      "bodyText": "Andy Robertson has said victory in the Club World Cup can propel Liverpool towards further honours in 2020 as they strive to add the Premier League title to their world and European crowns. Liverpool\u2019s 1-0 triumph in Qatar delivered a third trophy inside six months and ensured they have won every competition bar the Community Shield. The priority remains a first domestic championship since 1990 and while the unbeaten Premier League leaders have a 10-point lead over Leicester going into their visit to the King Power Stadium on Boxing Day, Robertson believes lifting a first world title in Liverpool\u2019s history can act as extra motivation in the new year. \u201cThat\u2019s three for 2019,\u201d the defender said. \u201cIn the calendar year we have won the Champions League, Super Cup and now this. To win three in any calendar year is special \u2013 and these are big ones. \u201cThe Champions League is absolutely massive. The Super Cup and the Club World Cup are massive to us. We are really excited about it but we have got to take the momentum into 2020. Hopefully there are a couple more of these scenes of us lifting trophies above our head to come. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible feeling to win it and it makes this week worthwhile. We took it seriously even though maybe people back in England didn\u2019t. The whole of South America was behind Flamengo. You could see how many fans came over and made a fantastic atmosphere for them. In England, they wanted us to prioritise the Carabao Cup but you don\u2019t get many chances to be world champions. We took ours and rightly so.\u201d Liverpool were dismayed that, after the trophy presentation, Fifa officials prevented J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his players from going on to the running track at the Khalifa International Stadium to celebrate in front of their fans. But nothing could detract from the achievement of winning the club\u2019s first world title at the fourth attempt. Alisson, a decisive influence against Flamengo as well as in the semi-final victory over Monterrey, has been enraptured by the Club World Cup since his boyhood team Internacional defeated Barcelona in 2006. That sensation was surpassed by lifting the trophy in Doha and, as the Brazil player described it, writing a new chapter in Liverpool\u2019s illustrious history. The goalkeeper said: \u201cAs a supporter you feel you are inside, you are involved, you are there suffering together with the team. It was a good emotion I had with my friends and my family [in 2006] \u2026 I love that club but being on the pitch, playing, helping the team, is really fantastic. It\u2019s even more special that it is the first time Liverpool has achieved this title. We put, again, our names in the history of this big club. \u201cAs a team, we are making special things. The boss keeps us together and we try to make the difference not just on the pitch but off the pitch with the supporters. Every time we say, \u2018We are Liverpool, this means more,\u2019 maybe it makes no sense for those who are not Liverpool supporters but we really try to make this special for everybody. Not just for us players, but also the supporters who are all around the world following us. \u201cWe need to give the best on the pitch. They have already the history but we are making history again. \u201cFootball is like this. Thursday we have another big match and this is the beauty of football. You always have the new opportunity of new things. We try to make history again because we have a big goal and that is the Premier League and to try to defend the Champions League title.\u201d Fifa awarded Mohamed Salah the Golden Ball for the player of the tournament, while the match-winner, Roberto Firmino, was named man of the match against Flamengo. Jordan Henderson had legitimate claims to both individual prizes too, having deputised for Virgil van Dijk in central defence for the first time in his career against Monterrey before producing an outstanding performance in the final. Robertson said: \u201cWe have got big names in our squad but Hendo shows what Liverpool is about. He does it in every single performance he puts in. He showed it when he played centre-back. He cruised it! He was magnificent against Flamengo, the best player on the park. \u201cHendo is underappreciated to some but, to us in the dressing room, we appreciate everything he does. That is the most important thing. In England maybe they don\u2019t give him the credit he deserves. That will soon change.\u201d Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will have a scan on Monday to discover the extent of the ankle ligament damage he sustained against Flamengo. The midfielder, who has been unfortunate with injury during his Liverpool career, rolled an ankle in a second-half challenge with \u00c9verton Ribeiro and was on crutches when the squad departed for home on Sunday. Liverpool\u2019s medical staff treated the injury during the flight but, with Klopp expressing concern the ligament could be ruptured, Oxlade-Chamberlain requires a scan.",

The building blocks would be enough this time. Even if the end product was sorely lacking they duly ran, battled, showed for the ball and did most of the basics that have seemed inconvenient to many of their more senior colleagues.</p> <p>They were enthused to learn afterwards they had done much of what Arteta is seeking, although at least one of their teammates could have given them fair warning of those criteria. \u201cFor sure,\u201d Calum Chambers said when asked whether it was clear, during the two seasons he played alongside Arteta at Arsenal, the midfielder would become a manager. \u201cWhen I came here he was one of the senior players; he helped me and gave me advice on positional play. He was a very intelligent player \u2013 you could always tell he had that side to him. I\u2019m excited; everyone\u2019s excited to work with him and learn his philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>Chambers had just put in one of his best performances of the season at centre-back and been named the man of the match, even if he will have tougher afternoons. He was 19 when he joined Arsenal from Southampton and, within two months, would make his England debut. Since then he has plateaued, with loans to Middlesbrough and Fulham punctuating a bit-part presence at his parent club, and at 24 it is time to discover exactly where his ceiling lies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67de7b96cb83d4f4964395626845410dfcb0ac34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67de7b96cb83d4f4964395626845410dfcb0ac34/0_99_2976_1786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti (right) watched Everton\u2019s draw with Arsenal from the stands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti (right) watched Everton\u2019s draw with Arsenal from the stands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Offside via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is what Arteta will have to judge and there are several other examples of players in Arsenal\u2019s squad who occupy that grey area between potential and fully known quantity. Lucas Torreira and Rob Holding are others, while refining the more frustrating tendencies of the younger Matteo Guendouzi will surely be a high priority. It is not necessarily anyone\u2019s fault when footballers fall short of early expectations; but they were usually signed for a reason, and Arteta inherits a number of individuals who are not too far gone to reset.</p> <p>Perhaps that is one reason why the word \u201cexcited\u201d arose several times in Chambers\u2019s short conversation. \u201cHe was proud of the way we worked and how we worked hard,\u201d he said of Arteta\u2019s reaction; banality on the pitch had quickly translated into buoyancy off it.</p> <p>Ancelotti has a similar task but his focus may be different. He is a proven cajoler of top-level players and one of the niggles over his suitability for the role is that Everton have few of those but Gylfi Sigurdsson comes close when operating at the peak of his powers. The Icelander is out of form, even if a first-half free-kick was one of Everton\u2019s better efforts, and not usually the most effusive speaker but there was a sparkle in his eyes when the prospect of learning under the three-times Champions League winner was raised.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted,\u201d Sigurdsson said. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously a fantastic manager with a lot of experience and a lot of success, so he definitely knows what he\u2019s doing. He knows what he\u2019s talking about, so I think the boys will have a lot of respect. We just can\u2019t wait to start working with him.\u201d</p> <p>At 30, Sigurdsson may start running out of chances to reassume his billing as one of the league\u2019s better attacking midfielders. At that stage of a career it is easy to stop learning but Ancelotti\u2019s name is the kind that makes senior professionals sit up straight. It is fair to think he may have a similar effect on players such as Lucas Digne and Richarlison, who are Sigurdsson\u2019s junior but two of the more compelling talents from whom the manager will seek to extract a consistent tune.</p> <p>Perhaps it was Duncan Ferguson who best summed up the feeling in both groups. Ferguson\u2019s moment in the spotlight is over for now but his enthusiasm pulsated around Goodison\u2019s arteries long after the end. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to start learning again on Monday,\u201d Ferguson said of assisting Ancelotti. \u201cWe\u2019re in awe of him really. We\u2019ll go on Monday and we\u2019ll go with everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d For Everton and Arsenal, a brand new education awaits.</p>",

Everton and Arsenal had created no more than three goalscoring chances between them but anyone who stopped to reflect was keener to dwell on the possibilities that lie ahead. Behind those doors both sets of players had just been addressed by their managers: the first time Carlo Ancelotti and Mikel Arteta had debriefed their charges on a matchday. The consequence was a collective spring in the step, a bubbliness out of keeping with what had passed and a sense of optimism that this time, under managers who set huge stock in making individuals better, things may just be different. \u201cBe brave, take responsibility and work hard for each other\u201d had been the essence of Arteta\u2019s message to Arsenal, six of whose starting XI were aged 23 or under. The building blocks would be enough this time. Even if the end product was sorely lacking they duly ran, battled, showed for the ball and did most of the basics that have seemed inconvenient to many of their more senior colleagues. They were enthused to learn afterwards they had done much of what Arteta is seeking, although at least one of their teammates could have given them fair warning of those criteria. \u201cFor sure,\u201d Calum Chambers said when asked whether it was clear, during the two seasons he played alongside Arteta at Arsenal, the midfielder would become a manager. \u201cWhen I came here he was one of the senior players; he helped me and gave me advice on positional play. He was a very intelligent player \u2013 you could always tell he had that side to him. I\u2019m excited; everyone\u2019s excited to work with him and learn his philosophy.\u201d Chambers had just put in one of his best performances of the season at centre-back and been named the man of the match, even if he will have tougher afternoons. He was 19 when he joined Arsenal from Southampton and, within two months, would make his England debut. Since then he has plateaued, with loans to Middlesbrough and Fulham punctuating a bit-part presence at his parent club, and at 24 it is time to discover exactly where his ceiling lies. This is what Arteta will have to judge and there are several other examples of players in Arsenal\u2019s squad who occupy that grey area between potential and fully known quantity. Lucas Torreira and Rob Holding are others, while refining the more frustrating tendencies of the younger Matteo Guendouzi will surely be a high priority. It is not necessarily anyone\u2019s fault when footballers fall short of early expectations; but they were usually signed for a reason, and Arteta inherits a number of individuals who are not too far gone to reset. Perhaps that is one reason why the word \u201cexcited\u201d arose several times in Chambers\u2019s short conversation. \u201cHe was proud of the way we worked and how we worked hard,\u201d he said of Arteta\u2019s reaction; banality on the pitch had quickly translated into buoyancy off it. Ancelotti has a similar task but his focus may be different. He is a proven cajoler of top-level players and one of the niggles over his suitability for the role is that Everton have few of those but Gylfi Sigurdsson comes close when operating at the peak of his powers. The Icelander is out of form, even if a first-half free-kick was one of Everton\u2019s better efforts, and not usually the most effusive speaker but there was a sparkle in his eyes when the prospect of learning under the three-times Champions League winner was raised. \u201cI\u2019m delighted,\u201d Sigurdsson said. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously a fantastic manager with a lot of experience and a lot of success, so he definitely knows what he\u2019s doing. He knows what he\u2019s talking about, so I think the boys will have a lot of respect. We just can\u2019t wait to start working with him.\u201d At 30, Sigurdsson may start running out of chances to reassume his billing as one of the league\u2019s better attacking midfielders. At that stage of a career it is easy to stop learning but Ancelotti\u2019s name is the kind that makes senior professionals sit up straight. It is fair to think he may have a similar effect on players such as Lucas Digne and Richarlison, who are Sigurdsson\u2019s junior but two of the more compelling talents from whom the manager will seek to extract a consistent tune. Perhaps it was Duncan Ferguson who best summed up the feeling in both groups. Ferguson\u2019s moment in the spotlight is over for now but his enthusiasm pulsated around Goodison\u2019s arteries long after the end. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to start learning again on Monday,\u201d Ferguson said of assisting Ancelotti. \u201cWe\u2019re in awe of him really. We\u2019ll go on Monday and we\u2019ll go with everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d For Everton and Arsenal, a brand new education awaits.",

      "body": "<p>Christmas is for kids, really, we all know that. But this version of A Christmas Carol, my friends, is for you. Three parts, BBC One, an hour long each, adults only. Not because there\u2019s any sex (although there is a bit of swearing), but because it\u2019s simply \u2026 so grownup.</p> <p>We open on the eve of Christmas Eve, London 1843, as all good festive adaptations should. Our first sight is of the late Jacob Marley (Stephen Graham) being roused from his not-as-eternal-as-he-thought sleep. A boy is weeing on the \u201cskinflint old bastard\u2019s\u201d grave, and the drops are seeping through the coffin and splashing on Marley\u2019s face. God rest ye, tweeness, whimsy. Your day is done.</p> <p>This is a take on Dickens\u2019 tale that looks into the darkness of the season, the unhappy hearts thrown into relief by jollity, and asks who deserves their share of joy. It incorporates a trip to purgatory for Marley, via a blacksmith who shows him the links in the chains he has forged before he binds him \u2013 each one made from the soul of a man, woman or child who died as a result of his and his business partner Ebenezer Scrooge\u2019s actions. Marley wanders through purgatory and meets a figure stoking a bonfire. \u201cI burn memories and old affections,\u201d he says. \u201cI am the Ghost of Christmas Past, here to smoke out redemption.\u201d He tells Marley that his and Scrooge\u2019s fates are tied \u2013 one cannot be saved without the other \u2013 because \u201cit was with him that you profaned the soul of humanity\u201d. Marley will be returned to the world above to pave the way. \u201cBy the time this Christmas is ash,\u201d says the ghost, \u201cI must search the heart of Ebenezer Scrooge and find if there is a tender place there.\u201d</p> <p>Above ground, things continue in the same unblinking mood. Bustling, urchin-crammed exteriors are replaced by deserted Georgian streets, Victoriana-stuffed interiors with high-ceilinged rooms that are clutter-free and comfortless, and poverty-stricken ciphers with real people struggling to do their best in a world full of problems not of their own making. Tweeness and whimsy have made way for psychological realism. The result is A Christmas Carol for our times, and for many times to come.</p> <p>Bob Cratchit is neither a cowed underling nor a diehard optimist; he is a man who can only push back so far against his boss if he wishes to keep his sorely needed job, and justly furious about it.</p> <p>And what a boss he has. Guy Pearce is Scrooge, as tall, lean, elegant and austere as the townhouse to which he retires once another day of extracting work from others, tallying grievances and wrestling with ghosts (for now metaphorical only) is done.</p> <p>His anti-Christmas sentiment is not a miserabilist pose nor an annual crystallisation of a naturally grumpy disposition but an outcropping of an entire philosophy. He gazes out at the street full of smiling passersby and says, almost to himself: \u201cIt makes me sad to see all the lies \u2026 how many \u2018Merry Christmasses\u2019 are meant? Why pretend on one day of the year that the human beast is not the human beast?\u201d It would make more sense, he suggests, to do things the other way round and have one day of acknowledging all our worst impulses. They could call it Scroogeday, says Cratchit, and his desiccated employer is drily amused. He even lets Cratchit use his ink, as Bob\u2019s own has frozen. \u201cSort of Christmas present, is it?\u201d asks Cratchit. \u201cIf it were,\u201d Scrooge replies, channelling the Ghost of Alan Rickman\u2019s Sheriff of Nottingham Yet to Come, \u201cI would have wrapped it in paper and ribbons in order to artificially increase your anticipation.\u201d The entire script is as luxuriant as the visuals are bleak.</p> <p>There are hints that Scrooge nurses guilt and sorrow. He is assaulted by visions of what seem to be workers in cages, but his nephew \u2013 on a final, futile visit to invite him for Christmas lunch \u2013 tells him he comes anyway because his late mother, Ebenezer\u2019s sister, assured him that he must forgive his uncle: \u201cHe is just in pain. A very old pain.\u201d</p> <p>Towards the end of the first episode, it is clear that there are deaths on Marley and Scrooge\u2019s conscience, from a fire in one of their factories \u2013 the resonances with Grenfell surely deliberate \u2013 but in their other outposts, too, across the globe, all caused by their relentless attempts to keep costs down and profits up. \u201cWe vandalised the world for this,\u201d says Marley, gesturing at Scrooge\u2019s towering house, having found his way from purgatory. The system, says this rich, clever, funny and courageous adaptation, implicates us all. It\u2019s not the kind we\u2019re used to, but it\u2019s as fine a distillation of the wider Christmas message \u2013 and the wider concerns that animated Dickens in his weightier tales \u2013 as you could hope to see.</p>",

It incorporates a trip to purgatory for Marley, via a blacksmith who shows him the links in the chains he has forged before he binds him \u2013 each one made from the soul of a man, woman or child who died as a result of his and his business partner Ebenezer Scrooge\u2019s actions. Marley wanders through purgatory and meets a figure stoking a bonfire. \u201cI burn memories and old affections,\u201d he says. \u201cI am the Ghost of Christmas Past, here to smoke out redemption.\u201d He tells Marley that his and Scrooge\u2019s fates are tied \u2013 one cannot be saved without the other \u2013 because \u201cit was with him that you profaned the soul of humanity\u201d. Marley will be returned to the world above to pave the way. \u201cBy the time this Christmas is ash,\u201d says the ghost, \u201cI must search the heart of Ebenezer Scrooge and find if there is a tender place there.\u201d Above ground, things continue in the same unblinking mood. Bustling, urchin-crammed exteriors are replaced by deserted Georgian streets, Victoriana-stuffed interiors with high-ceilinged rooms that are clutter-free and comfortless, and poverty-stricken ciphers with real people struggling to do their best in a world full of problems not of their own making. Tweeness and whimsy have made way for psychological realism. The result is A Christmas Carol for our times, and for many times to come. Bob Cratchit is neither a cowed underling nor a diehard optimist; he is a man who can only push back so far against his boss if he wishes to keep his sorely needed job, and justly furious about it. And what a boss he has. Guy Pearce is Scrooge, as tall, lean, elegant and austere as the townhouse to which he retires once another day of extracting work from others, tallying grievances and wrestling with ghosts (for now metaphorical only) is done. His anti-Christmas sentiment is not a miserabilist pose nor an annual crystallisation of a naturally grumpy disposition but an outcropping of an entire philosophy. He gazes out at the street full of smiling passersby and says, almost to himself: \u201cIt makes me sad to see all the lies \u2026 how many \u2018Merry Christmasses\u2019 are meant? Why pretend on one day of the year that the human beast is not the human beast?\u201d It would make more sense, he suggests, to do things the other way round and have one day of acknowledging all our worst impulses. They could call it Scroogeday, says Cratchit, and his desiccated employer is drily amused. He even lets Cratchit use his ink, as Bob\u2019s own has frozen. \u201cSort of Christmas present, is it?\u201d asks Cratchit. \u201cIf it were,\u201d Scrooge replies, channelling the Ghost of Alan Rickman\u2019s Sheriff of Nottingham Yet to Come, \u201cI would have wrapped it in paper and ribbons in order to artificially increase your anticipation.\u201d The entire script is as luxuriant as the visuals are bleak. There are hints that Scrooge nurses guilt and sorrow. He is assaulted by visions of what seem to be workers in cages, but his nephew \u2013 on a final, futile visit to invite him for Christmas lunch \u2013 tells him he comes anyway because his late mother, Ebenezer\u2019s sister, assured him that he must forgive his uncle: \u201cHe is just in pain. A very old pain.\u201d Towards the end of the first episode, it is clear that there are deaths on Marley and Scrooge\u2019s conscience, from a fire in one of their factories \u2013 the resonances with Grenfell surely deliberate \u2013 but in their other outposts, too, across the globe, all caused by their relentless attempts to keep costs down and profits up. \u201cWe vandalised the world for this,\u201d says Marley, gesturing at Scrooge\u2019s towering house, having found his way from purgatory. The system, says this rich, clever, funny and courageous adaptation, implicates us all. It\u2019s not the kind we\u2019re used to, but it\u2019s as fine a distillation of the wider Christmas message \u2013 and the wider concerns that animated Dickens in his weightier tales \u2013 as you could hope to see.",

      "bodyText": "\u2022 Last year, the Guardian reported on a plan to transfer Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy in London to Ecuador\u2019s embassy in Moscow by making Assange a member of the Ecuadorian embassy staff, first in London and then in Russia. Giving Assange diplomatic status would have allowed him to leave the Ecuadorian embassy, where he was a fugitive from UK justice. Assange, Ecuador and Russia were all parties to the plan, which was abandoned after the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office refused to recognise Assange as a member of the embassy staff. Our report should have avoided the words \u201csmuggle\u201d and \u201cplot\u201d since they implied that diplomatic immunity in itself was illicit. The Guardian\u2019s Review Panel has issued a ruling on this article, available online at gu.com/narvaez-decision (Revealed: Russia\u2019s Christmas Eve plot to smuggle Assange out of UK, 22 September 2018, page 3).",

      "bodyText": "Tottenham have vowed to take the \u201cstrongest possible action\u201d after their 2-0 defeat by Chelsea was overshadowed by the game having to be paused when Antonio R\u00fcdiger was targeted with racist abuse by a section of the crowd. Anthony Taylor, the referee, stopped play during the second half when an object was thrown at Kepa Arrizabalaga, Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper, and R\u00fcdiger told him he had suffered racist taunts. The German centre-back appeared to indicate a supporter had shouted a monkey chant at him and an announcement over the PA system at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium told the crowd that \u201cracist behaviour is interfering with the game\u201d. C\u00e9sar Azipilicueta, the Chelsea captain, also brought the incident to Taylor\u2019s attention, which took place moments after the Spurs forward Son Heung-min had been sent off following a clash with R\u00fcdiger. Taylor asked for the announcement to be broadcast to the crowd and, though it was repeated twice, it is understood that only one allegation of racism was made. Uefa\u2019s three\u2011step protocol says a game can be abandoned if fans have been warned twice before. Spurs may not be charged by the Football Association over the racism, as it has no jurisdiction over individual fans, but are likely to be asked for observations over missiles thrown from the stands. The club said: \u201cWe are now conducting a thorough investigation which will include liaising with Chelsea and their players for their observations. Any form of racism is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our stadium. We take any such allegations extremely seriously and shall take the strongest possible action against any individual found to be behaving in such a way, including stadium bans.\u201d Racism has blighted English football over the past 12 months.

We have to blame ourselves for both goals. In the second half we were much better, but then we lose a player and to have one player less against a team that has very, very good technical players is difficult. </p> <p>\u201cI hope that Rudiger recovers quickly from the broken ribs, because for sure he will have a few broken ribs, and that was a crucial moment of the game. For me, that red card is a strange one, but I don\u2019t want to focus on that because my team lost and I have to be complimentary to the opponent and congratulate them.</p> <p>\u201cThey started better than us. They used a system where some of their players are very, very comfortable \u2013 Kane, Azpi, Alonso, Willian. That\u2019s why I tried to change at half-time. They played very well, but the reality of the game is that we conceded from a short corner \u2013 our players were not concentrating \u2013 and a penalty.</p> <p>\u201cAgainst Everton, Son was crying because of what happened to Andre Gomes. Now he is crying because he broke a few of Antonio Rudiger\u2019s ribs.</p> <p>\u201cI saw the referee follow the protocol [regarding racism], and of course our club will deal with it because every club is together on this situation. We are disappointed but the protocols were followed.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dffba168f085eda5c10c7ef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T18:47:04.879Z\">6.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2><strong>Post-match interviews</strong></h2> <p><strong>Cesar Azpilicueta</strong></p> <p>\u201cAmazing.

We fought and then we played some very good football. We kept a clean sheet as well, and we are very happy about that.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been told to report any racist abuse to the referee. Tony told me there had been some racist songs towards him, so I told the referee straight away and left it to him to do his job. We are very concerned and very aware of this behaviour, and all together we need to stop it. It\u2019s an issue in life, not only football.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Willian</strong></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy with the two goals but the most important thing is to win the game. We did a brilliant job today. We know how difficult it is to play against Tottenham, but the team was perfect mentally.

Tottenham Hotspur v Chelsea was already one of the Premier League\u2019s spicier fixtures \u2013 and then Spurs added a few Carolina Reaper peppers to the recipe by appointing Jose Mourinho as their manager.

Jose\u2019s Spurs against Chelsea - Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea at that - is on another level. </p> <p>All things being equal, these teams will spend the rest of the season battling each other for the lucrative Fourth Place Trophy. When Mourinho took over on 20 November, Spurs were in 14th place, 12 points behind Chelsea. If they win today, they will go above them. Neutrals are advised to have the popcorn to hand for the next few hours. </p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 4.30pm</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T15:26:13.981Z\">at 3.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Some player ratings Here\u2019s Dave Hytner\u2019s match report from Stamford Bridge Here\u2019s Jose Mourinho \u201cFirst half they were the best team. We have to blame ourselves for both goals. In the second half we were much better, but then we lose a player and to have one player less against a team that has very, very good technical players is difficult. \u201cI hope that Rudiger recovers quickly from the broken ribs, because for sure he will have a few broken ribs, and that was a crucial moment of the game. For me, that red card is a strange one, but I don\u2019t want to focus on that because my team lost and I have to be complimentary to the opponent and congratulate them. \u201cThey started better than us. They used a system where some of their players are very, very comfortable \u2013 Kane, Azpi, Alonso, Willian. That\u2019s why I tried to change at half-time. They played very well, but the reality of the game is that we conceded from a short corner \u2013 our players were not concentrating \u2013 and a penalty. \u201cAgainst Everton, Son was crying because of what happened to Andre Gomes. Now he is crying because he broke a few of Antonio Rudiger\u2019s ribs. \u201cI saw the referee follow the protocol [regarding racism], and of course our club will deal with it because every club is together on this situation. We are disappointed but the protocols were followed.\u201d Post-match interviews Cesar Azpilicueta \u201cAmazing. It feels very good for us, for the fans, to come here and win after the run we have had. We prepared very well in the week, and we knew we had to rediscover our fighting spirit. We fought and then we played some very good football. We kept a clean sheet as well, and we are very happy about that. \u201cWe have been told to report any racist abuse to the referee. Tony told me there had been some racist songs towards him, so I told the referee straight away and left it to him to do his job. We are very concerned and very aware of this behaviour, and all together we need to stop it. It\u2019s an issue in life, not only football.\u201d Willian \u201cI\u2019m happy with the two goals but the most important thing is to win the game. We did a brilliant job today. We know how difficult it is to play against Tottenham, but the team was perfect mentally. Now we have to stay at that level \u2013 we can\u2019t go up and down, up and down.\u201d Here\u2019s more on the racist abuse of Antonio Rudiger \u201cHi Rob, just wanted to point out that to Mike Mackenzie that picking Baresi as someone who would have got multiple VAR red cards is a terrible choice,\u201d says Giovanni Pisoni. \u201cI\u2019m no AC Milan fan, but you just can\u2019t touch Franco: he was the ultimate elegant, clean defender. I\u2019d say you\u2019ve barely seen him in action.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s a very fair point. Claudio Gentile, on the other hand, would regularly have been sent off in the warm-up. Frank Lampard is celebrating wildly in front of the Chelsea fans. He deserves every last clench of the fist, because his young team played with so much maturity and class. It was a hammering. Peep peep! Chelsea move six points ahead of Spurs after a quite outstanding performance. It was an unmitigated triumph for Frank Lampard, whose 3-4-2-1 formation worked even better than it had in his imagination. Willian scored both goals, and Chelsea were in control long before Son was sent off for a petulant kick at Rudiger. Alas, the story of the game will be the racist abuse towards Rudiger that occurred soon after. 90+7 min A half-chance for Kane, whose shot has the sting taken out of it by the lunging Tomori before being comfortably saved by Kepa. 90+5 min \u201cI suspect that had VAR been used back in the day in Serie A, then Franco Baresi would have set a record for red cards,\u201d says Mike MacKenzie. \u201cAnd other famous Italian CBs wouldn\u2019t have been far behind.\u201d There would surely have been at least one great VAR-fixing scandal as well. 90+3 min Willian plays a stunning pass into space for Batshuayi, who moves to the edge of the area, comes back omto his left foot and smashes a shot just wide. Willian, one of Jose Mourinho\u2019s favourite players, has had an absolute stormer. 90+2 min Spurs again appeal for a penalty because of manhandling at a corner, this time by Alonso on Alli. I\u2019m not sure why that wasn\u2019t checked by VAR, as Alonso could have had few legitimate complaints had a penalty been given. 90+1 min There will be eight minutes of added time because of all the VAR and racism stoppages. 90 min \u201cWould an abandonment actually be a bad thing?\u201d says David Wall. \u201cPerhaps that is what it is going to take to finally make some of these idiots get the message.\u201d No, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing at all. But I do wonder where it all leads, because a lot of racists won\u2019t get the message regardless. 89 min Willian surges down the left and crosses deep to James, who takes the ball down on his chest and hits an acrobatic shot that is blocked superbly by Alderweireld. 88 min Eriksen\u2019s free-kick is headed behind by Batshauyi. Chelsea break devastatingly from the Spurs corner, with Willian flicking a pass over the top to find the marauding Kante. He comes back onto his left foot and is about to shoot when Eriksen makes a vital interception. 87 min: No penalty 86 min Zouma is penalised for a trip on Dele Alli, this far outside the area. VAR are checking for a penalty, but I doubt this will be overturned. 85 min The racism will overshadow an immense performance from Chelsea, who came into the match in dreadful form. Frank Lampard switched to a back three and it worked like a dream. The key was the performance of the two attacking midfielders, Willian and Mason Mount. 84 min Here\u2019s a short report from the news wires on the racist abuse of Anonio Rudiger: There was a stadium announcement after 75 minutes saying that \u201cracist behaviour among spectators is interfering with the game\u201d. Stills from Sky Sports of Rudiger appeared to suggest he was claiming a fan made a monkey gesture towards him. 83 min The match is petering out. It\u2019s been a miserable day for Spurs, and for humanity. We\u2019re not far away from a Premier League match being abandoned because of racism. 82 min I\u2019ve just remembered that Son is my Fantasy League captain. Well done, Bobby! 81 min \u201cSon can have no complaints really,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cWith the possible exception of being stuck, during his peak years, with a manager who just wants to watch the world burn.\u201d 80 min Michy Batshuayi replaces Tammy Abraham, who has run himself into the ground. While that is happening, replays show Rudiger signalling to his captain Cesar Azpilicueta that there had been monkey chants towards him. Azpilicueta then comes off to be replaced by Reece James. 79 min \u201cVAR 25 years ago would have been an absolute treat,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cRoger Milford constantly rewinding a cassette with footage of Duncan Ferguson throttling Steffen Freund to see if it constitutes a telling off.\u201d Imagine breaking the news to the Butcher of Bilbao that a man with a state-of-the-art Betamax had deemed his tackling to be somewhat overzealous. 78 min Rudiger is booked for taking out Sanchez. 77 min Aurier appeals for a penalty after being held by Kante at a corner. He had a case, though VAR decided it wasn\u2019t a clear and obvious one. 75 min \u201cHow long before ad breaks during VAR checks...?\u201d asks Richard Coopey. Lordy, I hadn\u2019t thought of that. It\u2019ll happen one day; of course it will. 74 min Spurs make a double change, with Tanguy Ndombele and Danny Rose replacing Jan Vertonghen and Lucas Moura. 73 min \u201cIf that had been a push with the arm with the same force, it\u2019s never a red,\u201d says Gareth Rogers. Agreed. But you don\u2019t have studs on your hands, do you. 72 min Apparently that earlier break in play was caused not by a cup of water being thrown at Kepa, but because of a racist remark towards Anthony Rudiger after Son was sent off. For heaven\u2019s sake. For heaven\u2019s effing fucking sake. 71 min Chelsea are content to pass the clock down, hence the introduction of Jorginho. They have done an emphatic number on Spurs today. In fact this has probably been their best performance under Frank Lampard. 70 min \u201cSomewhere,\u201d says Niall Mullen, \u201cMark van Bommel is having a little chuckle to himself.\u201d 69 min \u201cYeah probably,\u201d says Phil Podolsky of the great Porto/Chelsea debate that has captivated twos of people (see 59 min). \u201cBut then Porto didn\u2019t have to deal with a Barcelona featuring peak Ronaldinho, Deco and Eto\u2019o.\u201d Or a Liverpool featuring Traore, Biscan, Baros and Nunez. 68 min Jorginho replaces the excellent Mateo Kovacic, who has become a serious player for Chelsea in the last few months. 66 min Alderweireld is booked for something or other. Spurs are experiencing a collective loss of noggin. 65 min There\u2019s a break in play, I think because something has been thrown from the crowd. Yes, something was thrown at Kepa. He then appealed to the home fans for sanity, at which point a small boy looked him up and down and called him a \u201cwanker\u201d. 62 min Son cannot believe what has happened, but the laws of the game are pretty clear and that is classified as \u2018violent conduct\u2019. Rudiger made a meal of it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been a yellow card 25 years ago, but Son did push his studs upwards into Rudiger\u2019s chest as he fell over. That\u2019s Son\u2019s third red card of the year, I think. 62 min After a long VAR check, Son is given a red card. 61 min I think Son is going to be sent off. 60 min Rudiger fouls Son, who pushes his studs upwards into Rudiger\u2019s chest as he falls over. The contact was pretty soft, but he might be sent off here. 60 min Chelsea\u2019s two attacking midfielders, Mount and Willian, have been fantastic today. 59 min \u201cSpeaking of Mourinho\u2019s Porto, that won the Champions League, and Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea, that didn\u2019t, I still think the former was a marginally better team overall simply because they had a higher average technical quality,\u201d says Phil Podolsky. \u201cTidier in transitions, that kind of thing. Granted, Drogba (especially after they bought Shevchenko), Essien (before his knees went) and Robben (on the very few occasions he actually played) were amazing.\u201d I agree about the technical quality, mainly because of Deco, but overall I would take his Chelsea team. They would have walked the 2003-04 Champions League. 58 min Sissoko is booked for a lunge at Willian. 55 min: Disallowed goal for Chelsea! Eriksen\u2019s long-range shot is kicked away by Tomori and Chelsea break dangerously. Eventually Alonso\u2019s shot is spilled by the unsighted Gazzaniga and put in by the offside Abraham. Replays confirm the original offside decision was correct. 53 min The mood of the match has changed slightly, with Spurs pushing Chelsea back for the first time in the game. Kane threatens to wriggle free in the area before Kante makes an important block tackle. 52 min Replays show that Abraham was just offside when he had that chance a couple of minutes ago, so it would have been VARed had he scored. 51 min \u201cDid Spurs have turkey &amp; Xmas pud for lunch?\u201d says Mike Nagle. \u201cOr was it another lasagne? Chelsea are so much sharper!\u201d Indeed. Given the importance of the game and the amount of energetic players they have, Spurs have been almost bizarrely lethargic. 50 min That was almost 3-0 to Chelsea. Mount played a fine through pass to Abraham, who shaped to shoot on the turn but then tried to play a reverse square pass back to Mount. It was crucially intercepted by Alderweireld. If Abraham had his time again I\u2019m sure he\u2019d shoot. 47 min It looks like Spurs have switched to a back three, with Lucas Moura and Aurier as wing-backs in a 3-4-1-2 system. 46 min Peep peep! Spurs begin the second half. Spurs have made a half-time change, with Christian Eriksen replaces Paulo Gazzan Eric Dier. \u201cHow is Gazzaniga still on the pitch for that?\u201d asks Ruth Purdue. I\u2019m not sure it was a red-card offence, as it was more bizarre than dangerous. Had he hit Alonso studs-first I\u2019m sure he would have gone. \u201cLampard\u2019s Chelsea offering Mourinho\u2019s Spurs a textbook example of how to do things in a Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea style,\u201d says Stephen Carr. More like Mourinho\u2019s Derby for me, or was it Lampard\u2019s Porto? Peep peep! Chelsea have been brilliant - faster, slicker, smarter, braver - and fully deserve their two-goal lead. Willian scored both, although the second will be remembered for a preposterous piece of goalkeeping from Paulo Gazzaniga. It was a good penalty, placed confidently into the bottom-right corner. Gazzaniga went the wrong way. Willian scores! 45+3 min Quite right too. It was an absurd error from Gazzaniga. Alonso almost certainly wasn\u2019t going to get to the ball, either, so he could have let it bounce out of play. Could have used his hands as well. 45+2 min It should be a penalty, for mine. 45+2 min What the hell has just happened? Gazzaniga runs out, misses the ball completely with a flying kick and clatters into Alonso. But Anthony Taylor gives a foul to Spurs. This will be checked for a penalty. 44 min Actually, there wasn\u2019t much to it. Alli overran the ball and took an impromptu piggyback on Kovacic. They both fell over, at which point Kovacic, not unreasonably, asked Alli what the eff he was doing. Then they squared up and shoved each other, and that was about it. The 1974 Charity Shield it wasn\u2019t. 43 min Alli and Kovacic squared up to each other off the ball. I\u2019m not exactly sure what happened, because the camera followed the ball, but both have been booked. 43 min: It\u2019s all kicking off! 40 min An overzealous Sissoko charges into Arrizabalaga a split-second after the ball has gone. It was dumb rather than dangerous, and there is no yellow card. 39 min A long period of pressure for Chelsea comes to an end when Abraham overhits a cross. 35 min A quiet period in the game. Chelsea aren\u2019t as dominant as they were for the first 25 minutes. 31 min Zouma is booked for stopping Kane from taking a quick free-kick. It\u2019s starting to get a bit niggly. 29 min Spurs are starting to create opportunities. Kane runs down the right and curls an excellent low cross that bounces up towards Son beyond the far post. He has to take the shot first time, from a tight angle, and launches it into orbit with his left foot. 28 min A chance for Spurs. It came out of nothing, when Sissoko sudently charged into the area on the right. He cut the ball back towards Kane, whose snapshot from 10 yards went high over the bar. He probably should have done better. 26 min I\u2019m surprised Jose Mourinho hasn\u2019t made a tactical change, even at this early stage, because his team are getting battered. 25 min More superb play from Chelsea. Mount takes a return pass from Willian on the left edge of the area, zips smoothly between two defenders but then slices his shot across the penalty area. He was falling as he took the shot, which is why he sliced it so badly. 24 min A dangerous Chelsea counter-attack. Abraham floats a lovely angled pass over the defence for Mount, who takes it down on the chest and is about to shoot when Sanchez comes across to make a vital interception. 23 min \u201cAurier,\u201d says Matt Loten. \u201cQuite simply, Rob, he\u2019s naff. It\u2019s quite remarkable that the man who brought us Paulo Ferreira is willing to put up with his complete lack of defensive nous, but I suppose he doesn\u2019t have much choice. Surely the first head on the chopping block when Jose prises the chequebook from Levy\u2019s cold, dead hands.\u201d Yep, agreed. 22 min The corner is headed away by Harry Kane, a welcome touch of the ball for him. 21 min Spurs are getting battered. Willian wins another corner for Chelsea, whose 3-4-2-1 system has thus far worked perfectly. 20 min Alonso\u2019s cross finds the backpedalling Abraham, who can\u2019t steer his header on target. He was off balance as he made contact, which made it a much harder chance. That\u2019s Chelsea\u2019s fifth attempt on goal to Spurs\u2019 none. 19 min Dier goes down after a robust, slightly high block tackle from Mount, who is probably fortunate not to get a yellow card. 16 min Spurs look half asleep, it\u2019s most peculiar. 14 min Serge Aurier, discuss. He gave away a needless corner in the first place as well. Willian took a short corner to Kovacic, who returned the ball to him on the left wing. Willian zipped infield, evaded a half-arsed challenge from Aurier and smacked an emphatic curling shot that flew through the crowd and into the far corner. Chelsea take a deserved lead with a cracking goal! 12 min Spurs have been noticeably passive, defending very deep and allowing Chelsea to dictate the game. And now they\u2019ve paid for it! 10 min Rudiger drives over the bar from 30 yards. The fact he was in that position in open play, however, is a reflection of Chelsea\u2019s dominance. 9 min \u201cIs this a record,\u201d says Ian Sargeant, \u201cfor the number of syllables for a pair if goalkeepers in a top-flight game?\u201d What, Kepa? Yep, all week I\u2019m afraid. And most of next year an\u2019 all. 8 min Chelsea have started really well. Kante\u2019s first-time cross finds Abraham, whose header deflects behind for a corner. I\u2019m not sure it was on target anyway but the build-up was excellent. 6 min Mount forces a pass into Abraham, whose shot on the turn goes well wide. He was under a lot of pressure from Alderweireld. 4 min It\u2019s been a cagey start to the game, with lots of Chelsea possession in deeper areas. 2 min \u201cNow that the \u2018Official Undisputed Greatest Club In The Whole World Trophy\u2019 has been won, it barely seems worth continuing with the Premier League,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cAll seems a bit academic. If we must continue, though, I just hope Jos\u00e9 lets the \u2018humility\u2019 mask slip and does something really, really Jos\u00e9. The man is a genius, and I love having him in the league. Just nowhere near my club.\u201d 1 min Peep peep! Chelsea, in blue, kick off from left to right. Spurs are in white. The players are ready, and there\u2019s a cracking atmosphere at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Before the match, there\u2019s a minute\u2019s applause for the late Martin Peters. Watford have beaten Manchester United 2-0 in the early game. A generous assessment of United\u2019s performance - it\u2019s the season of goodwill, after all - is that they were a risible shambles. But Watford were great, and have a puncher\u2019s chance of staying up. Pre-match reading Spurs are unchanged from last weekend\u2019s stirring win at Wolves. It looks like Chelsea have switched to a back three. Spurs (4-2-3-1) Gazzaniga; Aurier, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Vertonghen; Sissoko, Dier; Lucas Moura, Alli, Son; Kane. Substitutes: Vorm, Rose, Foyth, Winks, Lo Celso, Eriksen, Ndombele. Chelsea (3-4-2-1) Arrizabalaga; Zouma, Rudiger, Tomori; Azpilicueta, Kante, Kovacic, Alonso; Willian, Mount; Abraham. Substitutes: Caballero, Christiansen, James, Pulisic, Jorginho, Hudson-Odoi, Batshuayi. Referee Anthony Taylor. Hello. Tottenham Hotspur v Chelsea was already one of the Premier League\u2019s spicier fixtures \u2013 and then Spurs added a few Carolina Reaper peppers to the recipe by appointing Jose Mourinho as their manager. Jose against Chelsea is always a big game. Jose\u2019s Spurs against Chelsea - Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea at that - is on another level. All things being equal, these teams will spend the rest of the season battling each other for the lucrative Fourth Place Trophy. When Mourinho took over on 20 November, Spurs were in 14th place, 12 points behind Chelsea. If they win today, they will go above them. Neutrals are advised to have the popcorn to hand for the next few hours. Kick off is at 4.30pm",

Do you think that the current view on the climate crisis has become too affiliated with the left/right spectrum of politics? </strong><em>Gideon Bickler, 16, Auckland</em></p> <p>A. I don\u2019t think most people view their lives in terms of the left/right political divide \u2013 and I hope we don\u2019t see climate change that way either. I think most New Zealanders just want to see us take action on the issues that matter most to them, including environmental issues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/22/housing-inequality-climate-what-the-guardians-new-zealand-readers-asked-jacinda-ardern\">Housing, inequality, climate: what the Guardian's New Zealand readers asked Jacinda Ardern</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently our new Zero Carbon Act passed through parliament unopposed. In other words, every political party has sent a clear message to New Zealanders that no matter who is in government we are all committed to significant domestic greenhouse gas emissions reductions.</p> <p>The Zero Carbon Act was conceived of by a movement of young people as a way to depoliticise climate change policy so that we can actually start to make some progress. That\u2019s exactly what we have done.</p> <p><strong>Q. May I know what will be your immigration policy going forward now that New Zealand will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/new-zealand-at-5-million\">meet the 5 million population mark</a> soon? Will your policy be more welcoming to international students like me who might opt to stay on to contribute to your country and will you formulate an attractive policy to lure in more international students whose parents may or will have spent millions to support their children\u2019s education in New Zealand (this is also a way to boost your country\u2019s GDP)? </strong><em>Ballerina Chong, 19, Wellington</em></p> <p>A. We have a range of different things our immigration policies are designed to achieve. We want to ensure that:</p> <ul> <li><p>New Zealand businesses can get the workers they need where skill shortages exist</p></li> <li><p>Our immigration settings respond to regional differences</p></li> <li><p>Migrants are not exploited</p></li> <li><p>New Zealand meets its international and humanitarian commitments</p></li> </ul> <p>If students have the skills we need they will be able to work here. But we also want to make sure that the courses provided for international students are quality courses that will give them good skills for their future careers wherever they may go.</p> <p><strong>Q. Will NZ change its name to Aotearoa when the Queen dies? </strong><em>John Irving, 77</em></p> <p>A. Te Reo is an official language of this country so Aotearoa is one of the names we are lucky to have already.</p> <p><strong>Q. When is your government going to make the transformational change to child poverty that you promised?</strong> <em>Douglas, 75, Porirua</em></p> <p>A. We have committed to reducing child poverty by at least half within 10 years. The Child Poverty Reduction Act requires the government to set targets and report on child poverty every year. This is huge as it creates a framework for ongoing action and accountability by this and all future governments.</p> <p>Achieving our targets will mean our child poverty rates are amongst the lowest in the world. Every step we take to get closer to our targets represents a tangible improvement in the day-to-day lives and future opportunities of those families and children who are no longer in poverty.</p> <p>Our first two budgets have included actions to significantly reduce child poverty and material hardship. The most significant of these was our $5.5bn families package, which increased the family tax credit and accommodation supplement, and introduced the best start and winter energy payments. In Budget 2020, we indexed benefits to wages, and increased the amount that beneficiaries can earn before their benefit reduces. These changes are expected to lift between 42,000 and 73,000 children out of poverty.</p> <p>We have also taken action to ease the financial pressures felt by low-income families, by reducing health, education and other costs. The impact of many of these investments isn\u2019t captured in current child poverty reporting the release of new Statistics NZ data in early 2020 will be the first indication of the progress we\u2019re making in reducing child poverty.</p> <p><strong>Q. How will Labour address the persistent wealth gap in Aotearoa/New Zealand and allow our children to aspire to own their own homes? </strong><em>Rachael Findlay, 57, Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Wellington</em></p> <p>A. This government views the economy as a means to an end, not as an end in itself. A strong, healthy economy is vital to New Zealand but only is as much as it means we can share the benefits more widely among all New Zealanders and their families.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/30/new-zealand-wellbeing-budget-jacinda-ardern-unveils-billions-to-care-for-most-vulnerable\">Our Wellbeing Budget</a> was a big step towards making this a reality. When we came into office budgets measured the wealth and success of New Zealand on just the narrow metric of economic growth \u2013 GDP.</p> <p>We have fundamentally changed the way budgets are put together and how they are delivered. The result is budgets now reflect what New Zealanders value including how many children have been lifted out of poverty, how much cleaner our environment is and how we are future proofing the economy.</p> <p>Innovations such as this will help narrow the wealth gap that exists in New Zealand and, accordingly, will put home ownership within reach of more people.</p> <p>Major investments will continue to be made in health, education, housing and social programmes to address New Zealand\u2019s long-term challenges. And we have also created more jobs and raised wages, made it cheaper to pay the bill (via the winter energy payment), made it cheaper to visit the doctor and to send kids to school. We have also banned foreign speculators from purchasing property in New Zealand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4229b6d2aada1b0811fda24e12e1ec89c2d446c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4229b6d2aada1b0811fda24e12e1ec89c2d446c/0_88_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homeless people beg for money in the Auckland CBD.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homeless people beg for money in the Auckland CBD.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Walter/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Q. What are you doing/will you do to ensure free, independent journalism in New Zealand? Sincerely, a recently graduated, jobless journalist.</strong> <em>Gordana Rodden, 23, Wellington</em></p> <p>A. As we all know, the media industry has changed hugely in recent years as traditional advertising revenues are increasingly diverted to online social media platforms. This has created a real issue for an industry that is now struggling to make the money to pay journalists.</p> <p>Free, independent journalism is a core part of any democracy and something we must guard jealously. In New Zealand, the government funds Radio New Zealand and TVNZ in order to ensure it continues. But even then, there are funding problems and the organisations are hampered in what they can do with limited resources.</p> <p>This is why broadcasting minister, Kris Faafoi, is currently looking for potential alternatives to ensure the ongoing strength of independent local journalism. He is hoping to announce some more details soon.</p> <p><strong>Q. How can we stop the \u201cculture wars\u201d growing in NZ? Guns, abortion, water, climate change and the planned referendums have the potential to split NZ just like Brexit has split the UK.</strong> <em>Ian Andrews, 55, Wairarapa</em></p> <p>A. I agree no one wants to see division, but I do think New Zealanders have shown they can live happily side by side while holding strong and varying views. Yes these can be emotional decisions but I trust that New Zealanders will have the debates while remaining respectful of one another and of differing views. In fact I think that\u2019s one of the things that sets us apart.</p> <p><strong>Q. Do you think that NZ could take an even stronger lead on accepting refugees to Australasia (including possible climate refugees from the South Pacific nations), particularly in light of Australia\u2019s continual refusal to take a fair quota? </strong><em>Nigel Dowdeswell, 57, Hamilton</em></p> <p>A. We have made a significant increase in our refugee quota this term and we are working hard to ensure that we are ready for that increase. New Zealand\u2019s refugee programme includes:</p> <ul> <li><p>a high quality refugee resettlement programme that is internationally acclaimed and provides up to a year of support once in the community</p></li> <li><p>increased the refugee quota up to 1,500 each year, which will be in place by 2020 and a significant amount of work is underway to support this</p></li> <li><p>we have announced new regional settlement plans for six new regions</p></li> <li><p>we are making improvements to the Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre to support our refugees for their 6 week induction programme</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Q. What practical plans does Arden and her government have to resolve the housing issues experienced by many New Zealanders - whether it be overpriced, poor unsuitable rentals, the lack of real social housing options, the price of ownership being un-affordable for many New Zealanders, or the lack of temporary beds for those in acute need? </strong><em>Jamie Lynch 34, Wellington</em></p> <p>A. After significant neglect in housing, we\u2019re starting to make progress on several fronts. So far we have stopped the previous government\u2019s sell-off of state houses, and have added over 3,600 additional houses to the stock. There are currently 2,400 state houses under construction and 13,000 in the pipeline in total. We know we have an ever-growing waiting list, but it is possible to meet that demand. If the National government had built state houses at the pace of our targeted 1,600 per year we\u2019d have an additional 14,400 state houses \u2013 that\u2019s the entire waiting list gone.</p> <p>In terms of homelessness, we\u2019re rolling out Housing First across New Zealand, and as at the end of October there were over 1,000 individuals and families engaged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/new-zealand-housing-crisis-just-47-affordable-homes-built-in-six-months\">New Zealand housing crisis: just 47 'affordable' homes built in six months</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I recognise that KiwiBuild homes will be out of reach for some families which is why we\u2019re building state houses and making life better for renters by banning letting fees, and modernising rental laws.</p> <p>We\u2019ve recently put $400m into progressive home ownership which will both lower deposits and mortgage repayments. We expect this will help thousands of families to buy their own homes.</p> <p>We\u2019ve also made changes to the First Home Scheme, lowering the deposit required for a government-backed mortgage to 5%, and allowing family and friends to combine their $10,000 First Home Grant to buy their first home together. These changes will make a significant difference in helping families who have been locked out of the housing market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4fd6b35591fc954fd6fcdc335d3c611bb5839645\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd6b35591fc954fd6fcdc335d3c611bb5839645/0_217_3955_2373/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A housing development in Auckland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A housing development in Auckland.

How are you going to safeguard democratic freedoms in New Zealand in terms of overseas and internal lobby group interests funding election campaigns? </strong><em>Jennifer Ashby, 52, Dunedin</em></p> <p>A. We\u2019ve already taken action to protect New Zealand from foreign interference in our elections by banning foreign donations to political parties and candidates.</p> <p>The Electoral Amendment Bill (No 2), which passed in early December, bans foreign donations over $50. This will reduce the risk of foreign money influencing our election outcomes.</p> <p>The bill also extends the requirement to include name and address details on election advertisements to apply to election advertisements in all mediums. This means that if someone wants to advertise online they need to say who they are, the same as if it was published in a newspaper.</p> <p>The minister of justice has also signalled a wider review of the Electoral Act after the 2020 general election.</p> <p><strong>Q. While China funds and influences New Zealand and Australian politics, burgles and intimidates a critical academic, and keeps a million people in gulags, your government continues to snuggle up to the panda. I fully concede that the opposition would cheerfully do more than snuggle. Isn\u2019t there a more principled path you could take?</strong> <em>Paul Kiely, 39, Wellington</em></p> <p>A. Forgive me for pushing back on you there Paul! Although we have a solid and growing relationship, New Zealand and China are very different countries. There is a significant asymmetry in size, we have fundamentally different political systems and values, and on some issues we have quite different approaches.</p> <p>It is only natural that there are areas where we do not see eye-to-eye and when that occurs, we raise it. For example, New Zealand regularly discusses human right issues with China, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/show-no-mercy-leaked-documents-reveal-details-of-chinas-mass-xinjiang-detentions\">including the situation in Xinjiang.</a></p> <p>New Zealand closely follows human rights issues in our region, and we share international concerns regarding the treatment of Uighurs. This is why I raised New Zealand\u2019s concerns about the situation in Xinjiang with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang during my visit to China in April. I also raised concerns with Premier Li during our meeting in Bangkok in November this year.</p> <p>New Zealand also joined a statement alongside 22 other countries expressing our concerns. The statement was delivered at a United Nations general assembly meeting in New York, and in in July, we signed a letter alongside 24 other countries, addressed to the president of the Human Rights Council and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p> <p>We will continue to raise our concerns directly with China and use these opportunities to explain the importance that New Zealand attaches to human rights standards. New Zealand also takes any allegations of foreign interference in New Zealand seriously. Some media speculation has focused on China, but we do not single out any specific actor.</p> <p>The important thing is that we have flexible and adequate protections. We have robust measures in place to protect our values, institutions and economy.</p> <p><strong>Q. What is one thing you want to accomplish in your second term if you get re-elected in 2020? </strong><em>Justin Lindsay</em></p> <p>A. We haven\u2019t set our policy agenda for the next election yet but the plan is to continue to build on the work we have done in the first term to deliver a better New Zealand for more people.</p> <p>But as finance minister, Grant Robertson, said when releasing the budget policy statement foreshadowing the direction of travel for the government, we will continue our focus on tackling the long-term challenges facing New Zealand while also investing to future proof the economy.</p> <p>The Budget 2020 priorities \u2013 which would carry work over into the next term - are:</p> <ul> <li><p>Just Transition:Supporting New Zealanders in the transition to a climate-resilient, sustainable, and low-emissions economy</p></li> <li><p>Future of Work: Enabling all New Zealanders to benefit from new technologies and lift productivity through innovation</p></li> <li><p>M\u0101ori and Pacific: Lifting M\u0101ori and Pacific incomes, skills, and opportunities</p></li> <li><p>Child Wellbeing: Reducing child poverty and improving child wellbeing</p></li> <li><p>Physical and Mental Wellbeing: Supporting improved health outcomes for all New Zealanders</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Q. Young women are so commonly treated with such disdain and in blatant forms of sexism amongst male school peers and teachers too. How will you battle New Zealand\u2019s misogynistic culture that\u2019s so very rampant in our schools?</strong> <em>William B, 49, Auckland</em></p> <p>A. Rebel against it! We have to do what we can to call out bad behaviour, but also to have plenty of role models too. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been told our schools are any worse than anywhere else, but there\u2019s almost always more to do to make sure our young women are treated fairly.</p> <p><strong>Q. Why is New Zealand risking 1080 invading our food chain?</strong> <em>Kris Davies, Otago, 33</em></p> <p>A. We\u2019re using all the tools we\u2019ve got in the box to restore the dawn chorus and save Aotearoa\u2019s precious kiwi, k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d, and whio from the predator crisis. 1080 is the best tool for large scale predator control and it dissolves quickly in the environment into harmless substances. We do want alternatives, but until we find them it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got to combat predators.</p> <p><strong>Q. What\u2019s the best way to batter snapper, and how long do you deep fry it?</strong><em><strong> </strong>Ian, 52, Tuakau</em></p> <p>A. What a controversial question Ian! Pan fried is best for delicious fresh snapper (in my opinion) but if you like a wee coating, I\u2019m a big fan of a bit of panko crumb (dip in flour, then egg, then panko). Either way, when you come to cook it, use a rice bran oil (it takes higher temperatures well) and a dollop of butter. Go well!</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Simon Bridges, the leader of the opposition, was invited to answer readers\u2019 questions but declined.</em></p></li> </ul>",

The Zero Carbon Act was conceived of by a movement of young people as a way to depoliticise climate change policy so that we can actually start to make some progress. That\u2019s exactly what we have done. Q. May I know what will be your immigration policy going forward now that New Zealand will meet the 5 million population mark soon? Will your policy be more welcoming to international students like me who might opt to stay on to contribute to your country and will you formulate an attractive policy to lure in more international students whose parents may or will have spent millions to support their children\u2019s education in New Zealand (this is also a way to boost your country\u2019s GDP)? Ballerina Chong, 19, Wellington A. We have a range of different things our immigration policies are designed to achieve. We want to ensure that: New Zealand businesses can get the workers they need where skill shortages exist Our immigration settings respond to regional differences Migrants are not exploited New Zealand meets its international and humanitarian commitments If students have the skills we need they will be able to work here. But we also want to make sure that the courses provided for international students are quality courses that will give them good skills for their future careers wherever they may go. Q. Will NZ change its name to Aotearoa when the Queen dies? John Irving, 77 A. Te Reo is an official language of this country so Aotearoa is one of the names we are lucky to have already. Q. When is your government going to make the transformational change to child poverty that you promised? Douglas, 75, Porirua A. We have committed to reducing child poverty by at least half within 10 years. The Child Poverty Reduction Act requires the government to set targets and report on child poverty every year. This is huge as it creates a framework for ongoing action and accountability by this and all future governments. Achieving our targets will mean our child poverty rates are amongst the lowest in the world. Every step we take to get closer to our targets represents a tangible improvement in the day-to-day lives and future opportunities of those families and children who are no longer in poverty. Our first two budgets have included actions to significantly reduce child poverty and material hardship. The most significant of these was our $5.5bn families package, which increased the family tax credit and accommodation supplement, and introduced the best start and winter energy payments. In Budget 2020, we indexed benefits to wages, and increased the amount that beneficiaries can earn before their benefit reduces. These changes are expected to lift between 42,000 and 73,000 children out of poverty. We have also taken action to ease the financial pressures felt by low-income families, by reducing health, education and other costs. The impact of many of these investments isn\u2019t captured in current child poverty reporting the release of new Statistics NZ data in early 2020 will be the first indication of the progress we\u2019re making in reducing child poverty. Q. How will Labour address the persistent wealth gap in Aotearoa/New Zealand and allow our children to aspire to own their own homes? Rachael Findlay, 57, Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Wellington A. This government views the economy as a means to an end, not as an end in itself. A strong, healthy economy is vital to New Zealand but only is as much as it means we can share the benefits more widely among all New Zealanders and their families. Our Wellbeing Budget was a big step towards making this a reality. When we came into office budgets measured the wealth and success of New Zealand on just the narrow metric of economic growth \u2013 GDP. We have fundamentally changed the way budgets are put together and how they are delivered. The result is budgets now reflect what New Zealanders value including how many children have been lifted out of poverty, how much cleaner our environment is and how we are future proofing the economy. Innovations such as this will help narrow the wealth gap that exists in New Zealand and, accordingly, will put home ownership within reach of more people. Major investments will continue to be made in health, education, housing and social programmes to address New Zealand\u2019s long-term challenges. And we have also created more jobs and raised wages, made it cheaper to pay the bill (via the winter energy payment), made it cheaper to visit the doctor and to send kids to school. We have also banned foreign speculators from purchasing property in New Zealand. Q. What are you doing/will you do to ensure free, independent journalism in New Zealand? Sincerely, a recently graduated, jobless journalist. Gordana Rodden, 23, Wellington A. As we all know, the media industry has changed hugely in recent years as traditional advertising revenues are increasingly diverted to online social media platforms. This has created a real issue for an industry that is now struggling to make the money to pay journalists. Free, independent journalism is a core part of any democracy and something we must guard jealously. In New Zealand, the government funds Radio New Zealand and TVNZ in order to ensure it continues. But even then, there are funding problems and the organisations are hampered in what they can do with limited resources. This is why broadcasting minister, Kris Faafoi, is currently looking for potential alternatives to ensure the ongoing strength of independent local journalism. He is hoping to announce some more details soon. Q. How can we stop the \u201cculture wars\u201d growing in NZ? Guns, abortion, water, climate change and the planned referendums have the potential to split NZ just like Brexit has split the UK. Ian Andrews, 55, Wairarapa A. I agree no one wants to see division, but I do think New Zealanders have shown they can live happily side by side while holding strong and varying views. Yes these can be emotional decisions but I trust that New Zealanders will have the debates while remaining respectful of one another and of differing views. In fact I think that\u2019s one of the things that sets us apart. Q. Do you think that NZ could take an even stronger lead on accepting refugees to Australasia (including possible climate refugees from the South Pacific nations), particularly in light of Australia\u2019s continual refusal to take a fair quota? Nigel Dowdeswell, 57, Hamilton A. We have made a significant increase in our refugee quota this term and we are working hard to ensure that we are ready for that increase. New Zealand\u2019s refugee programme includes: a high quality refugee resettlement programme that is internationally acclaimed and provides up to a year of support once in the community increased the refugee quota up to 1,500 each year, which will be in place by 2020 and a significant amount of work is underway to support this we have announced new regional settlement plans for six new regions we are making improvements to the Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre to support our refugees for their 6 week induction programme Q. What practical plans does Arden and her government have to resolve the housing issues experienced by many New Zealanders - whether it be overpriced, poor unsuitable rentals, the lack of real social housing options, the price of ownership being un-affordable for many New Zealanders, or the lack of temporary beds for those in acute need? Jamie Lynch 34, Wellington A. After significant neglect in housing, we\u2019re starting to make progress on several fronts. So far we have stopped the previous government\u2019s sell-off of state houses, and have added over 3,600 additional houses to the stock. There are currently 2,400 state houses under construction and 13,000 in the pipeline in total. We know we have an ever-growing waiting list, but it is possible to meet that demand. If the National government had built state houses at the pace of our targeted 1,600 per year we\u2019d have an additional 14,400 state houses \u2013 that\u2019s the entire waiting list gone. In terms of homelessness, we\u2019re rolling out Housing First across New Zealand, and as at the end of October there were over 1,000 individuals and families engaged. I recognise that KiwiBuild homes will be out of reach for some families which is why we\u2019re building state houses and making life better for renters by banning letting fees, and modernising rental laws. We\u2019ve recently put $400m into progressive home ownership which will both lower deposits and mortgage repayments. We expect this will help thousands of families to buy their own homes. We\u2019ve also made changes to the First Home Scheme, lowering the deposit required for a government-backed mortgage to 5%, and allowing family and friends to combine their $10,000 First Home Grant to buy their first home together. These changes will make a significant difference in helping families who have been locked out of the housing market. Q. How are you going to safeguard democratic freedoms in New Zealand in terms of overseas and internal lobby group interests funding election campaigns? Jennifer Ashby, 52, Dunedin A. We\u2019ve already taken action to protect New Zealand from foreign interference in our elections by banning foreign donations to political parties and candidates. The Electoral Amendment Bill (No 2), which passed in early December, bans foreign donations over $50. This will reduce the risk of foreign money influencing our election outcomes. The bill also extends the requirement to include name and address details on election advertisements to apply to election advertisements in all mediums. This means that if someone wants to advertise online they need to say who they are, the same as if it was published in a newspaper. The minister of justice has also signalled a wider review of the Electoral Act after the 2020 general election. Q. While China funds and influences New Zealand and Australian politics, burgles and intimidates a critical academic, and keeps a million people in gulags, your government continues to snuggle up to the panda. I fully concede that the opposition would cheerfully do more than snuggle. Isn\u2019t there a more principled path you could take? Paul Kiely, 39, Wellington A. Forgive me for pushing back on you there Paul! Although we have a solid and growing relationship, New Zealand and China are very different countries. There is a significant asymmetry in size, we have fundamentally different political systems and values, and on some issues we have quite different approaches. It is only natural that there are areas where we do not see eye-to-eye and when that occurs, we raise it. For example, New Zealand regularly discusses human right issues with China, including the situation in Xinjiang. New Zealand closely follows human rights issues in our region, and we share international concerns regarding the treatment of Uighurs. This is why I raised New Zealand\u2019s concerns about the situation in Xinjiang with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang during my visit to China in April. I also raised concerns with Premier Li during our meeting in Bangkok in November this year. New Zealand also joined a statement alongside 22 other countries expressing our concerns. The statement was delivered at a United Nations general assembly meeting in New York, and in in July, we signed a letter alongside 24 other countries, addressed to the president of the Human Rights Council and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. We will continue to raise our concerns directly with China and use these opportunities to explain the importance that New Zealand attaches to human rights standards. New Zealand also takes any allegations of foreign interference in New Zealand seriously. Some media speculation has focused on China, but we do not single out any specific actor. The important thing is that we have flexible and adequate protections. We have robust measures in place to protect our values, institutions and economy. Q. What is one thing you want to accomplish in your second term if you get re-elected in 2020? Justin Lindsay A. We haven\u2019t set our policy agenda for the next election yet but the plan is to continue to build on the work we have done in the first term to deliver a better New Zealand for more people. But as finance minister, Grant Robertson, said when releasing the budget policy statement foreshadowing the direction of travel for the government, we will continue our focus on tackling the long-term challenges facing New Zealand while also investing to future proof the economy. The Budget 2020 priorities \u2013 which would carry work over into the next term - are: Just Transition:Supporting New Zealanders in the transition to a climate-resilient, sustainable, and low-emissions economy Future of Work: Enabling all New Zealanders to benefit from new technologies and lift productivity through innovation M\u0101ori and Pacific: Lifting M\u0101ori and Pacific incomes, skills, and opportunities Child Wellbeing: Reducing child poverty and improving child wellbeing Physical and Mental Wellbeing: Supporting improved health outcomes for all New Zealanders Q. Young women are so commonly treated with such disdain and in blatant forms of sexism amongst male school peers and teachers too. How will you battle New Zealand\u2019s misogynistic culture that\u2019s so very rampant in our schools? William B, 49, Auckland A. Rebel against it! We have to do what we can to call out bad behaviour, but also to have plenty of role models too. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been told our schools are any worse than anywhere else, but there\u2019s almost always more to do to make sure our young women are treated fairly. Q. Why is New Zealand risking 1080 invading our food chain? Kris Davies, Otago, 33 A. We\u2019re using all the tools we\u2019ve got in the box to restore the dawn chorus and save Aotearoa\u2019s precious kiwi, k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d, and whio from the predator crisis. 1080 is the best tool for large scale predator control and it dissolves quickly in the environment into harmless substances. We do want alternatives, but until we find them it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got to combat predators. Q. What\u2019s the best way to batter snapper, and how long do you deep fry it? Ian, 52, Tuakau A. What a controversial question Ian! Pan fried is best for delicious fresh snapper (in my opinion) but if you like a wee coating, I\u2019m a big fan of a bit of panko crumb (dip in flour, then egg, then panko). Either way, when you come to cook it, use a rice bran oil (it takes higher temperatures well) and a dollop of butter. Go well! Simon Bridges, the leader of the opposition, was invited to answer readers\u2019 questions but declined.",

      "bodyText": "Taylor Swift\u2019s continued dominance was once in doubt. The death knell for the traditional form of pop icon that she represented had been rung by critics. Yet she has ended 2019 back on top: her seventh album, Lover, is this year\u2019s only record to sell more than 1m copies. But if we take Swift at her word, the 2019 success she will most cherish is how she has turned obscure details about artistic ownership into mainstream concerns. In June, the music mogul Scooter Braun bought her former label, Big Machine, and with it the master recordings of her first six albums. Swift claimed that, despite concerted efforts, she was never given the opportunity to buy her masters outright. She has made ownership into a feminist issue. After stating that she would use her leverage to fight for musicians\u2019 rights, Swift has become a catalyst in the reckoning that faces record labels.

The succession process involves the opening of sealed letters in the court in Muscat identifying the sultan\u2019s choice of successor, if the court cannot agree among itself. The sultan, one of the mainstays of Middle East politics for the past four decades, returned a week ago from Belgium where his treatment for a reoccurrence of cancer of the colon he has suffered from for four years was cut short. He had been expected to stay until the end of January. A former British protectorate in the Arabian Peninsula, Oman has been ruled by Qaboos ever since a bloodless coup in 1970 enacted with the help of Britain.

Most reports said it will contain the same name and that it exists only in case the first envelope cannot be found or if the first letter needs authenticating. Under Qaboos, who was educated in Britain, Oman has maintained a largely neutral role and acted as a mediator in the region, notably between Iran and the US over the proposed nuclear deal eventually signed in 2015.

      "bodyText": "Spanish energy giant Iberdrola says it has decided to invest $500m in a wind and solar farm in South Australia as the first of a series of renewable power projects it hopes to develop in Australia. Iberdrola\u2019s head of renewables, Xabier Viteri, said that in the new year the company would also probably increase its target for renewable energy from the \u201cambitious\u201d target of 10GW by 2022. \u201cOur ambition is going to be a little bit higher,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Viteri seemed unworried by the hostility expressed towards renewables by some parts of the Morrison government. \u201cAll of us can work together and there\u2019s not going to be any problem.\u201d Viteri said Australia was an ideal place to invest because of its high power consumption and stable market. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where renewables are going to play a much more relevant position in the coming years, clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit far away from where I am now, that\u2019s the only problem.\u201d The project, the Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park, has been under development by the privately owned DP Energy. DP Energy\u2019s country manager for Australia, Catherine Way, said the project was now \u201cshovel ready\u201d. She said DP Energy would assist in building the plant but it would ultimately be owned and operated by Iberdrola. The plant is to be made up of a 210MW windfarm, designed to peak at the same time as demand at about 6pm to 7pm every day, plus photovoltaic solar to provide electricity during the day. It will feed directly into the South Australian power grid, but Way said direct sales to industrial customers were also possible. She said demand from business customers was based on both a desire to decarbonise their operations and economics. \u201cRenewable energy electrons are typically cheaper than electrons where you have to pay for the fuel,\u201d she said. Iberdrola\u2019s country manager for Australia, Fernando Santamaria, said construction would start next year and the plant should be complete by the second half of 2021. \u201cThe combination of those technologies, it\u2019s a trend we are seeing globally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wind profile matches very well the South Australian demand, and the solar provides the perfect complement. \u201cI think corporate, big customers, are becoming more and more interested in decarbonisation, getting cleaner sources of energy for their projects, for their consumption.\u201d He said future investments would likely be in the areas serviced by the National Electricity Market, which excludes Western Australia, especially the east coast.

      "bodyText": "How many Christmas beetles have you seen this year? The insects \u2013 a genus containing some 35 separate species \u2013 traditionally appear in summer. Many settlers saw the scarabs, shimmering in festive red and green, as embodying the European holiday tradition. \u201cSome forgotten chord is strumming,\u2019 explained the folk poet Clement R E Grainger back in 1932, \u2018when beetles start their humming/ for they speak of joy and gladness/perfect love and deepest woe.\u201d Today that humming\u2019s become much more difficult to hear. Those of us who remember the beetles from our childhood can\u2019t help but notice how rarely they appear now. Entomologist Chris Reid, a research scientist at the Australian Museum, says beetle populations have almost certainly declined. \u201cFrom my own experience, I have not seen Christmas beetles in numbers in the southern suburbs, where I live on the edge of Royal National [park], since about eight or nine years ago.\u201d But we lack hard data on their situation, in a country short of both professional and amateur entomologists. \u201cIf you contrast Australia with western Europe,\u201d Reid says, \u201cthere\u2019s no comparison with the number of people observing insects.\u201d Earlier this month, David Yeates, from the Australian National Insect Collection at the CSIRO, spoke about the widespread perception among experts that insects were in trouble as were the creatures that fed upon them. \u201cThe worry is,\u201d Yeates said, \u201cif insect populations are in decline, so are the populations of larger animals such as birds and lizards who rely on them as food. We know in alpine New South Wales, there\u2019s been a collapse in Bogong moth populations \u2013 a staple food source for iconic Mountain Pygmy possums in spring, and this decline is resulting in the possums starving. But for most species these detailed interconnections are unknown.\u201d Assessing populations poses a particular problem in an era of ecological collapse. In a recent article for New Scientist, Adam Vaughan notes the difficulty in keeping perspective on wildlife abundance. He cites an anecdote from the butterfly collector SG Castle Russell who, in 1892, reported such a proliferation of insects in England\u2019s New Forest that he could barely see ahead, with two sweeps of his net securing more than a hundred specimens. We don\u2019t see butterflies in swarms like that \u2013 and nor do we think that we should. Hence the phenomenon noted by oceanographer Loren McClenachan, in which historical photos taken in Key West since 1956 show generations of anglers posing proudly with ever-smaller catches. We adapt our expectations to the current reality, forgetting that not so long ago the natural world looked startlingly different. \u201c[The] big fish that used to be abundant \u2026 aren\u2019t anymore,\u201d says McClenachan, \u201cand that\u2019s happened really, really quickly.\u201d Many Australians don\u2019t realise that the land near modern Melbourne once resembled, as Tim Flannery puts it, \u201ca temperate Kakadu\u201d, in which a shockingly blue lake teemed with swans, ducks, brolgas, magpie-geese, Cape Barren geese and other migratory birds. Arriving in Sydney with the First Fleet, the surgeon Arthur Bowes Smyth wrote in wonderment of how \u201cthe singing of various birds among the trees, and the flight of the numerous parakeets, lorikeets, cockatoos and macaws, made all around appear like an enchantment\u201d. In Hobart in 1804 the clergyman Robert Knopwood complained about the whales that disturbed locals with their bellowing and so crowded the local rivers as to make navigation by boat difficult. Today, when Christmas beetles often appear in ones or twos, it\u2019s difficult to grasp Grainger\u2019s enthusiasm for their \u201chumming\u201d. But in November 1936, a local paper in Maryborough reported that the scarabs had \u201cmade their presence felt\u201d in the town, swarming in such numbers that \u201cthe noise of their whirring wings in confined spaces between buildings was like the sound of a far-off aeroplane\u201d. Nine years later, the Sydney Morning Herald explained that \u201cwhere these gregarious pests gather their whirring fills the air and branches are quickly denuded of leaves\u201d, before adding a sinister coda: \u201cpoison sprays and DDT are effective\u201d. Today, Reid blames the city sprawl for the lack of beetles, with, for example, the spread of western Sydney covering traditional habitat in the Cumberland Plain woodland with roads and new housing. Their larvae live in the soil, feeding on roots and rotten wood until they pupate and dig their way out with their strong forelegs.

I\u2019m always looking at what\u2019s on vegetation and I\u2019m not seeing very much.

Pollution was falling only in electricity \u2013 due to the rise of cheap clean energy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/29/the-new-electricity-boom-renewable-energy-makes-staggering-leap-but-can-it-last\">the now-filled renewable energy target</a>, which the government has chosen not to replace \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/29/not-something-to-celebrate-drought-and-flood-cause-drop-in-emissions\">floods and drought affecting agricultural output</a>. \u201cThere is a lack of policy across all sectors,\u201d Fuentes said.</p> <p>The significant changes that included the shift in how soil carbon emissions are modelled were first published in May. The large increase in the estimate of pollution for the years between 2008 and 2o13 smoothed what had previously been a noticeable rise in national emissions since the carbon price scheme was repealed in 2014.</p> <p>In the most recent data, for the June quarter this year, industrial emissions were adjusted for years over the past decade. <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/8d47dec2-cd70-4a67-a7ab-85d67f3d53be/files/nggi-quarterly-update-jun-2019.pdf\">The department said it reflected new information</a> from companies and revised energy consumption estimates back to 2014.</p> <p>Following this change the data shows that, rather than rising annually under the Coalition, emissions have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/29/not-something-to-celebrate-drought-and-flood-cause-drop-in-emissions\">dropped slightly for the past two years</a>.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s official greenhouse gas records have been adjusted such that emissions are now significantly higher than previously believed for the years when Labor was in power, and no longer rise each year since the Coalition repealed the carbon price. The revisions, made clear in data published during the recent UN climate conference in Madrid, have allowed Scott Morrison to start claiming that emissions are now lower than when the Coalition was elected in 2013 and in any year when Labor was last in government. That was not the case a year ago. As the graph below shows, changes to the data over the past year have increased emissions in the years of the Rudd and Gillard governments by between 3.5% and 6.7%. Emissions have been increased by smaller amounts or slightly reduced for the years since the Coalition regained power. Most of the large revisions are due to a change in how the amount of carbon dioxide released from or absorbed by soil in grazing land is estimated. Guardian Australia asked several experts in greenhouse accounting about the changes. Some said they were legitimate and an improvement, as they factored in the impact of the climate crisis on soil carbon levels. Others said the size of the changes, and the fact they significantly favoured the government\u2019s narrative as it was facing rising criticism for not doing more to tackle emissions, warranted further explanation. The total revisions in emissions from the land and forests, including soil carbon, across the years in the graph up to 2018 was 382.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide. For emissions from fossil fuel and other industries, 41.2m tonnes worth of adjustments were made. Labor\u2019s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said he was concerned the government was using poorly explained revisions to emissions data to attack Labor and as an excuse not to act on climate change, singling out the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor. \u201cThis minister has form,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI hope he\u2019s not continuing that form by politicising the reporting of emissions data.\u201d A spokesman for Taylor said the emissions estimates by the Department of the Environment and Energy were made in accordance with international treaty requirements and subject to independent expert review each year. The department said the latest inventory of data had been reviewed by the UN climate secretariat and a report was likely to be published next year. Some experts told Guardian Australia the changes in soil carbon accounting made sense, but it was disingenuous for the government to take credit for it. The increase in emissions from grazing land soil carbon under Labor was most likely a result of the millennium drought, which broke in 2010 but took another couple of years for the effects to be felt. Analysts said if the government took credit for soil carbon it would also have to take responsibility for the future increases in emissions from the land due to the current drought and bushfires. Hugh Saddler, an energy consultant and ANU honorary associate professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy, said he respected the departmental officials who worked on greenhouse accounts and did not doubt the validity of their work. But he said calculating emissions from the land was a complex and arcane process, and that it would be better if national emissions accounts focused on areas over which people had greater control: electricity generation, transport, big industry, fugitive emissions from resource extraction, agriculture and the waste sector. If emissions from what are known as land use, land-use change and forestry (LuluCF) are removed, Australia\u2019s emissions have risen about 30% since 1990 and are nearly 20% higher than in 2000, contrary to the impression given when the government claims it is meeting its targets under UN accounting rules. \u201cThese are the emissions we should be most focused on,\u201d Saddler said. Ursula Fuentes, a senior policy advisor with Climate Analytics, said emissions in most parts of the economy continued to increase. Pollution was falling only in electricity \u2013 due to the rise of cheap clean energy and the now-filled renewable energy target, which the government has chosen not to replace \u2013 and floods and drought affecting agricultural output. \u201cThere is a lack of policy across all sectors,\u201d Fuentes said. The significant changes that included the shift in how soil carbon emissions are modelled were first published in May. The large increase in the estimate of pollution for the years between 2008 and 2o13 smoothed what had previously been a noticeable rise in national emissions since the carbon price scheme was repealed in 2014. In the most recent data, for the June quarter this year, industrial emissions were adjusted for years over the past decade. The department said it reflected new information from companies and revised energy consumption estimates back to 2014. Following this change the data shows that, rather than rising annually under the Coalition, emissions have dropped slightly for the past two years. Combined, the two sets of changes have resulted in the emissions data now showing pollution was lower for each year under the Coalition than when Tony Abbott ousted Kevin Rudd in 2013. The latest data was released just before Taylor flew to Madrid for a UN climate conference where Australia faced criticism for its plan to use an accounting measure to meet its 2030 target under the Paris agreement, a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels. The report including the data suggested, for the first time, that the government was expected to meet that target, but only if it counted carryover credits for beating previous targets under the expiring Kyoto protocol. Dozens of countries at the meeting opposed the use of the carryover credits amid claims they had no legal basis and were at odds with the commitment made in Paris to increase climate action over time. Australia is the only country that has said it plans to use them. A decision on whether to ban them was pushed into next year. Matt Drum, from climate change advisory business Ndevr Environmental, said discussion of carryover credits often ignored they were just a short-term book-keeping measure that would make it harder to reach net zero emissions by 2050, the ultimate goal of the Paris agreement. \u201cOn the first of January 2030 our emissions will go straight back up because we have made no structural adjustment to our economy\u2019s actual emissions,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Fallon Sherrock has said she is overwhelmed by the \u201cincredible\u201d response to her historic victories at the PDC World Darts Championship, as Billie Jean King led a wave of congratulations from across the globe. Sherrock became the first woman to defeat a male darts player in the sport\u2019s best-known competition last week and repeated the feat by beating one of the world\u2019s top-ranked players on Saturday. The 25-year-old, who only took up the sport when she was 17 after ditching her career as a hairdresser, said she was struggling to grasp the wave of adulation coming her way. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t all sunk in yet,\u201d she told BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday. \u201cI haven\u2019t had time to process the first game let alone this game. Then the fact that all these people are tweeting me, especially Billie Jean King. Oh my god, I never thought someone like that would be contacting me or congratulating me or anything like that. \u201cI mean, this is me. I\u2019m just a normal person. This stuff doesn\u2019t happen to me, but it\u2019s incredible and I\u2019m loving it.\u201d King, the former world No 1 tennis player, posted her congratulations on Twitter along with the hashtag \u201c#Gamechanger\u201d. Television presenters Gabby Logan, Jacqui Oatley and Piers Morgan were also among those paying tribute to the Milton Keynes-born star. Sherrock\u2019s journey from professional hairdresser to darts history-maker is an incredible one. Viewed as a well-regarded player for a number of years, she has emerged as a stand-out player in 2019 and cemented her status at the PDC World Championships in the past week. She has spoken about receiving merciless abuse on social media when she suffered a kidney condition following childbirth in 2014, which sometimes caused her face to swell. Sherrock has also called for women to be given more opportunity to play against men, saying there was no reason why the male-dominated sport should remain so: \u201cUs women, we can beat these men. We just need more opportunities to prove ourselves.\u201d In her nerveless first-round victory over Ted Evetts, she became the first woman to beat a man in the competition, going on to stun Alexandra Palace a second time by defeating 11th-seed Mensur Suljovic to progress to the last 32 on Saturday. Sherrock, whose walk-on music for her history-making win was Katy Perry, said she hoped to go on and win the tournament: \u201cWhy not? The possibilities are endless now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Sachin Nakrani\u2019s match report from Vicarage Road. Which is where we came in. Insert \u2018bearing of gift gag\u2019 here. The stats are not happy reading for Manchester United. Troy Deeney speaks We\u2019ve been close for ages. The performances against Liverpool and Leicester were good...It\u2019s massive for us. And I am just happy the people here can go away and have a decent Christmas...you could see the lads celebrating that free-kick. We wanted a clean sheet, and the boys deserve it. Real pressure is watching my mum work three jobs for Christmas. These boys have been grafting for the three months I haven\u2019t been here. We don\u2019t take anything for granted, we have won just one game...the gaffer has been top drawer. And Watford have done it. They deserved to win just as United fully deserved to lose. David de Gea\u2019s error swung the game Watford\u2019s way, and then came the penalty but United had been poor up until that point and didn\u2019t get much better barring a couple of good moments from Paul Pogba. Watford, organised and full of effort were excellent. The signs are positive for Nigel Pearson so far; that decent show against Liverpool has been followed by a famous win. 90+3 min: A Cathcart handball means United have a free-kick to score a consolation goal. Mata sets the ball down, and drifts it wide to jeers. That sums it all up: a misfire. 90 min: Three minutes added, and Martial forces another Foster save when coming in off the flank to shoot. Where was this in the first half? Though would Foster have been beaten in any case? 89 min: Yet another Foster save! A Pogba pass, and a Rashford turn and shoot and the ball comes off Foster\u2019s legs. He\u2019s been brilliant against his old club. 88 min: Now Watford are prepared to sit deep, with Pogba\u2019s series of attempts to find a final pass falling on the stony ground of Cathcart and Kabasele. 87 min: Final Watford sub: off goes Sarr, the matchwinner, and here comes Success, as Iggy Pop once had it. Isaac Success, to be specific. 85 min: Another pearler of a pass from Pogba, and Greenwood has time to bring the ball down. The lob is on but, like Lingard in the first half, it goes over. A better chance, perhaps, and more surprising from a young player who usually seems nerveless. 84 min: Pogba tries a dinked pass and ends up creating a Watford counter. That comes to nothing and back come United but Martial runs into heavy traffic. 82 min: Foster makes another save, as Pogba tries to beat him from an acute angle. Pogba has looked full of danger since coming on, but not many of his teammates have been on his wavelength. 81 min: End-to-end stuff: Roberto Pereyra digs the ball out to Deulofeu after robbing Greenwood and Watford again break. Shaw, at the other end, actually produces a decent cross but nobody had bothered to chase it. Watford hack behind and from the corner, Maguire heads straight at Foster. 79 min: United continue to be listless. There is no sign of the surge they produced against Sheffield United when they scored three goals in quick succession. They have been dreadful. 77 min: Watford sub: Capoue goes off and on comes Roberto Pereyra. Mad Nige is going for this one; that is not the substitution of a manager trying to sit on a lead. 75 min: Pogba tries a shot from distance that had no right to go in, and didn\u2019t. Foster, as he has so far this afternoon, read it well. 73 min: Watford, to their immense credit, are not sitting back at all. Deulofeu is causing all sorts of problems and he forces some anxious defending before Deeney also has a shot blocked. This has been a fine performance from Nige\u2019s team. There is plenty of hope for them if they can play like this to the end of the season. 72 min: On comes Mata for McTominay for United. 71 min: The final United change looks likely to be Juan Mata, who is being readied. Meanwhile, Rashford chases down a great Pogba pass. Rashford is fouled so a free-kick from the left-hand side of the Watford box. He hits it straight at goal and Foster is ready for it and punches away with some power. 69 min: Watford sub and it looks like for like: Nathaniel Chalobah come on for Doucoure, who has been excellent in midfield but was on a yellow card. 68 min: Sarr finds more space, but this time he can\u2019t fashion a shot. United are utterly ragged at the back. 66 min: Martial has a shot blocked after Shaw goes on the overlap. Fred\u2019s resultant corner is cleared by Deeney. Greenwood\u2019s speculative shot goes wide. On the bench, Ole looks crestfallen. 65 min: Pogba looks determined to get involved, which looks a start. And the quality of his passing has already shown through. 64 min: Off to nobody\u2019s surprise, goes Lingard. And on comes Pogba. 63 min: OK, Pogba is coming on in just a moment...meanwhile, Sarr almost makes another chance but Maguire has to clear the danger. 62 min: Deulofeu goes on one of his runs and United scrabble to concede a corner. Watford are not retreating into their shell just yet. 61 min: Fred and McTominay have struggled today; perhaps Pogba might be able to find more space and better passes than they have but there is no sign as yet. 60 min: The pattern from now on is likely to be United pushing onwards and Watford sitting deep. That\u2019s if United are actually capable of stringing passes together. 59 min: United sub: On comes Greenwood for the peripheral Dan James. 58 min: Ben Foster makes his first save of the game, when McTominay fires one in and the former United player palms it away. 56 min: Mad Nigel Pearson could be on his first step to making one of his great escapes: he was there when West Brom escaped in 2004-05 having been bottom at Christmas and he did it with Leicester five years ago. 55 min: Manchester United have only themselves to blame. They were already playing poorly and then they started making stupid mistakes. Deeney smashes it home, De Gea goes the wrong way. Good lord above. 53 min: Watford penalty! Wan-Bissaka brings down Sarr; a clear penalty. VAR has no problem with it. Deeney will take it. 50 min: Watford lead for the first time at home since April but that isn\u2019t the first DDG error since then. He\u2019s not the player he was, and that was a total rick. He just seemed to lose concentration as the ball came into his hands. Inexplicable but not unexpected. Hughes\u2019 free-kick, and the ball bobbles to Sarr, whose shot is weak and it bounces off the post and right through the hands of David de Gea. A catastrophic error. 48 min: The United fans are still singing at least, but this game is not flush with atmosphere. Harry Maguire walloping a free-kick straight out of play says much about the quality on show. 47 min: The opening two minutes as sleepy as the first half. This does not bode well. The second half is back underway. How soon until Paul Pogba plays a part? Ole likes a late sub. It looked more like Mason Greenwood was the player United needed from this point of view. There were no shots on target in that first half. See, I told you it wasn\u2019t great. Watford ought to be happy with that half, though could be in the lead if they had more quality up front. As for United, that performance was what we came to expect from them until they won that Spurs/City double-header: aimless and largely clueless. 45 min: Late scare for United as Lindelof is hurried by some Deeney force into clearing behind. It looked a corner but a goal-kick was given. 44 min: This has been very scrappy. On the bench, Pogba and Matic are continuing their talking shop. It can\u2019t be the match they are talking about; there is not much to be said. 42 min: Lingard had chance to make problems for Watford after some loose play from Deulofeu, but instead just walloped the ball into the middle. That was panicked stuff; he looks bereft of confidence. 40 min: Close for Watford, as Doucoure almost directs a header from a drifting cross but it goes just wide. De Gea was scrabbling somewhat. 38 min: Deeney wins a free-kick after he alpha males into Lindelof. Then Luke Shaw picks up a booking for a foul on Sarr. A free-kick on the edge of the United box and some big targets to aim for but it\u2019s Maguire who gets up highest. The captain then clears up the danger when Watford try again to force the issue. 36 min: Capoue is booked for manhandling Lingard after he has to chase down a misdirected pass in midfield. 34 min: Best chance of the game. Lingard through, all alone, after Martial\u2019s beaut of a pass, and he tries to lob Ben Foster rather than place or power. It drifts over and is a terrible waste. He has until Boxing Day to make sure he hasn\u2019t gone a year without scoring and that was the finish of someone devoid of confidence. 32 min: Martial is adjudged to be offside, which seems to happen rather too often. 31 min: Will Hughes has grown a beard, which when he grimaces in pain, as he did just now, gives him something of the look of Wilfred Brambell. 30 min: Watford\u2019s lack of goals is being explained by some rather hasty attacking when they get in front of goal, and a lack of creativity. Mind you, United are hardly inspired at the same time. 28 min: United have a corner. Fred\u2019s outswinger is cleared and then United conceded a foul in midfield. This is not great from them, not great at all. 27 min: Watford attack now, and are able to do so on the counter. Deulofeu\u2019s surge means the ball breaks to Deeney but his shot is blocked by Harry Maguire, 26 min: United play a glacially slow passing move and Watford are happy to sit bal and soak up the pressure. This has followed the pattern that is so obvious, they are only good when on the counter. 24 min: Not much of the attacking telepathy we saw from United against City and Spurs. Their front trio are operating as satellites of each other today. 22 min: Luke Shaw makes a burst to the byline, beyond Watford\u2019s defence, pings a ball in but there is nobody there. Jesse Lingard, so lacking in goals and assists these days, was rather rocking on his heels rather than chasing the ball down. 20 min: Watford have been decent so far, United in the lethargic mode that so angers so many of their fans. Watford have been strong in the tackle with Dan James on the end of some heavy stuff in particular. 18 min: The ball ends up in the Watford net, but there will be no goal. David de Gea was fouled, and rather less heavily than last week when Everton\u2019s goal was allowed to stand. That the Watford players did not dispute that decision suggests they didn\u2019t thing Calvert-Lewin\u2019s goal should have stood, either. 16 min: Rashford tries a shot that ends up looking like a cross and Ben Foster claims with ease. 15 min: In the dugout, there\u2019s sight of Pogba and Matic, deep in discussion, presumably about their next destination in January. 14 min: Watford\u2019s Sarr is down, having been the victim of an inadvertent eye-gouging from Wan-Bissaka. His eyes are watering, but he should be OK to continue. 12 min: Rashford speeds down the left to force a corner that is taken short. It ends up leading to a Watford counter, but Wan-Bissaka and McTominay clear the danger. 10 min: Martial nearly escaped after Jesse Lingard\u2019s dummy but had strayed offside. 9 min: Adrian Mariappa may well be singing soprano at Midnight Mass this Christmas after Fred larrups the ball at his crown jewels. Bravely, gingerly, he soldiers on. 8 min: Watford force a corner. Troy Deeney lurks with intent but the ball in from Will Hughes does not even beat first man Marcus Rashford. 6 min: Quick United attack, McTominay and Martial get James away, and the ball is centred for the striker, whose shot is wide. He\u2019s disappointed with that. 5 min: United had a free-kick in a dangerous position but Dan James and then Luke Shaw when the ball came back out did not make much of it. 4 min: Early burst from Martial at centre-forward. With his back to goal, he releases Jesse Lingard and it takes some hurried defending to avert any danger. 2 min: Gerard Deulofeu v Wan-Bissaka already looks like one of the key match-ups of this game; almost all of the action so far has been down their flank. 1 min: Aaron Wan-Bissaka goes into what some call the \u2018block tackle\u2019 and looks to have hurt himself a little. He\u2019s made of stern stuff and will try to run that off. And away we go.... Nemanja Matic, United\u2019s forgotten man, and someone surely headed for a move out next month is also on the bench. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r speaks (On Pogba): He looks very ready and he is in good shape. Hopefully we can see the best of Paul in the next few months. (On Mason Greenwood): He\u2019s come off the bench a few times, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s got to do today. He\u2019s got a chance of coming on if he needs to. Nige was also Sheffield Wednesday captain for this 1991 slaying of mighty Manchester United. Nigel Pearson has beaten Manchester United before as a manager. And it was this game in 2014, one of the most ridiculous in Premier League history. At this point, I should make a personal admission: after this I predicted Jamie Vardy would never score another Premier League goal. And he didn\u2019t for six months or so. But I was wrong, so wrong. Nigel Pearson speaks, and he first looks back to the Liverpool game. We created chances, we showed a strong team ethic, which we are gong to need. It\u2019s possible to get out of the situation we are in but we are going to have sto start winning sooner or later. We have to produce performances our fans are happy with but we need results. If we create the same amount of chances as last week clearly we are going to have start taking them. I think the players are looking forward to playing Manchester United but have to be at our best. So far, Manchester United\u2019s social media team has not yet resorted to the #pogback hashtag. But there is time yet, even if Paul Pogba\u2019s star does not shine nearly so brightly as in that heady summer of 2016 when Britain was heading out of the European Union and had a bright and shiny new prime minister. And, to get back to the football, even if he were fully fit, would have the right to challenge that redoubtable midfield partnership of Fred and Scott McTominay. Both are playing the best football of their time at United. This match will be preceded by a minute\u2019s applause for World Cup winner Martin Peters, whose death was announced yesterday. Here\u2019s some overnight news on Manchester United. Ole calls the shots, apparently. For Watford, Nigel Pearson seems to have been happy with his new charges\u2019 performance against Liverpool and selects the same team. Troy Deeney to target Vic Lindelof? The big news is on the Manchester United bench: Paul Pogba, whose earrings looked resplendent as he arrived at Vicarage Road. Looks like his dancing at this brother\u2019s wedding was a mark of a return to fitness. United were a little tardy in their arrival, 30 minutes late, in fact. Their logistics teams seems to have misjudged the Hertfordshire traffic; this type of thing seems to happen rather too often. Here\u2019s the teams in analogue, non-social media guff fashion. Watford starting XI: Foster, Cathcart, Hughes, Mariappa, Femenia, Kabasele, Capoue, Doucoure, Sarr, Deulofeu, Deeney Manchester United starting XI: De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Fred, McTominay, Lingard, James, Rashford, Martial Here are the teams for today Here\u2019s the thing: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s Manchester United are good against good teams, and bad against bad teams. Enter Watford, who have had so abominable a season that they are already on their third manager. One win all season, and just nine goals scored: it couldn\u2019t happen here, could it? Enter Nigel Pearson. He\u2019s already one game into his attempt to repeat Leicester\u2019s great escape in the 2014-15 season and this time he can\u2019t take any blame for his team being in the mire. Last week\u2019s defeat to Liverpool showed positive signs, including a typically muscular approach from a Nige team. Expect to see Troy Deeney given rein to prove himself the on-pitch alpha male that his manager will be in the dug-out. Can Ole\u2019s embryos live up the physical battering they might have to take at the Vicarage Road? Or will Watford\u2019s need for victory push them forward and open the space that United\u2019s quick attackers have made hay with? Kick-off 2pm UK time.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cLet\u2019s sort this mess of a town out,\u201d says a voter in Leigh, a former Lancashire mining and mill town on the edges of greater Manchester, writing on the Facebook wall of its first ever Conservative MP.</p> <p>\u201cLike Labour have done anything for Leigh over the last 100 years apart from grind it in to the ground,\u201d says another.</p> <p>The central Tory slogan of \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, handed down from headquarters to James Grundy, a local councillor, now elected to represent the town he grew up in, had an important extra element: \u201cand fix our town\u201d.</p> <p>The writing had been on the wall for years in Leigh. People here would have warned long before the election that a political earthquake was coming. Red for almost a century, the town was among the broad swathe of former industrial constituencies to turn blue, redrawing the electoral landscape to keep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> safely in Downing Street.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> played a major role in a town that voted overwhelmingly to leave. So did the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> as prime minister: the most unpopular opposition leader for <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/106687/jeremy-corbyn-most-unpopular\">half a century</a>, who promised more than he seemed competent to deliver. But while neither can be downplayed, the seeds of defeat for Labour were sown years before 2019.</p> <p>The seismic shift in Leigh and other so-called \u201cred wall\u201d seats across the north comes from two other deep-rooted problems: The first is the consequences of the economic model that has held sway in Britain for 40 years. The second is the vast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/apr/09/local-government-margaret-thatcher-war-politics\">centralisation of political power in Westminster</a>.</p> <p>Deindustrialisation began long before the late 1970s, but was propelled faster forward as the 1980s advanced to shift Britain, like many wealthy nations, into a service-oriented economy. What went wrong was the failure of successive governments to support areas similar to Leigh that experienced the hollowing out of jobs as manufacturing employment ebbed away.</p> <p>Instead, the red wall towns have low-paid, less-rewarding work as their inheritance, with work in the new boom industries of warehousing, call centres and retail. That\u2019s not to say no good jobs remain. But they do not exist on the scale required, while the idea of commuting to better work elsewhere is a stretch when transport links remain laughably bad.</p> <p>According to the research group Centre for Towns, constituencies that turned from red to blue were almost all <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2019/11/ian-warren-and-will-jennings-addressing-the-needs-of-towns-is-key-to-winning-this-election.html\">ageing as a consequence of these trends</a>, finding that the over-65 population has risen by about 30% in places like Mansfield, Bolsover and Bishop Auckland. All former Labour bastions that are now Tory seats.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like a slow-motion car crash,\u201d says Jo Platt, the defeated Labour MP. \u201cPockets of support were collapsing. We have an older demographic here and our kids leave the first opportunity they get.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of it was the Brexit vote. It\u2019s not that they liked Johnson in any way shape or form. They thought he was a bumbling idiot. But it was about getting something done that they feel should\u2019ve been done three and a half years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The second factor is about local political power, or the lack of it. Public spending power in Britain is largely concentrated in two neighbouring terraced homes on a street in Westminster, No 10 and No 11, rather than in any post-industrial town. It has left people in smaller towns across Britain feeling as though decisions that affect their lives are somehow a very remote activity, over which they have little influence.</p> <p>According to the IPPR thinktank, as much as 95p in every \u00a31 paid in tax is taken by central government, compared to just 69p in Germany. Just 1% of Britain\u2019s national income is spent by local government on economic affairs, half that spent locally and regionally in France or Germany.</p> <p>Leigh is governed by the Labour-led Wigan council. The local council is relatively popular in Wigan itself \u2013 a handful of miles up the road - responding to central government cuts with \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/05/wigan-council-transforming-lives-despite-cuts-austerity\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/05/wigan-council-transforming-lives-despite-cuts-austerity\">deal,</a>\u201d a big society vision of community groups and charities stepping into the void. But Leigh\u2019s people will tell you they\u2019ve seen nothing and had nothing from the Labour-led council. They feel ignored by the council, while the high street is dead, homelessness has risen, the transport is appalling, and it\u2019s all Labour\u2019s fault.</p> <p>Platt says she took much of the flack on the doorstep. The council has always been Labour and so has the MP, and so it seemed to voters like their problem.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the face of Labour in Leigh,\u201d Platt says, adding: \u201cI was getting blamed for the bins and the potholes. We\u2019re seeing more homeless on streets; fly-tipping up and bin collection down.\u201d</p> <p>Grundy ran a hyperlocal campaign. Promises to extend the Atherleigh Way bypass, stop extensive building on the greenbelt and reopening a train station in one of the biggest towns in Britain without a rail link, from a local lad were hugely popular.</p> <p>It was Grundy\u2019s party and not Platt\u2019s that has had a bigger impact in the area, despite never holding power locally.</p> <p>Over the past decade of austerity, Labour councils in the north of England have been hit much harder than their leafy Conservative equivalents in the south.

      "bodyText": "\u201cLet\u2019s sort this mess of a town out,\u201d says a voter in Leigh, a former Lancashire mining and mill town on the edges of greater Manchester, writing on the Facebook wall of its first ever Conservative MP. \u201cLike Labour have done anything for Leigh over the last 100 years apart from grind it in to the ground,\u201d says another. The central Tory slogan of \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, handed down from headquarters to James Grundy, a local councillor, now elected to represent the town he grew up in, had an important extra element: \u201cand fix our town\u201d. The writing had been on the wall for years in Leigh. People here would have warned long before the election that a political earthquake was coming. Red for almost a century, the town was among the broad swathe of former industrial constituencies to turn blue, redrawing the electoral landscape to keep Boris Johnson safely in Downing Street. Brexit played a major role in a town that voted overwhelmingly to leave. So did the idea of Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister: the most unpopular opposition leader for half a century, who promised more than he seemed competent to deliver. But while neither can be downplayed, the seeds of defeat for Labour were sown years before 2019. The seismic shift in Leigh and other so-called \u201cred wall\u201d seats across the north comes from two other deep-rooted problems: The first is the consequences of the economic model that has held sway in Britain for 40 years. The second is the vast centralisation of political power in Westminster. Deindustrialisation began long before the late 1970s, but was propelled faster forward as the 1980s advanced to shift Britain, like many wealthy nations, into a service-oriented economy. What went wrong was the failure of successive governments to support areas similar to Leigh that experienced the hollowing out of jobs as manufacturing employment ebbed away. Instead, the red wall towns have low-paid, less-rewarding work as their inheritance, with work in the new boom industries of warehousing, call centres and retail. That\u2019s not to say no good jobs remain. But they do not exist on the scale required, while the idea of commuting to better work elsewhere is a stretch when transport links remain laughably bad. According to the research group Centre for Towns, constituencies that turned from red to blue were almost all ageing as a consequence of these trends, finding that the over-65 population has risen by about 30% in places like Mansfield, Bolsover and Bishop Auckland. All former Labour bastions that are now Tory seats. \u201cIt was like a slow-motion car crash,\u201d says Jo Platt, the defeated Labour MP. \u201cPockets of support were collapsing. We have an older demographic here and our kids leave the first opportunity they get.\u201d \u201cA lot of it was the Brexit vote. It\u2019s not that they liked Johnson in any way shape or form. They thought he was a bumbling idiot. But it was about getting something done that they feel should\u2019ve been done three and a half years ago.\u201d The second factor is about local political power, or the lack of it. Public spending power in Britain is largely concentrated in two neighbouring terraced homes on a street in Westminster, No 10 and No 11, rather than in any post-industrial town. It has left people in smaller towns across Britain feeling as though decisions that affect their lives are somehow a very remote activity, over which they have little influence. According to the IPPR thinktank, as much as 95p in every \u00a31 paid in tax is taken by central government, compared to just 69p in Germany. Just 1% of Britain\u2019s national income is spent by local government on economic affairs, half that spent locally and regionally in France or Germany. Leigh is governed by the Labour-led Wigan council. The local council is relatively popular in Wigan itself \u2013 a handful of miles up the road - responding to central government cuts with \u201cthe deal,\u201d a big society vision of community groups and charities stepping into the void. But Leigh\u2019s people will tell you they\u2019ve seen nothing and had nothing from the Labour-led council. They feel ignored by the council, while the high street is dead, homelessness has risen, the transport is appalling, and it\u2019s all Labour\u2019s fault. Platt says she took much of the flack on the doorstep. The council has always been Labour and so has the MP, and so it seemed to voters like their problem. \u201cI\u2019m the face of Labour in Leigh,\u201d Platt says, adding: \u201cI was getting blamed for the bins and the potholes. We\u2019re seeing more homeless on streets; fly-tipping up and bin collection down.\u201d Grundy ran a hyperlocal campaign. Promises to extend the Atherleigh Way bypass, stop extensive building on the greenbelt and reopening a train station in one of the biggest towns in Britain without a rail link, from a local lad were hugely popular. It was Grundy\u2019s party and not Platt\u2019s that has had a bigger impact in the area, despite never holding power locally. Over the past decade of austerity, Labour councils in the north of England have been hit much harder than their leafy Conservative equivalents in the south. In Wigan, the amount spent by the council has been slashed by 43% after inflation, compared with an average of 24% nationally, according to a Cambridge university study. The cuts handed down from Westminster were the biggest in Wigan\u2019s history, were the third worst for any local authority in the country, and reduced its budget over a decade by \u00a3160m. Boris Johnson knows he cannot continue down the path of his own party, and has turned on the spending taps as a consequence. This is popular and vital. But the prime minister cannot simply mend the problems of his own party\u2019s making by splashing money around. None of his ideas appear to be in any way connected to individual places. And the concern is that pots of funding controlled in Westminster will result in bidding fests across smaller towns, where everyone competes against everyone else. The plans with the most publicity bang for Johnson\u2019s buck will win, rather than the most in need. In reality, interventions that can make the economies of towns work better are of fundamental importance. Central government ought though play a minimal role, handing spending decisions to local areas. In winning the election in places like Leigh, the Tories have a blank sheet of paper to come up with some new ideas about how to best help their new, traditional working-class constituents. Throwing money at the old red wall might sound like a good idea, but if Johnson wants to make it stick, he ought to hand control of the cash to local people.",

      "body": "<p>It was the equivalent of a V-sign cheerfully flashed at his critics. The day after his landslide election victory, Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds dropped into a caviar-fuelled Christmas party in London hosted by former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny.</p> <p>During the campaign Johnson had stubbornly refused to publish the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/no-10-blocks-russia-eu-referendum-report-until-after-election\">Russia report</a>, written by the last parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee.</p> <p>Its contents have still not been revealed. But it is understood to examine the extent of Moscow influence on British politics \u2013 and the way in which the Russian elite has established a powerful lobby in the UK through lavish expenditure and networking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1350bde11b102766060219c8559847a7dc1362d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1350bde11b102766060219c8559847a7dc1362d/0_124_1164_698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds attend Evgeny Lebedev\u2019s Christmas party a day after Johnson\u2019s landslide election win.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds attend Evgeny Lebedev\u2019s Christmas party a day after Johnson\u2019s landslide election win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GORC/GC Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Lebedev family insist that they are merely entrepreneurs and media proprietors. Nonetheless, the party \u2013 held to celebrate Alexander\u2019s 60th birthday \u2013 was a practical demonstration of how extensive their connections are, stretching all the way to Downing Street.</p> <p>Johnson was one of several top politicians who turned up to the event, held at the Lebedev family\u2019s \u00a36m stuccoed mansion overlooking Regent\u2019s Park. Guests included David and Samantha Cameron and George Osborne, now a Lebedev employee as Evening Standard editor. From the Blairite left, Peter Mandelson and Tristram Hunt were also in attendance.</p> <p>Others invited to the vodka and caviar birthday party included Mick Jagger, Princess Eugenie, the actors Matt Smith and Rosamund Pike, and the model Lily Cole. Comedians Eddie Izzard and David Baddiel, the artist Grayson Perry and sculptor Antony Gormley were also there. Missing this year was the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"211a14d9015383a1cd0767198a6d90ca0866c148\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/211a14d9015383a1cd0767198a6d90ca0866c148/0_119_1835_1100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson and Evgeny Lebedev at a charity event in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson and Evgeny Lebedev at a charity event in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As grand as the list was, the newly elected prime minister\u2019s presence \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-leads-tories-historic-general-election-win\">the night after his election win </a>\u2013 was eye-catching. Johnson has long been a celebrity as well as a politician \u2013 but for a leader who promised to lead a \u201cpeople\u2019s government\u201d, to rub shoulders with such an exclusive elite as one of his first public acts after victory might seem a little incongruous.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn was invited, but didn\u2019t attend. (The invite, for the record, shows a youthful Alexander holding a toddler Evgeny.) In the Labour leader\u2019s absence the Lebedevs hired a Corbyn impersonator, who mingled with guests as they sipped Ruinart champagne and tucked into plates of caviar. There was also a Johnson lookalike, perhaps hired just in case the real prime minister didn\u2019t show up.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s decision to call in on the Lebedevs might be explained as an act of political homage. The Lebedevs own the Evening Standard. Over the summer the newspaper endorsed Johnson to succeed Theresa May. It backed him again last month as the best candidate to be prime minister, an opinion at odds with the left-leaning, Remain-backing Londoners who form its target audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd46af10bbce6dedb0d44fa3a09acacb64fc363b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd46af10bbce6dedb0d44fa3a09acacb64fc363b/0_166_4974_2984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Lebedev\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson went to the champagne-fuelled Christmas party in London on 13 December hosted by former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What lies behind the prime minister\u2019s reluctance to publish the Russia report has yet to be explained. He has dismissed the suggestion of Kremlin interference in the EU referendum vote. And yet on a busy day laced with history, Johnson chose to celebrate with a foreign intelligence officer with the rank of a lieutenant colonel, who graduated from the KGB\u2019s Red Banner Institute.</p> <p>As a young spy Lebedev served with the KGB\u2019s first directorate. During the late Thatcher years he worked at the Soviet embassy in London, not far from the office in Kensington High Street where the Standard is based today. In the 1990s Lebedev senior swapped cold war spying for banking. In 2009 he bought a majority share in the Standard.</p> <p>That complicated history has never put Johnson off spending time with the family. As London mayor, Johnson made repeated trips to the Lebedevs\u2019 luxurious palazzo in Ronti, Italy, and to Evgeny\u2019s parties in London in 2010. He was one of an array of celebrities and actors who flew out to the villa for lavish weekends, complete with a Michelin-starred private chef and a dressing-up box filed with exotic costumes. Evgeny\u2019s pet wolves \u2013 one of them called Boris \u2013 would pad around as the great and the good enjoyed themselves.</p> <p>Sometimes Johnson took his wife Marina Wheeler, from whom he is now divorcing. But in April 2018, at the height of the crisis over the poisoning of Russian former spy Sergei Skripal, Johnson flew to Perugia on his own. He was foreign secretary. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/boris-johnson-security-evgeny-lebedev-perugia-party\">In a highly unusual move, he</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/boris-johnson-security-evgeny-lebedev-perugia-party\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/boris-johnson-security-evgeny-lebedev-perugia-party\">left his security detail behind</a>. The following morning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/boris-johnson-security-evgeny-lebedev-perugia-party\">he was spotted</a> queuing at the airport for a flight home, looking crumpled and hungover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea9ee10780d7b29cae1965a6318ee04dd7548a8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea9ee10780d7b29cae1965a6318ee04dd7548a8c/964_1076_656_394/500.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson, then foreign secretary, on his way back from a Lebedev party in a converted castle near Perugia in Italy\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson, then foreign secretary, on his way back from a Lebedev party in a converted castle near Perugia in Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What was the purpose of the trip? Johnson won\u2019t say. In September, Alexander Lebedev told the Guardian he wasn\u2019t at the palazzo. Two months later, speaking at the Moscow launch of his memoir, Hunt the Banker, Lebedev said he did go to the villa. He didn\u2019t meet Johnson there, he said, instead merely calling in to wish his son a happy birthday.</p> <p>Guests portray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/17/boris-johnson-met-alexander-lebedev-without-security-after-nato-summit\">Evgeny</a> as a needy and even lonely figure, craving companionship, and happiest in his Italian home, away from the burdens of being a media owner. They suggest he doesn\u2019t really get politics per se. But, they add, he enjoys the superficial side of mingling with powerful individuals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dfe6ce2d2aa9c84c915812801beeb81e6bc9273\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dfe6ce2d2aa9c84c915812801beeb81e6bc9273/0_552_2435_1461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson, then foreign secretary, on his way back from a Lebedev party in a converted castle near Perugia, in Italy, spotted looking crumpled and hungover.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson, then foreign secretary, on his way back from a Lebedev party in a converted castle near Perugia, in Italy, spotted looking crumpled and hungover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newly arrived visitors are invited to make a Russian-style toast to Evgeny and to perform a \u2018turn\u2019 of some kind \u2013 a sketch or speech. A lot of drinking goes on, with vodka shots and a mood described by one guest as debauched. Invitees are sometimes stuck there for days, waiting for a lift back on Lebedev\u2019s private jet.</p> <p>Whether in London or Ronti, Lebedevs\u2019 parties bring together two groups who rarely mingle: celebrities and politicians. One is glamorous, the other not so much; both are curious about each other. The mutual attraction partly explains why so many high-profile individuals accept Lebedev\u2019s invitations.</p> <p>But others say there is more. One celebrity who has attended the Lebedev parties in the past now declines, arguing \u201call of these parties seem like covers for meetings\u201d where people can discreetly connect with politicians under the the guise of the event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"011eb2a23ac7da0298eea1965a184a01fb3b8051\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/011eb2a23ac7da0298eea1965a184a01fb3b8051/70_156_2858_1714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson socialises with Evgeny Lebedev at a party along with his sister Rachel Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson socialises with Evgeny Lebedev at a party along with his sister Rachel Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Davidson/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEvgeny sends cars and flies people around on private jets, he makes people feel important, and always serves tons and tons of caviar, which people love.

One non-actor celebrity \u2013 who declined to be named \u2013 received an invite out of the blue.

His bank has been raided, and he has supported the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta.</p> <p>In reality, however, he is on warm terms with the Kremlin. In 2014 he publicly supported Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea, where Lebedev owns a hotel complex in the seaside resort of Alushta. In 2017 he staged a media symposium there. It was arranged \u2013 he told Russian state TV \u2013 to correct a false impression of Crimea put out by a \u201cbiased\u201d western media.</p> <p>Lebedev shared a panel at the conference with Maria Zakharova, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson. She was a guest at his recent Moscow book launch. Zakharova is a hardline exponent of Kremlin policy; last year she denied Russian involvement in the novichok poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury and suggested that Britain\u2019s spy agencies had kidnapped him.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/aug/16/independent-evening-standard-links-to-saudi-arabia-inquiry-blocked\">Lebedevs say that their forays into the British media are altruistic</a>, and have nothing to do with Moscow\u2019s darker global agenda. Whatever their motives for bringing them together, their remarkably diverse collection of friends \u2013 from the British prime minister to senior Putin functionaries \u2013 add up to an environment in which gossip, intelligence and information can flow as freely as the champagne.</p> <p>Alexander Lebedev was contacted for comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was the equivalent of a V-sign cheerfully flashed at his critics. The day after his landslide election victory, Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds dropped into a caviar-fuelled Christmas party in London hosted by former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny. During the campaign Johnson had stubbornly refused to publish the Russia report, written by the last parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee. Its contents have still not been revealed. But it is understood to examine the extent of Moscow influence on British politics \u2013 and the way in which the Russian elite has established a powerful lobby in the UK through lavish expenditure and networking. The Lebedev family insist that they are merely entrepreneurs and media proprietors. Nonetheless, the party \u2013 held to celebrate Alexander\u2019s 60th birthday \u2013 was a practical demonstration of how extensive their connections are, stretching all the way to Downing Street. Johnson was one of several top politicians who turned up to the event, held at the Lebedev family\u2019s \u00a36m stuccoed mansion overlooking Regent\u2019s Park. Guests included David and Samantha Cameron and George Osborne, now a Lebedev employee as Evening Standard editor. From the Blairite left, Peter Mandelson and Tristram Hunt were also in attendance. Others invited to the vodka and caviar birthday party included Mick Jagger, Princess Eugenie, the actors Matt Smith and Rosamund Pike, and the model Lily Cole. Comedians Eddie Izzard and David Baddiel, the artist Grayson Perry and sculptor Antony Gormley were also there. Missing this year was the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. As grand as the list was, the newly elected prime minister\u2019s presence \u2013 the night after his election win \u2013 was eye-catching. Johnson has long been a celebrity as well as a politician \u2013 but for a leader who promised to lead a \u201cpeople\u2019s government\u201d, to rub shoulders with such an exclusive elite as one of his first public acts after victory might seem a little incongruous. Jeremy Corbyn was invited, but didn\u2019t attend. (The invite, for the record, shows a youthful Alexander holding a toddler Evgeny.) In the Labour leader\u2019s absence the Lebedevs hired a Corbyn impersonator, who mingled with guests as they sipped Ruinart champagne and tucked into plates of caviar. There was also a Johnson lookalike, perhaps hired just in case the real prime minister didn\u2019t show up. Johnson\u2019s decision to call in on the Lebedevs might be explained as an act of political homage. The Lebedevs own the Evening Standard. Over the summer the newspaper endorsed Johnson to succeed Theresa May. It backed him again last month as the best candidate to be prime minister, an opinion at odds with the left-leaning, Remain-backing Londoners who form its target audience. What lies behind the prime minister\u2019s reluctance to publish the Russia report has yet to be explained. He has dismissed the suggestion of Kremlin interference in the EU referendum vote. And yet on a busy day laced with history, Johnson chose to celebrate with a foreign intelligence officer with the rank of a lieutenant colonel, who graduated from the KGB\u2019s Red Banner Institute. As a young spy Lebedev served with the KGB\u2019s first directorate. During the late Thatcher years he worked at the Soviet embassy in London, not far from the office in Kensington High Street where the Standard is based today. In the 1990s Lebedev senior swapped cold war spying for banking. In 2009 he bought a majority share in the Standard. That complicated history has never put Johnson off spending time with the family. As London mayor, Johnson made repeated trips to the Lebedevs\u2019 luxurious palazzo in Ronti, Italy, and to Evgeny\u2019s parties in London in 2010. He was one of an array of celebrities and actors who flew out to the villa for lavish weekends, complete with a Michelin-starred private chef and a dressing-up box filed with exotic costumes. Evgeny\u2019s pet wolves \u2013 one of them called Boris \u2013 would pad around as the great and the good enjoyed themselves. Sometimes Johnson took his wife Marina Wheeler, from whom he is now divorcing. But in April 2018, at the height of the crisis over the poisoning of Russian former spy Sergei Skripal, Johnson flew to Perugia on his own. He was foreign secretary. In a highly unusual move, he left his security detail behind. The following morning he was spotted queuing at the airport for a flight home, looking crumpled and hungover. What was the purpose of the trip? Johnson won\u2019t say. In September, Alexander Lebedev told the Guardian he wasn\u2019t at the palazzo. Two months later, speaking at the Moscow launch of his memoir, Hunt the Banker, Lebedev said he did go to the villa. He didn\u2019t meet Johnson there, he said, instead merely calling in to wish his son a happy birthday. Guests portray Evgeny as a needy and even lonely figure, craving companionship, and happiest in his Italian home, away from the burdens of being a media owner. They suggest he doesn\u2019t really get politics per se. But, they add, he enjoys the superficial side of mingling with powerful individuals. Newly arrived visitors are invited to make a Russian-style toast to Evgeny and to perform a \u2018turn\u2019 of some kind \u2013 a sketch or speech. A lot of drinking goes on, with vodka shots and a mood described by one guest as debauched. Invitees are sometimes stuck there for days, waiting for a lift back on Lebedev\u2019s private jet. Whether in London or Ronti, Lebedevs\u2019 parties bring together two groups who rarely mingle: celebrities and politicians. One is glamorous, the other not so much; both are curious about each other. The mutual attraction partly explains why so many high-profile individuals accept Lebedev\u2019s invitations. But others say there is more. One celebrity who has attended the Lebedev parties in the past now declines, arguing \u201call of these parties seem like covers for meetings\u201d where people can discreetly connect with politicians under the the guise of the event. \u201cEvgeny sends cars and flies people around on private jets, he makes people feel important, and always serves tons and tons of caviar, which people love. And there\u2019s usually a photographer there ensuring attendees will get a bit of press,\u201d the celebrity added. Regular attendees at the Lebedev parties have included the actors Ian McKellen, Keira Knightley, Joan Collins and Ralph Fiennes. One non-actor celebrity \u2013 who declined to be named \u2013 received an invite out of the blue. When he climbed on board Evgeny\u2019s plane he found that he and the other guests had one thing in common: they were all famous. Evgeny\u2019s A-list contacts book is in part due to the Standard\u2019s theatre awards, which have run since 1955 and which he now co-hosts. He also enlists his journalists to pull in big names. His former fixers have included Sarah Sands, who edited the Standard and is now editor of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, and Amol Rajan, the former Independent editor who is now the BBC\u2019s media editor. In Russia, Alexander Lebedev depicts himself as a semi-oppositionist and victim of official persecution. His bank has been raided, and he has supported the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta. In reality, however, he is on warm terms with the Kremlin. In 2014 he publicly supported Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea, where Lebedev owns a hotel complex in the seaside resort of Alushta. In 2017 he staged a media symposium there. It was arranged \u2013 he told Russian state TV \u2013 to correct a false impression of Crimea put out by a \u201cbiased\u201d western media. Lebedev shared a panel at the conference with Maria Zakharova, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson. She was a guest at his recent Moscow book launch. Zakharova is a hardline exponent of Kremlin policy; last year she denied Russian involvement in the novichok poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury and suggested that Britain\u2019s spy agencies had kidnapped him. The Lebedevs say that their forays into the British media are altruistic, and have nothing to do with Moscow\u2019s darker global agenda. Whatever their motives for bringing them together, their remarkably diverse collection of friends \u2013 from the British prime minister to senior Putin functionaries \u2013 add up to an environment in which gossip, intelligence and information can flow as freely as the champagne. Alexander Lebedev was contacted for comment.",

      "body": "<p>In a career spanning six decades, Tony Britton, who has died aged 95, went from being a leading juvenile at Stratford-upon-Avon and a contracted film star with British Lion in the 1950s, to a West End \u201cabove the title\u201d lead in the 60s, a TV sitcom stalwart in the 70s and thereafter a benign, suave presence on stage and screen.

Robin lived \u201cin sin\u201d with his girlfriend, Victoria (Tessa Wyatt), James\u2019s daughter; James in turn disapproved of the relationship, while contending with the incursions of his own former wife, played by Honor Blackman and, later on, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/01/barbara-murray\" title=\"\">Barbara Murray</a>.</p> <p>Britton then consolidated his place in the sitcom firmament with Don\u2019t Wait Up (1983-90), about a tricky father-and-son relationship, with serious moral and political overtones, co-starring Nigel Havers. The scripts were by the actor George Layton who had chipped in as a writer to several later episodes of Robin\u2019s Nest. Britton, as Toby Latimer, was a Harley Street consultant, while Havers as his son, Tom, was an idealist and over-worked NHS GP; both had split up from their respective wives and they end up sharing a home.

In the 1987 season, he directed Wilde\u2019s An Ideal Husband with Clive Francis and Joanna Lumley, and played \u2013 though not with the tortured brilliance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/20/2\" title=\"\">Paul Scofield</a> \u2013 Thomas More in Robert Bolt\u2019s A Man For All Seasons, with Roy Kinnear as the Common Man.</p> <p>Still, in the early 90s, he was part of three shows which belied Chichester\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d reputation: supporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/19/alan-howard\" title=\"\">Alan Howard</a> in a flashing melodrama, The Silver King; as Wolsey, with great speeches, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/20/keith-michell\" title=\"\">Keith Michell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/aug/07/guardianobituaries.lyngardner\" title=\"\">Dorothy Tutin</a>, in Shakespeare\u2019s Henry VIII; and as the bishop of Chelsea in Shaw\u2019s rarely seen Getting Married.</p> <p>In 1994, he returned to Stratford as Chorus in Henry V and an avuncular Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night. His last West End appearance, at the Haymarket, was in Jeffrey Archer\u2019s The Accused (2000) in which the audience voted on the accused\u2019s culpability, though it was Archer himself whom the critics placed in the dock. Britton and Edward de Souza were judge and jury bailiff in a distinctly underwhelming occasion, a real trial to be sure.</p> <p>Britton\u2019s many enthusiasms included golf, gardening, wine and photography. He was a member of the Garrick, Surrey cricket club and the MCC.</p> <p>He married Ruth Hawkins in 1948. They divorced, and in 1962 he married the Danish portrait sculptor Eva Birkefeldt; she died in 2008. Britton is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Cherry, a scriptwriter, and Fern, a TV presenter, and by a son, Jasper, an actor, from his second.</p> <p>\u2022 Anthony Edward Lowry Britton, actor, born 9 June 1924; died 22 December 2019</p>",

Still, in the early 90s, he was part of three shows which belied Chichester\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d reputation: supporting Alan Howard in a flashing melodrama, The Silver King; as Wolsey, with great speeches, and Keith Michell and Dorothy Tutin, in Shakespeare\u2019s Henry VIII; and as the bishop of Chelsea in Shaw\u2019s rarely seen Getting Married. In 1994, he returned to Stratford as Chorus in Henry V and an avuncular Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night. His last West End appearance, at the Haymarket, was in Jeffrey Archer\u2019s The Accused (2000) in which the audience voted on the accused\u2019s culpability, though it was Archer himself whom the critics placed in the dock. Britton and Edward de Souza were judge and jury bailiff in a distinctly underwhelming occasion, a real trial to be sure. Britton\u2019s many enthusiasms included golf, gardening, wine and photography. He was a member of the Garrick, Surrey cricket club and the MCC. He married Ruth Hawkins in 1948. They divorced, and in 1962 he married the Danish portrait sculptor Eva Birkefeldt; she died in 2008. Britton is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Cherry, a scriptwriter, and Fern, a TV presenter, and by a son, Jasper, an actor, from his second. \u2022 Anthony Edward Lowry Britton, actor, born 9 June 1924; died 22 December 2019",

      "body": "<h2>The world awoke to the need to combat global heating</h2> <p>Was 2019 the year people finally started to listen to climate scientists on global heating? The previous year, the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/\" title=\"\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) had laid out the monumental challenge of limiting warming to <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\" title=\"\">1.5</a><a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\" title=\"\">C</a>. Global CO2 emissions would need to halve within 12 years, and reach zero around 2050. But emissions are still rising, while UN summits make tiny steps towards agreeing how to reduce them. The \u201cemissions gap\u201d between target and reality grows ever wider \u2013 and becomes ever harder to close.</p> <p>This struck a chord with vast numbers of people, especially the young, who are thinking ahead to what their world could look like. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a> kickstarted a global movement of school strikers, demanding that governments \u201clisten to the science\u201d and \u201cact as if the house is on fire\u201d. Although some countries have ramped up their own emissions cuts targets \u2013 the UK now officially aims for net zero emissions by 2050 \u2013 public concern and frustration has kept growing. More and more members of the public have taken extreme steps to call for urgent action on climate, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a> protesters being arrested en masse and controversially keeping the issue in the news.</p> <p>What if we don\u2019t turn things around quickly? Major impacts are already baked in, with glaciers melting worldwide, Greenland losing ice rapidly, and heatwaves and fires happening more often and more severely. Heavy rainfall is increasing, as is drought in some places. We already need to live with a different climate. Although some campaigners\u2019 rhetoric is not scientific (we don\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/20/extinction-rebellion-founders-holocaust-remarks-spark-fury\" title=\"\">seriously expect \u201c6 billion deaths\u201d</a>), unchecked warming would still expose tens or even hundreds of millions to extreme heat stress conditions and flooding from the sea. The worst can still be avoided, but the longer we keep heating the planet, the harder it gets. <br><strong>Prof</strong><strong> <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/richard-betts\" title=\"\">Richard Betts</a>, </strong><strong>climate </strong><strong>scientist, University of Exeter </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> Met Office Hadley Centre</strong></p> <h2>A last-chance survey of the Arctic sea ice got under way</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a522fda96f41dd492023f71e09f680b3bd0693bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a522fda96f41dd492023f71e09f680b3bd0693bf/0_0_3751_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Researchers from the icebreaker Polarstern collect snow samples from the Arctic sea ice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Researchers from the icebreaker Polarstern collect snow samples from the Arctic sea ice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melanie Bergmann/Alfred-Wegener-Institut/Science Advances</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Right now, on top of the world, a ship is frozen into the Arctic sea ice at the north pole.

This region of Earth, the Arctic Ocean, is still one of the most remote and inaccessible places on our planet. We know very little about what happens here during the polar night, when temperatures can easily drop to -30C, and thick sea ice crunches and bends in the darkness. But this region is critical to Earth\u2019s climate, and it\u2019s essential to understand more.</p> <p>The Polarstern is here on a once-in-for-ever opportunity to fill that data gap. It\u2019s the centrepiece of the <a href=\"https://www.mosaic-expedition.org/\" title=\"\">Mosaic</a><a href=\"https://www.mosaic-expedition.org/\" title=\"\"> expedition</a>, probably the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/13/mosaic-measure-climate-change-expedition-anchor-research-ship-arctic-ocean-ice-floe\" title=\"\">biggest polar expedition that will ever be launched</a>. Twenty years from now, it may not be possible to do this: to freeze into the sea ice for an entire year and to drift inside this vast cold environment to watch and learn from the inside. It\u2019s taken 20 years to organise, and over the year of the expedition (September 2019 to September 2020), 600 scientists will rotate on and off the ship, supported by many more in research institutes around the world. There is no question that the data being gathered now will drive a revolution in our understanding of the north pole and our climate, and every one of us will be affected by what they find. <br><strong><a href=\"https://www.helenczerski.net/\" title=\"\">Helen Czerski</a>, physicist and oceanographer</strong></p> <h2>The first image of a black hole will have huge ramifications</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c41f7d493ca611d6472bd4930bbc63a721a20ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c41f7d493ca611d6472bd4930bbc63a721a20ae3/0_0_3500_2039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The image of the black hole at the centre of galaxy M87 taken by the Event Horizon Telescope in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"583\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The image of the black hole at the centre of galaxy M87 taken by the Event Horizon Telescope in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The laws of physics can be expressed in a handful of compact equations, but their reach is simply breathtaking. A stunning demonstration of this came with our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/10/black-hole-picture-captured-for-first-time-in-space-breakthrough\" title=\"\">first picture of a black hole</a>, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope.</p> <p>The black hole is situated at the centre of the Messier 87 galaxy, 54m light years away. The glowing ring of radiation, emitted by tortured matter spinning through warped space-time, is already iconic. The matter is plunging towards an event horizon as big as the solar system, containing the mass of 6.5bn suns.</p> <p>Remarkable aspects of the image abound. The theory of general relativity, published by Einstein a hundred years ago, predicted the existence and features of this beast remarkably well. The cataclysmic whirlpool may be beyond our imagination, but it is not beyond our mathematics.</p> <p>The singularity predicted at the heart of a black hole is a different story though. That is where quantum mechanics and relativity conflict and break down. We would love to know what answers lie there, and we will be scouring the image for any clues.</p> <p>Finally, the global collaboration necessary to capture the image shows we can work together on a worldwide scale to a common goal \u2013 something that our science tells us we need to do more of, if we want to survive as a species and continue our exploration of the amazing universe in which we find ourselves. <br><strong>Jon Butterworth</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>professor of </strong><strong>physics</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> University College </strong><strong>London</strong></p> <h2>Progress was made in the fight against Ebola in DRC</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05e7e6cd0bccc6b7ee6bc14f04efce9131cf154f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05e7e6cd0bccc6b7ee6bc14f04efce9131cf154f/0_0_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A WHO nurse with a bottle of Ebola vaccine, Mbandaka, Democratic Republic of the Congo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A WHO nurse with a bottle of Ebola vaccine, Mbandaka, Democratic Republic of the Congo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Junior D Kannah/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ebola in 2019 highlights both the achievements of scientific progress and the persistent deep-rooted challenges of improving health in the most difficult settings. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa killed more than 11,000 people and alerted the world to its dangers. It highlighted the rich world\u2019s neglect of research and development for infectious diseases that only rarely present a global risk.</p> <p>At the end of 2019 we have a licensed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/22/ebola-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective-scientists-declare-after-trials-successful\" title=\"\">Ebola vaccine</a>, another hopefully soon to be licensed, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/ebola-now-curable-after-trials-of-drugs-in-drc-say-scientists\" title=\"\">two effective therapeutic drugs</a>. We can now treat those infected as well as prevent spread of the disease, allowing us to move from reactive containment to primary prevention, as a result of large and innovative collaborations that demonstrate how to help develop new and effective technologies, now and in the future.</p> <p>But the current outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has lasted more than 15 months and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019\" title=\"\">killed more than 2,000 people</a>. Treatment and control continues to be hugely difficult in a setting characterised by political, economic and social fragility.

That whole scheme has been thoroughly binned in the last decade, with more fossil discoveries and the addition of ancient DNA to the armoury. We now have less confidence in the relationships between many more members of the human family, apart from the ones whose legacy we can see in our own DNA \u2013 our Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestors. Others will be found soon enough.</p> <p>We remain an African species. <em>Homo sapiens</em> evolved in multiple places in Africa, and a few thousand left some 70,000 years ago to populate the rest of the world. But now we know that there were earlier diasporas from the motherland. This year, we discovered that we had made it all the way to Greece.

This was a misguided and badly conducted attempt to make children resistant to infection by HIV, the virus that causes Aids, by mutating the CCR5 gene, which encodes a protein expressed on the surface of white blood cells that the virus uses to gain entry. He showed disregard for normal scientific and clinical practice, ignored risks to the children born and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/04/china-gene-edited-baby-experiment-may-have-created-unintended-mutations\" title=\"\">potentially to subsequent generations</a>.</p> <p>But the work made the prospect of altering our genetic makeup more immediate rather than theoretical. It also raised concerns about where to draw the line with the possibility of not just avoiding genetic and perhaps infectious disease, but ultimately carrying out forms of enhancement. However, it had the positive benefit of stimulating debate worldwide and it has led to the launch of international efforts, notably a science academies panel to judge the science, clinical need, and the conditions that would have to be met for germline (potentially heritable) genome editing to be carried out; and a WHO-appointed committee to develop a framework of governance that can be adopted to control the use of the genome editing methods in treating or avoiding disease. Both of these efforts will report next year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the science of genome editing and its application in both the field and clinic are progressing rapidly.

Given that about 85% of disease-causing mutations in humans could, in theory, be corrected by prime editing, it clearly offers great promise. Ways to make animals and plants resistant to disease and to allow plants to cope with climate change have been developed using genome editing, and this year we have seen a huge jump in the number of clinical trials using the methods to treat patients with genetic diseases (\u201csomatic\u201d or non-heritable gene therapy), including cancers, blindness and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/sickle-cell-disease\" title=\"\">sickle cell disease</a>. <br><strong><a href=\"https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/find-a-researcher/robin-lovell-badge\" title=\"\">Robin Lovell-Badge</a>, group leader, the Francis Crick Institute, London</strong></p> <h2>Work on batteries for the future was rightly honoured</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2801dca3e5a02913eeed3acf91b3c881b1d8de63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2801dca3e5a02913eeed3acf91b3c881b1d8de63/0_442_5112_3068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof John Goodenough, the oldest person to receive a Nobel prize, for his work on lithium-ion batteries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof John Goodenough, the oldest person to receive a Nobel prize, for his work on lithium-ion batteries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rechargeable lithium-ion battery has helped power the global revolution in portable electronics, and, indeed, many of you will be reading this article on a mobile phone, laptop or tablet computer.

All the rats learned to look for the hiding experimenter and all but one learned to hide from her. The only reward the rats received was the experimenter tickling and playing with them.</p> <p>The data suggests that the rats were enthusiastically engaging in the game, looking \u201cfrantically\u201d for the experimenter, squeaking and executing <em>Freudenspr</em><em>\u00fcnge</em> (\u201cjoy jumps\u201d) when they found her. They seemed to understand what it means to hide, preferring opaque boxes rather than clear boxes, and remaining silent (no squeals) until found. Frequently when they were found, they would tease the experimenter by running away and hiding again.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth bearing in mind how complex this hide-and-seek is \u2013 involving changes in role (hider or seeker) and theory of mind, and it\u2019s almost alarming how well these rats learned to do this, all in the absence of classic psychological rewards like food. The experimenters conclude that the rats learn to play this game for the sheer joy of playing the game, and this is disconcertingly similar to the way human children play. <br><strong>Sophie Scott</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>professor of </strong><strong>cognitive </strong><strong>neuroscience</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> University College London</strong></p> <h2>Pioneering work on oxygen levels in the blood paid dividends</h2> <p>Once, during an ill-judged holiday in Borneo, I tried to climb a small mountain.

      "bodyText": "The world awoke to the need to combat global heating Was 2019 the year people finally started to listen to climate scientists on global heating? The previous year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had laid out the monumental challenge of limiting warming to 1.5C. Global CO2 emissions would need to halve within 12 years, and reach zero around 2050. But emissions are still rising, while UN summits make tiny steps towards agreeing how to reduce them. The \u201cemissions gap\u201d between target and reality grows ever wider \u2013 and becomes ever harder to close. This struck a chord with vast numbers of people, especially the young, who are thinking ahead to what their world could look like. Greta Thunberg kickstarted a global movement of school strikers, demanding that governments \u201clisten to the science\u201d and \u201cact as if the house is on fire\u201d. Although some countries have ramped up their own emissions cuts targets \u2013 the UK now officially aims for net zero emissions by 2050 \u2013 public concern and frustration has kept growing. More and more members of the public have taken extreme steps to call for urgent action on climate, with Extinction Rebellion protesters being arrested en masse and controversially keeping the issue in the news. What if we don\u2019t turn things around quickly? Major impacts are already baked in, with glaciers melting worldwide, Greenland losing ice rapidly, and heatwaves and fires happening more often and more severely. Heavy rainfall is increasing, as is drought in some places. We already need to live with a different climate. Although some campaigners\u2019 rhetoric is not scientific (we don\u2019t seriously expect \u201c6 billion deaths\u201d), unchecked warming would still expose tens or even hundreds of millions to extreme heat stress conditions and flooding from the sea. The worst can still be avoided, but the longer we keep heating the planet, the harder it gets. Prof Richard Betts, climate scientist, University of Exeter and Met Office Hadley Centre A last-chance survey of the Arctic sea ice got under way Right now, on top of the world, a ship is frozen into the Arctic sea ice at the north pole. The RV Polarstern is pirouetting on the spot in the dark, with no prospect of sunlight for months to come. This region of Earth, the Arctic Ocean, is still one of the most remote and inaccessible places on our planet. We know very little about what happens here during the polar night, when temperatures can easily drop to -30C, and thick sea ice crunches and bends in the darkness. But this region is critical to Earth\u2019s climate, and it\u2019s essential to understand more. The Polarstern is here on a once-in-for-ever opportunity to fill that data gap. It\u2019s the centrepiece of the Mosaic expedition, probably the biggest polar expedition that will ever be launched. Twenty years from now, it may not be possible to do this: to freeze into the sea ice for an entire year and to drift inside this vast cold environment to watch and learn from the inside. It\u2019s taken 20 years to organise, and over the year of the expedition (September 2019 to September 2020), 600 scientists will rotate on and off the ship, supported by many more in research institutes around the world. There is no question that the data being gathered now will drive a revolution in our understanding of the north pole and our climate, and every one of us will be affected by what they find. Helen Czerski, physicist and oceanographer The first image of a black hole will have huge ramifications The laws of physics can be expressed in a handful of compact equations, but their reach is simply breathtaking. A stunning demonstration of this came with our first picture of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope. The black hole is situated at the centre of the Messier 87 galaxy, 54m light years away. The glowing ring of radiation, emitted by tortured matter spinning through warped space-time, is already iconic. The matter is plunging towards an event horizon as big as the solar system, containing the mass of 6.5bn suns. Remarkable aspects of the image abound. The theory of general relativity, published by Einstein a hundred years ago, predicted the existence and features of this beast remarkably well. The cataclysmic whirlpool may be beyond our imagination, but it is not beyond our mathematics. The singularity predicted at the heart of a black hole is a different story though. That is where quantum mechanics and relativity conflict and break down. We would love to know what answers lie there, and we will be scouring the image for any clues. Finally, the global collaboration necessary to capture the image shows we can work together on a worldwide scale to a common goal \u2013 something that our science tells us we need to do more of, if we want to survive as a species and continue our exploration of the amazing universe in which we find ourselves. Jon Butterworth, professor of physics, University College London Progress was made in the fight against Ebola in DRC Ebola in 2019 highlights both the achievements of scientific progress and the persistent deep-rooted challenges of improving health in the most difficult settings. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa killed more than 11,000 people and alerted the world to its dangers. It highlighted the rich world\u2019s neglect of research and development for infectious diseases that only rarely present a global risk. At the end of 2019 we have a licensed Ebola vaccine, another hopefully soon to be licensed, and two effective therapeutic drugs. We can now treat those infected as well as prevent spread of the disease, allowing us to move from reactive containment to primary prevention, as a result of large and innovative collaborations that demonstrate how to help develop new and effective technologies, now and in the future. But the current outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has lasted more than 15 months and killed more than 2,000 people. Treatment and control continues to be hugely difficult in a setting characterised by political, economic and social fragility. Effective vaccines and drugs are part of what is needed for epidemic prevention, but we must continue to strive to address the fundamental causes of ill health in these settings. Anne Mills, professor of health economics and policy, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine We found our earliest European ancestors Remember that time when we were young, and we had those nice neat family trees about human evolution? Lucy, Homo erectus, skip a few, Neanderthals and finally us? That whole scheme has been thoroughly binned in the last decade, with more fossil discoveries and the addition of ancient DNA to the armoury. We now have less confidence in the relationships between many more members of the human family, apart from the ones whose legacy we can see in our own DNA \u2013 our Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestors. Others will be found soon enough. We remain an African species. Homo sapiens evolved in multiple places in Africa, and a few thousand left some 70,000 years ago to populate the rest of the world. But now we know that there were earlier diasporas from the motherland. This year, we discovered that we had made it all the way to Greece. Embedded in the roof of a cave in the southern Peloponnese, two crushed skulls were found by Katerina Harvati and her team, one a sprightly 170,000-year-old Neanderthal, but the other is us, Homo sapiens, and is more than 210,000 years old. This is far older and much farther afield than we had previously found. The revolution in the story of how we got here shows no signs of calming down. Dr Adam Rutherford is a geneticist and author. His book How to Argue With a Racist is out in February (W&amp;N, 12.99) The promise and fears around gene editing ratcheted upwards Although announced in November 2018, the shock waves from the announcement by the Chinese scientist He Jiankui that two girls had been born from embryos that were genetically modified using genome editing have been reverberating throughout 2019, and will no doubt continue to do so for years to come. This was a misguided and badly conducted attempt to make children resistant to infection by HIV, the virus that causes Aids, by mutating the CCR5 gene, which encodes a protein expressed on the surface of white blood cells that the virus uses to gain entry. He showed disregard for normal scientific and clinical practice, ignored risks to the children born and potentially to subsequent generations. But the work made the prospect of altering our genetic makeup more immediate rather than theoretical. It also raised concerns about where to draw the line with the possibility of not just avoiding genetic and perhaps infectious disease, but ultimately carrying out forms of enhancement. However, it had the positive benefit of stimulating debate worldwide and it has led to the launch of international efforts, notably a science academies panel to judge the science, clinical need, and the conditions that would have to be met for germline (potentially heritable) genome editing to be carried out; and a WHO-appointed committee to develop a framework of governance that can be adopted to control the use of the genome editing methods in treating or avoiding disease. Both of these efforts will report next year. Meanwhile, the science of genome editing and its application in both the field and clinic are progressing rapidly. A novel and ingenious new method termed prime editing, published by David Liu and colleagues, can efficiently make precise, small changes in DNA, without the problems associated with earlier methods, such as those used by He Jiankui. Given that about 85% of disease-causing mutations in humans could, in theory, be corrected by prime editing, it clearly offers great promise. Ways to make animals and plants resistant to disease and to allow plants to cope with climate change have been developed using genome editing, and this year we have seen a huge jump in the number of clinical trials using the methods to treat patients with genetic diseases (\u201csomatic\u201d or non-heritable gene therapy), including cancers, blindness and sickle cell disease. Robin Lovell-Badge, group leader, the Francis Crick Institute, London Work on batteries for the future was rightly honoured The rechargeable lithium-ion battery has helped power the global revolution in portable electronics, and, indeed, many of you will be reading this article on a mobile phone, laptop or tablet computer. In October this year, the three pioneers of the lithium-ion battery, John Goodenough from the University of Texas at Austin, Stan Whittingham from Binghamton University, New York, and Akira Yoshino from Japan\u2019s Meijo University, were awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry. For me, this award was long overdue and finally recognised an exciting area of materials chemistry. There are lots of reasons to welcome this news. For the sheer beauty of literally holding the result of their fundamental research in our hands. For the celebration of John Goodenough, who at 97 is the oldest person ever awarded any Nobel prize. For the fact that new materials lie at the heart of developing green technologies that can change the way we live and work. For spurring further development of better batteries for electric vehicles and for storing energy from wind and solar. Perhaps most of all because it helps to shine a light on one of the most urgent challenges of our time: a low-carbon future to deal with climate change. Saiful Islam, professor of materials chemistry at the University of Bath Madagascar\u2019s plight highlighted a global problem Menabe, a dry forest in western Madagascar, is on fire. The only habitat of the world\u2019s smallest primate (Berthe\u2019s mouse lemur) is going up in flames as hungry people, many escaping droughts in the south, clear land for agriculture (despite the area being officially protected). Worryingly, we learned in October that this is far from an isolated problem and protected areas are less effective than previously thought. Using a global data set of population density, night-time light and agriculture, researchers compared the changes in human pressures over time in more than 12,000 protected areas with similar unprotected areas. On average, pressures have increased faster inside than outside protected areas and those in poorer countries are particularly likely to suffer higher pressures. A decade ago, governments agreed a target to increase the proportion of the globe under conservation by 2020. Next year they gather to review progress and, potentially, commit to new targets. The evidence is clear; when it comes to protecting sites for conservation, quality matters. Designating protected areas without effective management (including support for local communities) won\u2019t stop the fires, hold back the expansions of farms, or, ultimately, protect species from extinction. Julia Jones, professor in conservation science, Bangor University Rats like playing hide-and-seek \u2013 just for fun Games of hide-and-seek are among my favourite childhood memories, and I still case novel environments for good hiding places. Researchers in Germany studied how rats can learn to play hide-and-seek with humans. All the rats learned to look for the hiding experimenter and all but one learned to hide from her. The only reward the rats received was the experimenter tickling and playing with them. The data suggests that the rats were enthusiastically engaging in the game, looking \u201cfrantically\u201d for the experimenter, squeaking and executing Freudenspr\u00fcnge (\u201cjoy jumps\u201d) when they found her. They seemed to understand what it means to hide, preferring opaque boxes rather than clear boxes, and remaining silent (no squeals) until found. Frequently when they were found, they would tease the experimenter by running away and hiding again. It\u2019s worth bearing in mind how complex this hide-and-seek is \u2013 involving changes in role (hider or seeker) and theory of mind, and it\u2019s almost alarming how well these rats learned to do this, all in the absence of classic psychological rewards like food. The experimenters conclude that the rats learn to play this game for the sheer joy of playing the game, and this is disconcertingly similar to the way human children play. Sophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience, University College London Pioneering work on oxygen levels in the blood paid dividends Once, during an ill-judged holiday in Borneo, I tried to climb a small mountain. While I crawled, panted and coughed on the slopes, my Malaysian guide, Miki, shuffled around politely, hands in his pockets, playing football with small rocks to slow his pace enough to match mine. Unacclimatised to altitude, it took me a day and a half to get to the summit. When I asked Miki how long it would normally take him to do the same he told me that, unencumbered by tourists like me, he could run up and down the mountain in just over three hours. The molecular mechanisms that underpin Miki\u2019s apparently superhuman adaptation to high-altitude life revolve around a family of proteins known as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). These substances trigger alterations in a host of genes, which together help regulate oxygen levels in the human body. Their discovery helped explain how oxygen levels could be sensed and gave scientists insight into the mechanisms that allow the body to adapt and survive when demand for oxygen greatly outstrips supply. This year Sir Peter Ratcliffe, Gregg Semenza and William Kaelin shared a Nobel prize for their part in unpicking that mystery. Their work informs more than ill-advised summit attempts. HIFs and the regulation of oxygen levels are together central to almost all aspects of human life, whether in health or disease. The work has already been applied to develop drugs to treat anaemia and may one day lead to new treatments for stroke, spinal cord injury, chronic inflammation and even cancer.

We\u2019re moving beyond an era when all space projects must involve national agencies or large commercial conglomerates. Groups from many nations will be able to launch follow-ups similar in concept to Beresheet. Sophisticated, privately funded miniaturised probes will gather data about the moon as well as the Earth.

Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal The kilogram was redefined using quantum physics There have been so many \u201csignificant\u201d science stories in 2019 that I have been spoilt for choice. I could have gone with the climate crisis (David Attenborough\u2019s speech at Davos or Greta Thunberg\u2019s at the UN); or maybe the announcement of the first image of a black hole by scientists on the Event Horizon Telescope project, which seems to have already achieved iconic status.

A team of journalists and editors, including the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, George Monbiot, Owen Jones, Gary Younge, John Crace and Marina Hyde took hundreds of calls from readers as the Guardian newsroom turned into a pop-up call centre between 10am and 6pm. The appeal, which runs throughout the festive period, is supporting four charities that promote environmental and social justice through natural climate solutions, from safeguarding the Amazon rainforest to rewilding parts of the Scottish Highlands to planting trees in Britain\u2019s towns, cities and countryside. The charities are Woodland Trust, Trees for Life, Trees for Cities and Global Greengrants Fund UK. Introducing the appeal earlier this month, Viner, said although the onus was on governments and corporations to take major steps to avoid global climate catastrophe, this year\u2019s charity appeal \u201chighlights ways we as citizens can support practical, natural solutions to climate change\u201d.

In her submission to the commissioner, Kelwick says the girl has been treated \u201cworse than an animal\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe attempted suicide by taking an overdose twice in four days and she still wasn\u2019t monitored. Currently she is being kept in segregation to keep her safe,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cShe has been held in a room for five weeks with only a mat to sleep on and a toilet. She is being guarded by three to four males from agencies that do not interact with her\u201d.</p> <p>Susan said: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that the commissioner has taken the trouble to come and see Laura so close to Christmas. She sat on the bed with her and gave her a big hug before she left.

Laura, who became the youngest child to be placed in secure accommodation in England nearly four years ago, is said to have been sexually abused since she was 12 while under the protection of children\u2019s social care in Sheffield. Both her mother and charity workers say the abuse, and the authorities\u2019 failure to deal with it, have sent her into a downward spiral of mental illness. They hope Longfield\u2019s intervention will help secure the three or four-on-one treatment they feel could save her. Susan, meanwhile, lives in dread of someone knocking on her door to say Laura has been found dead. Kathryn Kelwick, who works for a charity that dealt with victims of the Rotherham child abuse scandal, says Laura was \u201chorrendously exploited\u201d during two separate spells at a children\u2019s home in Sheffield. Evidence gathered by Kelwick and Laura\u2019s family h suggests Laura was able to come and go as she pleased while living at the home, despite often showing signs of having been abused when she returned. Those exploiting her allegedly sent taxis to the home to collect her. In Laura\u2019s first spell at the home, Kelwick says it took months for authorities \u201cto sit up and take notice\u201d, and by the time they did the then 14-year-old had been sexually exploited by more than 40 adults. The family say social services turned a blind eye to the abuse, and that South Yorkshire police failed to take any meaningful action to pursue the perpetrators. Laura became so ill she had to be detained at the hospital a year ago. In her submission to the commissioner, Kelwick says the girl has been treated \u201cworse than an animal\u201d. \u201cShe attempted suicide by taking an overdose twice in four days and she still wasn\u2019t monitored. Currently she is being kept in segregation to keep her safe,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has been held in a room for five weeks with only a mat to sleep on and a toilet. She is being guarded by three to four males from agencies that do not interact with her\u201d. Susan said: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that the commissioner has taken the trouble to come and see Laura so close to Christmas. She sat on the bed with her and gave her a big hug before she left. She actually held her face in her hands and said \u2018I\u2019m sorry for all you\u2019ve had to go through, but I\u2019m investigating now\u2019.\u201d Longfield confirmed she had spoken to all the relevant agencies and to Laura herself. \u201cI have asked for some immediate changes and improvements as well as wider reassurance,\u201d she said. Sheffield city council and the hospital have declined to discuss Laura\u2019s case. * Names have been changed In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said in October that the first steps had been taken towards bringing the beleaguered rail service back into public hands. However, a detailed report in the Sunday Times went further and said Northern would be stripped of its franchise and an \u201coperator of the last resort\u201d brought in to run the railway under direct government control.

The promises included \u00a34.2bn in extra funding for the directly elected mayors in eight regions to spend on local public transport, and the announcement of the high-speed east-to-west line Northern Powerhouse Rail in the February budget. The pledges included a \u00a3900m devolution package for West Yorkshire that would give the region similar powers to Greater Manchester, including over health and social care, local transport and housing. Jake Berry, the northern powerhouse minister, also said he was leading discussions to establish a version of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in northern England. He said the US institution provided a significant boost to the regional economy around Boston and that an \u201cMIT for the north\u201d could have the same effect in Britain. \u201cWe want to set up a world-leading institution in the north to rival Oxford and Cambridge, where the best and brightest will base themselves to create new ideas and sell them,\u201d he said. Northern and the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government have been contacted for comment. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cWe are developing contingency plans for the replacement of the current franchise with either a new short-term management contract with Northern or the \u2019operator of last resort\u2019.\u201d",

In a press release this month Italy\u2019s Enel, the 13th largest, trumpeted its inclusion on the index because of its \u201csustainable business model\u201d. \u201cLooking at the number of oil companies listed in this index, this looks more like FTSE4Crude than FTSE4Good,\u201d said Rosie Rogers, the head of Greenpeace UK\u2019s climate campaign. \u201cIt takes some brass neck to argue that there\u2019s anything \u2018ethical\u2019 about investing in the fossil fuel companies driving the climate emergency.\u201d A spokeswoman for FTSE Russell declined to comment on the inclusion of new fossil fuel companies. On G4S, the spokeswoman said: \u201cFTSE Russell and the FTSE Russell ESG advisory committee considered G4S against the controversy framework at this review, which assesses both the severity/scale of an incident as well as how effectively the company has responded. \u201cBased on this assessment it was decided not to suspend G4S at this review. FTSE Russell will continue to closely monitor developments in relation to G4S.\u201d The London Stock Exchange Group\u2019s head of sustainable business, David Harris, has previously told the Guardian he would not exclude the entire oil and gas sector from FTSE4Good indices, saying divestment from those companies would mean forfeiting the ability to bring shareholder pressure to bear.",

With rail strikes continuing into their third week and travellers scrambling to get to home for the holidays, Macron, who turned 42 this weekend, made the symbolic move to become the first president in more than 50 years to give up the automatic pension of more than \u20ac6,000 a month that all French leaders receive after leaving office, regardless of age or wealth. Macron\u2019s office added that he would not take his seat in France\u2019s constitutional court, where former presidents are members for life and receive a monthly allowance of \u20ac13,500. \u201cThis is about being exemplary and coherent,\u201d an \u00c9lys\u00e9e official said.

Le Parisien newspaper hailed Macron\u2019s decision to forfeit his presidential pension as \u201cbreaking with a dusty tradition of republican monarchy\u201d. The left criticised it as a PR stunt, with the Communists saying Macron, a former investment banker, had made millions in the private sector, so had a rare luxury of being able to give up his presidential pension. Despite the strikes, the government insists it will plough ahead to unify the French pensions system, arguing that getting rid of the 42 special regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris Opera staff is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. While some unions support a single system, almost all reject any tweaks relating to age. There is union anger over government plans to introduce a \u201cpivot age\u201d \u2013 keeping the legal retirement age at 62 but insisting on an additional two years\u2019 of work until 64 to get a full pension. With strikes set to continue into the new year, the pensions stand-off has become a personal issue for Macron who had promised to deliver the biggest \u201ctransformation\u201d of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era. The very essence of Macron\u2019s political identity is at stake. He has always said he preferred to make structural changes to the French model amid unpopularity than back down in the face of street protests. Failure to deliver the reforms would dent Macron\u2019s firm support base of about 25%, which is crucial for any re-election bid in 2022.

      "body": "<p>It is painful to watch political denial in action. Believe me, I\u2019ve been down this road before. I lived through Aids denialism in South Africa and I\u2019m witnessing denial again in Australia.</p> <p>In the last few weeks, as fires have raged across New South Wales, and as the nation has grown increasingly furious about Scott Morrison\u2019s lack of leadership, I have felt like I am in a time warp.</p> <p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, South Africa\u2019s President Thabo Mbeki inexplicably decided to gaslight the nation by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/06/southafrica.aids\">denying the existence of human immune deficiency virus \u2013 HIV</a>. He had just taken the reins from Nelson Mandela and the country was shocked. We quickly mobilised to counter the denial. There was no time to dither. For my generation, the fight against Aids denialism was existential \u2013 we were literally fighting for our lives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2019/dec/07/how-big-are-the-fires-burning-on-the-east-coast-of-australia-interactive-map\">How big are the fires burning on the east coast of Australia? Interactive map</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The parallels to the current fight for climate justice are stark. The same obfuscation is on display, the same arrogance. Journalists in South Africa had to plead with politicians to answer their questions. The same desperation is apparent in the Australian media today.</p> <p>In South Africa the media and civil society refused to stop asking questions. They hounded the government and embarrassed the president in international forums. The sustained efforts paid off. Today the South African government runs the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/sarah-boseley-global-health/2010/apr/25/hiv-infection-southafrica\">largest antiretroviral program</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/sarah-boseley-global-health/2010/apr/25/hiv-infection-southafrica\"> in the world</a> and has won global accolades for its rollout.</p> <p>Despite the positive outcome, the entire debacle was an epic waste of time and cost many lives \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/researchers-estimate-lives-lost-delay-arv-drug-use-hivaids-south-africa/\">Harvard study</a> found that 300,000 people lost their lives during the period when South Africa\u2019s president was debating the merits of virology and science.</p> <p>Australia cannot afford a distraction of this scale. And, while there are many parallels between South Africa and Australia, there are also some important differences.

      "bodyText": "It is painful to watch political denial in action. Believe me, I\u2019ve been down this road before. I lived through Aids denialism in South Africa and I\u2019m witnessing denial again in Australia. In the last few weeks, as fires have raged across New South Wales, and as the nation has grown increasingly furious about Scott Morrison\u2019s lack of leadership, I have felt like I am in a time warp. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, South Africa\u2019s President Thabo Mbeki inexplicably decided to gaslight the nation by denying the existence of human immune deficiency virus \u2013 HIV. He had just taken the reins from Nelson Mandela and the country was shocked. We quickly mobilised to counter the denial. There was no time to dither. For my generation, the fight against Aids denialism was existential \u2013 we were literally fighting for our lives. The parallels to the current fight for climate justice are stark. The same obfuscation is on display, the same arrogance. Journalists in South Africa had to plead with politicians to answer their questions. The same desperation is apparent in the Australian media today. In South Africa the media and civil society refused to stop asking questions. They hounded the government and embarrassed the president in international forums. The sustained efforts paid off. Today the South African government runs the largest antiretroviral program in the world and has won global accolades for its rollout. Despite the positive outcome, the entire debacle was an epic waste of time and cost many lives \u2013 a Harvard study found that 300,000 people lost their lives during the period when South Africa\u2019s president was debating the merits of virology and science. Australia cannot afford a distraction of this scale. And, while there are many parallels between South Africa and Australia, there are also some important differences. While Mbeki\u2019s form of denial was crude and fairly straightforward, Scott Morrison\u2019s is far more slippery and clearly buttressed by political expediency. In fact, it is not clear what the prime minister himself believes in respect to global warming. Last week he affirmed that it is a real phenomenon affecting the bushfires, but only did so after mounting pressure from media outlets and angry, fire-hit communities. In addition, over the last few months, Morrison has been deeply disdainful of climate activists. He has indulged in climate sadism \u2013 the phenomenon of mocking those who are outspoken about the climate crisis in order to paint them as hysterical. Using language and tactics straight out of the Trump playbook, Morrison accused Greta Thunberg of causing young people \u201cneedless anxiety,\u201d and has threatened to crack down on climate justice protesters. By minimising the concerns of activists, Morrison has proven himself adept at deploying one of the most powerful rightwing tactics of the moment \u2013 trolling. Unfortunately for Morrison, playing people of different political affiliations against one another isn\u2019t a smart long-term strategy in the face of an existential threat. The quiet Australians whose virtues he has extolled don\u2019t necessarily have different views about climate change from the noisy ones who seem to bother him so much. Morrison can be forgiven for thinking this is a wining formula. After all, divisive rhetoric that pits one kind of person against another has been useful in the culture wars. But, on matters of the environment, the strategy of polarisation is almost sure to backfire in the long term. This is because despite what the Liberal party\u2019s lunatic backbenchers say, 61% of Australians think \u201cglobal warming is a serious and pressing problem and are prepared to take measures to address it even if it involves significant costs\u201d. In other words, climate change is a bipartisan issue. If this is the case \u2013 and events seem to prove it as everyone from schoolchildren to firefighters have come out supporting basic science and challenging the government to do more \u2013 Morrison will need to change course quickly. A year ago embracing the facts of climate change cost Malcolm Turnbull his position as party leader. The bluster and scare tactics secured a victory for Morrison and his team but they cannot take that victory for granted. If the PM does not read the public sentiment properly he could lose his footing by being out of touch with people\u2019s genuine anxieties about the fate of the planet. Ultimately, South Africa\u2019s president was turfed out by the party faithful. The activists played their part but it was the so-called \u201csilent majority\u201d who destroyed his political career. I learned a lot during that era.

The local authority had been in conflict for years with residents who protested against its controversial plans to chop down thousands of street trees and replace them with saplings. In an email released under the Freedom of Information Act, a senior council official suggested to South Yorkshire police that officers should make a note of people attending a meeting with police because it could help take them to court in future. The private meeting was called to discuss how the police would enforce a high court injunction obtained by the council that made it unlawful for campaigners to try to stop the tree-felling work by obstructing the chainsaws. The email, obtained by the Yorkshire Post, was from the council\u2019s head of highway management, Paul Beecroft, and sent to Supt Paul McCurry on 1 February 2018. In it, Beecroft asked whether there would be a register of attendance for the meeting between police and members of the Sheffield Tree Action Group (Stag), which had formed to campaign against the council\u2019s tree-felling programme. Beecroft added that a list of names \u201cwould be useful as we could refer to them being made aware of their responsibilities in any future injunction hearings\u201d. McCurry responded by saying: \u201cWe will be recording the meeting with Stag, we will try to obtain a register of attendance but this may prove difficult.\u201d South Yorkshire police said in a statement that no information-sharing with the council occurred.

Michael Gove had accused the council of \u201cenvironmental vandalism\u201d when he was environment secretary, after it chopped down more than 5,500 trees. The \u00a32bn programme under a PFI contract, which began in 2012, resulted in scores of arrests of campaigners and others taken to court for breaching the injunction obtained by the council.

      "body": "<p>Jeanette Winterson has written 11 novels, as well as nonfiction and children\u2019s books. She was born in Manchester in 1959, the adopted daughter of Pentecostal parents, which she wrote about in her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/27/jeanettewinterson\" title=\"\"><em>Oranges </em><em>Are Not the Only Fruit</em></a> (1985), and then again in her memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/04/why-be-happy-jeanette-winterson-review\" title=\"\"><em>Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?</em></a> (2011). Now 60, Winterson is a professor of new writing at Manchester University, but spends most of her time in the Cotswolds. Her latest book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/20/frankisstein-jeanette-winterson-review-inventive-reanimation-of-a-classic\" title=\"\"><em>Frankissstein</em></a>, which was longlisted for the Booker prize, reimagines Mary Shelley\u2019s gothic novel for the AI era and is out in paperback next month. She is married to the psychotherapist, Susie Orbach.</p> <p><strong><em>Frankissstein</em> is about the troubling ramifications of artificial intelligence. What concerns you most about our technological advancements?</strong><br>I wanted to make the future accessible and show how near we are to that future. What with Brexit and Trump and climate breakdown, the development of AI and how it will impact on our lives isn\u2019t getting the right kind of attention. People don\u2019t think about the profound implications of where we\u2019re heading Because we are profoundly stupid, we\u2019re going to share the planet with a self-created non-biological lifeform smarter than we are! Well done, human race!</p> <p><strong>One of the characters in the book </strong><strong>is a transgender doctor. A lot of writers are now exploring gender and sexuality in their work. Does it feel as if the world has caught up with some of the ideas you have been exploring since the 1980s?</strong><br>Yes, and this is a great thing. When I set off, there was a lot of marginalisation: as a woman, as a gay woman, as a working-class woman. I\u2019m glad that over the 35 years I\u2019ve been writing, that has changed and that I\u2019ve been able to be a part of the change. What I always longed for is that sexuality and gender could be made implicit rather than foregrounded. When I read younger writers like Daisy Johnson and Evie Wyld, I\u2019m excited because they\u2019ve just grown up so differently. They don\u2019t have to foreground these issues in the same way. That started to become possible with Ali Smith, who began 10 years after me. She was able to say: we live like this.</p> <p><strong>Would you upload your own mind to a computer if the opportunity arose?</strong><br>Yes. I\u2019d probably regret it! Who would you trust to do it? What would they do with you? We could be trapped in somebody\u2019s laptop for hundreds of years waiting to get out: \u201cLet me out!\u201d It keys back into all those wonderful fairy stories about trapped spirits in bottles. We\u2019ve always dealt with disembodiment, it\u2019s right through folklore across the planet.</p> <p><strong>Your book is unexpectedly funny. Do you enjoy writing comedy?</strong><br>Yes. It\u2019s partly a northern thing. It\u2019s something you pick up on the buses listening to people talk. I was standing outside my house the other day looking at all the twinkly Christmas lights I\u2019d put up \u2013 because I love Christmas \u2013 and as I watched them flashing on and off, I thought \u201cI wonder if it looks like a carvery\u201d. It was a very northern moment. The world is so dire at the moment, it\u2019s important to make people laugh. It isn\u2019t an escapist response, it\u2019s a way of managing it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/20/frankisstein-jeanette-winterson-review-inventive-reanimation-of-a-classic\">Frankissstein by Jeanette Winterson review \u2013 an inventive reanimation</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Should novelists be more political? Do you intend to write more political books?</strong><br>I have no choice. We live in the times that we live in. You can change your nationality, your gender, but you can\u2019t change the fact you have to live in this world at this time. At the same time, writers are trying to shape the world \u2013 I mean, the way people think and feel. Above all, we have to get away from the simple soundbites, the karate-chop syntax of the daily news, as well as the data avalanche, where no one can find the meaning any more.</p> <p><strong>What are you writing now?</strong><br>Twelve essays about AI. I\u2019d like to write about gene editing because it\u2019s something I didn\u2019t explore in <em>Frankissstein</em>. That really will happen but only for the very rich. People always say \u201clet\u2019s get the technology out there and lots of people will benefit in time\u201d. Well, no, because by that point, the technology will change and the rich will control it completely. The world is moving too fast for the trickle-down effect.</p> <p><strong>Are you optimistic about the future?</strong><br>I\u2019m always optimistic, it\u2019s my greatest strength and greatest failing because I didn\u2019t predict Trump and Brexit. I suppose my faith is always in young people to get it right and to take over where my generation have made such a terrible mess.</p> <p><strong>But lots has changed for the better in your lifetime?</strong><br>Yes, when I was growing up, we didn\u2019t know anyone who was black, divorced, a single parent, gay and now all of those people are probably within our galaxy of friends and acquaintances, so we are more cosmopolitan. But with the right taking over, I\u2019m very worried that the liberalism, tolerance and educated open-mindedness that has allowed generations after me to live freely could easily disappear. I didn\u2019t see this coming with this pace and viciousness. Nothing is won for ever.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the best thing about living in the Cotswolds?</strong><br>I like having physical things to do: grow vegetables, chop wood. It\u2019s proper hard work and it suits my mind. I can\u2019t live from the neck up.

      "bodyText": "Jeanette Winterson has written 11 novels, as well as nonfiction and children\u2019s books. She was born in Manchester in 1959, the adopted daughter of Pentecostal parents, which she wrote about in her first novel, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit (1985), and then again in her memoir Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? (2011). Now 60, Winterson is a professor of new writing at Manchester University, but spends most of her time in the Cotswolds. Her latest book, Frankissstein, which was longlisted for the Booker prize, reimagines Mary Shelley\u2019s gothic novel for the AI era and is out in paperback next month. She is married to the psychotherapist, Susie Orbach. Frankissstein is about the troubling ramifications of artificial intelligence. What concerns you most about our technological advancements? I wanted to make the future accessible and show how near we are to that future. What with Brexit and Trump and climate breakdown, the development of AI and how it will impact on our lives isn\u2019t getting the right kind of attention. People don\u2019t think about the profound implications of where we\u2019re heading Because we are profoundly stupid, we\u2019re going to share the planet with a self-created non-biological lifeform smarter than we are! Well done, human race! One of the characters in the book is a transgender doctor. A lot of writers are now exploring gender and sexuality in their work. Does it feel as if the world has caught up with some of the ideas you have been exploring since the 1980s? Yes, and this is a great thing. When I set off, there was a lot of marginalisation: as a woman, as a gay woman, as a working-class woman. I\u2019m glad that over the 35 years I\u2019ve been writing, that has changed and that I\u2019ve been able to be a part of the change. What I always longed for is that sexuality and gender could be made implicit rather than foregrounded. When I read younger writers like Daisy Johnson and Evie Wyld, I\u2019m excited because they\u2019ve just grown up so differently. They don\u2019t have to foreground these issues in the same way. That started to become possible with Ali Smith, who began 10 years after me. She was able to say: we live like this. Would you upload your own mind to a computer if the opportunity arose? Yes. I\u2019d probably regret it! Who would you trust to do it? What would they do with you? We could be trapped in somebody\u2019s laptop for hundreds of years waiting to get out: \u201cLet me out!\u201d It keys back into all those wonderful fairy stories about trapped spirits in bottles. We\u2019ve always dealt with disembodiment, it\u2019s right through folklore across the planet. Your book is unexpectedly funny. Do you enjoy writing comedy? Yes. It\u2019s partly a northern thing. It\u2019s something you pick up on the buses listening to people talk. I was standing outside my house the other day looking at all the twinkly Christmas lights I\u2019d put up \u2013 because I love Christmas \u2013 and as I watched them flashing on and off, I thought \u201cI wonder if it looks like a carvery\u201d. It was a very northern moment. The world is so dire at the moment, it\u2019s important to make people laugh. It isn\u2019t an escapist response, it\u2019s a way of managing it. Should novelists be more political? Do you intend to write more political books? I have no choice. We live in the times that we live in. You can change your nationality, your gender, but you can\u2019t change the fact you have to live in this world at this time. At the same time, writers are trying to shape the world \u2013 I mean, the way people think and feel. Above all, we have to get away from the simple soundbites, the karate-chop syntax of the daily news, as well as the data avalanche, where no one can find the meaning any more. What are you writing now? Twelve essays about AI. I\u2019d like to write about gene editing because it\u2019s something I didn\u2019t explore in Frankissstein. That really will happen but only for the very rich. People always say \u201clet\u2019s get the technology out there and lots of people will benefit in time\u201d. Well, no, because by that point, the technology will change and the rich will control it completely. The world is moving too fast for the trickle-down effect. Are you optimistic about the future? I\u2019m always optimistic, it\u2019s my greatest strength and greatest failing because I didn\u2019t predict Trump and Brexit. I suppose my faith is always in young people to get it right and to take over where my generation have made such a terrible mess. But lots has changed for the better in your lifetime? Yes, when I was growing up, we didn\u2019t know anyone who was black, divorced, a single parent, gay and now all of those people are probably within our galaxy of friends and acquaintances, so we are more cosmopolitan. But with the right taking over, I\u2019m very worried that the liberalism, tolerance and educated open-mindedness that has allowed generations after me to live freely could easily disappear. I didn\u2019t see this coming with this pace and viciousness. Nothing is won for ever. What\u2019s the best thing about living in the Cotswolds? I like having physical things to do: grow vegetables, chop wood. It\u2019s proper hard work and it suits my mind. I can\u2019t live from the neck up. I\u2019m also a bit dangerous in London now because once I get stuck in my own thoughts, I can get knocked off my bike. You have to be very aware in London and sometimes you don\u2019t want to be very aware! Which book or author do you always return to? Every December, I read Charles Dickens\u2019s A Christmas Carol, which I\u2019ve done since I was a child. It\u2019s like having a cup of tea with an old friend. I know what\u2019s coming next.

A spokesman for Tesco said: \u201cWe abhor the use of prison labour and would never allow it in our supply chain. We were shocked by these allegations and immediately suspended the factory where these cards are produced and launched an investigation. We have also withdrawn these cards from sale while we investigate. \u201cWe have a comprehensive auditing system in place and this supplier was independently audited as recently as last month and no evidence was found to suggest they had broken our rule banning the use of prison labour. If a supplier breaches these rules, we will immediately and permanently de-list them.\u201d Similar notes from Chinese prisoners have been reported in the past. In 2017, Jessica Rigby, from Braintree, Essex, said she found a handwritten note in a Christmas card contained within a box bought from Sainsbury\u2019s. It translated as: \u201cWishing you luck and happiness. Third Product Shop, Guangzhou Prison, No 6 District.\u201d In 2014, Karen Wis\u00ednska from Co Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, said she found a note in a pair of Primark trousers she bought in Belfast alleging slave labour conditions in a Chinese prison making clothes for export. The author, who claimed to be an inmate of the Xiang Nan prison in Hubei province, said: \u201cOur job inside the prison is to produce fashion clothes for export. We work 15 hours per day and the food we eat wouldn\u2019t even be given to dogs or pigs.\u201d Amnesty International says forced labour persists in Chinese detention facilities. Tesco donates \u00a3300,000 a year to three charities \u2013 the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK \u2013 from the sale of boxes of Christmas cards and it is understood they will still receive the full donation this year. Humphrey and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, a naturalised US citizen, were detained in 2013. They had become embroiled in the fallout from a GlaxoSmithKline corruption scandal that their company was originally hired to investigate. He previously told the Guardian that at times during his imprisonment he was handcuffed and held in a metal cage. Humphrey was sentenced to two and a half years in jail and fined 200,000 yuan (\u00a320,260). His wife was sentenced to two years and fined 150,000 yuan. They were released early on medical grounds.",

      "body": "<p>Born in Ballarat, Australia, Craig Revel Horwood, 54, began his career as a dancer in Melbourne but moved to the UK 30 years ago to work in London\u2019s West End. He\u2019s now a choreographer, director and stage star but is best known as a judge on all 17 series of <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>. He\u2019s appearing in <a href=\"http://www.pantomime.com/venues/manchester\" title=\"\">pantomime at Manchester Opera House</a> until 29 December.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re currently playing the Wicked Queen in <em>Snow White.</em> How wicked is she?</strong><br>Very wicked but she\u2019s funny with it. There are a lot of <em>Strictly</em> gags in there, where my dancing gets scored by the audience. Sometimes they shout \u201cSeveeeeen!\u201d like Len Goodman, other times I get a whole row of zeros. There\u2019s lots of singing, frivolity, banter with hecklers and costume changes. It\u2019s so full-on, I usually lose a stone-and-a-half during panto season.</p> <p><strong>You should patent the Panto Diet Plan.</strong><br>I should. You can eat anything you like over the Christmas period and still lose weight \u2013 what\u2019s not to love?</p> <p><strong>How are you enjoying spending the month in Manchester?</strong><br>I adore Manchester. It\u2019s got fantastic places to eat and great nightlife. It\u2019s like a mini-London, except easy to get around. I\u2019ve spent lots of time here with <em>Annie</em>, <em>Sister Act</em> and the <em>Strictly</em> tour. I directed the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony here too.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re virtually Mancunian.</strong><br>Not just virtually. Ashton-under-Lyne is where my great-great-great-grandfather was born, so I am sort of Mancunian. You can probably tell by my accent [laughs]. When I did [BBC genealogy series] <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0588xt1\" title=\"\"><em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em></a>, we discovered that my ancestors came from up north. There was even a champion clog-dancer in the family. Bizarre, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p><strong>This is your 12th year doing panto. Are you booked up for next Christmas</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I\u2019m booked up for the next three, actually. Hopefully I\u2019ve got another three years in me! Next year it\u2019s <em>Cinderella</em> in Southampton. I\u2019m the Wicked Stepmother, obviously.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re also off on your first solo tour next year, titled <em>All Balls </em></strong><strong><em>and Glitter</em>. What can audiences expect?</strong><br>I\u2019m really looking forward to it. I\u2019ll showcase songs from some of the musicals I\u2019ve been in, do a bit of dancing and tell some stories. I\u2019ll also share some backstage gossip because I\u2019m always opening my mouth. A bit too wide sometimes.</p> <p><strong>What did you think of the standard on <em>Strictly</em> this year?</strong><br>Really high \u2013 and unpredictable, too. I would\u2019ve put a big bet on Michelle Visage getting to the final but she went out in Blackpool. All it took was one weak routine.</p> <p><strong>Head judge </strong><strong>Shirley Ballas</strong><strong> said she received more online abuse this year than ever\u2026</strong><br>She can join my club, darling. I\u2019ve had that for 15 years. Everyone\u2019s entitled to their opinion, of course, but there\u2019s never any need for that. I tend to just look at how many followers trolls have got and it\u2019s usually about two, so please. You can\u2019t let it bother you.</p> <p><strong>There were lots of injuries this series. Is that because the dances are becoming more adventurous?</strong><br>That\u2019s part of it. Because the competition is so strong, they\u2019re pushing themselves further each year and trying harder to impress. But accidents can happen anytime. I\u2019ve ripped my calf muscle walking down stairs and slipped a disc leaning across the bed to pick up some washing, but I\u2019ve always been fine when I\u2019m dancing.</p> <p><strong>Injuries </strong><strong>led to </strong><strong>Kelvin Fletcher</strong><strong> being drafted in as a replacement and going on to win\u2026</strong><br>Well, hello. God works in mysterious ways. He\u2019s definitely a worthy winner. He came in at the last minute but had a strong work ethic, great temperament and he can really dance.</p> <p><strong>Is it true you developed your catchphrases on <em>Strictly</em> to save time?</strong><br>Yes, there\u2019s only two minutes for the judges\u2019 comments and Bruno [Tonioli] takes up a lot of that, so we\u2019re often pushed for time. If I\u2019m last to speak, they\u2019ll come to me and say I\u2019ve got literally 10 seconds, so it\u2019s difficult to do a full critique. Instead I\u2019ll just say one word, like fab-ew-lous or dis-ah-ster.</p> <p><strong>You sometimes say dancers have \u201cspatulistic\u201d hands. Is that a word you made up?</strong><br>Yes! Hands like spatulas. And arm-ography \u2013 that was one of mine that is now in the dictionary, hilariously.</p> <p><strong>Is it time that same-sex couples were introduced on <em>Strictly</em>?</strong><br>Yes, I\u2019ve been pushing for it for five years, so I\u2019m pleased it seems to be slowly happening. I\u2019m head judge on the Australian edition and we did it there this year with [drag queen] <a href=\"http://courtneyact.com/\" title=\"\">Courtney Act</a> and [pro dancer] <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshuakeefedancer/\" title=\"\">Josh Keefe</a>, who ended up coming second. I fully support the idea of two women or two men dancing together. You\u2019ve just got to choose who goes backwards, that\u2019s all.</p> <p><strong>You used to be a drag queen back in Australia. What do you think of drag being so fashionable now?</strong><br>It does seem to be having a moment. It certainly wasn\u2019t this mainstream in my day. I\u2019d finish a theatre show, then grab my trumpet, tap shoes and backing tapes, then go off to the clubs. There\u2019s a long history in the UK of comedy drag acts with almost clown-style makeup, but I always tried to fool everyone I was a woman. I was 6ft 5in in heels but one has fantasies when one is young.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re celebrating your 30th year in the UK. What changes have you seen?</strong><br>Margaret Thatcher was still in power when I moved here, so I\u2019ve seen huge changes politically. I lived in Camden Town [London] back then and loved how bohemian and grungey it was. Now it\u2019s all commercialised and touristy.

The tasks that you agree are important may include: childcare (finding babysitters for adult-only parties and shopping); home goods (decorations, the Christmas tree, stringing lights on your roof); hosting; memories and photos; storage, garage and seasonal items (locating the ornaments, the tree stand and the box of lights, the menorah or kinara and candles); travel, packing and unpacking; parents and in-laws; gifts; thank you notes; charity and good deeds; and so on. When you stop and write it down, the list can seem exhausting. And depending on your lifestyle and beliefs, yours may stretch even longer. But this visibility has value.</p> <p>Next, take an honest inventory of what you and your family most care about. What is important to you? Why are you doing what you do? External expectations? Family pressure? Or are you consciously choosing how you spend your time? If staying up past midnight to knit your children\u2019s names on to their stockings doesn\u2019t bring you joy, put down the needle and walk away. This Christmas, ditch the peer pressure and societal expectations and give yourself permission to do less.</p> <p>Once you and your partner have an honest discussion and determine which tasks and traditions are worth the effort, deal the cards. What cards will each of you hold and what does this responsibility entail from start to finish?</p> <p>This is where you must get granular or you run the risk of doubling up on efforts or unintentionally dropping the ball. As an example: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/17/kitchen-aide-making-first-ever-christmas-dinner-help\" title=\"\">Christmas dinner</a>. Who is planning it? You can both provide input, but only one person takes the lead. Agree on the menu based on preferences, dietary restrictions and budget. Establish a measurement of accountability.

      "body": "<p>For Manchester City there is hope, and its name is Kevin. It may take something miraculous for them to close their 11-point gap to the leaders, Liverpool, who have a game in hand, but there is something miraculous about Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s form. His performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/manchester-city-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Leicester on Saturday</a> was extraordinary, somehow furious and measured, a blur of activity that was also precisely targeted.</p> <p>Four shots, two on target. Seven key passes. Two successful dribbles. Two successful crosses. Five tackles made. The numbers give some indication of the scale of his performance but only some. De Bruyne is playing with such energy he seems to defy basic notions of how time and space function. You watch him go to close a defender down, follow the flight of the ball as it\u2019s hacked clear and suddenly there he is underneath it as it comes to earth again, an ability previously thought to be restricted to N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 in his two seasons of title-winning pomp and the Beano character Billy Whizz.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/21/manchester-city-rediscover-potency-but-leicester-challenge-is-not-finished\">Leicester\u2019s hero is Jonny Evans as Manchester City rediscover potency | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a rage about De Bruyne\u2019s play. For the most part that is controlled \u2013 although there was a strange moment just before the hour against Leicester when he was booked for dissent. His outburst at Mike Dean was seemingly born of his disbelief that neither Gabriel Jesus nor Raheem Sterling had managed to score after he had taken Kasper Schmeichel out of the game and rolled the ball across goal. However, it does seem as though he feels he has something to prove. Perhaps someone had told him he came only 12th in the Guardian\u2019s poll of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/ng-interactive/2019/dec/17/the-100-best-male-footballers-in-the-world-2019\" title=\"\">top 100 male players</a> of the year.</p> <p>But to focus on that fire and the ultra-commitment it seems to generate \u2013 even his own body could not keep up in the end and he was forced off in injury time with cramp \u2013 is to risk underestimating the intelligence of the movement. De Bruyne\u2019s notional starting position was, as usual, as the right-sided of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/18/the-question-kevin-de-bruyne-silva-free-roles\" title=\"\">City\u2019s pair of \u201cfree eights\u201d</a> but he was very much more advanced than Bernardo Silva on the other side. At times, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/15/kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city-arsenal\" title=\"\">at Arsenal the previous weekend</a>, he seemed almost to be playing as a No 10 just behind Gabriel Jesus, but his position was always to the right of centre, so he operated almost as an old-fashioned inside-right, although one with a far greater sense of his defensive responsibility than would have been traditional.</p> <p>The effect was two fold. From a defensive point of view, it meant De Bruyne was higher up the pitch and so the simple pass from Caglar Soyuncu out to Ben Chilwell became much riskier. Leicester went into the weekend as the most effective counterattacking side in the Premier League, while Manchester City had let in the third-highest proportion of their goals conceded to the counterattack. Jamie Vardy\u2019s strike on the break was entirely foreseeable and, as so much of Manchester United\u2019s threat had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">in the derby two weeks ago</a>, had come down the City right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9ec4149eb261fefe78baf8c8e5bed4393ed8874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9ec4149eb261fefe78baf8c8e5bed4393ed8874/0_173_3900_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man City v Leicester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin De Bruyne applies effective pressure on Caglar Soyuncu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Flathers/Manchester City FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That remains an area of concern and, while City were almost entirely in control, Vardy did have another similar opportunity five minutes after the goal.

      "bodyText": "For Manchester City there is hope, and its name is Kevin. It may take something miraculous for them to close their 11-point gap to the leaders, Liverpool, who have a game in hand, but there is something miraculous about Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s form. His performance against Leicester on Saturday was extraordinary, somehow furious and measured, a blur of activity that was also precisely targeted. Four shots, two on target. Seven key passes. Two successful dribbles. Two successful crosses. Five tackles made. The numbers give some indication of the scale of his performance but only some. De Bruyne is playing with such energy he seems to defy basic notions of how time and space function. You watch him go to close a defender down, follow the flight of the ball as it\u2019s hacked clear and suddenly there he is underneath it as it comes to earth again, an ability previously thought to be restricted to N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 in his two seasons of title-winning pomp and the Beano character Billy Whizz. There is a rage about De Bruyne\u2019s play. For the most part that is controlled \u2013 although there was a strange moment just before the hour against Leicester when he was booked for dissent. His outburst at Mike Dean was seemingly born of his disbelief that neither Gabriel Jesus nor Raheem Sterling had managed to score after he had taken Kasper Schmeichel out of the game and rolled the ball across goal. However, it does seem as though he feels he has something to prove. Perhaps someone had told him he came only 12th in the Guardian\u2019s poll of the top 100 male players of the year. But to focus on that fire and the ultra-commitment it seems to generate \u2013 even his own body could not keep up in the end and he was forced off in injury time with cramp \u2013 is to risk underestimating the intelligence of the movement. De Bruyne\u2019s notional starting position was, as usual, as the right-sided of City\u2019s pair of \u201cfree eights\u201d but he was very much more advanced than Bernardo Silva on the other side. At times, as at Arsenal the previous weekend, he seemed almost to be playing as a No 10 just behind Gabriel Jesus, but his position was always to the right of centre, so he operated almost as an old-fashioned inside-right, although one with a far greater sense of his defensive responsibility than would have been traditional. The effect was two fold. From a defensive point of view, it meant De Bruyne was higher up the pitch and so the simple pass from Caglar Soyuncu out to Ben Chilwell became much riskier. Leicester went into the weekend as the most effective counterattacking side in the Premier League, while Manchester City had let in the third-highest proportion of their goals conceded to the counterattack. Jamie Vardy\u2019s strike on the break was entirely foreseeable and, as so much of Manchester United\u2019s threat had in the derby two weeks ago, had come down the City right. That remains an area of concern and, while City were almost entirely in control, Vardy did have another similar opportunity five minutes after the goal. There is something still not quite right with how City are pressing and there are sure to be inquests about how Chilwell and Harvey Barnes found such space on that flank to spring the counter from which Vardy scored. De Bruyne\u2019s high starting position at least kept that threat to a minimum and those two Vardy chances were aberrations rather than part of a consistent stream. But De Bruyne\u2019s positioning also made a huge difference from an attacking point of view. That it is hard to define exactly where he was playing is not only a problem of classification. If there is no precise word for his position, it probably also means that it\u2019s not clear whose job it is to deal with him. Perhaps James Maddison could have dropped deeper but that is not really his game and risked leaving Vardy isolated. Perhaps Wilfred Ndidi could have shifted left but had he done so it would have left a central chasm between Leicester\u2019s defensive and midfield lines. In the end, Chilwell tried to pick him up but that meant abandoning Riyad Mahrez. Again and again in the first half, Benjamin Mendy picked out Mahrez in space with booming crossfield passes. The Algerian didn\u2019t just score the equaliser, he also had 10 shots \u2013 twice as many as every player put together in the game between Bournemouth and Burnley. Mahrez was excellent but that was to a large extent because De Bruyne created the space for him to be excellent. City\u2019s pursuit of Liverpool looks impossible but De Bruyne\u2019s form is also impossible. While he is fit and playing like this, the normal rules may not apply.",

Part of what makes the Ferrante novels so relatable is that many readers will have their own brilliant friend: someone they believe is cooler or cleverer than them and whom they thus regard with a potent mix of admiration and resentment. (Naturally, the friend thinks the same vice versa.) Adapting the play has given De Angelis time to consider the passion of women\u2019s friendships \u2013 and how formative this can be. \u201cFemale friends are as important as our lovers,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our development as women, because we\u2019re sort of moulding our identity on them, like a mirror.

They get to be jealous. (\u201cEnvy runs through that book so powerfully,\u201d says De Angelis of <em>My Brilliant Friend.</em>) They get to use their bodies for fun rather than for seduction.

The organisation behind the campaign is expanding into Germany, the US and Chile and is airing its first TV commercial after Christmas. \u201cOn Sunday, we finished with about 102,000 sign-ups and that is massively more than at the same point last year, 15 December, when we had 44,000 sign-ups \u2013 that\u2019s a 127% increase,\u201d Veganuary\u2019s Toni Vernelli said. It hopes to reach 350,000 by 1 January, up from 250,000 at the start of this year. The campaign is having an impact on restaurants and supermarkets, she said: \u201cThe number of companies getting in touch with us who are launching products is truly mind blowing. It does just seem to be everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer will have more than 100 vegan products including those in its Plant Kitchen range, with a No-Chicken Kiev, a tofu-based ToFish and Chips, as well as lunch pots and snacks. Aldi has a vegan seasonal range with 10 new items, from sandwiches and ready meals to ice-cream. Iceland will expand its vegan range in January, as will Waitrose, which says its vegan Christmas sales have risen by 40% \u2013 all the supermarkets made big additions to their Christmas ranges this year. Greggs, which stole the show last year with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/08/millions-of-britons-plan-meat-free-christmas-supermarket-vegan-range\" title=\"\">vegan sausage roll</a>, is expected to launch a follow-up and <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/burger-king-says-meatless-rebel-whopper-burger-coming-uk-11083711/\" title=\"\">Burger King\u2019s \u201crebel whopper\u201d</a> may reach the UK. Those products are aimed at flexitarians \u2013 people reducing meat in their diets \u2013 because though veganism seems to be growing, only about 600,000 people are fully committed to not eating animal products. About half the population are either not eating meat or actively reducing it, according to market researchers Mintel. It was described last week as a \u201cplant-based revolution\u201d by another analyst, Innova Market Insights.</p> <p>The competition \u2013 dairy and livestock farmers \u2013 are clearly concerned, although it\u2019s hard to tell exactly how much impact veganuary had last year. Initial reports from Kantar Worldpanel, which tracks consumer spending, showed that sales of meat remained fairly steady at the start of the year.</p> <p>But since then the firm <a href=\"https://www.kantarworldpanel.com/en/PR/Christmas-cheer-feels-a-little-early-for-MFP\" title=\"\">has charted a significant decline</a> in sales of beef, lamb and pork, although fish and chicken have grown, and a later Kantar study showed that 1.31m people gave up animal products in January 2019.</p> <p>Although many of the new products mimic meat, fish and cheese, from BBQ ribs and bleeding burgers to Camembert and smoked salmon, some vegan entrepreneurs believe they can persuade people to eat plant-based food that hasn\u2019t been manipulated.</p> <p>Alex Petrides set up Allplants with his brother Jonathan in 2017 to offer vegan-only food subscription boxes \u2013 frozen meals delivered to your door. \u201cWe don\u2019t use synthetic ingredients,\u201d Petrides said, \u201cbut we do use the language people are familiar with and can connect to.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s either a fad or a revolution, but whatever the future holds for veganism it\u2019s set for another flexitarian-fuelled boom next month. More than 100,000 people have already pledged to stick to a plant-based diet for Veganuary, double the number who took the plunge at the same time last year. The organisation behind the campaign is expanding into Germany, the US and Chile and is airing its first TV commercial after Christmas. \u201cOn Sunday, we finished with about 102,000 sign-ups and that is massively more than at the same point last year, 15 December, when we had 44,000 sign-ups \u2013 that\u2019s a 127% increase,\u201d Veganuary\u2019s Toni Vernelli said. It hopes to reach 350,000 by 1 January, up from 250,000 at the start of this year. The campaign is having an impact on restaurants and supermarkets, she said: \u201cThe number of companies getting in touch with us who are launching products is truly mind blowing. It does just seem to be everywhere.\u201d Marks &amp; Spencer will have more than 100 vegan products including those in its Plant Kitchen range, with a No-Chicken Kiev, a tofu-based ToFish and Chips, as well as lunch pots and snacks. Aldi has a vegan seasonal range with 10 new items, from sandwiches and ready meals to ice-cream. Iceland will expand its vegan range in January, as will Waitrose, which says its vegan Christmas sales have risen by 40% \u2013 all the supermarkets made big additions to their Christmas ranges this year. Greggs, which stole the show last year with its vegan sausage roll, is expected to launch a follow-up and Burger King\u2019s \u201crebel whopper\u201d may reach the UK. Those products are aimed at flexitarians \u2013 people reducing meat in their diets \u2013 because though veganism seems to be growing, only about 600,000 people are fully committed to not eating animal products. About half the population are either not eating meat or actively reducing it, according to market researchers Mintel. It was described last week as a \u201cplant-based revolution\u201d by another analyst, Innova Market Insights. The competition \u2013 dairy and livestock farmers \u2013 are clearly concerned, although it\u2019s hard to tell exactly how much impact veganuary had last year. Initial reports from Kantar Worldpanel, which tracks consumer spending, showed that sales of meat remained fairly steady at the start of the year. But since then the firm has charted a significant decline in sales of beef, lamb and pork, although fish and chicken have grown, and a later Kantar study showed that 1.31m people gave up animal products in January 2019. Although many of the new products mimic meat, fish and cheese, from BBQ ribs and bleeding burgers to Camembert and smoked salmon, some vegan entrepreneurs believe they can persuade people to eat plant-based food that hasn\u2019t been manipulated. Alex Petrides set up Allplants with his brother Jonathan in 2017 to offer vegan-only food subscription boxes \u2013 frozen meals delivered to your door. \u201cWe don\u2019t use synthetic ingredients,\u201d Petrides said, \u201cbut we do use the language people are familiar with and can connect to. We believe it\u2019s possible to create all the expressions that people have come to expect from food and all the emotional and nutritional qualities purely using plants.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 December 2019 to more accurately set out the range of vegan products available from Marks &amp; Spencer.",

And the past decade\u2019s worth of my multi-award-winning satirical standup sets seem like the sagely predictions of a seer.</p> <p>Sometimes I scare myself and I am a familiar face at the TK Maxx emergency underwear counter. Young activists in the Labour party recognise me as a doom barometer, and tremble when they encounter me. I agreed to meet some of the optimistic hope vessels for a brain-storming session and suggested a fashionably minimalist Dalston bar called <a href=\"http://www.untitled-bar.com/about-location-test-1\" title=\"\">Untitled</a>, as if to satirise the youthful city-dwelling socialists\u2019 perceived cultural isolationism.</p> <p>In Workington, for example, pubs still have the names of actual things: <a href=\"https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/cumbria/the-henry-bessemer-workington\" title=\"\">the Henry Bessemer</a> is named after the inventor of the Bessemer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/Bessemer-process\" title=\"\">steel manufacturing</a> process; the Pack Horse is named after an actual horse that did actual work, exactly the kind of horse with genuine non-racist anxieties about foreign horses that is now deserting the Labour party in droves; and there\u2019s Vinnie\u2019s Bar, which is probably named after Vinnie Jones. Or Vinnie Vincent, who replaced Ace Frehley in Kiss.

      "bodyText": "And that is where we\u2019ll leave Sportwatch, alas. Enjoy the rest of your Sunday night. Even if it\u2019s an early start tomorrow I\u2019d recommend just watching the first five overs of Sixers v Heat to see if the home side can muster anything to match that crisp, powerful hitting from Lynn and Renshaw. A big day for Adam Scott who won just his second Australian PGA, closing nicely to finish two shots clear on the final day. A less positive day for his hometown, Adelaide, who picked up dual 2-1 losses in both the A-League and the W-League. A late Emily Condon goal not enough for the Lady Reds\u2019 first points of the season, while Ben Halloran\u2019s super strike wasn\u2019t enough to cancel out Kye Rowles and Milan Duric\u2019s goals. Haris Rauf\u2019s five-wicket haul the headline act as Melbourne Stars maintained their two-from-two start to the campaign. And that\u2019s Sportwatch! It\u2019s a big slash outside off from Renshaw and he finds the rope. Then he goes the other side and that\u2019s fifty! Impressive knock. Off just 36 balls. Wasn\u2019t this guy a Test opener? Curran pushes one wide, but it\u2019s too far and he has to bowl again. And now Renshaw\u2019s gone straight down the ground for six! What a final over he\u2019s having. And that\u2019s the end of innings. A record-equalling 15 sixes from that innings. Good luck chasing that, Sixers. Big Bash - Heat 4/191 (19), Renshaw 43*, Cutting 9* Second ball, and crunch! Beautifully struck six from Cutting there. Ben Dwarshuis left feeling nauseous as that one flies back over his head. He tries the leg cutter on Renshaw, but he flicks it off the legs for another boundary. Good over for the Heat - can they bring up the 200? Big Bash - Heat 4/177 (18), Renshaw 37*, Cutting 1* A key wicket for the Sixers, as Peirson holes out. Renshaw almost follows him with a big top edge, but the fielder can\u2019t quite reel it in. Next ball he crunches a four just to add insult to injury. And one of the most unlikely sporting stories of the year is unfolding in London where Fallon Sherrock is breaking new ground for women in darts. I have just proved that we [women] can beat anyone. I have beaten two of the best players in the world. If that doesn\u2019t show that women can play darts, I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d Staying with cricket, and a little bit of war of words emerging ahead of the Boxing Day Test between Australia and New Zealand, with mention of the hated \u201cB word\u201d coming out of camp. The fuse has been lit. Big Bash - Heat 3/162 (16), Renshaw 29*, Peirson 20* Renshaw fires a gorgeous leg side six off Tom Curran. A hint of future Ashes rivalry there? A decent over - they need a few more 10-10+ overs here to really consolidate that opening. It does look a good pitch, so who knows what the Sixers can make of it. Big Bash - Heat 3/145 (14), Renshaw 20*, Peirson 14* So, after that early unbelievable Lynn innings, this feels almost glacial. It\u2019s 32 off 27, the partnership though, so a decent period of steadying. They need to lift the tempo now though if they want to really capitalise off that blistering first 10 overs. There\u2019s the whistle, and what elation around Gosford stadium! It\u2019s been a summer from hell inland of the Coast, but for one evening at least, minds can be taken off the bushfires and celebrate a bright spot in the A-League. Huge win for the Mariners, and they leapfrog both rivals Newcastle Jets and Brisbane Roar on the table. A-League - 90 min: It\u2019s five minutes added on, to the groans of the home fans. Strain looks to head an effort goalwards, but it doesn\u2019t trouble the \u2018keeper. Simon earns a foul from a push in the back from Elsey. That\u2019s what he gives you - a big aerial presence, with an even bigger heart. Always a nuisance. Big Bash - Heat 3/113 (9.4), Lynn 94, Renshaw 3* And there it is!! Can you believe it - having put on an absolute masterclass, Lynn has holed out in the deep six shy of his century, Abbott claims it off the bowling of Manenti. 94 off 35 balls. Four fours and ELEVEN sixes. And all inside 10 overs. You\u2019d hope the Heat can steer it home from here, because anything less than a big win here would be a travesty. Chris Lynn, take a bow. A-League - 87 min: It\u2019s getting nervous around Gosford. Another incredible stat from match commentary - it\u2019s been four seasons since the Mariners won back-to-back home games. FOUR. They\u2019re just a few minutes (plus added time) away from doing so. No Ospeth, McGree or Blackwood for Adelaide through injury - which it must be said does limit their attacking options. A-League - 82 min: And as so often happens, as one team chases a match, the other gets chances at the other end. Mariners don\u2019t finish though, as Murray and Jair fail to connect with each other. Now it\u2019s Stajcic emptying his bench. Silvera comes on for Duric, Fox replaces the tiring Miller, and club captain Matt Simon comes on for Jair. Look for him to put himself about and to give this inexperienced Mariners XI a little, well, you won\u2019t say calmer head, but perhaps older head? Big Bash - Heat 2/90 (7.2), Lynn 74*, Renshaw 0* We\u2019ll they\u2019ve got the wicket, the Sixers - but it\u2019s not the one they wanted! Heazlett goes for 10 - he was desperately unlucky as his leg spun out of the crease and he was stumped after the ball ricocheted off the legs of the wicketkeeper Phillipe. Lynn 74 off 27 balls. 8 sixes, and he\u2019s striking at 267%. A-League - 77 min: Mariners are dropping deep, looking to protect their slim lead, and don\u2019t look away - the Reds are coming. Halloran goes to ground inside the box - was there a touch from the trailing leg of Oar? VAR lets it be. Brooks now looks to drive through the heart of the Mariners defence, but they scramble it clear. A-League - 73 min: I\u2019m like a dog chasing two cars now - the last twenty minutes of this one are going to get very interesting as Adelaide trail Mariners 2-1 still, but meanwhile, Chris Lynn is batting like a man who\u2019s sold his soul in the Big Bash. Big Bash - Heat 1/73 (6), Heazlett 7*, Lynn 61* Good grief. He\u2019s just brought up his half century off just 21 balls, has Chris Lynn! The Sixers go back to their strike bowler, Abbott, but he gets the same treatment. That\u2019s a massive six - his sixth of the innings. He\u2019s hit 57 off the 59 run partnership here, Lynn. This is just incredible batting. And now he squeezes one over the slip cordon and runs it fine. That was one hell of a powerplay. Remarkable batting. A-League - 66 min: They\u2019re coming again, the Mariners. Alen Stajcic hasn\u2019t even gone to his bench, that\u2019s how happy he is with his XI, while Gertjan Verbeek has already made all three changes. Marrone, Maria and Troisi all given an early shower - Elsey, Kitto and Brooks the new men. And Lewis Miller becomes the first Mariners booked as he slides in late in the tackle. And if you missed the earlier story from the Australian PGA - a fine day for Adam Scott, and a return to winning ways: Big Bash - Heat 1/40 (4), Heazlett 4*, Lynn 33* Eep. They try the spinner Manenti, the Sixers, but he receives the same treatment as the quick. Chris Lynn is in a mood, ladies and gentlemen. He\u2019s whacked that one so nicely it\u2019s got stuck in the back of the scoreboard. They\u2019ve had to replace the ball! 33 off 14. Can he keep it up? A-League - 58 min: A cheeky curling effort from De Silva and it just drops onto the roof of the net! He had the Adelaide \u2018keeper Richards scrambling there. And now it\u2019s Jair through one-on-one, but he\u2019s ruled offside. This is better from the Mariners. Big Bash - Heat 1/27 (3), Heazlett 4*, Lynn 20* So, we\u2019re underway at the SCG and there\u2019s an early breakthrough for the home side. Abbott picks up opener Max Bryant with his first ball, but it only brings in the big-hitting Chris Lynn who right on cue thumps a massive six. And he\u2019s just gone again off Dwarshuis. Too short and the big man goes WHACK. A six, followed by a four. And then another shoulder-opener over point for two before a single. Thirteen off four. Yikes. The in-ground tannoy pumps out Maria Carey. All they want for Christmas here is Chris Lynn. 51 min: Michael Maria fouls Miller. He has to be careful, the man from Curacao. He was booked in the first half and the home side bay with frustration as he walks away, unpunished but for a freekick. A-League: Goal! Central Coast 2-1 Adelaide (Halloran) 46 min: Oh my! The home fans had hardly retaken their seats and woof. That was something special as well! A break in play from midfield, before it was played out to Ben Halloran. Sharp feet and an even better finish - he jinks inside Oar and curls an unstoppable effort into the top bins! No chance, Birighitti. That was a sumptuous finish. Throwbacks to his Socceroo days - a terrific strike. A-League: second half! 45 min: One change at the break for the Reds - Jordan Elsey comes in for Michael Marrone. You wonder if some harsh words were had in the sheds at the break? We\u2019re not far away from live Big Bash action. The Sixers have won the toss there and decided to put their visitors in first. We\u2019ll pick that up when there\u2019s developments of note. A-League: Central Coast 2-0 Adelaide - half-time 45 min: And what a difference that goal just before the break makes! The Reds were really building into that contest, but what a moment of individual brilliance from the experienced Serb, Duric, to turn the contest. If there\u2019s a club that\u2019s earned a break, it\u2019s this mob. Let\u2019s hope the fans can continue cheering after the break. A-League: Goal! Central Coast 2-0 Adelaide (Duric) 41 min: A first yellow of the contest, as Michael Maria goes into the book. It\u2019s a decent delivery from Oar which is well cleared, but from way down-town, up steps Milan Duric - oh my! He\u2019s thumped that from 30m. He\u2019s got a foot like a traction engine - what a goal!! 37 min: Nikola Mileusnic is starting to see a bit more ball down Adelaide\u2019s left, a danger sign for the home side. He had five goals last season, and he\u2019s already bagged three this campaign. Could he add to that today? 32 min: Halloran with another swift counter, but he drags his shot wide. And now they\u2019ve earned a corner out of the Mariners. It\u2019s definitely building for the Reds - a danger period for the home side. Only two of their six efforts have forced a save though - with a bit more sharpness they could be level, Adelaide. 27 min: Ben Halloran with another chance for the Reds, and he draws a fine save from Mark Birighitti. They\u2019re starting to work their way into this, Adelaide. The match commentary team has just dropped the stat - this is the fifth game in succession the Reds have conceded first, on the road. Do they need to tweak their travelling routine? A key period in the contest here - Mariners need to nip this momentum swing in the bud. 23 min: As mentioned, there has been a bit of cut and changing across this season already for Mariners coach, Stajcic. But you have to say as the experienced Kim regains full fitness, their midfield is one area where they\u2019re really looking good. NZ youth international Gianni Stensness - pinched from the Phoenix academy - has been hugely impressive, with Milan Duric also one of the better imports coming in this season. And speaking of football teams in Red. If you missed the global sporting news of the day, it\u2019s Liverpool\u2019s extra-time triumph over Flamengo in the final of the Club World Cup. Roberto Firmino broke the hearts of his compatriots from Flamengo with the decisive goal in extra time as Liverpool triumphed in the Club World Cup. The Brazil international missed two clear openings in normal time but finally secured a title that had eluded predecessors in 1981, 1984 and 2005. Klopp\u2019s team have achieved what no other in the club\u2019s illustrious history have managed before. Plus a little pay-back for defeat by the Brazilian club in the final 38 years ago. 17 min: A first sight of goals for the Reds, as Nathan Konstandopoulos breaks through the middle, but he skews his shot wide! A very good chance for the visitors, spurned. Gertjan Verbeek does not look best pleased with what\u2019s he\u2019s witnessed thus far from his side. With the games in hand they have, they could go second on the table. Not with showings like this, so far, mind. 12 min: And to confirm, it does appear Stajcic has shuffled his backline once again, with skipper Tommy Oar filling in at left back. Is that an adjustment to deal with the pace of Halloran and Al Hassan Toure? He did of course play there a fair bit in his earlier career. Danny De Silva finds himself open in the box - but he slips just as he is about to pull the trigger! He recovers, and works youngster Isaac Richards with the shot. An A-League debut for the Reds \u2018keeper, by the by, with Paul Izzo out injured. 8 min: So - what can Adelaide come up with now? It\u2019s a bright start for the home side - they\u2019ve definitely looked the sharper over the early passages. So, to those team lists - here\u2019s Central Coast: And Adelaide: A-League: Goal! Central Coast 1-0 Adelaide (Rowles) 4 min: It\u2019s a ball in from Tommy Oar, and they\u2019ve not dealt with it, the Reds. The ball pinballs around, it\u2019s back across from Miller, Marrone fails to clear well from the head, it falls to the central defender Kye Rowles, and he swivels on that and finishes as well as any striker! That was Alex Grant-esque (niche A-League non-headed defender goals crossover). What a start this for the Mariners! Just what the doctor ordered. Kick off! Central Coast v Adelaide 1 min: We\u2019re off! It\u2019s a slightly more attacking line up named by home coach, Alen Stajcic - I\u2019ll try and get you the starting XI\u2019s from both sides shortly. But first, would you believe it! Let\u2019s head straight to the A-League. The players are out on the pitch in Gosford, where there\u2019s a minute\u2019s applause for the memory of two firefighters killed during recent fires south of Sydney. Oh god, that\u2019s got me right in the feels. Shout out to my dad and thousands more around the nation, either volunteers or professionals, doing what they can for their communities during this national calamity. My full respect. Evening all! Cheers JP, a pleasure as always. Mighty! It\u2019s true, I did bring my steed in. And my valerian steel. Watch me wield it with rapier-like incision. About the A-League. Or the Big Bash. That will be the plat du jour over the next few hours - first up we travel to Gosford, for Central Coast Mariners v Adelaide United. And later on we\u2019ll have Sydney Sixers v Brisbane Heat. There\u2019s a bit of golf, basketball and plenty more flying round. Get in touch via email or twitter if there\u2019s something you\u2019d desperately love to get off your chest. Okie dokie, that\u2019s all from me for now. Time to handover to the mighty Richard Parkin to steer you through the rest of the day. W-League: Adelaide United 1-2 Canberra United - Canberra scored a late second through Hayley Taylor-Young to seal the three points away to Adelaide and cement their status in the top four. Emily Condon\u2019s injury-time strike made it a frantic few seconds towards the end but the home side remain pointless and rooted to the foot of the ladder. Aside from a mid-innings wobble with the bat Melbourne Stars dominated in Moe from start to finish. Marcus Stoinis led the way with the bat before a superb all-round bowling performance, highlighted by Haris Rauf\u2019s stunning five-for, sealed the deal. That was the kind of performance to make the rest of the competition sit up and take notice. Meredith can\u2019t do what Rose can and his massive mow in Moe is unsuccessful, Handscomb doing the business with quick gloves standing up. All over, not that there\u2019s been much doubt for over an hour. 15.4 over: Hurricanes 111-9 (Rose 32, Meredith 2) In a forlorn run-chase Rose has stood up to the task and he slog sweeps Zampa for his third six of the day to add some respectability to the final reckoning. 15th over: Hurricanes 103-9 (Rose 25, Meredith 1) Rauf ends with 5-27 from his four overs. Brilliant fast bowling. Rauf has been all raw pace today but the delivery after a searing bouncer he unfurls his first slower ball of the day - and it is executed to perfection - deceiving Ellis and sending the timbers rattling yet again. What a superb five-wicket performance. 14th over: Hurricanes 93-8 (Ellis 8, Rose 21) This partnership is restoring some pride to the Hurricanes. Another Rose six and four overthrows push Hobart towards three figures. Golf: Adam Scott has done it! 2019 Australian PGA champion. 13th over: Hurricanes 79-8 (Ellis 6, Rose 10) Rauf continues his brutal spell but despite tying Rose up in knots he can\u2019t snag his five-for. 12th over: Hurricanes 75-8 (Ellis 3, Rose 9) Finally something for Hobart to celebrate. Ellis and Rose work Zampa around for ones and twos before Rose slog sweeps for a very handsome six. The comeback is on! (Not really). Ooooof! Too fast, too straight, too good, from Haris Rauf. Tom Rogers Qais Ahmad is cleaned up as though he wasn\u2019t even stood at the crease. Emphatic from the young paceman. This has been a serious performance with the ball by the Stars. The competition is on notice - and with Dale Steyn still to come in! 11th over: Hurricanes 64-8 (Ellis 1) Ooooof! Too fast, too straight, too good, from Haris Rauf. Tom Rogers is cleaned up as though he wasn\u2019t even stood at the crease. Emphatic from the young paceman. This has been a serious performance with the ball by the Stars. The competition is on notice - and with Dale Steyn still to come in! The Stars return to pace and the slippery Haris Rauf strikes second ball. Wright cannot handle a bouncer, gloving a simple chance behind to Handscomb. 10th over: Hurricanes 61-5 (Wright 10, Rogers 1) Zampa is close to another wicket in the over with another googly beating the bat, but the LBW appeal against Wright is turned down despite very strong claims to the dismissal. The Stars are rampant. Zampa thinks he has Milenko with a wrong \u2018un first up but Milenko survives despite what looked to be an inside edge behind. It matters little because another wrong \u2018un leads to another inside edge, this time clipping the bails on its way through to Handscomb. Golf: Adam Scott is now two up with one to play in the Australian PGA. 9th over: Hurricanes 59-4 (Wright 9, Milenko 1) Hobart are in quicksand now. The required rate is pushing ten rpo and wickets are falling at regular intervals. The Stars are going to be a handful for any side this season with the quality and variety of their bowling attack. Another one gone! Lamichhane is too good for Jewell, beating the batsman\u2019s outside edge with a massive googly then inducing a top-edge from a sweep that flies into no-man\u2019s land in front of the legside sweeper but Hinchliffe makes a lot of ground before diving to take a magnificent catch. 8th over: Hurricanes 57-3 (Jewell 25, Wright 8) Melbourne Stars are down to spin it to win it and they have plenty of depth in the slow bowling department with Adam Zampa the third called upon this afternoon. He is tight for five deliveries but releases a loose sixth that Wright flicks to fine-leg for a now rare boundary. 7th over: Hurricanes 49-3 (Jewell 23, Wright 2) First look of the day at Sandeep Lamichhane and he concedes just three runs off the bat in an over full of guile. Maxwell may not have fired with the bat but his golden arm is doing the business for the Stars. David Miller is his latest victim, the big South African looked in great touch but he advanced to the Victorian, yorked himself, and suffered the ignominy of rattled timbers. 6th over: Hurricanes 45-3 (Jewell 20, Wright 1) Golf: Scott\u2019s lead over Hendry in the Australian PGA has been trimmed to just one stroke with two holes remaining. 5th over: Hurricanes 41-2 (Jewell 20, Miller 6) Ten off the over, helped by Miller striding out and finding the middle of his bat with ease, including a four through point. But Rauf will consider it a win for him with that dismissal of McDermott. Haris Rauf\u2019s first delivery is near enough 150kph but Ben McDermott is unfazed, presenting the full face of the bat to a length ball and watching it skip to the extra cover fence. But the bowler strikes back immediately! Short and straight and McDermott tries to pull but it\u2019s too quick and hits the bat up near the stickers and he can only shovel a catch to Dunk at midwicket. The Stars have gone bang-bang. 4th over: Hurricanes 31-1 (Jewell 20, McDermott 1) Big over for the Stars, curtailing Hobart\u2019s rapid start and snagging the most valuable wicket in the competition in the process. Maxwell keeps himself on - and what a good decision that is! A frankly rubbish delivery - short and on the batsman\u2019s hip - is whipped by D\u2019Arcy Short straight to Worrall at square-leg. A gift of a dismissal for the Stars, just as the TV boys were explaining how Short averages 70+ in wins and just teens in defeats. Is that an omen? 3rd over: Hurricanes 28-0 (Short 8, Jewell 19) Another four for Jewell and it\u2019s a whipcrack though cover that makes that sweet \u201cclack\u201d sound off the bat. Four more runs follow soon after with a backfoot drive that pierces the ring, and then another four through the offside, this one smoked Warner-like, all arms and hands through the line of the ball. Hobart are flying. Golf: Adam Scott has made his move. He\u2019s now two shots clear with just three holes left to play. 2nd over: Hurricanes 13-0 (Short 7, Jewell 6) Glenn Maxwell is an unlikely new ball bowler but he fashions half-chances against both batsmen in a rapid over. The ball with the most incident saw Jewell earn his first boundary of the day with a drive that just bounced in front of the diving mid-on. 1st over: Hurricanes 5-0 (Short 5, Jewell 0) Bosh, have some of that! Daniel Worrall\u2019s first delivery is line and length and D\u2019Arcy Short just caresses it through the covers for four. The bowler fights back well though, conceding just a single from the following five balls by bowling full and wide. BBL: The Hurricanes run-chase is ready to go. W-League: 10 mins: Adelaide United 0-1 Canberra United - There\u2019s been a goal in the W-League with Canberra United taking an early lead away to Adelaide United. Leena Khamis with a tidy finish. Golf: The Australian PGA is hotting up. After 14 holes of the final round Michael Hendry and Adam Scott are tied for the lead on 12 under with Wade Ormsby one stroke further back. The title looks to be between that trio at this late stage. Yet another delicately poised BBL contest at the halfway stage with Melbourne Stars posting about par at Moe, a total they would have expected to exceed when they were 81-0 after ten overs. 20th over: Stars 163-4 (Stoinis 81, Cartwright 13) Ellis is going to have a handy career in T20 cricket. He is a bowler full of variations and nerves of steel. With Stoinis on the charge he goes through his bag of tricks to go dot, dot, two... and then - oh dear - letting slip a loose full toss that is hammered for six. He shows excellent grit to bounce back with dot, one. 19th over: Stars 153-4 (Stoinis 72, Cartwright 13) Rogers returns and he has the misfortune to concede the first boundary in an age, Stoinis muscling a yorker straight down the ground. It gets even worse when Cartwright finally finds the middle of his bat, launching a massive mid-iron high over long-on. The Stars finally gathering some late momentum. 18th over: Stars 139-4 (Stoinis 65, Cartwright 6) In their opening match the Stars left a stack of runs out on the field because they failed to get Maxwell on strike often enough, and they\u2019re doing the same again only this time with Stoinis. Cartwright scores only one run from the opening three balls of Ellis\u2019 over and by the time the set batsman is facing he\u2019s lost all timing. It\u2019s now over 30 deliveries since Melbourne\u2019s last boundary. Credit to Hobart for sticking in when the game was running away from them, but this has been poor game management from Melbourne. 17th over: Stars 136-4 (Stoinis 64, Cartwright 4) A terrific end to a superb spell from Riley Meredith. He is a quick, unpredictable, wicket-taking weapon. Another over without a boundary for the decelerating Stars leaves the young paceman with figures of 3/27. 16th over: Stars 132-4 (Stoinis 62, Cartwright 2) The flurry of wickets has reined the Stars in and brought out a more circumspect side to Stoinis. Qais\u2019 final over goes for just five. 15th over: Stars 127-4 (Stoinis 59) Peter Handscomb comes and goes in the blink of an eye. A couple of nicely timed shots suggest the elegant right-hander is on for a decent knock but he misjudges a full straight one from the pacy Meredith - that keeps a touch low - and he is unceremoniously castled. Maxwell\u2019s cameo is over! Meredith\u2019s radar is off at the start of his over and after slinging a wide down the legside he throws one well outside off that Maxwell slashes at, the ball traveling down to third man where Qais runs in and takes a terrific catch diving forward. The batter and umpires are unconvinced by the take but the third umpire is decisive and in favour of the fielder. Big moment in the match and a terrific intervention from Qais. 14th over: Stars 121-2 (Stoinis 57, Maxwell 2) Maxwell is fortunate to survive just one delivery. Qais throws out a wide one that the Stars skipper chases and sends a thick edge spiralling just wide of gully. Unperturbed he then reverse sweeps acrobatically - for a single. Qais Ahmad is back, which means he\u2019s spinning the ball into Ben Dunk\u2019s arc, which means another six over cow corner. But the bowler exacts his revenge! Dunk ends with 19 off 12 when he fails to pick the slider and the zing bails light up. Time for Maxwellball. 13th over: Stars 111-1 (Stoinis 55, Dunk 13) D\u2019Arcy Short is asked to stem the bleeding, and he does a fine job with his left-arm spin... until he lets himself down with a full toss from his final delivery that Dunk climbs into and sends flying way into the cheap seats. 12th over: Stars 101-1 (Stoinis 53, Dunk 5) Fresh from that spectacular catch Milenko comes on to bowl, but he is greeted by the firm blade of Marcus Stoinis who larrups the ball into the sightscreen for the day\u2019s second maximum then chops behind square on the offside for four. The Stars star then brings up his half-century with an insouciant drive over cover that demonstrated his forearms are as powerful as they look. He started slowly and he\u2019s received a couple of lives but Stoinis is now taking the game away from Hobart. Golf: New Zealand\u2019s Michael Hendry still leads the Australian PGA by one stroke through 11 holes. Adam Scott is alongside Nick Flanagan in joint second. 11th over: Stars 85-1 (Stoinis 38, Dunk 4) Ben Dunk surprisingly walks out at three (perhaps keeping the right-left combination going?) and the surprise is only reinforced by four dot balls, all while Glenn Maxwell waits in the dugout. But any pressure on Dunk is eased by yet another misfield gifting the Stars yet another cheap boundary. Hobart need a hero - and they\u2019ve found one - Simon Milenko flying through the air in the gully to snare a superb diving catch. Nic Maddinson got plenty of bat on a fast length delivery from Riley Meredith and it went like a missile to the right of Milenko but he flew and wrapped two big hands around it to secure a much needed breakthrough. 10th over: Stars 81-0 (Maddinson 40, Stoinis 38) ... and now a misfield on the legside boundary to gift Stoinis four. The Stars allrounder shouldn\u2019t be on strike, but he is, so what does he do? Swivels for a massive six, of course. At the halfway mark the Stars are in a superb position. 9.2 overs - Oh boy, another escape for Melbourne! Maddinson wanted a piece of Ellis and after missing a reverse sweep he is cleaned up comprehensively by a superb yorker. But the third umpire intervenes and calls a no-ball for the narrowest of front line indiscretions. Such a frustrating afternoon so far for Hobart. 9th over: Stars 69-0 (Maddinson 40, Stoinis 28) Stoinis is easing into his work now and he drives the day\u2019s first maximum with a clean loft over cover. He\u2019s fortunate to survive next ball but his thin edge off Qais is wide of the keeper and runs away for four more. 8th over: Stars 57-0 (Maddinson 39, Stoinis 17) Nathan Ellis is on to bowl and he opens with a gimme for Stoinis who whips a full toss off his pads for four. Trent Copeland on TV (who is excellent) explains how Ellis is well liked in Sydney grade cricket and possesses a range of slower balls in the manner of Ian Harvey. Next ball, a wobbly delivery so Harvey-like it could have been scripted. Golf: Meanwhile at Royal Pines... 7th over: Stars 50-0 (Maddinson 38, Stoinis 11) The exciting Qais Ahmad gets an early whirl and he deceives the out-of-sorts Stoinis with a tempting leggy before extracting a leading edge that lands safely. It\u2019s a totally different contest with Maddinson on strike though and his wristy reverse flick for four keeps the Stars moving forward. 6th over: Stars 43-0 (Maddinson 33, Stoinis 9) The Hurricanes have been brave, backing Rose in for a third over, and he continues to deliver, pinning both batsmen to the crease and exposing Stoinis\u2019 leaden-footed technique with the ball fired into his pads. Maddinson eventually breaks the shackles with a late cut for four but Rose and Hobart will be delighted with his figures of 0/12 from three powerplay overs. 5th over: Stars 38-0 (Maddinson 29, Stoinis 8) Riley Meredith is invited to send down his rapid right-armers but he\u2019s quickly despatched to the boundary by Maddinson, first pulled through mid-on, then carved over cover, and finally guided behind point. 4th over: Stars 25-0 (Maddinson 17, Stoinis 7) Good grief! Absolute shocker from the Hurricanes. Stoinis does not look comfortable against Rose this over and eventually slices a thick edge high towards point where two fielders converge - but neither goes for the catch. That should have been a dolly for Meredith or Qais but the ball tamely hit the turf. Two early let-offs for the Stars. 3rd over: Stars 22-0 (Maddinson 17, Stoinis 5) The Stars have come out all guns blazing, without a great deal of shots finding the middle of the bat. However, in Rogers\u2019 second over Maddinson does smoke a pull for four through midwicket then slashes four more high over gully. Melbourne clearly trying to take advantage of the hard ball and the powerplay on a surface expected to slow up later on. 2nd over: Stars 12-0 (Maddinson 8, Stoinis 4) Clive Rose shares the new ball and he beats Maddinson first up before tying the left-hander down with a couple of dots. A single brings Stoinis on strike for the first time today and he immediately drills a drive straight back to Rose who shells a low caught and bowled opportunity. Stoinis rubs salt into the wound by slog-sweeping a four. 1st over: Stars 7-0 (Maddinson 7, Stoinis 0) Nic Maddinson starts superbly, driving straight for a couple then square for four, but he throws the kitchen sink at the next three and either misses or mistimes a succession of awkward swipes before farming the strike with a dabbed single. Broadly line and length from Rogers with the ball. Nothing to report in the air or off the pitch at this stage. BBL: Marcus Stoinis and Nic Maddinson are out in the middle for the Stars, Tom Rogers has the ball for the Hurricanes. We\u2019ll be underway shortly. BBL: Back to Moe, where Dale Steyn has just told Channel Seven he probably could have debuted for the Stars today, but the South African paceman remains sidelined for the time being. Golf: Meanwhile over at the Australia PGA, Adam Scott has just dropped a shot to create a logjam at the top of the leaderboard heading into the closing stages at Royal Pines. Stars win the flip and will bat first. Green Melbourne are unchanged from the side that impressed against Brisbane Heat on the Gold Coast. Hobart make two changes from the XI that suffocated the Sixers in Alice Springs with George Bailey and James Faulkner making way for Mac Wright and Tom Rogers. Hello everybody and welcome to another busy Sunday Sportwatch. The first half of the day is going to focus on the BBL clash between the Stars and Hurricanes. Both are unbeaten at this early stage of the season and with Glenn Maxwell on display the unfamiliar surrounds of Moe in Victoria\u2019s east look set to host an entertaining contest. During the cricket we\u2019ll have updates on the W-League fixture between the Uniteds of Adelaide and Canberra. That one kicks off at 4pm. After 6pm Richard Parkin will take the reins and he\u2019ll have the A-League duel between Central Coast and Adelaide to report on, as well as the Sixers against the Heat in the BBL. In amongst all that we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the final round of the Australian PGA, checking in with how New Zealand are warming up for the Boxing Day Test, and plenty more besides.

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust, has a straightforward view about the way doctors and scientists tackled the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/13/spike-ebola-cases-alarms-health-officials-drc\" title=\"\">current Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>. \u201cIn four or five years, we have taken a disease that was absolutely terrifying and which had an enormously high death rate \u2013 more than 80% \u2013 and we have turned it, potentially, into something that is preventable and treatable.\u201d</p> <p>The fact this has been done in a nation in the middle of a civil war is \u201csimply miraculous\u201d, added Farrar, a world expert on emerging diseases. \u201cIt is a truly phenomenal achievement. If you do not celebrate that, you cannot celebrate anything else.\u201d</p> <p>However, there is a sting in the tail of Farrar\u2019s medical message. Yes, over the past four years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/ebola-now-curable-after-trials-of-drugs-in-drc-say-scientists\" title=\"\">science has developed diagnostics, drugs and vaccines</a> that are helping to halt Ebola. But major problems still lie ahead for many nations, including DRC, which try to deploy these treatments without continued international help \u2013 because they have such fragile health services. And that is true not just for Ebola but for entire health care systems which face continued challenges from TB, HIV, malaria and emerging diseases such as Dengue or Nipah or Mers. All of these could soon become major epidemics thanks to ecological changes taking place across the planet.</p> <p>Ebola was first identified in 1976 by researchers sent to investigate an ailment that was killing victims in a remote part of DRC. Blood taken from patients would not clot, and poured from wounds. Nurses treating patients were also dying. The team named the condition after the local Ebola river.</p> <p>\u201cWe now know Ebola is triggered by a virus \u2013 probably picked up from an infected bat or non-human primate \u2013 that causes blood vessels to leak,\u201d added Farrar. \u201cIt ends in organ failure and death.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"205d1cc09954024ddb54c884e07085d000de0199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/205d1cc09954024ddb54c884e07085d000de0199/0_429_6847_4108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Farrar, left, in action in DRC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Farrar, left, in action in DRC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsay Mackenzie/Who</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the next four decades, small-scale outbreaks occurred in central Africa but were contained by quarantining affected villages. Then in December 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/30/guinea-battles-spread-ebola-virus\" title=\"\">a young child was discovered to be infected in west Africa, in Guinea</a>, and because of the extensive movement of people in that area, the disease quickly spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Ebola became a disease of dense populations, killing more than 11,000 people between 2013 and 2016. A new threat to world health had emerged.</p> <p>\u201cThe transformation in the behaviour of Ebola came about because of alterations in the movements of humans, changes in human interactions with animals \u2013 which act as reservoirs of the virus \u2013 as well as changes in ecology and mass urganisaton,\u201d said Farrar.</p> <p>The west Africa outbreak was eventually contained but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/18/more-ebola-cases-confirmed-in-congolese-city-of-mbandaka\" title=\"\">two years later Ebola appeared again</a> in a major outbreak, this time back in central Africa in DRC in 2018. So far about 2,200 of the 3,500 infected have died. But although the epidemic is still not over, numbers of cases are stabilising .</p> <p>\u201cThe world came together and over the past four years we have developed two vaccines to protect against the disease and two drugs that treat those already infected.\u201d said Farrar.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can get to people and treat them within four days of them becoming infected, mortality will only be about 10%. A few years ago, it was more like 80%. And of course, vaccines stop you getting the disease in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Money for the development of these drugs and vaccines has come from the US, UK, Norway, WHO, the European Commission and charities such as the Wellcome Trust. Pharmaceutical firms including Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Regeneron have all provided important help as well.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition, all those who carried out Ebola studies in west Africa and in DRC have had to do so under the circumstances of extreme violence and fear, with healthcare colleagues being killed. It is a staggering, astonishing story,\u201d added Farrar.</p> <p>The success he sees in DRC over Ebola is important not just for that disease, he added. There are a number of other illnesses \u2013 including Lassa, Mers, Nipah, Marburg and Dengue \u2013 which have the potential to become widespread epidemics as a result of climate change or other ecological shifts \u2013 and changes in society \u2013 in Africa or Asia or Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThe lesson from Ebola is that for all these conditions we will need to create vaccines and treatments, where there are none today, over the next 10 years \u2013 and we are going to need them. Mers, Lassa and Dengue all have the potential to shift from relatively low infection rates to high ones just as Ebola did in response to ecological change, travel and urbanisation. The world is now very exposed.</p> <p>\u201cEbola shows we can respond, scientifically, to these threats. The real issue is to ensure drugs and vaccines reach those who need them. To do that we need to set up effective healthcare systems across the world. That will not be easy \u2013 but it is critical. It is an issue on which we should be judged. We will succeed, I believe.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust, has a straightforward view about the way doctors and scientists tackled the current Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \u201cIn four or five years, we have taken a disease that was absolutely terrifying and which had an enormously high death rate \u2013 more than 80% \u2013 and we have turned it, potentially, into something that is preventable and treatable.\u201d The fact this has been done in a nation in the middle of a civil war is \u201csimply miraculous\u201d, added Farrar, a world expert on emerging diseases. \u201cIt is a truly phenomenal achievement. If you do not celebrate that, you cannot celebrate anything else.\u201d However, there is a sting in the tail of Farrar\u2019s medical message. Yes, over the past four years science has developed diagnostics, drugs and vaccines that are helping to halt Ebola. But major problems still lie ahead for many nations, including DRC, which try to deploy these treatments without continued international help \u2013 because they have such fragile health services. And that is true not just for Ebola but for entire health care systems which face continued challenges from TB, HIV, malaria and emerging diseases such as Dengue or Nipah or Mers. All of these could soon become major epidemics thanks to ecological changes taking place across the planet. Ebola was first identified in 1976 by researchers sent to investigate an ailment that was killing victims in a remote part of DRC. Blood taken from patients would not clot, and poured from wounds. Nurses treating patients were also dying. The team named the condition after the local Ebola river. \u201cWe now know Ebola is triggered by a virus \u2013 probably picked up from an infected bat or non-human primate \u2013 that causes blood vessels to leak,\u201d added Farrar. \u201cIt ends in organ failure and death.\u201d For the next four decades, small-scale outbreaks occurred in central Africa but were contained by quarantining affected villages. Then in December 2013, a young child was discovered to be infected in west Africa, in Guinea, and because of the extensive movement of people in that area, the disease quickly spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Ebola became a disease of dense populations, killing more than 11,000 people between 2013 and 2016. A new threat to world health had emerged. \u201cThe transformation in the behaviour of Ebola came about because of alterations in the movements of humans, changes in human interactions with animals \u2013 which act as reservoirs of the virus \u2013 as well as changes in ecology and mass urganisaton,\u201d said Farrar. The west Africa outbreak was eventually contained but two years later Ebola appeared again in a major outbreak, this time back in central Africa in DRC in 2018. So far about 2,200 of the 3,500 infected have died. But although the epidemic is still not over, numbers of cases are stabilising . \u201cThe world came together and over the past four years we have developed two vaccines to protect against the disease and two drugs that treat those already infected.\u201d said Farrar. \u201cIf you can get to people and treat them within four days of them becoming infected, mortality will only be about 10%. A few years ago, it was more like 80%. And of course, vaccines stop you getting the disease in the first place.\u201d Money for the development of these drugs and vaccines has come from the US, UK, Norway, WHO, the European Commission and charities such as the Wellcome Trust. Pharmaceutical firms including Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Regeneron have all provided important help as well. \u201cIn addition, all those who carried out Ebola studies in west Africa and in DRC have had to do so under the circumstances of extreme violence and fear, with healthcare colleagues being killed. It is a staggering, astonishing story,\u201d added Farrar. The success he sees in DRC over Ebola is important not just for that disease, he added. There are a number of other illnesses \u2013 including Lassa, Mers, Nipah, Marburg and Dengue \u2013 which have the potential to become widespread epidemics as a result of climate change or other ecological shifts \u2013 and changes in society \u2013 in Africa or Asia or Europe. \u201cThe lesson from Ebola is that for all these conditions we will need to create vaccines and treatments, where there are none today, over the next 10 years \u2013 and we are going to need them. Mers, Lassa and Dengue all have the potential to shift from relatively low infection rates to high ones just as Ebola did in response to ecological change, travel and urbanisation. The world is now very exposed. \u201cEbola shows we can respond, scientifically, to these threats. The real issue is to ensure drugs and vaccines reach those who need them. To do that we need to set up effective healthcare systems across the world. That will not be easy \u2013 but it is critical. It is an issue on which we should be judged. We will succeed, I believe.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In 2009, at the end of the decade for which no better name than the \u201cnoughties\u201d was devised, a flurry of books appeared that attempted to make sense of the preceding 10 years. Most were overwhelmingly upbeat. Some bore signs that their final, more sober chapters had been late additions; tagged on at the end so as to acknowledge the elephant in the room \u2013 that the decade had ended in the most severe economic contraction since 1929.</p> <p>In a little over a week, a second nameless decade will come to an end and the 2020s will begin. The list of upcoming books about the past 10 years appears to be short. Journalists and cultural historians, the sort of people who tend to write such titles, are, it seems, as bewildered as everyone else; concussed by the political and cultural blast waves that detonated throughout the decade. Few are confident enough to think that, in their final moments, the 2010s can be neatly summed up in book form.</p> <p>Ninety years ago in the US, Frederick Lewis Allen, the editor-in-chief of Harper\u2019s Magazine, coined a term for histories of the recent past written in the immediate aftermath. He called the genre \u201cretrospective journalism\u201d and was himself the author of one of its classics. Only Yesterday, Allen\u2019s history of the 1920s, was published in 1931, having been written during the early stages of the Great Depression. It took its readers on a tour of a nation that no longer existed, the raucous, booming America of the \u201croaring 20s\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2010, people were still debating if Barack Obama\u2019s presidency meant America was becoming a 'post-racial society'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The one million Americans who bought Allen\u2019s extraordinarily successful book were able to time-travel back to those yearned-for days of wealth and hedonism, and in part the book was little more than nostalgic comfort food, eagerly consumed by people struggling through the depression years. But Allen also reflected on the inequality and the violence of a decade that ended with an even more emphatic economic shock than that of the 2000s.</p> <p>Today, <em>Only Yesterday</em> is a largely forgotten book but it could well stand as a template for the type of books we are going to need to help us make sense of the 2010s.</p> <p>Allen began the book by asking his readers to imagine that \u201ctime were suddenly to turn back\u201d, and they were to find themselves in the first years of the 1920s. In such circumstances, \u201cwhat would seem strange\u201d he asked?</p> <p>It\u2019s a question worth asking again, in the dying days of 2019, from which the first years of the 2010s seem as distant and as alien as the early 20s appeared to the readers of <em>Only Yesterday</em>.</p> <p>The inherent lament within Allen\u2019s title also feels apt in the last days of 2019 as it must have done in the early 1930s. After all, it was only yesterday that the great indictment against British politics was that it was dull and uninspiring. What concerned politicians and thinktanks back then was how disengaged from politics the public were becoming.</p> <p>Only yesterday Donald Trump was a reality TV star, Boris Johnson was the Tory\u2019s in-house joker, and Facebook was just a way of tracking down old friends, rather than an existential threat to western liberal democracy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5a9ecb5bf85d18bbec97d6dc0e39daae593a87c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5a9ecb5bf85d18bbec97d6dc0e39daae593a87c/0_136_4080_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson, London\u2019s mayor, stuck on a zipwire in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson, London\u2019s mayor, stuck on a zipwire in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only yesterday the prospect of Scottish independence seemed unlikely and that of a united Ireland utterly implausible.</p> <p>Only yesterday the Conservative and Unionist party regarded the maintenance of the union as a sacred duty, rather than something that might be surrendered in a political transaction to deliver another objective. Only yesterday we would have dismissed the idea that any single issue, particularly one that was merely the obsession of a tiny minority, could tear British society apart, rupture party loyalties and even damage familial bonds \u2013 how many of us are about to sit down to a fourth (and hopefully final) Christmas dinner eaten under a strictly enforced, seasonal ceasefire, a ban on any discussion of Brexit, to prevent inter-generational conflict from breaking out over the sprouts and turkey?</p> <p>Looking back just 10 years to 2010, it is difficult to understand how we got from there to here but it is easy to see why we are punch-drunk. Since the start of the 2010s we have had four elections, (2010, 2015, 2017, 2019), four prime ministers, seven governments and three referendums (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13297573\" title=\"\">Alternative Vote in 2011</a>, Scottish Independence in 2014 and Brexit in 2016). There have been five Conservative administrations just since the end of the coalition.</p> <p>Back in 2010, people were still debating if Barack Obama\u2019s presidency meant America was on the road to becoming a \u201cpost-racial society\u201d. Now, at the decade\u2019s close, we have become virtually anaesthetised to the fact that the current occupant of the White House feels able to describe <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/\" title=\"\">white supremacists as \u201cvery fine people\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0b8b0b52ac84e3e85fb4df6718fc0337ffa5856\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0b8b0b52ac84e3e85fb4df6718fc0337ffa5856/0_48_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US president Barack Obama prepares to deliver his State of the Union address in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US president Barack Obama prepares to deliver his State of the Union address in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Sloan/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, we were swept along by the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/12/17/143897126/the-arab-spring-a-year-of-revolution\" title=\"\">optimism of the Arab </a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/12/17/143897126/the-arab-spring-a-year-of-revolution\" title=\"\">spring</a>. In 2019, we watched from the sidelines as President Bashar al-Assad and his backers set about crushing what little is left of the Syrian revolution. The first years of the 2010s seem like a foreign country, a calmer, safer, more stable place where they do things differently.</p> <p>Partitioning music, fashion and youth culture into decades just about works. Everyone knows what you mean if you talk about 60s music or 80s fashion.</p> <p>Politics and economics, however, refuse to arrange themselves neatly into decades for our convenience, and at times our determination to divide history up into 10-year blocks distorts our view.</p> <p>It is tempting, given the results of this month\u2019s election, to see the Conservative victory as an emphatic full stop, one that in the UK definitively marks the end of the 2010s.</p> <p>Future events will almost certainly complicate that picture. And it is easy to subconsciously catalogue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\" title=\"\">the crash of 2008</a>, and recession it sparked, as the last big event of the 2000s rather than the fundamental economic and political fact of the 2010s.</p> <p>Recessions and depressions, unlike financial crashes, are not events but processes. They take years to resolve, so just as the reverberations of the Wall Street crash were playing out in the lives of the people who read <em>Only Yesterday,</em> the consequences of 2008 and governmental responses to it were the great seismic forces rumbling under the surface of the 2010s.</p> <p>Perhaps the ultimate inequality in a decade defined by growing divergence in incomes and experience was how the effects of the crash and the great recession were so unequally distributed.</p> <p>For millions of people who lived through the 2010s, there was effectively no recovery from the crash. Their incomes never returned to pre-2008 levels.</p> <p>The austerity policies of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ca653f0-e445-11e4-9039-00144feab7de\" title=\"\">Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition</a>, which came to power just five months after the start of the decade, made things worse. As did the increasing casualisation of the labour market.</p> <p>The zero-hours uberisation of employment seemed, in some parts of the country, to turn most jobs into McJobs, not just low paid but insecure in ways that a Victorian dockworker could relate to. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97f55622693c2c664515739dfda0d67f28633e40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97f55622693c2c664515739dfda0d67f28633e40/0_193_5784_3470/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of London\u2019s homeless beds down in a doorway on election night 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of London\u2019s thousands of homeless people beds down in a doorway on election night 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, homelessness, which was far less common in 2010, increased by 80%, more according to some calculations, in the years since the coalition came to power. Tents and sleeping bags on the streets and in shop doorways became one of the emblems of the decade.</p> <p>In parts of the UK, the combination of recession, austerity and long-term under-investment resulted in these places being seen as \u201cleft behind\u201d, one of the new terms of the late 2010s.</p> <p>Little surprise then that so many people were in the market for a new type of politics.</p> <p>Only yesterday, populism was a term mainly encountered by history students doing courses on the 20th century. Ten years on and Trump has tested most of America\u2019s \u201cchecks and balances\u201d to near destruction. And he is just one figure among a global axis of nationalist leaders who emerged in the 2010s. In 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan became president of Turkey, the same year Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party came to power in India. The 2010s ended with Jair Bolsonaro joining the club as president of Brazil.</p> <p>European politics seems similarly transformed. In 2010, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) didn\u2019t exist. In the federal elections of 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/24/germany-elections-afd-europe-immigration-merkel-radical-right\" title=\"\">the far-right party won</a> 12.6% of the vote and 94 seats in the Bundestag.</p> <p>Here, the decade began with Ukip obtaining just 3.1% of the vote in the 2010 election. It ends with an election in which the Brexit party tail was able to wag the dog of Conservative party policy.</p> <p>The politics of extremes tapped into deepening insecurity, and was enabled by disarray on the left, but it metastasised through technologies whose full potential we had not fully appreciated in 2010.</p> <p>Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, we were still being told in 2010 that the web and social media had brought us to the threshold of a new and almost utopian society.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The technology used by demonstrators worked just as well when placed in the hands of autocrats and state security forces</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The analogue autocrats of the world would be toppled in \u201cTwitter Revolutions\u201d led by demonstrators who coordinated their marches and their protests using Facebook and Twitter.</p> <p>In 2011, this sort of delusional optimism inflected much of the reporting of the Arab spring. For a few months, North Africa and the Middle East were viewed by cyber-utopianists as vast field laboratories in which the democratising and revolutionary potential of social media was to be empirically demonstrated.</p> <p>The facts on the ground, however, always suggested otherwise. Any delusions that the web represents an irresistible force for democratisation, any suggestion that the new technology was by its very nature on the side of liberal democracy withered to dust over these past 10 years.</p> <p>Not only was the role of Twitter and Facebook in the Arab spring enormously exaggerated, it was demonstrated, later in the 2010s, that the new technology used by demonstrators worked just as well when placed in the hands of autocrats and state security forces.</p> <p>The hit movie of 2010 was Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher\u2019s Oscar-winning biopic <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/\" title=\"\">The Social Network</a></em>, which dramatised the troubled relationships between the founders of Facebook. What in 2010 seemed like a strangely dark take on a then celebrated phenomenon feels in 2019 like a prescient foreshadowing of a decade that was to come \u2013 a decade that ended with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica</a>, Putin\u2019s troll armies and Mark Zuckerberg called to appear before a congressional committee to defend his company.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8cb60506392a8f6fc0abf15387a2372e2cf186e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8cb60506392a8f6fc0abf15387a2372e2cf186e/170_370_2662_1597/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg waits to testify before a Senate committee in 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica revelations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg about to testify before a Senate committee in 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica revelations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To round the 2010s off perfectly, Sorkin earlier this year wrote an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/opinion/aaron-sorkin-mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html\" title=\"\">open letter to Zuckerberg</a> in which he condemned Facebook\u2019s refusal to fact-check political advertisements, a policy that Sorkin said led to \u201ccrazy lies pumped into the water supply that corrupt the most important decisions we make together\u201d.</p> <p>We enter the 2020s free from any delusions about social media as the ally of democracy.

      "bodyText": "In 2009, at the end of the decade for which no better name than the \u201cnoughties\u201d was devised, a flurry of books appeared that attempted to make sense of the preceding 10 years. Most were overwhelmingly upbeat. Some bore signs that their final, more sober chapters had been late additions; tagged on at the end so as to acknowledge the elephant in the room \u2013 that the decade had ended in the most severe economic contraction since 1929. In a little over a week, a second nameless decade will come to an end and the 2020s will begin. The list of upcoming books about the past 10 years appears to be short. Journalists and cultural historians, the sort of people who tend to write such titles, are, it seems, as bewildered as everyone else; concussed by the political and cultural blast waves that detonated throughout the decade. Few are confident enough to think that, in their final moments, the 2010s can be neatly summed up in book form. Ninety years ago in the US, Frederick Lewis Allen, the editor-in-chief of Harper\u2019s Magazine, coined a term for histories of the recent past written in the immediate aftermath. He called the genre \u201cretrospective journalism\u201d and was himself the author of one of its classics. Only Yesterday, Allen\u2019s history of the 1920s, was published in 1931, having been written during the early stages of the Great Depression. It took its readers on a tour of a nation that no longer existed, the raucous, booming America of the \u201croaring 20s\u201d. The one million Americans who bought Allen\u2019s extraordinarily successful book were able to time-travel back to those yearned-for days of wealth and hedonism, and in part the book was little more than nostalgic comfort food, eagerly consumed by people struggling through the depression years. But Allen also reflected on the inequality and the violence of a decade that ended with an even more emphatic economic shock than that of the 2000s. Today, Only Yesterday is a largely forgotten book but it could well stand as a template for the type of books we are going to need to help us make sense of the 2010s. Allen began the book by asking his readers to imagine that \u201ctime were suddenly to turn back\u201d, and they were to find themselves in the first years of the 1920s. In such circumstances, \u201cwhat would seem strange\u201d he asked? It\u2019s a question worth asking again, in the dying days of 2019, from which the first years of the 2010s seem as distant and as alien as the early 20s appeared to the readers of Only Yesterday. The inherent lament within Allen\u2019s title also feels apt in the last days of 2019 as it must have done in the early 1930s. After all, it was only yesterday that the great indictment against British politics was that it was dull and uninspiring. What concerned politicians and thinktanks back then was how disengaged from politics the public were becoming. Only yesterday Donald Trump was a reality TV star, Boris Johnson was the Tory\u2019s in-house joker, and Facebook was just a way of tracking down old friends, rather than an existential threat to western liberal democracy. Only yesterday the prospect of Scottish independence seemed unlikely and that of a united Ireland utterly implausible. Only yesterday the Conservative and Unionist party regarded the maintenance of the union as a sacred duty, rather than something that might be surrendered in a political transaction to deliver another objective. Only yesterday we would have dismissed the idea that any single issue, particularly one that was merely the obsession of a tiny minority, could tear British society apart, rupture party loyalties and even damage familial bonds \u2013 how many of us are about to sit down to a fourth (and hopefully final) Christmas dinner eaten under a strictly enforced, seasonal ceasefire, a ban on any discussion of Brexit, to prevent inter-generational conflict from breaking out over the sprouts and turkey? Looking back just 10 years to 2010, it is difficult to understand how we got from there to here but it is easy to see why we are punch-drunk. Since the start of the 2010s we have had four elections, (2010, 2015, 2017, 2019), four prime ministers, seven governments and three referendums (Alternative Vote in 2011, Scottish Independence in 2014 and Brexit in 2016). There have been five Conservative administrations just since the end of the coalition. Back in 2010, people were still debating if Barack Obama\u2019s presidency meant America was on the road to becoming a \u201cpost-racial society\u201d. Now, at the decade\u2019s close, we have become virtually anaesthetised to the fact that the current occupant of the White House feels able to describe white supremacists as \u201cvery fine people\u201d. In 2011, we were swept along by the optimism of the Arab spring. In 2019, we watched from the sidelines as President Bashar al-Assad and his backers set about crushing what little is left of the Syrian revolution. The first years of the 2010s seem like a foreign country, a calmer, safer, more stable place where they do things differently. Partitioning music, fashion and youth culture into decades just about works. Everyone knows what you mean if you talk about 60s music or 80s fashion. Politics and economics, however, refuse to arrange themselves neatly into decades for our convenience, and at times our determination to divide history up into 10-year blocks distorts our view. It is tempting, given the results of this month\u2019s election, to see the Conservative victory as an emphatic full stop, one that in the UK definitively marks the end of the 2010s. Future events will almost certainly complicate that picture. And it is easy to subconsciously catalogue the crash of 2008, and recession it sparked, as the last big event of the 2000s rather than the fundamental economic and political fact of the 2010s. Recessions and depressions, unlike financial crashes, are not events but processes. They take years to resolve, so just as the reverberations of the Wall Street crash were playing out in the lives of the people who read Only Yesterday, the consequences of 2008 and governmental responses to it were the great seismic forces rumbling under the surface of the 2010s. Perhaps the ultimate inequality in a decade defined by growing divergence in incomes and experience was how the effects of the crash and the great recession were so unequally distributed. For millions of people who lived through the 2010s, there was effectively no recovery from the crash. Their incomes never returned to pre-2008 levels. The austerity policies of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, which came to power just five months after the start of the decade, made things worse. As did the increasing casualisation of the labour market. The zero-hours uberisation of employment seemed, in some parts of the country, to turn most jobs into McJobs, not just low paid but insecure in ways that a Victorian dockworker could relate to. Meanwhile, homelessness, which was far less common in 2010, increased by 80%, more according to some calculations, in the years since the coalition came to power. Tents and sleeping bags on the streets and in shop doorways became one of the emblems of the decade. In parts of the UK, the combination of recession, austerity and long-term under-investment resulted in these places being seen as \u201cleft behind\u201d, one of the new terms of the late 2010s. Little surprise then that so many people were in the market for a new type of politics. Only yesterday, populism was a term mainly encountered by history students doing courses on the 20th century. Ten years on and Trump has tested most of America\u2019s \u201cchecks and balances\u201d to near destruction. And he is just one figure among a global axis of nationalist leaders who emerged in the 2010s. In 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan became president of Turkey, the same year Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party came to power in India. The 2010s ended with Jair Bolsonaro joining the club as president of Brazil. European politics seems similarly transformed. In 2010, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) didn\u2019t exist. In the federal elections of 2017, the far-right party won 12.6% of the vote and 94 seats in the Bundestag. Here, the decade began with Ukip obtaining just 3.1% of the vote in the 2010 election. It ends with an election in which the Brexit party tail was able to wag the dog of Conservative party policy. The politics of extremes tapped into deepening insecurity, and was enabled by disarray on the left, but it metastasised through technologies whose full potential we had not fully appreciated in 2010. Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, we were still being told in 2010 that the web and social media had brought us to the threshold of a new and almost utopian society. The analogue autocrats of the world would be toppled in \u201cTwitter Revolutions\u201d led by demonstrators who coordinated their marches and their protests using Facebook and Twitter. In 2011, this sort of delusional optimism inflected much of the reporting of the Arab spring. For a few months, North Africa and the Middle East were viewed by cyber-utopianists as vast field laboratories in which the democratising and revolutionary potential of social media was to be empirically demonstrated. The facts on the ground, however, always suggested otherwise. Any delusions that the web represents an irresistible force for democratisation, any suggestion that the new technology was by its very nature on the side of liberal democracy withered to dust over these past 10 years. Not only was the role of Twitter and Facebook in the Arab spring enormously exaggerated, it was demonstrated, later in the 2010s, that the new technology used by demonstrators worked just as well when placed in the hands of autocrats and state security forces. The hit movie of 2010 was Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher\u2019s Oscar-winning biopic The Social Network, which dramatised the troubled relationships between the founders of Facebook. What in 2010 seemed like a strangely dark take on a then celebrated phenomenon feels in 2019 like a prescient foreshadowing of a decade that was to come \u2013 a decade that ended with Cambridge Analytica, Putin\u2019s troll armies and Mark Zuckerberg called to appear before a congressional committee to defend his company. To round the 2010s off perfectly, Sorkin earlier this year wrote an open letter to Zuckerberg in which he condemned Facebook\u2019s refusal to fact-check political advertisements, a policy that Sorkin said led to \u201ccrazy lies pumped into the water supply that corrupt the most important decisions we make together\u201d. We enter the 2020s free from any delusions about social media as the ally of democracy. Instead, we are asking a question that would have been unimaginable in 2010 \u2013 is social media, in its current form, actually inimical to the workings of liberal democracy? When the 2010s are too distant for retrospective journalism and are handed over to the historians, there is one key statistic that could determine their analysis. The decade might well come to be seen as one of history\u2019s pivotal periods, not because it was the most divisive or unstable \u2013 the 20th century alone has several decades that would be stronger contenders for those titles. Instead, the past 10 years might be most definitively marked as the decade in which the climate crisis reached a point of extreme urgency. The year ends with swaths of the Australian bush in flames and the Amazon blackened from earlier conflagrations. Everywhere are signs of ecological collapse, habitat loss, adaptive behaviours and mass extinction. Only yesterday we had an opportunity \u2013 perhaps our last \u2013 to change course. In the flurry of events and in the face of constant distraction, we let our attention be drawn elsewhere. That failure is one that future generations will struggle to understand, or forgive. OBSERVER WRITERS CHOOSE 10 THINGS THAT DEFINED THE DECADE TRANSPORT Electric bikes A decade ago, electric vehicles were poised to whisk us silently and smoothly around our cities, replacing dirty motors with a new generation of technologically sophisticated smart cars. In fact, the bottom fell out of the car market altogether. Sales dropped to pre-2008 levels as millennials turned their backs on cars, be they electric or petrol-powered. Instead, the electric bike came to represent a shift to healthier, more sustainable, low-tech, low-impact transport. Ebikes became a non-car solution to our car problems. The pundits were right: it\u2019s an electric vehicle, just with two wheels instead of four. Martin Love TV Game of Thrones HBO\u2019s adaptation of George RR Martin\u2019s bestselling fantasy series bestrode the global television landscape from 2011 to its end earlier this year. Along the way, it became the most illegally downloaded TV show of all time, a drama adored by presidents and rappers alike, which, in its first seasons at least, provided some of the biggest shocks ever seen on the small screen. It ended with more of a whimper than a bang thanks to a divisive final season. Sarah Hughes SCIENCE Graphene At the beginning of the decade, the 2010 Nobel physics prize was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov \u2018for ground-breaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene\u2019. Suddenly, everyone was talking about a material made of a single lattice layer of carbon atoms that had remarkable abilities to transmit heat and electricity while also being extremely strong. Suggested applications include improved camera sensors, DNA sequencing, gas sensing, material strengthening, and water desalination. To date, none of these ideas has been turned into devices but it took two centuries of work with silicon before engineers got the full potential out of that material. Robin McKie SPORT The fitness tracker This was the decade when we became obsessed with taking 10,000 steps a day.

These data-harvesting devices track our locations, our heart rates, our sleeping patterns and our exercise habits.

      "bodyText": "Disturbing scenes from the early life of Oliver Twist, Charles Dickens\u2019s orphaned \u201citem of mortality\u201d, are among the most familiar in English literature. They have become the basis for popular films, television dramas and a much-loved musical. But now a PhD student has identified a previously unknown source of inspiration for several of the most affecting elements in the novel, including the notorious underground world of Fagin, the seedy leader of a troop of young pickpockets. Those passages, according to Eva-Charlotta Mebius, a Swedish student of literature at University College London, bear a strong resemblance to factual reports written by a crusading Scottish journalist 35 years Dickens\u2019s senior: Robert Mudie. The two men shared a social cause: to shed light on the miserable lives of poor children in the city of London. Mebius said the seeds of Oliver\u2019s story were sown by a book that lay on Dickens\u2019s shelf at the time of his death and had come out the year before his Twist was first serialised \u2013 Mudie\u2019s London and Londoners of 1836. \u201cWhen I found the passages I was, of course, incredibly excited,\u201d Mebius, originally from Stockholm, told the Observer. \u201cI knew I would have to do a lot of work to connect Mudie with Dickens, but there were just so many similarities, both biographical and literary.

The academic and Dickens scholar Professor Malcolm Andrews added that, while there is no firm proof, the similarities Mebius has spotted \u201cbetween Dickens and Mudie in their detailed descriptions of London crime and poverty are very striking indeed, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if evidence came to light that Dickens had indeed drawn on Mudie\u201d. Mebius, 30, lays out her argument in an essay for The Dickensian, the journal of The International Dickens Fellowship, edited by Andrews. In it, she describes finding proof that Dickens had once owned the book, and then highlights the key resonant passages of Mudie\u2019s writing.

      "bodyText": "Mario Sandoval had been living in France for 14 years when he became a lecturer at the Institute of Latin American Studies (IHEAL) at the Sorbonne in Paris. The Argentinian security specialist was in his mid-40s, spoke good French and had recently obtained French citizenship. His credentials were impeccable \u2013 he\u2019d spent the previous five years teaching international relations at another Paris institute, the Universit\u00e9 Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e \u2013 and he soon became a valued asset at the Sorbonne. During his six years at the illustrious university, from 1999 to 2005, Sandoval regularly volunteered to screen student applicants and organized numerous seminars, bringing in outside experts to speak to his students. \u201cHe had an uncanny capacity to blend in. He would roll up his sleeves and get straight to work,\u201d said Carlos Quenan, a fellow Argentinian academic at the Sorbonne. \u201cI never received any particular complaint from staff or students about him.\u201d What Quenan and his colleagues at the Sorbonne did not know was that before arriving in France in 1985, Sandoval had allegedly been a notorious police torturer during Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship. Last Sunday, that past caught up with him: on Sunday, Sandoval, 66, was extradited to Argentina to face trial over the 1976 disappearance of Hern\u00e1n Abriata, an architecture student whose body has never been found. About 30,000 people died at the hands of Argentina\u2019s military, which targeted armed leftists but also non-violent opponents including journalists, intellectuals and human rights activists. Many were thrown drugged but still alive into the sea. In the dungeons of the regime, Sandoval was allegedly known as \u201cChurrasco\u201d \u2013 a play on words referring not only to his good looks (\u201cchurro\u201d is Argentinian slang for handsome) but also to his alleged skill with an electric cattle prod (a \u201cchurrasco\u201d is a barbecued steak). Political prisoners were routinely strapped to a metal bed frame and electrocuted in the basement of infamous navy mechanics school (Esma) in Buenos Aires, where Sandoval allegedly served \u2013 and where 5,000 people were tortured and killed. One of those victims is believed to be Abriata. At about 2pm on on 30 October 1976, a police officer escorted by soldiers arrived at the home of Abriata\u2019s parents, identifying himself as \u201cSandoval, from Federal Coordination\u201d (a police unit linked to kidnappings and murder). As Abriata was led away, \u201cSandoval took my husband\u2019s watch and handed it to me,\u201d his widow M\u00f3nica Dittmar told the press this week. \u201c\u2018To show you we don\u2019t steal anything,\u2019 he said.\u201d Abriata was never seen again, but at some point before his death, he managed to scrawl a message on a wall of his Esma cell: \u201cH.A. M\u00f3nica, I love you.\u201d The message was discovered many years later, after the return of democracy, and Dittmar testified that she recognized her husband\u2019s handwriting. Sandoval\u2019s alleged role during the military regime was first revealed in an 2007 article in Le Monde Diplomatique in 2007, two years after he left IHEAL. But the episode has left Sorbonne Nouvelle under a cloud: how could an alleged torturer have worked undetected at the a Latin American studies institute of a major French university? Sandoval\u2019s annually renewed contract was originally signed by the then head of the IHEAL, Jean-Michel Blanquer \u2013 now France\u2019s education minister. Blanquer has denied being aware of Sandoval\u2019s alleged role during the dictatorship. \u201cThis is severely traumatizing for us as an institution,\u201d says Olivier Compagnon, a contemporary history professor at the IHEAL, in a phone interview from Paris. Compagnon first met Sandoval in 2003, when the two academics taught a course together on Venezuela. \u201cWe met at a bar in Paris and very quickly we had a disagreement. He was very rightwing, very reactionary, but I didn\u2019t suspect anything deeper than that,\u201d he said. Compagnon never overcame his initial dislike of Sandoval, and refused to share another course with Sandoval the following year. In 2005 Sandoval\u2019s contract at the Sorbonne was not renewed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because we suspected anything,\u201d said Quenan. \u201cWe were just unhappy with the kind of classes he wanted to give, about armaments, security and other subjects that we didn\u2019t deem relevant for our students.\u201d The IHEAL is conducting an investigation to determine how Sandoval managed to become an external lecturer, and in a statement said that staff were \u201cvery pleased\u201d that he would face justice.",

      "body": "<p><strong>It\u2019s going to be</strong> party time in 2022, apparently. The government, I hear, is lining up Martin Green, who ran the very successful Hull City of Culture during 2017, to take charge of a four nations arts extravaganza with a budget of \u00a3120m. Our beloved leader, who likes to emphasise that he is not just PM but also minister for the union, wants a festival of the UK. Anybody would think that threats of Scottish independence and a united Ireland were in the ether\u2026?</p> <p>The 2022 Festival of the UK will be centred in Birmingham, which will also be hosting the Commonwealth Games, while the BBC, which will be celebrating (or commiserating) its centenary, will play its role with a raft of relevant programmes. (And hopefully not dancing to the tune of the government to appease those demanding its funding be switched to subscription.)</p> <p>I\u2019m in two minds about this cultural cornucopia. Good that the arts, design and creative industries will, Heineken-like, reach parts often starved. It worked before with Liverpool, European Capital of Culture in 2008, whose legacy is still lasting, and with Hull, though Derry has not fared so well after being City of Culture in 2013. My problem with this plan, aside from the danger of this government making it into a union flag-waving, post-Brexit jamboree, is its very vastness and non-specificity. The whole of the UK? What\u2019s the uniting force, arts-wise?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a16d01e89963acc9fd905124f985898d5525f999\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a16d01e89963acc9fd905124f985898d5525f999/0_0_2400_2407/997.jpg\" alt=\"Meera Syal by Jason Bell, 1 March 2002.\" width=\"997\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meera Syal by Jason Bell, 1 March 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Portrait Gallery London/\u00a9 Jason Bell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The National Portrait Gallery </strong>will itself be reaching out from mid-2020 until 2023, loaning about 300 works a year to galleries and museums, hospitals and schools. The reason for such largesse is that the NPG will be closed during this period for a massive refurbishment. Still, it\u2019s good to make these loans to places such as Bath, Newcastle, Edinburgh, and Belfast, as well as to National Trust properties. It will also be lending portraits of noted people to the towns with which they are most associated \u2013 like one of Meera Syal, who hails from the Black Country and who will visit Wolverhampton Art Gallery to see her portrait; or Florence Nightingale, whose picture will go to Derby\u2019s museum as her family came from nearby.</p> <p>I hear that about 400 NPG members have cancelled their annual subscriptions since the closure was announced in early November. About 1,250 have renewed though, presumably lured by the offer of a three-year membership for the cost of one. This will give them free or reduced price entry into some regional museums where the loans are heading. And before the NPG closes in June next year, the gallery will bow out with exhibitions of <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/exhibitions/2019/david-hockney-drawing-from-life/\" title=\"\">David Hockney drawings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/exhibitions/2019/cecil-beatons-bright-young-things/\" title=\"\">Cecil Beaton\u2019s photos of his Bright Young Things</a>.

Starring Sophie Cookson as Keeler and Ellie Bamber as Mandy Rice-Davies it is written by Amanda Coe, directed by Andrea Harkin, and has two female producers. This extraordinary 1960s story has previously centred on the men - Profumo in the movie <em>Scandal</em>, and then the pimping osteopath Stephen Ward in the eponymous 2013 musical.

Our beloved leader, who likes to emphasise that he is not just PM but also minister for the union, wants a festival of the UK. Anybody would think that threats of Scottish independence and a united Ireland were in the ether\u2026? The 2022 Festival of the UK will be centred in Birmingham, which will also be hosting the Commonwealth Games, while the BBC, which will be celebrating (or commiserating) its centenary, will play its role with a raft of relevant programmes. (And hopefully not dancing to the tune of the government to appease those demanding its funding be switched to subscription.) I\u2019m in two minds about this cultural cornucopia. Good that the arts, design and creative industries will, Heineken-like, reach parts often starved. It worked before with Liverpool, European Capital of Culture in 2008, whose legacy is still lasting, and with Hull, though Derry has not fared so well after being City of Culture in 2013. My problem with this plan, aside from the danger of this government making it into a union flag-waving, post-Brexit jamboree, is its very vastness and non-specificity. The whole of the UK? What\u2019s the uniting force, arts-wise? The National Portrait Gallery will itself be reaching out from mid-2020 until 2023, loaning about 300 works a year to galleries and museums, hospitals and schools. The reason for such largesse is that the NPG will be closed during this period for a massive refurbishment. Still, it\u2019s good to make these loans to places such as Bath, Newcastle, Edinburgh, and Belfast, as well as to National Trust properties. It will also be lending portraits of noted people to the towns with which they are most associated \u2013 like one of Meera Syal, who hails from the Black Country and who will visit Wolverhampton Art Gallery to see her portrait; or Florence Nightingale, whose picture will go to Derby\u2019s museum as her family came from nearby. I hear that about 400 NPG members have cancelled their annual subscriptions since the closure was announced in early November. About 1,250 have renewed though, presumably lured by the offer of a three-year membership for the cost of one. This will give them free or reduced price entry into some regional museums where the loans are heading. And before the NPG closes in June next year, the gallery will bow out with exhibitions of David Hockney drawings and Cecil Beaton\u2019s photos of his Bright Young Things. Some exit. Do watch The Trial of Christine Keeler, a six-part series on BBC One about the girlfriend of Tory politician John Profumo, starting on 29 December. Starring Sophie Cookson as Keeler and Ellie Bamber as Mandy Rice-Davies it is written by Amanda Coe, directed by Andrea Harkin, and has two female producers. This extraordinary 1960s story has previously centred on the men - Profumo in the movie Scandal, and then the pimping osteopath Stephen Ward in the eponymous 2013 musical. A welcome post- #MeToo take.",

He would, owing to his advanced age, resign, but would retain a living title, \u201cpope emeritus\u201d.</p> <p>Within weeks, the great doors of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican were sealed and the cardinals were drawn into conclave for the second time in less than a decade. When the doors opened again a few days later, the charismatic Jorge Bergoglio, who would take the name Francis, had been elected. The world, for the first time since the year 1415, had two living popes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So why did Benedict, the most traditional pope of the modern era, do the most untraditional thing imaginable?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reasons for Benedict\u2019s cataclysm became fodder for speculation. A pope, surely, must die on the job. He had to. Wasn\u2019t this an integral part of the job description? Not just tradition; it was virtually dogma. As the <em>Washington Post</em>, citing a theological expert, explained: \u201cMost modern popes have felt that resignation is unacceptable except in cases of an incurable or debilitating disease \u2013 that paternity, in the words of Paul IV, cannot be resigned.\u201d So why did Benedict, the most traditional pope of the modern era, do the most untraditional thing imaginable? (Poor health has usually been an asset to a pope, in that it re-enacts \u2013 for all to see \u2013 Christ\u2019s suffering on the cross.) And how could this ultra-conservative protector of the faith, guardian of doctrine, even contemplate doing so when, in all likelihood, he would be surrendering the chair of St Peter to the radical Bergoglio, a man so different from him, in character and views?</p> <p>In film and book, I tell the tale of an odd couple whose destinies converged and who influenced each other profoundly.</p> <p>Let us consider Francis first, or, as we first encounter him, Cardinal Bergoglio. A fun-loving Argentinian, on the surface a humble man, an extrovert, a simple dresser (he wore the same pair of black shoes for 20 years, wears a Swatch) and an on-off-on-again advocate of liberation theology, a Catholic movement that seeks to aid the poor and oppressed through direct involvement in political and civic affairs.

      "bodyText": "On 11 February 2013, a 600-year-old tradition was shattered: Pope Benedict XVI made a startling announcement. He would, owing to his advanced age, resign, but would retain a living title, \u201cpope emeritus\u201d. Within weeks, the great doors of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican were sealed and the cardinals were drawn into conclave for the second time in less than a decade. When the doors opened again a few days later, the charismatic Jorge Bergoglio, who would take the name Francis, had been elected. The world, for the first time since the year 1415, had two living popes. The reasons for Benedict\u2019s cataclysm became fodder for speculation. A pope, surely, must die on the job. He had to. Wasn\u2019t this an integral part of the job description? Not just tradition; it was virtually dogma. As the Washington Post, citing a theological expert, explained: \u201cMost modern popes have felt that resignation is unacceptable except in cases of an incurable or debilitating disease \u2013 that paternity, in the words of Paul IV, cannot be resigned.\u201d So why did Benedict, the most traditional pope of the modern era, do the most untraditional thing imaginable? (Poor health has usually been an asset to a pope, in that it re-enacts \u2013 for all to see \u2013 Christ\u2019s suffering on the cross.) And how could this ultra-conservative protector of the faith, guardian of doctrine, even contemplate doing so when, in all likelihood, he would be surrendering the chair of St Peter to the radical Bergoglio, a man so different from him, in character and views? In film and book, I tell the tale of an odd couple whose destinies converged and who influenced each other profoundly. Let us consider Francis first, or, as we first encounter him, Cardinal Bergoglio. A fun-loving Argentinian, on the surface a humble man, an extrovert, a simple dresser (he wore the same pair of black shoes for 20 years, wears a Swatch) and an on-off-on-again advocate of liberation theology, a Catholic movement that seeks to aid the poor and oppressed through direct involvement in political and civic affairs. He\u2019s a man with the common touch. A natural man of the people. Once had a girlfriend. Has worked as a bouncer at a tango club. An ardent fan of football. Benedict, the former Cardinal Josef Ratzinger, on the other hand, is an intellectual German, suspicious of humour. He\u2019s a luxury-savouring, somewhat dandyish introvert (he revived the papal tradition of red velvet slippers, wears a Rolex), who feels that the church\u2019s refusal to yield and change is its greatest strength and, indeed, the secret of its timeless durability. While sincere about his sacred duties, he completely lacks the common touch. A reclusive theologian who lacks in-the-field experience. Could not tell Arsenal from Real Madrid. Has never, to our knowledge, spoken a romantic word to another soul. The theme that arises from even a superficial study of both men is that of \u201csin\u201d, and more specifically of the grace and extra wisdom that comes if sinners can acknowledge their failings and put their sins behind them. How much wiser, how much more valuable as a future teacher and healer and guide, is the person who has a full, first-hand understanding of a particular human weakness or failing or problem, but who has then risen from this place of dark insight to see the true dimensions of this problem. Bergoglio openly labels himself a sinner, continually points out that this is not a mere turn of phrase. He has sinned. He goes even further, controversially stating that it is not enough to enact the ritual of confession of sins to a priest, with the penalty being nothing more than the repeating of a short prayer three times and a pledge to try to sin no more. No, instead one must take practical steps to atone for those sins in one\u2019s daily life, make real and deep changes.

      "bodyText": "Bedecked in gold lam\u00e9 and baubles, Julian Clary is firmly established as a Christmas beacon at the London Palladium. In this, Clary\u2019s fourth pantomime season at the prestigious venue, he has effectively become a permanent fixture: his face has just gone up on the theatre\u2019s \u201cwall of fame\u201d, alongside stars such as Judy Garland and Ken Dodd. But the performer and author, a man infamous for over-sharing for comic effect on stage, still has a few secrets hiding under his outlandish costume as the Ringmaster in Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Not only is Clary soon to play a serious theatrical role, starring opposite Matthew Kelly in a touring production of Ronald Harwood\u2019s esteemed drama The Dresser, he has also written a stage show of his own, based on his successful series of children\u2019s books, The Bolds. \u201cI find as I get older I\u2019ve got to challenge myself, otherwise life gets too easy,\u201d Clary told the Observer. \u201cI could get bored if I didn\u2019t keep doing different things. So I like saying to myself, \u2018I wonder if I could do that?\u2019 and then throwing down the gauntlet. It is not to do with bravery; it is just to do with stimulating myself.\u201d The five-week run of Goldilocks, in which Clary co-stars with Gary Wilmot, Paul Zerdin, Paul O\u2019Grady and Nigel Havers, forms a break in a big national tour of his one-man stand-up show, Born to Mince, which resumes in April. \u201cI did my tour, then I wrote the latest Bolds book over the summer, finishing it about a week before I started work on the panto,\u201d said Clary. \u201cI just compartmentalise. My brain couldn\u2019t cope with it any other way, because they are such different activities. And I like the contrast. I like being applauded on stage, but I also like being locked away at home using a different part of the brain \u2013 my inner life and all that sort of carry-on.\u201d Perhaps the pantomime star\u2019s most surprising admission, however, is that he does not much like Christmas.

In Victoria, conditions for the fires in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland eased, with watch and act warnings in place for a fire in Tambo Crossing, Wattle Creek and Stirling, and another at Marthavale-Barmouth Spur. Fires burning in the state since 21 November flared up on Saturday after the cool change brought with it dry lightning strikes. Smoke from the NSW fires made its way up to Queensland, where another day of severe fire danger was forecast for Monday. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, returned to Australia from his holiday in Hawaii on Saturday night. Morrison spent Sunday touring the RFS headquarters in NSW, before visiting an evacuation centre in Picton and an emergency fire control centre in Wollondilly. The prime minister met the widows of the two firefighters, Geoff Keaton and Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, who died in a truck rollover last week. At a press conference on Sunday morning, Morrison apologised to people who were upset for him going on holiday during the bushfire crisis. He said the secrecy surrounding the trip was because it was family leave, and tried to draw a line under the criticism of his decision to take the trip. \u201cThe time for that discussion is over. We need to focus on what is going out there today. Let me finish by saying this \u2026 it is time to be kind to each other. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, it is not a time for point scoring,\u201d he said. The prime minister acknowledging that climate change was having an impact on weather events, but indicated there would be no change to government policy, including Australia\u2019s controversial policy of using carryover credits for meeting targets in the Paris agreement. Morrison said a council of Australian governments meeting would be convened in March to discuss the response to the fires and how to plan more effectively. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, praised emergency management minister David Littleproud for providing updates to him about the bushfires, but said he had not been able to secure a tour of the RFS headquarters Morrison visited in the morning, despite requests.",

But the porcelain palettes of carefully mixed colours, and the design on silver tubes of Winsor &amp; Newton paint, are as they were when I was a child and Mum would write and illustrate her children\u2019s books, listening to the Beatles, Billie Holiday and Edith Piaf.</p> <p>Sixty years later the task in hand these past months has been quite something: <em>Dogger\u2019s Christma</em><em>s</em>. It\u2019s a sort of remake of Mum\u2019s best loved and most successful book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/07/buildingachildrenslibrary.booksforchildrenandteenagers\" title=\"\">Dogger</a></em>, about a boy, Dave, who loses the cuddly toy on which he feels his life depends, the ensuing trauma \u2013 and resolution.</p> <p>It feels a bit like a greatest hits album. Mum has done other books for this season of the year: <em>Lucy and Tom\u2019s Christmas</em>, one of her earliest, and <em>Alfie\u2019s Christmas</em>, featuring her longest-running character. But she has never before infused Christmas Day with that unlikely superhero, a stuffed toy dog cuddled with such intensity that his fur has worn off.</p> <p>Last March, Mum had a fall and it was a worrying time. I can\u2019t say I was surprised at her recovery, but <em>Dogger\u2019s Christmas, </em>announced by Penguin Random House last week, will be, among other things, testimony to Mum\u2019s resilience of body and spirit. \u201cI have to get back to work,\u201d she would say. So back to the studio: \u201cMy publisher said they wanted another Christmas book, and what better offering to my readers than a Dogger drama on the big day?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e362a6d5d3b2987a2e35dd3afdcb582daebb50ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e362a6d5d3b2987a2e35dd3afdcb582daebb50ae/0_115_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Vulliamy with the original Dogger, whom he received for Christmas in 1959 (he thinks).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Vulliamy with the original Dogger, whom he received for Christmas in 1959 (he thinks).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shirley Hughes/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The original <em>Dogger</em> was published in 1977. Dave mislays his companion and is distraught, only to find Dogger on sale at a school fete for 5p. By the time Dave finds his family, it is too late \u2013 Dogger is sold. But his athletic sister Bella wins a prize \u2013 a huge teddy bear \u2013 with which she duly entices Dogger back from his new owner.</p> <p>The book has origins in two true stories. Mum recalls the first: \u201cMy mother, a widow, did not drive, and we were being taken in a taxi \u2013 a converted hearse \u2013 by a man called Eric Barrington from the Wirral for holidays at Llandudno Junction. The window was ajar and for some reason I threw my koala bear, Oscar, out of it. I have no idea why. Not for miles did I raise the alarm. When I did, we went back, Mother and Mr Barrington searching the roadside to no avail.\u201d</p> <p>Then the second: the afternoon I left my indispensably favourite teddy bear in then-tatty Holland Park. \u201cIt was just awful: Dad going down there with a torch, climbing in, searching \u2013 we never found the bear; you didn\u2019t sleep for ages.\u201d</p> <p>Dogger really exists. I was given him for Christmas 1959 (I think) by my Irish great-uncle, Hugh Hynes, a general practitioner. Says Mum now: \u201cLittle did Uncle Hugh know \u2026\u201d</p> <p>She made Dogger the hero of her adapted tale, giving these cruel real-life narratives a fictional happy ending. The book won the 1977 Kate Greenaway prize, the children\u2019s books Oscar, then 40 years later the \u201cGreenaway of Greenaways\u201d \u2013 a bit like being the all-time hall-of-famer in the baseball hall of fame \u2013 weeks after my father\u2019 death, while Mum was working on another book about a toy lost in this-time-enchanted Holland Park: <em>Jonadab and Rita</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b11b94b50df98e6b1252b22f9b9e06cb7fefadb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b11b94b50df98e6b1252b22f9b9e06cb7fefadb/0_0_600_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dave and Dogger\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dave and Dogger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shirley Hughes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDogger has become something of a celebrity,\u201d says Mum now. \u201cHe was put in a glass box, on tour, at the Ashmolean in Oxford and Liverpool Walker Art Gallery. He has one ear flopped down, as it should be, and another that was cocked up from years of cuddling and has remained that way after 60 years. His eyes are rather far apart, which I think makes him especially endearing. He\u2019s retired from the celeb circuit now, living in a shoebox, only coming out for the occasional photoshoot\u201d \u2013 including last week for the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>Why did the book do so well? \u201cSo many children know that dependence on, and love for, a cuddly toy \u2013 and the trauma of losing it. But parents too: all hell lets loose when something like that happens in a child\u2019s life, and no one can sleep.\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s also this: \u201cThe real story, though, is about Bella, her kindness and self-sacrifice, understanding what\u2019s really important in life: Dave\u2019s old dog and all it means to him, rather than this big, new, shiny bear she\u2019s won. She\u2019s a good sister, and a good human being.\u201d</p> <p>Those who reckon that lightning doesn\u2019t strike twice, think again. Dave is the same age now as he was in 1977, and dammit if Dogger doesn\u2019t go missing again, on Christmas Day.</p> <p>Some might think that part of the appeal in Mum\u2019s books is that life is the way it used to be, or should be \u2013 not how it is now. That could be true of Christmas, too. But it\u2019s not as simple as that.</p> <p>Mum is not especially religious, but beneath her books, apparently simple, cuts a riptide which could be described as \u201cchristian\u201d with a small \u201cc\u201d. \u201cChristmas in this book is more about family and home than cheap booze and shopping,\u201d she says. \u201cDave, Bella and Mum go to visit an elderly neighbour who lives alone while \u2013 please note! \u2013 Dad cooks. It matters a lot that the children know that Christmas is about the baby in the manger, the birth of Jesus and all it stands for. Whether you are Christian or not, there are universal values associated with Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there\u2019s always stress on the day. \u201cAlfie\u2019s sister, Annie Rose, throws a temper, over-excited; there\u2019s a battery lacking.\u201d All this is nothing, however, compared with Dogger, almost forgotten in the bustle, buried under a pile of wrapping paper \u2013 then nowhere to be found.</p> <p>Will Bella do it again? Is Dogger gone for good this time? \u201cI\u2019m not telling what happens,\u201d Mum rolls her eyes, \u201cbut it\u2019s a close shave.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Dogger\u2019s Christmas will be published by Penguin Random House in autumn 2020.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Most mornings, when in London, I climb the stairs of the house where I grew up during the 1950s and 60s to what was my bedroom, now my mother\u2019s studio \u2013 and there she is, at the drawing board, aged 92. The woman that countless grandparents, parents and children call Shirley Hughes and Philip Pullman calls \u201ca national treasure\u201d, I have the honour of calling Mum. The view beyond the winter branches has changed: cranes over White City, and Grenfell Tower. But the porcelain palettes of carefully mixed colours, and the design on silver tubes of Winsor &amp; Newton paint, are as they were when I was a child and Mum would write and illustrate her children\u2019s books, listening to the Beatles, Billie Holiday and Edith Piaf. Sixty years later the task in hand these past months has been quite something: Dogger\u2019s Christmas. It\u2019s a sort of remake of Mum\u2019s best loved and most successful book, Dogger, about a boy, Dave, who loses the cuddly toy on which he feels his life depends, the ensuing trauma \u2013 and resolution. It feels a bit like a greatest hits album. Mum has done other books for this season of the year: Lucy and Tom\u2019s Christmas, one of her earliest, and Alfie\u2019s Christmas, featuring her longest-running character. But she has never before infused Christmas Day with that unlikely superhero, a stuffed toy dog cuddled with such intensity that his fur has worn off. Last March, Mum had a fall and it was a worrying time. I can\u2019t say I was surprised at her recovery, but Dogger\u2019s Christmas, announced by Penguin Random House last week, will be, among other things, testimony to Mum\u2019s resilience of body and spirit. \u201cI have to get back to work,\u201d she would say. So back to the studio: \u201cMy publisher said they wanted another Christmas book, and what better offering to my readers than a Dogger drama on the big day?\u201d The original Dogger was published in 1977. Dave mislays his companion and is distraught, only to find Dogger on sale at a school fete for 5p. By the time Dave finds his family, it is too late \u2013 Dogger is sold. But his athletic sister Bella wins a prize \u2013 a huge teddy bear \u2013 with which she duly entices Dogger back from his new owner. The book has origins in two true stories. Mum recalls the first: \u201cMy mother, a widow, did not drive, and we were being taken in a taxi \u2013 a converted hearse \u2013 by a man called Eric Barrington from the Wirral for holidays at Llandudno Junction. The window was ajar and for some reason I threw my koala bear, Oscar, out of it. I have no idea why. Not for miles did I raise the alarm. When I did, we went back, Mother and Mr Barrington searching the roadside to no avail.\u201d Then the second: the afternoon I left my indispensably favourite teddy bear in then-tatty Holland Park. \u201cIt was just awful: Dad going down there with a torch, climbing in, searching \u2013 we never found the bear; you didn\u2019t sleep for ages.\u201d Dogger really exists. I was given him for Christmas 1959 (I think) by my Irish great-uncle, Hugh Hynes, a general practitioner. Says Mum now: \u201cLittle did Uncle Hugh know \u2026\u201d She made Dogger the hero of her adapted tale, giving these cruel real-life narratives a fictional happy ending. The book won the 1977 Kate Greenaway prize, the children\u2019s books Oscar, then 40 years later the \u201cGreenaway of Greenaways\u201d \u2013 a bit like being the all-time hall-of-famer in the baseball hall of fame \u2013 weeks after my father\u2019 death, while Mum was working on another book about a toy lost in this-time-enchanted Holland Park: Jonadab and Rita. \u201cDogger has become something of a celebrity,\u201d says Mum now. \u201cHe was put in a glass box, on tour, at the Ashmolean in Oxford and Liverpool Walker Art Gallery. He has one ear flopped down, as it should be, and another that was cocked up from years of cuddling and has remained that way after 60 years. His eyes are rather far apart, which I think makes him especially endearing. He\u2019s retired from the celeb circuit now, living in a shoebox, only coming out for the occasional photoshoot\u201d \u2013 including last week for the Observer. Why did the book do so well? \u201cSo many children know that dependence on, and love for, a cuddly toy \u2013 and the trauma of losing it. But parents too: all hell lets loose when something like that happens in a child\u2019s life, and no one can sleep.\u201d But there\u2019s also this: \u201cThe real story, though, is about Bella, her kindness and self-sacrifice, understanding what\u2019s really important in life: Dave\u2019s old dog and all it means to him, rather than this big, new, shiny bear she\u2019s won. She\u2019s a good sister, and a good human being.\u201d Those who reckon that lightning doesn\u2019t strike twice, think again. Dave is the same age now as he was in 1977, and dammit if Dogger doesn\u2019t go missing again, on Christmas Day. Some might think that part of the appeal in Mum\u2019s books is that life is the way it used to be, or should be \u2013 not how it is now. That could be true of Christmas, too. But it\u2019s not as simple as that. Mum is not especially religious, but beneath her books, apparently simple, cuts a riptide which could be described as \u201cchristian\u201d with a small \u201cc\u201d. \u201cChristmas in this book is more about family and home than cheap booze and shopping,\u201d she says. \u201cDave, Bella and Mum go to visit an elderly neighbour who lives alone while \u2013 please note! \u2013 Dad cooks. It matters a lot that the children know that Christmas is about the baby in the manger, the birth of Jesus and all it stands for. Whether you are Christian or not, there are universal values associated with Christmas.\u201d Yet there\u2019s always stress on the day. \u201cAlfie\u2019s sister, Annie Rose, throws a temper, over-excited; there\u2019s a battery lacking.\u201d All this is nothing, however, compared with Dogger, almost forgotten in the bustle, buried under a pile of wrapping paper \u2013 then nowhere to be found. Will Bella do it again? Is Dogger gone for good this time? \u201cI\u2019m not telling what happens,\u201d Mum rolls her eyes, \u201cbut it\u2019s a close shave.\u201d \u2022 Dogger\u2019s Christmas will be published by Penguin Random House in autumn 2020.",

After the reinvigorating thrills of The Force Awakens (the best Star Wars film since Empire), some fans howled with frenzied derision at Rian Johnson\u2019s The Last Jedi, feeling \u201cbetrayed\u201d by its somewhat iconoclastic take on the series\u2019 ever-expanding mythology, a complaint Abrams appears to have taken to heart. Stylistically, The Rise of Skywalker returns to the aesthetics of The Force Awakens, juggling rocket-fuelled action sequences \u2013 dogfights, desert chases and saber-battles abound \u2013 with straight-faced \u201cdark v light\u201d standoffs, retaining the thread of humour that dates back to A New Hope while still taking the unfolding events deadly seriously. While Rian Johnson delighted in wrong-footing viewer expectations (Luke comically ditching a sacred talismanic object in Episode VIII raised laughs, gasps and shrieks of dismay in equal measure), Abrams keeps things closer to home, reviving that strange sense of quasi-mystical cod-reverence that was the hallmark of Lucas\u2019s original productions. We pick up with our heroes still pluckily fighting back against the First Order, unaware of a greater phantom menace lurking in the background. In a world in which a cast list can be a plot-spoiler, and death (both real and fictional) is no impediment to resurrection, suffice to say that all the key characters return, including Carrie Fisher\u2019s Princess Leia, thanks to repurposed cut-scene footage from The Force Awakens. As for the narrative, Abrams (who shares screenplay credits with Chris Terrio) returns to the core themes to which he and Lawrence Kasdan had \u201cprojected forward\u201d when writing The Force Awakens, largely sidestepping (or just flat-out ignoring) the more intriguing googlies of The Last Jedi. Rey\u2019s identity is once again at the heart of the story (the question \u201cwho is she?\u201d reverberates throughout), wrestling with her own potentially destructive powers as she continues her long-distance, combative relationship with Kylo Ren. Both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver rise to the challenge of their roles, with the former increasingly commanding the screen while the latter exhibits vulnerabilities beneath the cracked face mask. Between them, they carry the burden of the film\u2019s emotional core as Abrams invokes the fractured-family revelations of yore that have always been a Star Wars staple. Other cast members are less well-served as they ping-pong around the galaxy, chasing clues and objects that open doors leading to other clues and objects like players in some vast, multi-level video game. For such an essentially simple story, there\u2019s a superfluity of plotty exposition, bogged down by an underlying risk-aversion that promptly undoes any genuinely daring developments. What we\u2019re left with is an entertaining but rather empty greatest hits compilation of familiar riffs, characters and iconic space hardware \u2013 a feeling amplified by John Williams\u2019s score, which revisits key themes from the entire series in appropriately heart-swelling, tear-jerking fashion.",

      "bodyText": "Since six female editors on Vogue magazine disclosed their de-luxe Christmas break plans, from trips to the Caribbean to snowy Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re, the harassed hostesses of the nation\u2019s \u201csqueezed middle\u201d have been venting outrage. Snowballs of ice-cold satire have been lobbed at these women from higher moral slopes. Detox spas? Sparkling gifts including rings worth \u00a33,000? Suffice to say, none hoped to find themselves the sponsor of a goat in an African village. While the glut of aspirational consumerism made their plush choices fair game, the reaction also carried a bleak hint of seasonal envy. The hard-pressed working women of Britain were like street urchins staring in at Mr Fezziwig\u2019s festive party through a frosty window pane. The Vogue writers, after all, are employed to make ludicrously expensive things sound desirable. A couple had even written with flashes of self-knowledge (particularly the fashion features editor\u2019s aim to turn her home into a \u201cconcept store\u201d). The attacks came from a shared certainty that what makes a good, ethical Christmas is charity and self-sacrifice. That may well be, but someone still has to be in \u201creceive mode\u201d. Pouring scorn on all those wishing for a special present on the big day is a bit elitist in itself. Not everyone already has too much \u201cstuff\u201d.

      "body": "<p>It would not cross the mind of many critics of neoliberalism to call on the testimony of the angel Raphael in Milton\u2019s <em>Paradise Lost</em>. But if the case you wish to make is as ambitious as Eugene McCarraher\u2019s, then a witness to prelapsarian times comes in extremely handy. When Raphael explains to Adam the lie of the land in the garden of Eden, he tells him: \u201cGod hath here/Varied his bounty so with new delights/As may compare with Heaven.\u201d The paradisiacal economy obliges \u201cno more toil than sufficed/To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease/More easy\u201d. Abundance reigns. But once Satan finds his way in, writes McCarraher, \u201cthis earthly beatitude ends, and the sinful regime of toil and accumulation commences\u201d. All the way to Donald Trump.</p> <p>It is almost impossible to categorise <em>Enchantments of Mammon</em>. This monumental labour of love took two decades to write. There have been marvellous studies of contemporary capitalism published in recent years, for example Wolfgang Streeck\u2019s <em>How Will Capitalism End?</em> But this is an extraordinary work of intellectual history as well as a scholarly tour de force, a bracing polemic and a work of Christian prophecy. It perhaps should have been at least three books. But it is beautifully written and a magnificent read, whether or not one follows the author all the way to his final destination in this journey of the pilgrim soul in the capitalist wilderness.</p> <p>McCarraher challenges more than 200 years of post-Enlightenment assumptions about the way we live and work.

Bracciolini is careful to note that avarice is a sin.

McCarraher quotes Gerrard Winstanley, champion of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggers\" title=\"\">Diggers</a> movement, on the iniquity of the enclosures, which let loose the demons of possessive individualism. Money, writes Winstanley in <em>A Declaration from the </em><em>Poor </em><em>Oppressed </em><em>People of England</em>, becomes \u201cthe great god that hedges in some, and hedges out others\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f19dd3cf40974a235bea38e489271e63bd211a7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f19dd3cf40974a235bea38e489271e63bd211a7f/0_0_2046_2442/838.jpg\" alt=\"Evelyn De Morgan\u2019s 1909 painting The Worship of Mammon\" width=\"838\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evelyn De Morgan\u2019s 1909 painting The Worship of Mammon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: History and Art Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Milton mourns this sellout of the English revolution, using <em>Paradise Lost</em> to portray Mammon as a fallen angel, driven to blasphemous self-aggrandisement on earth. But by the 20th century such satanic cunning is the new common sense in business circles. As the new dispensation gathers momentum, McCarraher leaves the poetry of Milton to move, via the Industrial Revolution, to the outlandish business utopias dreamed up in early 20th-century America. The work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_C._Gillette\" title=\"\">King Camp Gillette</a>, the famed inventor of the safety razor, sets the tone. \u201cHeaven will be on Earth,\u201d he writes in his utopian tract <em>World </em><em>Corporation</em><em> </em>(1910).

One passage of <em>Life in the Crystal Palace</em> gives psalmic form to the consolations of life as an organisation man: \u201cA Mighty fortress is our Palace; I will not want for anything.../I am led along the paths of righteousness for my own good.

All of it is selected and presented with verve. But the epilogue of this mammoth portrait of the religious longings at the heart of secular materialism carries a bleak message: 20th-century fantasies of the world as one global business have been realised. Capital\u2019s empire now extends to all corners of the world. Globalisation has built a \u201cparadise of capital\u201d. But Mammon is delivering an unsustainable future dominated by wage stagnation, tech-led unemployment, deepening inequality and environmental peril. As disaster looms, distraction is being sought in \u201ca tranquillising repertoire of digital devices and myriad forms of entertainment\u201d along with \u201cthe analgesic pleasures of consumption\u201d.</p> <p>The solution, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jonimitchell\" title=\"\">Joni Mitchell</a> might put it, is to \u201cget back to the garden\u201d. A new Romantic left is needed to reinhabit a sacramental imagination, which values people and things in themselves rather than as factors of production, and places collaboration over competition. McCarraher revisits the British Romantic tradition of the 19th century, recalling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin\" title=\"\">John Ruskin</a>\u2019s principle of \u201camazement\u201d, which teaches that the gifts of nature should be admired and nurtured, rather than ravished and depleted. He rereads William Morris\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/03/how-william-morris-beauty-and-anarchy-uk\" title=\"\"><em>News from Nowhere</em> </a>and William Blake\u2019s poetry, invokes the spirit of the Arts and Crafts movement, and celebrates the farms pioneered by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Day\" title=\"\">Dorothy Day\u2019s</a> Catholic Workers, who seek a fuller, humbler life in which they \u201cmilk cows in the morning, plough in the afternoon [and] study Aquinas in the afternoon\u201d.</p> <p>Most strikingly, perhaps, McCarraher mourns the brief life of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy\" title=\"\">Occupy movement,</a> which startled New York in 2011, observing that: \u201cThe Occupiers rebuked the callous and insouciant rapacity that had marked the previous three decades. With the free provision of food and medical care... a gift economy had supplanted the mercenary order of accumulation. Alas, it seemed that humankind cannot bear too much of heaven: Occupy and its tongues of fire were quickly extinguished or exhausted.\u201d</p> <p>The author\u2019s dogged idealism is uplifting. But Romantic countercultures have had an unsuccessful time challenging the church of Mammon. Sometimes, as McCarraher notes, their ideas have simply been monetised and co-opted into the next wave of capitalist accumulation. And at least some readers may be less surprised than he is at how hard it is to live in heaven, given the expectations there. There seems to be little sense here of original sin, or the tragic dimension to life.</p> <p>But it feels wrong to quibble with a book that is so refreshingly original and splendidly pulled off. In any case, where pessimism might take hold, the author\u2019s Christian faith gives him a trump card. For McCarraher, it is simply the case that \u201cthe Earth is a sacramental place, mediating the presence and power of God\u201d. That cannot change, however obscured the truth is by a destructive lust for power and accumulation. It is simply a question of seeing things as they truly are.</p> <p>Some secular romantics might not be able to go along with that.

      "bodyText": "It would not cross the mind of many critics of neoliberalism to call on the testimony of the angel Raphael in Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost. But if the case you wish to make is as ambitious as Eugene McCarraher\u2019s, then a witness to prelapsarian times comes in extremely handy. When Raphael explains to Adam the lie of the land in the garden of Eden, he tells him: \u201cGod hath here/Varied his bounty so with new delights/As may compare with Heaven.\u201d The paradisiacal economy obliges \u201cno more toil than sufficed/To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease/More easy\u201d. Abundance reigns. But once Satan finds his way in, writes McCarraher, \u201cthis earthly beatitude ends, and the sinful regime of toil and accumulation commences\u201d. All the way to Donald Trump. It is almost impossible to categorise Enchantments of Mammon. This monumental labour of love took two decades to write. There have been marvellous studies of contemporary capitalism published in recent years, for example Wolfgang Streeck\u2019s How Will Capitalism End? But this is an extraordinary work of intellectual history as well as a scholarly tour de force, a bracing polemic and a work of Christian prophecy. It perhaps should have been at least three books. But it is beautifully written and a magnificent read, whether or not one follows the author all the way to his final destination in this journey of the pilgrim soul in the capitalist wilderness. McCarraher challenges more than 200 years of post-Enlightenment assumptions about the way we live and work. He rails against \u201cthe ensemble of falsehoods that comprise the foundation of economics\u201d, which offer \u201ca specious portrayal of human beings and a fictional account of their history\u201d. Homo economicus, driven by instrumental self-interest and controlled by the power of money, is condemned as a shabby and degrading construct that betrays the truth of human experience. After capitalism has delivered what the author describes as \u201ctwo centuries of Promethean technics and its irreparable ecological impact\u201d there must be a return to an earlier, gentler, more sacramental vision of the world; one that has a greater sense of natural limits and a restored sense of wonder at creation. It will be a long haul to get back to that spirit. To demonstrate this, McCarraher embarks on a kind of genealogy of neoliberal morals, barrelling his way through the tracts, studies, theories and literature that have constituted the \u201csymbolic universe\u201d of capitalism since the Renaissance. From the English Puritans who made money for the greater glory of God, through the machine idolatry rampant in 1920s Fordism, to the cult of the ruthless entrepreneur \u2013 most recently sanctified in the election of Trump \u2013 capitalism is best understood, he concludes, as a secular faith. It operates through myths and dogma, just as any religion does. Modernity is not, as Max Weber maintained, the culmination of a process of intellectual \u201cdisenchantment\u201d, in which societies lost their sense of the sacred and embraced the rational. Instead, a different enchantment took hold of our minds; the material culture of production and consumption. \u201cIts moral and liturgical codes are contained in management theory and business journalism,\u201d writes McCarraher. \u201cIts iconography consists of advertising, marketing, public relations and product design.\u201d This brave new era produced a \u201cpredatory and misshapen love of the world\u201d. Spiritually diminished by the commodification of things and people, and the desire to consume, we have lost sight of what the Catholic poet Gerard Manley Hopkins described as the \u201cdearest freshness deep down things\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Things hit you in the night like a falling stone \u2013 worry, grief, sickness, all seem worse when accompanied by darkness and the stark numbers on a digital clock. The exception to this rule is semi-slumbering while listening to a cricket Test match from the other side of the world, a surprisingly restful activity even if England are doing one of their periodic explosive\u2011box experiments. What you pick up during these semiconscious moments stays with you for a long time \u2013 all the more so when you\u2019ve had to get out of bed to do a night-time over-by-over shift. OBO cricket coverage has been a Guardian website institution for most of this century, a natural step up from flicking over to Ceefax, which had its own peculiar magic for cricket fans and whose greatest triumph came just as it was about to be overtaken by the internet, broadcasting breathless slow-moving scorecards as India beat Australia in the almost-greatest-series of all in 2001. The Guardian, which combines its website with the Observer, kickstarted its experiment with OBO in 2002 when India toured England, and it has grown at universe-expanding proportions ever since. On 14 July this year Tim de Lisle\u2019s and Rob Smyth\u2019s Cricket World Cup final coverage \u2013 a work of genius that came to a thrilling climax at the same moment as Djokovic and Federer were heading for a Wimbledon men\u2019s final tiebreak \u2013 smashed all OBO records, with millions of views on the website. \u201cAnd that, ladies, is goodnight,\u201d wrote Rob as he tied up the loose ends before going off to lie down in a darkened room. \u201cCricket has nothing left to offer and will now cease to exist as a sport.\u201d Helming the OBO is a peculiar mixture of panic and pleasure. Often it goes off on a tangent, led by correspondents who have emailed in from around the world \u2013 which is the wormhole we\u2019ll crawl down now. It has a seasonal theme, I promise. The night of 22-23 November was a chilly one. When I woke for my 1.40am shift and shuffled downstairs New Zealand were in the process of patting a strangely listless England attack around; Colin de Grandhomme and BJ Watling both had fifties. The stage was set for some fairly relentless cricket. A reader from New Zealand wrote in to say that in the afternoon he was taking his children to see Father Christmas, who was due to land in Auckland in a helicopter while dispensing lollies from his pockets \u2013 a fine example, we would later find out (cultural exchange has been a huge boon of the OBO), of the great antipodean lolly scramble. This then inspired another Christmas-themed email, from a reader who had gone to Villa Park on 13 December 1998, and watched in horror alongside 39,000 other fans as RAF parachutist Nigel Rogoff\u2019s half-time jump, while dressed as Father Christmas, went horribly wrong. Rogoff accidentally clipped the roof of the stadium as he descended and fell 100ft, his parachute a silken, useless tangle on the ground beside him. The email concluded: \u201cI think the Santa parachutist survived, but with life-changing injuries.

      "body": "<p>O<em>bserver</em> readers take a lot of holidays. I know that because you write in to tell me about them. Not happy postcards of sun and surf, but accounts of how a year\u2019s savings bought you a night at an airport (the luckier ones who at least got a change of scene) or vanished into thin air (the unlucky ones who never left home).</p> <p>I know why you take a lot of holidays. It\u2019s to get away from the stress of corporate Britain, where bills arrive out of nowhere for heating a house you\u2019ve never heard of, or parking a car you\u2019ve never owned. Where your telecoms provider makes you pay to leave them when they can no longer supply you, where confusing a 0 with an O can cost you \u00a3160, where a typo on a credit file can cost you a career.</p> <p>You can\u2019t blame the companies. They\u2019re simply fulfilling their purpose \u2026 to make money. No, it\u2019s customer naivety that\u2019s at the root of the problem. Extraordinary numbers of you still hand over your wages to traders in the belief that there\u2019s a sentient human on the end of the line to fulfil your order and solve any problems.</p> <p>If you are among that number, welcome to my annual prizegiving, which reveals the nature of 21st century customer service.</p> <h2>Most brazen profiteering</h2> <p>Three cheers for the car hire sector! It may refuse to hand over your vehicle until you\u2019ve shelled out twice the hire price for unnecessary insurance, or debit your card for unspecified damage weeks after returning it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f43f3206a0193ab5f88f0cc571ad1b82baeb702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f43f3206a0193ab5f88f0cc571ad1b82baeb702/0_238_4709_2825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goldcar office at an airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goldcar: given two months\u2019 notice of a change of plans, but \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But why supply the goods at all if you can get money for nothing! Hence the policy of cancelling a booking and withholding the payment if a customer arrives late to an airport collection desk. Since punctuality is beyond the control of passengers, this is a win-win. Goldcar even refused to honour or refund a booking when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/may/05/goldcar-holiday-car-hire-cheap-deal-cancel-change-booking\" title=\"\"><strong><em>KB of Northumberland</em></strong></a> told them two months before he was due to collect his car that the airline had changed the time of his incoming flight. Goldcar omitted this crucial caveat from their terms and conditions, but insisted it was still enforceable.</p> <h2>Canniest opt-out</h2> <p>This has to go to BT for its Keep Connected Promise. The \u00a365.99-a-month deal pledges instant dispatch of a mini hub to get customers back online if they report a fault with their broadband. The rub is halfway down the terms and conditions, which aren\u2019t visible on the sales page. Clause 10e mentions that \u201cplanned or unplanned outages on BT\u2019s network or any third-party service\u201d are not covered. Nor are faults in the \u201chome environment\u201d. Which essentially excludes many causes and is why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jan/09/bt-plus-keep-connected-promise-terms-conditions\" title=\"\"><strong><em>MR of London</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>was refused the promised mini hub after two half-days with no broadband.</p> <h2>Most lucrative blunders</h2> <p>Discount shopping website The Money Club is a perennial winner. Ever since a software update in 2013 it has had a habit of debiting customers\u2019 annual subscription fees weekly, or even daily. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/mar/15/money-club-annual-fee-weekly-overpay\" title=\"\"><strong><em>SM of Croydon</em></strong></a> was relieved of \u00a38,000 over two months after agreeing to a yearly subscription of \u00a3125. After six years of complaints from the <em>Observer</em>,<em> </em>the Club says it\u2019s \u201clooking at\u201d updating the offending software.</p> <p>Runners-up must be the utilities companies who send customers the tab for their own billing fiascos.

      "bodyText": "Observer readers take a lot of holidays. I know that because you write in to tell me about them. Not happy postcards of sun and surf, but accounts of how a year\u2019s savings bought you a night at an airport (the luckier ones who at least got a change of scene) or vanished into thin air (the unlucky ones who never left home). I know why you take a lot of holidays. It\u2019s to get away from the stress of corporate Britain, where bills arrive out of nowhere for heating a house you\u2019ve never heard of, or parking a car you\u2019ve never owned. Where your telecoms provider makes you pay to leave them when they can no longer supply you, where confusing a 0 with an O can cost you \u00a3160, where a typo on a credit file can cost you a career. You can\u2019t blame the companies. They\u2019re simply fulfilling their purpose \u2026 to make money. No, it\u2019s customer naivety that\u2019s at the root of the problem. Extraordinary numbers of you still hand over your wages to traders in the belief that there\u2019s a sentient human on the end of the line to fulfil your order and solve any problems. If you are among that number, welcome to my annual prizegiving, which reveals the nature of 21st century customer service. Most brazen profiteering Three cheers for the car hire sector! It may refuse to hand over your vehicle until you\u2019ve shelled out twice the hire price for unnecessary insurance, or debit your card for unspecified damage weeks after returning it. But why supply the goods at all if you can get money for nothing! Hence the policy of cancelling a booking and withholding the payment if a customer arrives late to an airport collection desk. Since punctuality is beyond the control of passengers, this is a win-win. Goldcar even refused to honour or refund a booking when KB of Northumberland told them two months before he was due to collect his car that the airline had changed the time of his incoming flight. Goldcar omitted this crucial caveat from their terms and conditions, but insisted it was still enforceable. Canniest opt-out This has to go to BT for its Keep Connected Promise. The \u00a365.99-a-month deal pledges instant dispatch of a mini hub to get customers back online if they report a fault with their broadband. The rub is halfway down the terms and conditions, which aren\u2019t visible on the sales page. Clause 10e mentions that \u201cplanned or unplanned outages on BT\u2019s network or any third-party service\u201d are not covered. Nor are faults in the \u201chome environment\u201d. Which essentially excludes many causes and is why MR of London was refused the promised mini hub after two half-days with no broadband. Most lucrative blunders Discount shopping website The Money Club is a perennial winner. Ever since a software update in 2013 it has had a habit of debiting customers\u2019 annual subscription fees weekly, or even daily. SM of Croydon was relieved of \u00a38,000 over two months after agreeing to a yearly subscription of \u00a3125. After six years of complaints from the Observer, the Club says it\u2019s \u201clooking at\u201d updating the offending software.

The rule forbids utilities firms to chase unbilled debts over 12 months old.

Robert Pattinson is convinced he doesn\u2019t know how to act. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/willem-dafoe\" title=\"\">Willem Dafoe</a> can act, Pattinson thinks. Willem Dafoe can act the socks off anyone in the business. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/joaquin-phoenix\" title=\"\">Joaquin Phoenix</a>. Joaquin Phoenix could tie his shoelaces on film and be nominated for an award. And Bruce Willis \u2013 Bruce Willis! \u2013 now <em>there\u2019s</em> a leading man. But Robert Pattinson? Nope. \u201cI only know how to play scenes, like, three ways,\u201d he says. Three! That\u2019s all. Despite more than a decade in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m nervous on, like, every single movie.\u201d</p> <p>Pattinson, who is 33, is sitting in a booth in a low-lit restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, dunking table bread into a pot of something. It\u2019s the early evening, dark and cold outside. He has arrived from rehearsals for <em>The Batman</em>, which started not long ago and which are taking place, to his delight, in the studio in which he filmed <em>Harry Potter</em> in the mid-aughts. <em>The</em> <em>Batman</em> is the first time he\u2019s worked in a studio in \u201clike, forever,\u201d and his first mainstream leading role since he retired his best-known character, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/02/ten-years-of-twilight-the-extraordinary-feminist-legacy-of-the-panned-vampire-saga\" title=\"\">Twilight\u2019s</a></em> Edward Cullen, sexy vampire. That was in 2012.</p> <p>Maybe he\u2019s tired now. Or maybe he\u2019s had a bad day. Maybe he\u2019s arriving at the studio every morning and not quite getting Batman\u2019s vibe. Maybe he\u2019ll <em>never</em> get Batman\u2019s vibe, and people will finally agree he really can\u2019t act, and his career will come screeching to its inevitable end, and the whole world will fold in on itself.</p> <p>Which are the kind of thoughts Robert Pattinson has.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a catastrophist,\u201d he says, laughing. Pattinson laughs a lot and goes for it: closes his eyes, throws back his head, reveals the square jaw and the fine stubble and the underside of the slightly skew-whiff nose, and lets out a loud, unfiltered giggle. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking that the worst-case scenario is actually going to happen. So when it <em>does</em> happen, I\u2019m like: \u2018Gah! OK! I\u2019m prepared!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cda2dbde3a0f7b7ae41eaf6092146dd4707691e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cda2dbde3a0f7b7ae41eaf6092146dd4707691e/0_13_2700_1663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seeing the light: with Willem Dafoe in Robert Eggers\u2019s The Lighthouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seeing the light: with Willem Dafoe in Robert Eggers\u2019s The Lighthouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Chakeen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other actors suffer from bouts of false modesty. But Pattinson is wholeheartedly committed to the concept of his ordinariness. He is not \u201ctotemic,\u201d he says, like other traditional leading men. And he tends not to work hard in the lead-up to filming, because what if he somehow conjures some very good acting before an actual take, and can\u2019t reproduce whatever spontaneous fluke that created it when the cameras roll? \u201cIf I show it in rehearsals,\u201d he says, \u201cthen it\u2019s doomed to failure immediately.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>It\u2019s strange to hear, </strong></em>all this worry and self-doubt, because over the past six or seven years Pattinson has been slowly, forcefully, making fine films with very good directors. He has worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/14/david-cronenberg-interview-my-imagination-not-a-place-of-horror\" title=\"\">David Cronenberg</a> on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/17/cosmopolis-david-cronenberg-pattinson-review\" title=\"\">Cosmopolis</a></em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/10/streaming-and-dvds-homage-to-claire-denis\" title=\"\">Claire Denis</a> on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/10/high-life-review-robert-pattinson-claire-denis-sci-fi-drama-astronauts\" title=\"\">High Life</a></em>, Werner Herzog on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/queen-of-the-desert\" title=\"\">Queen of the Desert</a></em> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/16/good-time-directors-the-safdie-brothers-robert-pattinson-was-just-a-guy-chasing-work\" title=\"\">Safdie Brothers</a> on <em>Good Time. </em>In<em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-michod\" title=\"\">The King</a></em>, David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s kind of retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s Henriad, which came out on Netflix earlier this year, Pattinson plays a French prince so brilliantly camp it was reported that his co-stars burst into laughter the first time they heard his accent. This kind of thing thrills Pattinson, because at least he got a reaction. \u201cIf I\u2019m doing a scene and I see that the other actor is expecting me to do it the way I\u2019m doing it, if I can just see that it hasn\u2019t surprised them, I immediately feel stupid,\u201d he says. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2019/nov/06/super-bowl-how-timothee-chalamets-haircut-became-the-years-most-unlikely-style-hit\" title=\"\">Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet</a> plays <em>The King\u2019s </em>titular monarch, but it\u2019s Pattinson scenes you remember: long blond hair; accent as thick as a block of beurre.</p> <p>Next month, Pattinson will star in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/19/the-lighthouse-review-robert-pattinson-shines-in-sublime-maritime-nightmare\" title=\"\">The Lighthouse</a></em>, Robert Eggers\u2019s two-hander about lighthouse keepers descending into madness on a remote and craggy island. He appears alongside Willem Dafoe, the <em>actual</em> actor, which was nerve-wracking, of course. \u201cHe\u2019s got a tonne of energy,\u201d Pattinson says, \u201cand it\u2019s intimidating.\u201d Before scenes, Pattinson would punch himself in the face, or twirl around to create dizziness, or drink mud from puddles, or force himself to gag. He explains the process as necessary \u2013 a wild attempt to maximise creativity \u2013 because, you remember, he\u2019s just <em>so</em> bad at acting. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t really know <em>how</em> to act, I kind of wanted to somehow make it real, and one of the ways I\u2019ve always thought makes that a little bit easier is if you shake up your physical state just before action. You end up walking into a scene having a different\u201d \u2013 pause \u2013 \u201cfeeling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"04ca06934212c1b0124d501ad0192622b561c0f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04ca06934212c1b0124d501ad0192622b561c0f1/314_1022_4375_5961/734.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018In a lot of ways I haven\u2019t developed past 15.

And so, while filming, Pattinson thought he probably should, too. \u201cI like doing whatever I can to not know what\u2019s going on. To be completely overwhelmed and disorientated. To feel like it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d Did it work? It did! To anyone watching, if not the actor himself, Pattinson emerges as Dafoe\u2019s on-screen equal. (Dafoe, noting Pattinson\u2019s lack of confidence, said recently: \u201cHow do I deal with this charming self-deprecation?\u201d) Word is <em>The Lighthouse</em> role might earn Pattinson an Academy Award nomination. Maybe a shot at a Bafta. Which is as good a nod as any to the fact that Robert Pattinson has quietly become one of Britain\u2019s best actors.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of amazed by how it\u2019s been received,\u201d he says. He\u2019s sipping a beer now, dunking the bread. \u201cI love the movie. I think it\u2019s <em>soooo</em> cool. But I never would have thought\u2026\u201d He never thought people would actually see it \u2013 a small independent film he shot in 2018 \u2013 let alone absolutely love it, which has been the near-universal response. \u201cIt\u2019s done better than almost anything I\u2019ve done in, like, ages, and it\u2019s the most random movie. Knowing there\u2019s a hunger for stuff that\u2019s very, very strange \u2013 that\u2019s cool! That\u2019s the stuff I like making!\u201d</p> <p>The general consensus is Pattinson turned to independent films to escape the interminable celebrity glare. <em>Twilight</em> birthed him into mega-stardom, and mega-stardom turned out to be a state into which he\u2019d have preferred never to have been born, thank you very much. Fans hoped he might bask in the limelight, take on a few major roles, emerge as the leading man he was destined to become. But Pattinson didn\u2019t feel like playing along. He\u2019d tasted the mainstream, and decided on the cusp. So we made up that Robert Pattinson had actively chosen the quiet life. That he\u2019d turned against Hollywood. That he couldn\u2019t handle the heat. That he was trying to <em>escape</em>.</p> <p>At one point, during the vampire years, escape required actual physical strategies.

      "bodyText": "Do you want to hear a funny thing about Robert Pattinson? Robert Pattinson is convinced he doesn\u2019t know how to act. Willem Dafoe can act, Pattinson thinks. Willem Dafoe can act the socks off anyone in the business. And Joaquin Phoenix. Joaquin Phoenix could tie his shoelaces on film and be nominated for an award. And Bruce Willis \u2013 Bruce Willis! \u2013 now there\u2019s a leading man. But Robert Pattinson? Nope. \u201cI only know how to play scenes, like, three ways,\u201d he says. Three! That\u2019s all. Despite more than a decade in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m nervous on, like, every single movie.\u201d Pattinson, who is 33, is sitting in a booth in a low-lit restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, dunking table bread into a pot of something. It\u2019s the early evening, dark and cold outside. He has arrived from rehearsals for The Batman, which started not long ago and which are taking place, to his delight, in the studio in which he filmed Harry Potter in the mid-aughts. The Batman is the first time he\u2019s worked in a studio in \u201clike, forever,\u201d and his first mainstream leading role since he retired his best-known character, Twilight\u2019s Edward Cullen, sexy vampire. That was in 2012. Maybe he\u2019s tired now. Or maybe he\u2019s had a bad day. Maybe he\u2019s arriving at the studio every morning and not quite getting Batman\u2019s vibe. Maybe he\u2019ll never get Batman\u2019s vibe, and people will finally agree he really can\u2019t act, and his career will come screeching to its inevitable end, and the whole world will fold in on itself. Which are the kind of thoughts Robert Pattinson has. \u201cI\u2019m a catastrophist,\u201d he says, laughing. Pattinson laughs a lot and goes for it: closes his eyes, throws back his head, reveals the square jaw and the fine stubble and the underside of the slightly skew-whiff nose, and lets out a loud, unfiltered giggle. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking that the worst-case scenario is actually going to happen. So when it does happen, I\u2019m like: \u2018Gah! OK! I\u2019m prepared!\u2019\u201d Other actors suffer from bouts of false modesty. But Pattinson is wholeheartedly committed to the concept of his ordinariness. He is not \u201ctotemic,\u201d he says, like other traditional leading men. And he tends not to work hard in the lead-up to filming, because what if he somehow conjures some very good acting before an actual take, and can\u2019t reproduce whatever spontaneous fluke that created it when the cameras roll? \u201cIf I show it in rehearsals,\u201d he says, \u201cthen it\u2019s doomed to failure immediately.\u201d It\u2019s strange to hear, all this worry and self-doubt, because over the past six or seven years Pattinson has been slowly, forcefully, making fine films with very good directors. He has worked with David Cronenberg on Cosmopolis and Claire Denis on High Life, Werner Herzog on Queen of the Desert and the Safdie Brothers on Good Time. In The King, David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s kind of retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s Henriad, which came out on Netflix earlier this year, Pattinson plays a French prince so brilliantly camp it was reported that his co-stars burst into laughter the first time they heard his accent. This kind of thing thrills Pattinson, because at least he got a reaction. \u201cIf I\u2019m doing a scene and I see that the other actor is expecting me to do it the way I\u2019m doing it, if I can just see that it hasn\u2019t surprised them, I immediately feel stupid,\u201d he says. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet plays The King\u2019s titular monarch, but it\u2019s Pattinson scenes you remember: long blond hair; accent as thick as a block of beurre. Next month, Pattinson will star in The Lighthouse, Robert Eggers\u2019s two-hander about lighthouse keepers descending into madness on a remote and craggy island. He appears alongside Willem Dafoe, the actual actor, which was nerve-wracking, of course. \u201cHe\u2019s got a tonne of energy,\u201d Pattinson says, \u201cand it\u2019s intimidating.\u201d Before scenes, Pattinson would punch himself in the face, or twirl around to create dizziness, or drink mud from puddles, or force himself to gag. He explains the process as necessary \u2013 a wild attempt to maximise creativity \u2013 because, you remember, he\u2019s just so bad at acting. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t really know how to act, I kind of wanted to somehow make it real, and one of the ways I\u2019ve always thought makes that a little bit easier is if you shake up your physical state just before action. You end up walking into a scene having a different\u201d \u2013 pause \u2013 \u201cfeeling.\u201d Occasionally, Pattinson would gag so hard he\u2019d throw up. \u201cAnd I forgot I had a mic on the whole time, so the producers and the director, before every single take of the movie, would get\u2026\u201d He sits back in the booth and makes a loud retching sound. \u201cIt kind of puts everyone else off.\u201d What did his co-star think? \u201cI don\u2019t know, I was too engrossed in my gagging.\u201d In The Lighthouse, Pattinson\u2019s character grows slowly wilder and more febrile. And so, while filming, Pattinson thought he probably should, too. \u201cI like doing whatever I can to not know what\u2019s going on. To be completely overwhelmed and disorientated. To feel like it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d Did it work? It did! To anyone watching, if not the actor himself, Pattinson emerges as Dafoe\u2019s on-screen equal. (Dafoe, noting Pattinson\u2019s lack of confidence, said recently: \u201cHow do I deal with this charming self-deprecation?\u201d) Word is The Lighthouse role might earn Pattinson an Academy Award nomination. Maybe a shot at a Bafta. Which is as good a nod as any to the fact that Robert Pattinson has quietly become one of Britain\u2019s best actors. \u201cI\u2019m kind of amazed by how it\u2019s been received,\u201d he says. He\u2019s sipping a beer now, dunking the bread. \u201cI love the movie. I think it\u2019s soooo cool. But I never would have thought\u2026\u201d He never thought people would actually see it \u2013 a small independent film he shot in 2018 \u2013 let alone absolutely love it, which has been the near-universal response. \u201cIt\u2019s done better than almost anything I\u2019ve done in, like, ages, and it\u2019s the most random movie. Knowing there\u2019s a hunger for stuff that\u2019s very, very strange \u2013 that\u2019s cool! That\u2019s the stuff I like making!\u201d The general consensus is Pattinson turned to independent films to escape the interminable celebrity glare. Twilight birthed him into mega-stardom, and mega-stardom turned out to be a state into which he\u2019d have preferred never to have been born, thank you very much. Fans hoped he might bask in the limelight, take on a few major roles, emerge as the leading man he was destined to become. But Pattinson didn\u2019t feel like playing along. He\u2019d tasted the mainstream, and decided on the cusp. So we made up that Robert Pattinson had actively chosen the quiet life. That he\u2019d turned against Hollywood. That he couldn\u2019t handle the heat. That he was trying to escape. At one point, during the vampire years, escape required actual physical strategies. For example, sometimes he\u2019d walk into a restaurant with friends, ask that they swap clothes halfway through a meal, and make a getaway while photographers waited for the handsome actor to exit the venue in the same outfit in which he entered. (Take that, Paps!) But appearing in art house cinema was a different escape strategy altogether \u2013 an opportunity to continue working while simultaneously blending into the background. He starred in films very few people paid to see on the big screen, the world thought, because a part of him longed to disappear. He didn\u2019t need the money any more; presumably Twilight had made him rich many times over. So why not? But \u201cNo!\u201d Pattinson says. He shakes his head. No. No. No. No. No. This hasn\u2019t been about escape. And he hasn\u2019t been trying to defy our expectations. Not strategically, anyway. He just hasn\u2019t been offered the roles. \u201cNothing ever came up for a big movie!\u201d He did audition for Scorsese, and once for the Coen brothers, \u201cbut the whole world auditioned for those parts,\u201d he says, and who was he to walk up to Scorsese and demand work? \u201cI guess there was a part of me that was a little trepidatious about doing, like, a long-running series\u201d \u2013 a \u201csaga\u201d. But really there was no conscious decision to avoid one, either. All he wanted was to work with the directors he admired, make the films he wanted to make. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t, like, a long-term plan.\u201d And all of this talk of him being terrified of fame\u2026 It was never too much. For a while, Pattinson was one of the best- known people on the planet \u2013 \u201cR-Patz\u201d, beautiful Edward, boyfriend and then not-boyfriend to Kristen Stewart \u2013 but that\u2019s how it goes. He actually thought it was cool! \u201cI think the stuff about fame is the most boring,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say.

Nobody looks over. Nobody points and giggles. Everything\u2019s different now, he says, but it wouldn\u2019t really bother him if it wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhen I was younger, when I was a little bit more insecure, I kept thinking people were disappointed when they met me.\u201d And now? \u201cNow I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d For a long time, Pattinson has been drawn to complex, often oddball characters. The camp French prince. The New York conman on the run. The criminal astronaut with a baby. He plays men called the Dauphin (The King), or Connie Nikas (Good Time), or Ephraim Winslow (The Lighthouse). He rarely plays characters called Ben or Ryan or Joe. Edward is about as boring as it gets, and even then the character is a telepathic immortal. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure how to play, like, a normal person,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m great at subtle.\u201d He enjoys playing characters that are the opposite of his real self, which, he says, is totally normal and straightforward and low key. \u201cI like characters who, when a situation is placed upon them, their decision-making process is incomprehensible.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI find it fascinating when people make bad decisions.

The befuddlement comes from within. \u201cI guess I see the world a lot of the time and don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, I\u2019m kind of disassociated.

The fact is that, due to its complex and inefficient system lacking staff and equipment, Bosnia and Herzegovina is failing to protect its eastern border, as well as its western border with Croatia. \u201cAs a full member of the European Union, Croatia has an obligation to protect its own border, which is at the same time the external border of the EU. Croatia is doing this, both on its eastern and western borders.\u201d Due to the cold and the dire conditions, Vu\u010djak camp has been closed.",

For her, men are born male and women born female and that\u2019s that; people can identify as another gender but can\u2019t change their biological sex, no matter what surgery they have. She will use someone\u2019s preferred pronouns out of politeness, but doesn\u2019t feel bound to, because she fundamentally doesn\u2019t accept that a man can properly become a woman. To some, that makes her a heroine, defending the sex-based rights that feminists fought to secure and doing so at great personal cost (she believes it cost her work as a tax researcher). But to others, it makes her a villain, denying the legitimacy of trans people\u2019s existence.</p> <p>Last week, Forstater <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/18/judge-rules-against-charity-worker-who-lost-job-over-transgender-tweets\" title=\"\">lost an employment tribunal case</a>, which, had she won it, would have allowed her to take legal action against a global development thinktank that did not renew her contract after she started posting views some staff found offensive on Twitter. A furore on social media followed, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/19/jk-rowling-trans-row-court-ruling-twitter-maya-forstater\" title=\"\">JK Rowling tweeting</a> that people could call themselves whatever they liked and live their lives in peace but \u201cforce women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? #IStandWithMaya\u201d. Lost in the ensuing hurricane, however, is what exactly standing with Forstater means.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with what this case did not settle. The judge had nothing much to say about the way that biology \u2013 the raw and bloody business of being able to menstruate, or to be literally left carrying the baby, or to go through menopause, or to realise that the man following you home on a dark night is physically stronger than you \u2013 has been used against women for millennia. His ruling doesn\u2019t change the political row that originally got Forstater tweeting, which was over whether adults should be allowed to self-identify as trans rather than undergo the demanding legal and medical process of getting a gender recognition certificate or GRC (which allows a trans woman to be treated for legal purposes as a woman). It doesn\u2019t even tell us whether the thinktank was right or wrong to drop her, since the case never got that far.</p> <p>This ruling was purely about whether Forstater\u2019s views count as a so-called protected belief, like religious faith, which employers can\u2019t discriminate against someone for holding. And while she met four of five legal tests for that, the sticking point was her insistence that a trans woman is still a man even if she holds a GRC confirming her legal status as a woman.</p> <p>That\u2019s what Forstater thinks. It might be what a number of other people think. But it\u2019s not what the law says and the judge ruled that Forstater\u2019s desire to be able to refer to someone by the sex she felt appropriate, even if that created an \u201cintimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment\u201d, failed the fifth test \u2013 that a protected belief can\u2019t violate human dignity or conflict with fundamental rights. Put simply, those seeking the protection of the law can\u2019t ignore the protection it affords others. Even the vulnerable must acknowledge that others can be vulnerable too.</p> <p>Crucially, that doesn\u2019t mean women can now be sacked just for criticising self-identification or for objecting to trans women having automatic access to women\u2019s prisons and domestic violence shelters. But what it means is objections shouldn\u2019t be based on arguing that trans women are men really. The ruling explicitly says that it is \u201cquite possible to accept that trans women are women but still argue that there are certain circumstances in which it would be justified to exclude certain trans women\u201d, for example, from services used by rape victims or potentially traumatised women, just as the law currently allows. The central idea is that being a woman, trans or not, isn\u2019t a licence to ride roughshod over the needs of others; that it comes with rights, but not infinite ones.</p> <p>That cuts both ways, obviously. Forstater\u2019s allies are justified in worrying that debate is being chilled by a small minority of trans activists resorting to aggressive threats online and physical intimidation of gender-critical feminists in real life. But if we are ever to achieve the \u201cnormal, open and democratic\u201d conversation about sex and gender that Forstater says she wants, then it has to be conducted with mutual respect. This ruling offers a place, however difficult, from which to start.</p> <p>\u2022Gaby Hinsliff is a columnist for the Guardian and Observer</p>",

The judge had nothing much to say about the way that biology \u2013 the raw and bloody business of being able to menstruate, or to be literally left carrying the baby, or to go through menopause, or to realise that the man following you home on a dark night is physically stronger than you \u2013 has been used against women for millennia. His ruling doesn\u2019t change the political row that originally got Forstater tweeting, which was over whether adults should be allowed to self-identify as trans rather than undergo the demanding legal and medical process of getting a gender recognition certificate or GRC (which allows a trans woman to be treated for legal purposes as a woman). It doesn\u2019t even tell us whether the thinktank was right or wrong to drop her, since the case never got that far. This ruling was purely about whether Forstater\u2019s views count as a so-called protected belief, like religious faith, which employers can\u2019t discriminate against someone for holding. And while she met four of five legal tests for that, the sticking point was her insistence that a trans woman is still a man even if she holds a GRC confirming her legal status as a woman. That\u2019s what Forstater thinks. It might be what a number of other people think. But it\u2019s not what the law says and the judge ruled that Forstater\u2019s desire to be able to refer to someone by the sex she felt appropriate, even if that created an \u201cintimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment\u201d, failed the fifth test \u2013 that a protected belief can\u2019t violate human dignity or conflict with fundamental rights. Put simply, those seeking the protection of the law can\u2019t ignore the protection it affords others. Even the vulnerable must acknowledge that others can be vulnerable too. Crucially, that doesn\u2019t mean women can now be sacked just for criticising self-identification or for objecting to trans women having automatic access to women\u2019s prisons and domestic violence shelters. But what it means is objections shouldn\u2019t be based on arguing that trans women are men really. The ruling explicitly says that it is \u201cquite possible to accept that trans women are women but still argue that there are certain circumstances in which it would be justified to exclude certain trans women\u201d, for example, from services used by rape victims or potentially traumatised women, just as the law currently allows. The central idea is that being a woman, trans or not, isn\u2019t a licence to ride roughshod over the needs of others; that it comes with rights, but not infinite ones. That cuts both ways, obviously. Forstater\u2019s allies are justified in worrying that debate is being chilled by a small minority of trans activists resorting to aggressive threats online and physical intimidation of gender-critical feminists in real life. But if we are ever to achieve the \u201cnormal, open and democratic\u201d conversation about sex and gender that Forstater says she wants, then it has to be conducted with mutual respect. This ruling offers a place, however difficult, from which to start. \u2022Gaby Hinsliff is a columnist for the Guardian and Observer",

Coming back, James says he is shell-shocked.<br> </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost everything,\u201d he says. \u201cOur house is on a separate property. My wife, son and our dog left at 10.30 for Mt Barker. At about 11am I had to choose between staying to defend the vineyard, or going to defend our home. I had to make that choice. The result is our house \u2013 our home \u2013 is still standing, but the vineyard\u2019s gone. We\u2019ve lost our livelihood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce our house was safe, I went to help a friend with his home. I figured the vineyard was toast, there was nothing I could do there, so I might as well go help friends.\u201d</p> <p>As the fire swept through, James says \u201ccooked\u201d the decades-old vine plantings and melted the winery on the property. A neighbouring cherry orchard was also destroyed in the blaze.</p> <p>\u201cWe were only a small producer, we make 1000 cases a year but all our stock was in the winery,\u201d James said. \u201cAll the barrels of our last vintage. All our wine in tanks. All the wine in the tank is still there, but it\u2019s probably cooked too.</p> <p>\u201cI got a photo of some bottles that were sitting on top of a filing cabinet and the bottles have melted or collapsed. Someone said to me that the melting point of glass is 1400 to 1600 degrees. It would have been fucking hot in there. Excuse my language.\u201d</p> <p>James says the biggest problem going forward is going to be income. The couple planted their first vines on the property in 1999 and it will take years for them to recover or regrow.

Customers with solar panels made up about 16% of all residential customers in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2018-19, compared to 0.2 per cent in 2007-08.</p> <p>Many of these policies, such as premium Feed-in Tariff (FiT) rebates, result in additional costs for retailers that ultimately flow through to customers\u2019 electricity bills, unless funded through other means. The costs of such schemes accounted for $103 or 41% of the long-term increase in household bills between 2007\u201308 and 2018\u201319.</p> <p>...For example, the average household pays about $550 a year (or 9.4 cents per kWh) more than a household with solar panels, a situation the ACCC believes raises significant questions about fairness.</p> <p>\u201cThe cost of installing solar panels has reduced significantly in recent years, so environmental schemes like the premium FiT rebates are no longer needed to make solar an attractive option for those households that can afford it,\u201d Sims said.</p> <p>\u201c<strong>Indeed, all customers who can, should consider how much they could save by installing solar panels.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cWe are primarily concerned about the additional costs such schemes have imposed on households that cannot access or afford to install solar panels,\u201d Sims said.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cFunding environmental schemes through government budgets rather than through increased electricity charges should also be considered as a more equitable option.\u201d</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T00:32:44.886Z\">at 12.32am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfeb7b58f085eda5c10c2dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T00:25:07.920Z\">12.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A very welcome piece of good news from the NSW RFS \u2013 a missing man has been found, safe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NSWRFS/status/1208542777778130947\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In some good news: A missing gentleman from the village of Dargan has been located safe and sound this morning by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nswpolice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nswpolice</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NSWRFS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NSWRFS</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nswfires?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nswfires</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/WmvwDRboe7\">pic.twitter.com/WmvwDRboe7</a></p>&mdash; NSW RFS (@NSWRFS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSWRFS/status/1208542777778130947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T00:26:08.349Z\">at 12.26am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfeb67c8f087e8308e62962\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T00:19:21.791Z\">12.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison </strong>is still making his way to an evacuation centre in Picton</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfeb6398f087e8308e6295c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T00:18:41.672Z\">12.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">South Australia fire update</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <blockquote> <p><br><strong>Royce Kurmelovs </strong>has provided an update on the South Australian fires for us:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <blockquote> <p>Adelaide has woken up to the smell of smoke as a haze lingers over the city from fires burning in the Adelaide Hills and on Kangaroo Island in the south, but the South Australian CFS says it is hopeful they will have a handle on the situation in the coming days.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>While the CFS is not confident enough to issue a statement on containment, cool conditions overnight have allowed fire crews to get on the front foot, with back-burning operations currently being performed in an effort to contain the Cudlee Creek fires in the northwest.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>So far the blaze in that area has consumed over 25,000 hectares, destroyed homes and properties, injured lifestock and native wildlife.

The RFS and the fire services around Australia are run by state governments so it is not for the commonwealth to step in and make decisions. </p> <p>But these are things that I think can be contemplated. </p> <p>But I very much want to do that in consultation with state and territory governments. </p> <p>As I said to the commissioner today, whatever they need, whatever they think they need to bolster support, sustain the operations that they are running, they simply need to ask. </p> <p>And they will get that support. </p> <p><strong>I think there are immediate issues that need to be addressed there with the rural firefighters, particularly as they get into areas of terrible fatigue now.</strong> </p> <p>... They have been fighting fires for a while now and they are still going. Thankfully, as I was briefed this morning, those parts of the state are more under today than they were when I was there not that long ago. </p> <p><strong>But these are the many issues that I think we need to understand. Let\u2019s not forget, there are 210,000 rural firefighters around the country, and there are thousands of surf-lifesavers who will be patrolling our beaches, those who are volunteering on meals on wheels and carers and others. </strong></p> <p>Australia is a magnificent country because it does have that volunteer spirit. And Australia relies on them and they should be celebrated and we do so. </p> <p>And where there are ways that we can further support that volunteer effort, we are very open to considering this. </p> <p>Let me say one thing, all our firefighters are professionals. They are all professional at what they do. </p> <p>They are well-trained and they are very good at what they do. One of the things we focused on this morning was ensuring how we can better supplement the clearing work and the other things that need to be done in those areas that have been ravaged by fires and ensure that we can get even more prompt defence support into those arrangements. </p> <p>There has been defence liaisons in these \u2026 there has been in Queensland other places, and I am sure we can get some \u2026 at local level as well through the state government. </p> <p>The defence forces being deployed in those, defence force members who are firefighters, are out there fighting fires, just like any other employee would be. </p> <p>They are not in their platoons, they are in their brigades.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T23:02:12.245Z\">at 11.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfe9f008f08c3972263ed91\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T22:40:57.334Z\">10.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison </strong>on why the government is not considering changing its climate change policy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Kyoto targets set by the previous Labor government, when we came to government, there was the projection that we would miss those by some 700 million tonnes. </p> <p>Now we\u2019re going to beat them \u2026 And I would hope that not only will we meet, and I\u2019m sure we will, our Paris commitments, that we will beat them as well. </p> <p>And there is a long time between now and 2030 and we will continue to refine our policies because we\u2019re about taking action. </p> <p><strong>But what we will not do is act in a knee-jerk or crisis or panicked mode.

Flowing on from that public anxiety, there is also been other issues that have been raised, not just about the response and the resources which I think I have addressed, but also around issues of climate policy. </p> <p>It is also been the case - our Government has always and I have always acknowledged the connection between these weather events and these broader fire events and the impacts globally of climate change. <br></p> <p>It\u2019s one of many factors as I have said. The drought conditions have certainly been a big contributor in terms of the dryness of the fuel load. </p> <p>There are also many other issues as you would be well aware and they\u2019ll all come under scrutiny as we prepare for what needs to happen next time - issues of management in national parks of fuel loads, issues of back-burning and managing native vegetation and building codes and all of these sorts of things, ensuring our communications programs are important. </p> <p>I mean, there are some fires that have been started by just carelessness.

That\u2019s bigger than the entire of our defence forces and reserves. </p> <p>So we\u2019re talking about an enormous force that has drawn together here in New South Wales and that\u2019s about a third of the national force. So they will continue to get everything that they need and I have run through some matters this morning with the Commissioner and I have been speaking to the Premier as well - <strong>there will be a COAG meeting in March </strong>and at that meeting, as always, I have already put on the agenda the response capabilities for future disasters and lessons, of course, will be learned by these responses but I do know the response you\u2019re seeing right now is informed by how this work has gone on each and everyday since the last fire. </p> <p>I mean, emergency management Australia which is the Commonwealth agency responsible for our engagement, both in drawing in the ADF and the other systems of support, including the important income support, later today I\u2019ll be announcing with the Premier further disaster assistance payments into new areas of affected areas as three payments have been rolling out. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfe99b18f085eda5c10c26e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T22:17:22.253Z\">10.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> moves into addressing the issues which have exploded since he left on his holiday:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are over 100 fires active in New South Wales today and many of those are quite serious, but I do remind people that there are also severe fires in South Australia and in Victoria. </p> <p>I spoke to the South Australian Premier last night when I arrived back in Australia to get an update and there\u2019s been loss of life there and there are fears for others. </p> <p>We have heard further news this morning of people missing, an individual missing out in Lithgow where the fires also have raged overnight. </p> <p>No-one wants to be out there fighting these fires, no-one wants these fires to be happening at this time. </p> <p>But when those fires do occur, as they have for a very long time in this country, then those who have - there\u2019s over 200,000 of them in Australia - who have signed up and put their hand up to be there to defend their communities, then they go out and they do this work and they do it on behalf of all of us and they\u2019re getting tired and they\u2019re getting fatigued because this has been going for a very long time and this is one of the key issues I have been in discussion with the Commissioner about thismorning and also with the Premier and I know that Minister Littleproud, who joins me here and I thank him for that, David, and the work you have been doing, and the Deputy Prime Minister during my absence, we will continue to look at all of these issues as we go forward.

Now is the time to invest in giving our firefighters the resources they need to keep us all safe.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s national firefighting package will deliver:</p> <p> <strong>$80 million to establish the National Aerial Bushfire Fighting Fleet of aircraft</strong></p> <p>It will include retro-fitted Black Hawk helicopters as they are phased out from active use by the Australian Army and Erickson S-64 Air-crane helicopters (or \u2018Elvis\u2019 as they are commonly known) which has a 2,650 gallon tank capable of snorkelling or scooping fresh or salt water.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s expected that the national fleet will include a standing capability of up to six Large or Very Large Air Tankers, and up to 12 heavy rotary wing helicopters.</p> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s first \u2018smokejumper\u2019 units</strong><br></p> <p>Smokejumpers are firefighters trained to be rapidly deployed by helicopters at remote fires during the short window during which those fires can be contained.</p> <p>Smokejumpers usually rappel from helicopters and use chain-saws, hoes and other dry firefighting tools to establish a containment perimeter around the fire.

If you need updates on the fire situations: \u2022 The CFS site is for South Australia \u2022 The VicEmergency site is for Victoria \u2022 The RFS site is for New South Wales There are two fires at watch and act level in New South Wales: the Gosper Mountains fire and the Grose Valley fire. Authorities are keeping an eye on ember activity in Athelstone in South Australia from the Cudlee Creek fire. Although conditions have been less severe today, it is expected the fires will continue without significant rainfall. We will have updates in the morning, and in the meantime, please stay safe. My colleague Helen Davidson wrote this just two days ago about the effort to save Balmoral. It\u2019s so utterly devastating that almost all of the town is gone now. AAP has some more horrific detail on the extent of the devastation in Balmoral. The town has around 150 houses and a population of 400. There is \u201cnot much left\u201d but we don\u2019t know exactly how many homes were destroyed yet. AAP: Matthew Deeth, who\u2019s the mayor of the neighbouring Wollondilly Shire Council, says everyone knows everyone in the small village. \u201cThey were all banding together until they got hit yesterday and they were just decimated,\u201d Deeth said on Sunday. \u201cMost people were pulled out of their houses and if there was nobody defending houses they kind of just all lit up.\u201d Residents in the nearby town of Bargo, north-east of Balmoral, were counting themselves lucky on Sunday. One house in Bargo\u2019s Ashby Close was lost to the Green Wattle Creek blaze, with fire damaging a number of other properties in the street. Joe Cefai, 50, said the blaze just missed his home. Cefai, who evacuated with his two young children and a neighbour, lost a number of buildings next to his house. \u201cIt could have been far worse,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cI could have easily kissed my home goodbye. To return to see how close it did get, words can\u2019t explain.\u201d A total fire ban has been declared for tomorrow in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. An update on the situation in Victoria from AAP: Bushfires in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland have been downgraded as firefighters get a leg up on blazes thanks to milder weather conditions. A watch and act warning remains active on Sunday for Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle and Stirling, while the bushfire at Marthavale- Barmouth Spur is still not under control. \u201cEmergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay,\u201d the VicEmergency website states. Fire crews have managed to get a handle on two blazes with warnings lowered to advice across Goroke, Lawloit, Little Desert, Peronne, Burnbank, Evansford and surrounding towns. One of the fires, the Lexton-Ben Major bushfire in the vicinity of Mt Lonarch, has been contained after burning through 2,711 hectares, and an advice warning in place. It comes as the temperature took a dip on Sunday with about 24C forecast in Tambo Crossing and a milder 22C in Melbourne after a top of 44C in the Victorian capital. The bushfires have been burning since 21 November but flared up on Saturday after a cool change came through and brought dry lightning strikes. ABC is reporting SA premier Steven Marshall has said 72 homes have been destroyed in the Cudlee Creek fire. It is up from 15 yesterday. A total of 404 outbuildings and 227 vehicles were also destroyed in the fire. Here\u2019s a bit more on what the Australian defence force has been doing to help out the firefighting effort in the past day. An aerial tanker has been provided to the NSW RFS from the RAAF base in Richmond. The HMAS Albatross has helped with water refuelling and retardant loading for the Currowan fires from the naval air station in Nowra. The army is also supplying personnel to prepare meals three times a day for 250 firefighters in the northern rivers region from November until mid-January. It is also assisting with transport and logistics for the RFS in Glen Innes, Kempsey, Casino, Wollondilly and in the Hawkesbury. Helicopters and accomodation are also being supplied You can read more about what defence is doing to help out here. I am going to leave you in the very, very capable hands of my colleague Josh Taylor for the rest of the afternoon. Conditions continue to be a lot better than yesterday, but that just means firefighters are having to try and use what time they have to get ahead of what is coming after that. Please pay attention to the alerts and make sure your plan is ready. Thank you for following along with me today \u2013 and as always, take care of you and those around you. Journalist Royce Kurmelovs has another update from the South Australian fires: James Tilbrook coughs from the smoke inhalation as he picks through the wreckage of his Adelaide Hills vineyard. \u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d James says of both the cough and the scene. The boutique Tilbrook Estate winery and vineyard is run by James and his wife Annabelle, who fled their property on Friday morning as the Cudlee Creek fires started to burn out of control. Coming back, James says he is shell-shocked. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost everything,\u201d he says. \u201cOur house is on a separate property. My wife, son and our dog left at 10.30 for Mt Barker. At about 11am I had to choose between staying to defend the vineyard, or going to defend our home. I had to make that choice. The result is our house \u2013 our home \u2013 is still standing, but the vineyard\u2019s gone. We\u2019ve lost our livelihood.\u201d \u201cOnce our house was safe, I went to help a friend with his home. I figured the vineyard was toast, there was nothing I could do there, so I might as well go help friends.\u201d As the fire swept through, James says \u201ccooked\u201d the decades-old vine plantings and melted the winery on the property. A neighbouring cherry orchard was also destroyed in the blaze. \u201cWe were only a small producer, we make 1000 cases a year but all our stock was in the winery,\u201d James said. \u201cAll the barrels of our last vintage. All our wine in tanks. All the wine in the tank is still there, but it\u2019s probably cooked too. \u201cI got a photo of some bottles that were sitting on top of a filing cabinet and the bottles have melted or collapsed. Someone said to me that the melting point of glass is 1400 to 1600 degrees. It would have been fucking hot in there. Excuse my language.\u201d James says the biggest problem going forward is going to be income. The couple planted their first vines on the property in 1999 and it will take years for them to recover or regrow. In the meantime, they have a multi-million dollar mortgage to pay. \u201cSomeone told me there\u2019s a chance the vines may recover and come back,\u201d James says. \u201cI\u2019m usually a positive person, but I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Some friends have already set up a fundraiser for the family. Victorian fire update, courtesy of AAP: Bushfires in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland have been downgraded as firefighters get a leg up on blazes thanks to milder weather conditions. A watch and act warning remains active on Sunday for Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle and Stirling, while the bushfire at Marthavale \u2013 Barmouth Spur is still not under control. \u201cEmergency Services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay,\u201d the VicEmergency website states. Fire crews have managed to get a handle on two blazes with warnings lowered to advice across Goroke, Lawloit, Little Desert, Peronne, Burnbank, Evansford and surrounding towns. One of the fires, the Lexton-Ben Major bushfire in the vicinity of Mt Lonarch, has been contained after burning through 2711 hectares, and an advice warning in place. It comes as the temperature took a dip on Sunday with about 24C forecast in Tambo Crossing, and a milder 22C in Melbourne, after a top of 44C in the Victorian capital. The bushfires have been burning since November 21 but flared up on Saturday after a cool change came through and brought dry lightning strikes. A relief centre has been set up at the Omeo memorial hall, 60 kilometres north, for people affected while generators have been set-up to restore power and services. Hundreds of firefighters on the ground and in the air have been working across the state to contain the fires, which are concentrated in steep and largely inaccessible terrain. People are advised to monitor the VicEmergency website. Anthony Albanese\u2019s office has just released the transcript to the press conference, which includes this line at the end: In terms of this crisis, I have tried to visit the Rural Fire Service headquarters \u2026 Minister Littleproud, can I say this, has been exemplary at providing information and briefings to the opposition, but I have made a request now for days to visit the rural fire service. And that request has not been met up to this point. That would be the headquarters Scott Morrison held his \u201cI have returned\u201d press conference from this morning. From my time covering state politics in Queensland, those decisions are usually up to the state government. You can hear the terror and the frustration in this video. These fires \u2013 they are different. It\u2019s not just authorities saying it. It\u2019s those on the ground, the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d who have lived through previous seasons, but not like this. Which is why politicians saying they\u2019ve seen smoke haze in Sydney before, or that we\u2019ve always had fires, or quoting Dorothea Mackellar is not good enough, on any measure. NSW police say a man is missing in Lithgow, following a fire. From AAP: NSW police say a man is missing from the rural village of Bell after a huge bushfire tore through the Lithgow area, destroying dozens of buildings. The man in his 60 or 70s lives on a remote property in Bell and the area was engulfed in fire on Saturday, NSW police chief inspector Chris Sammut said on Sunday. Another elderly man who had been missing from neighbouring Dargan has been located \u201csafe and sound\u201d, the Rural Fire Service tweeted on Sunday morning. He was found at an evacuation centre in Lithgow which was threatened by the huge Gospers Mountain megafire over the weekend. Sammut said the man who was still unaccounted for lived on one of the remotest properties in Bell. \u201cHe may have self-evacuated or went to stay with friends and we want the public to let us know any information they have to assist us locate this missing person,\u201d he said. Sammut confirmed up to five properties were burned in Lithgow on Saturday while about 30 buildings were lost in Clarence and Dargan. Those numbers include sheds and other structures. About 350 residential homes in Lithgow remained without power on Sunday afternoon. For those who missed the prime minister\u2019s press conference, here is the beginning, including where he apologises for causing anxiety: But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they\u2019re going through this terrible time. And I say to those Australians who I caused upset to, and I apologise for that. It is important I think when you [are] confronted with these things you front up and are honest with people and that is what I am seeking to do now. The time for that discussion is over. We need to focus on what is going out there today. Bits and pieces are slowly coming out of Balmoral. Anthony Albanese says he won\u2019t be leaving Australia this summer, and thanked David Littleproud for being \u201cexemplary\u201d in providing the opposition with briefings. In the briefing that the opposition\u2019s had this morning, there are cooler conditions expected as we\u2019re experiencing today, over the next few days, but north-western Australia is a real issue. And of course, when you have heat, that\u2019s where the heat begins. And it\u2019s there now and is expected to come across the country to the east coast to the more heavily populated areas over the next week. Around north Queensland, around Townsville, Mount Isa and in that area, is also being looked at very carefully at the moment. And people should bear in mind the warnings that are there if they are thinking of going on driving holidays, for example, down the south coast, they need to listen to the expert advice which is there and not take any risks. The first priority is keeping people safe. And I thank minister Littleproud for the ongoing briefings that he\u2019s provided, and the personal discussions I\u2019ve had with him as well. Back to Scott Morrison\u2019s decision to leave Australia, Anthony Albanese says: I wouldn\u2019t have made the decision that he made to go \u2013 that is a matter for him and his family circumstances and it is difficult \u2013 I haven\u2019t sought during this week to, to pass judgment on that, it\u2019s a matter for his judgment. He chose to leave. He chose also to do it in a way that I think created a major issue of secrecy. This government has a real problem with being accountable with any scrutiny whatsoever, and the circumstances whereby Michael McCormack wouldn\u2019t say whether he was acting prime minister or not, whereby people didn\u2019t know when Scott Morrison was coming back \u2013 and even after he said he was coming back, he didn\u2019t come back and wouldn\u2019t tell the media or public when he would be returning. I just think this government has a problem with scrutiny and openness and it\u2019s on display all the time, over so many issues. I\u2019ve raised this for a considerable period of time \u2013 it is part of Mr Morrison\u2019s character that when asked a question, that\u2019s just a straight question, he dismisses it, or he prevaricates, he speaks about the bubble, or he says it\u2019s just gossip and he won\u2019t provide answers to simple question whether it\u2019s in parliament or from the media. And I say to the media that they need to hold him to account, and we\u2019ll do our job of holding him to account in the parliament, with a whole range of issues in which he just won\u2019t provide a straight answer. Anthony Albanese on Scott Morrison\u2019s assertion his government won\u2019t be changing its emissions reduction policy: Well, I just find it staggering that in the current circumstances, whereby he\u2019s sent Angus Taylor, a discredited minister, who has been misleading parliament since his first speech, to represent our nation at Madrid to try and undermine international action on climate change, including arguing for accountancy tricks rather than lower emissions. Australians do want action on climate change. The deputy prime minister yesterday said new measures were needed and a new response \u2013 and today, going from the acting prime minister to the real prime minister, we have a dismissal of the need for any action on climate change. The government needs to listen to the International Energy Agency head, who has said it is time for Australia to get our act together. And quite clearly, when it comes to climate change, the prime minister\u2019s attitude is there\u2019s nothing to see here. It\u2019s business as usual. Well if he thinks there is nothing to see her, it\u2019s because he can\u2019t see through the smoke that\u2019s coming from those bushfires. Anthony Albanese on Scott Morrison\u2019s return from Hawaii. (Earlier in the week, Albanese said he would not be criticising the PM for taking leave.) Now I note that today, Scott Morrison has returned from his holiday in Hawaii. It\u2019s a good thing that he is back. But we saw today no change in strategy with regard to the bushfires, a Coag meeting to be held next March. I wrote to the prime minister in November, asking him to convene Coag in November, prior to the emergency levels of the current crisis. And that was dismissed. We see no change to climate change policy. And we\u2019ve seen no commitment to provide compensation to our volunteer firefighters who are giving up working and the wages that comes with that in order to help their communities, but they\u2019ve still got to pay the rent, they\u2019re still going to pay their mortgages, they\u2019re still going to buy food for their families, and they are really struggling, they\u2019re fatigued. And there\u2019s a need for the government to look at making sure that they\u2019re properly compensated. So they don\u2019t have to choose between whether they continue to help out, or whether they have money to put food on the table for their families. Australian Associated Press has an update on the South Australian situation: Smoke from the Adelaide Hills bushfire had dropped the city\u2019s air quality rating to poor. The Environment Protection Authority says air quality readings are improving but parts of the hills and metropolitan area remain affected by bushfire smoke. The situation on Sunday was further exacerbated by an early morning temperature inversion layer which kept smoke low to the ground. The EPA said anyone with health issues or concerns should stay inside with windows and doors closed. A watch and act warning remains in place for the blaze, with the Country Fire Service reporting some renewed fire activity within the 127km perimeter. The fire has burnt through more than 25,000 hectares and destroyed at least 15 homes. Before it was sparked on Friday, the Bureau of Meteorology also reported that smoke from the NSW bushfires had made its way to Adelaide. Anthony Albanese has just held his press conference in Rozelle. Unfortunately it hasn\u2019t been broadcast as yet, and I am in Canberra, so I will bring that to you as soon as I can. We are still waiting on Anthony Albanese\u2019s press conference. It should be soon. The smoke has officially made its way north. Which brings Scott Morrison back in to the frame: I think all Australians, I think, are very proud \u2013 I know the commissioner is very proud and the premier is very proud of the services that the lead. But all Australians are extremely proud of what is being done here, and in so many places around the country. ... All Australians are proud and have a great, great reason to be proud. This is this is Australia at its best, Australia at its best, and we thank them for it. The commissioner finishes with how proud he is of the fire services: We\u2019ve seen only tragically this week, the risk is real. And the consequences can be fatal. And and as a result of the events only this week, there are there are families, there are loved ones, there are wives and there are children and there are mates, who will never be the same again because of the horrendous that unfolded this week. I could not be any more proud, not just of the extraordinary volunteers that that I have the privilege of being the commissioner for, but the entire coordinated fire response over here in NSW, partnering with the commonwealth, ... It\u2019s a massive, huge logistical operation maintaining and sustaining more than 2,000 people per shift, day and night \u2013 the people behind the scenes of people on the front line, I could not be any more proud of the extraordinary efforts and commitment and dedication that we see following rolling out day in day out, and we know that they\u2019re going to be doing it as long as their community and the people of NSW are going to be threatened and, and all we pray for is rain. And unfortunately, we need a lot of rain to start getting some reprieve. Shane Fitzsimmons on Balmoral: Unfortunately I don\u2019t have the specific numbers \u2013 there are teams in the field today. But as the premier indicated the team inside there say that it was devastating, and I think I coined the phrase \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot left or there\u2019s not much left\u201d, and that\u2019s just really confronting to contemplate and, and whether it\u2019s Balmoral or Buxton ... we are talking dozens of properties, dozens of buildings. As a matter of fact, right across all the far grounds of the last 24 hours, we could be talking about another hundred buildings that being added to the state tally so far this season. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s 100 homes and we need to make sure we differentiate between buildings, property and homes. The detailed analysis going on in the field now will seek to differentiate between what is a home, what is a house, what is a shed, and you know, and that takes some time, we need to access these areas. But the toll is significant. ... There\u2019s a long way to go before we really have an understanding of the magnitude and scale of the the loss and damage here as a result of these fires. Commissioner Fitzsimmons on what is coming up: We\u2019ve got to keep in mind that we\u2019re not expecting any rainfall to make any meaningful difference to these fires until January /February. That\u2019s still a way to go. We\u2019re still talking four to six weeks at best before we start to see a meaningful reprieve in the weather, based on the forecast are available. And then, as the prime minister indicated, we will want to do some very critical post-incident reviews, post-season reviews, gather the information gathered the support from firefighters and communities right across NSW. That will take some time. And the last thing we want is ad hocery or, or unnecessary reactiveness so close to the end of this season, and particularly when other states and territories are still going to have challenges heading well and truly into March. So they will need to be a very concerted effort to consolidate the learnings to ensure that we\u2019re hearing far and wide and formulate that into lessons and proposals in due course but it is certainly something [we] will be very much focused on. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons on that same issue: Fatigue management, and the drain, the relentless nature of this season is certainly taking a toll and so to is a geographic spread of the activity \u2013 you might recall for several months between July and and into September, most of the effort was really concentrated in north-east NSW, we\u2019ve now got fires spreading from north-east NSW and Queensland border down to the south coast of NSW. Those logistical challenges, those transport and, and accommodation challenges spreading and moving people right across such a broad geographic area all add to the challenges of fatigue and crew rotation. Underpinning all of this is a combination of members that are in a very strong position, a very ready position to sustain ongoing efforts and support for three days, five days at a time, coming back for rest and doing another three to five days coming back from a rest. Not everybody can do that. There are also teams that need to maintain a local presence and our local level of fire covering case we get new fires. And then on days like yesterday, where we saw such a broad area affected by catastrophic forecast and unfolding in the day, devastating fires, we saw a whole, a whole bunch of people in the order of 1,000 people stand up and make themselves available to bolster that effort. We\u2019ve got another 30 people that the prime minister met this morning in at the state headquarters that have just arrived from Canada and the United States. We\u2019ve got commitments to see beyond that, from our interstate colleagues, and our overseas colleagues to help us with the fatigue management and the crew rotations and where appropriate, the bolstering of numbers on those difficult days. It is a tough challenge. It is a difficult challenge, and something that we work very closely on, and we will continue to work very closely on as we see through the balance of this season. Scott Morrison on the fatigue volunteers are facing: It\u2019s obviously one of the many significant issues that the commissioner manages with this incredible volunteer fighting force that is out there. But I gotta tell you, one of the things that commissioner told me this morning just, again, just impressed me so much is when a call went out yesterday for extra hands. An extra thousand firefighters showed up in response to that call. A thousand. That is just incredible. People know what\u2019s at stake and they\u2019re all making their contribution. Scott Morrison on the scheduled March Coag: Well, the immediate needs as I said this morning, simply require the requests to come forward as they do through the regular meetings that are held of the fire chiefs and commissioners. The ministers responsible ... they only met a few weeks ago. And what we need to do in March is to ensure that we deal with the recommendations that come out from many of the lessons that have come through these fires not just here in NSW, but in other states and territories as well that have been affected. And we look forward to receiving those proposals then, right now they are fighting fires, and we don\u2019t want them sitting around writing submissions. We want them [to] obviously be focused on the operational tasks they have in front of them. Coag has been very busy over the back end of this year, particularly dealing with a lot of the environmental issues that we\u2019ve been working on and waste management which I thank the premier for her support on and will be considering those proposals. A lot of the ministers have been meeting through their various councils in recent weeks and months. And that means there will be a really good body of work that comes forward to character in March which will be in NSW and it\u2019ll be in Rooty Hill. And I\u2019m looking forward to bring out their their wonderful new facility out there in Rooty Hill. From Australian Associated Press: More than 3,000 properties in the Adelaide Hills remain without power as a result of the devastating bushfire that swept through the region and continues to burn. SA Power Networks says crews are working in a number of areas to restore electricity supply. But it says the timeframe to have all power restored is unclear, and in some cases it could take several days depending on access and the extent of the damage. The company said it had already identified a number of spots where trees had fallen on powerlines. \u201cAnyone in fire-damaged areas is urged to keep clear of power poles and wires as there may still be some that haven\u2019t been inspected,\u201d it said. Among those without electricity are properties in Woodside, Lenswood, Mt Torrens, Charleston and Lobethal. The Adelaide Hills fire has so far burnt out more than 25,000 hectares inside a 127km perimeter. A watch and act warning remains in place for the blaze which has destroyed at least 15 homes. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons says fire authorities don\u2019t expect any real relief in terms of conditions until well into January. Gladys Berejiklian: Question: There\u2019s been concern in Balmoral specifically about when people will be able to get back in and see whether or not their home is still standing? Berejiklian: Look, it\u2019s devastating not knowing whether your property is standing or not. Unfortunately, we have received bad news. There isn\u2019t much left [in Balmoral]. I might ask the commissioner to add to my comments. I understand expert teams are going in on the ground in a lot of those communities today, to make full assessments and to let people know when it is safe to go back. Even if people have lost their properties, they still want to go back to see what\u2019s left and if there is anything they can salvage. We know that\u2019s part of the recovery. We want people to have access to their land, to their property, as soon as they can, but it has to be safe. Scott Morrison: As the premier has just said, the category C assistance is being extended to the Wollondilly shire. That, as the premier said, includes payments for small producers and businesses of up to $15,000 and includes things like mental health support and small grants to communities in both shires to help them rebuild particularly with community resilience programs and things of that nature coming out of that fund. That support is going to over \u2013 around 40 local government areas around NSW at the moment. It\u2019s the same sort of support that\u2019s been provided in many other parts, say, of Queensland where they have had the fires as well in recent times. These programs are designed to help people with their immediate needs. The premier and I have agreed also this morning that those $1,000 disaster assistance recovery payments that are paid to \u2013 for each individual and the $400 that are paid for each and \u2013 each child, in a family, that will be extended to the shire as well. It is already in place for Wollondilly. Those arrangements will be put in place today. These things are done as a partnership. This is the best coordinated, the best resourced, the biggest-hearted response that I think we\u2019ve seen once again here from our response to these terrible disasters. It is something, I think, Australians \u2013 as I said earlier today \u2013 can be be enormously proud of, seeing their country at their best. That is what we have to keep focused on \u2013 allowing Australians to continue to be at their best, supporting them as they get tired and ensure that we can continue to roll out what has been an extraordinary performance from all of those who have been involved. Scott Morrison is called to the front \u2013 he starts with a repeated call for \u201ckindness\u201d: It is great to be here with you of course, your colleagues, and Angus Taylor, the local member, and Commissioner Fitzsimmons. Thank you, again, for the tremendous job you\u2019re doing with all of your team \u2013 all around New South Wales. As the premier said, it is humbling as you come and speak to families and individuals, you speak to volunteers, and you see the best of Australia on every single occasion. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing here again today. Friendships, neighbours looking after each other, simple kindnesses that are being extended. I met one wonderful, wonderful lady today from Malta. She was there with another lady, a single lady, who was finding it tough. She was looking after her. She was making sure that she gets back to her property today. She\u2019s holding her hand. That\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. And this is the \u2013 these are the \u2013 this is the grace, this is the kindness, that events like this need and that\u2019s what\u2019s being displayed here on the ground. That will continue. Not just through the ordinary everyday things that are done by members of the community off their own bat, but also by the many volunteers. We rightfully praise those in the RFS, but equally today we met with members of St John\u2019s Ambulance, the State Emergency Service \u2013 those who are looking after the care and welfare of animals, and others \u2013 there are so many people who stick up their hands in these times. We thank them very, very much for everything they are doing. Berejiklian finishes with this: The devastation is shocking. I have also been just literally bowled by the way the community\u2019s come together, the resilience and people\u2019s generosity. People with not much are giving away everything they have to support others. And it\u2019s times like these when you really appreciate what New South Wales and what Australia\u2019s about. Gladys Berejiklian: So, as you know, we announced joint funding and now that joint funding is in excess of $63m across the state and extends to a dozen councils. These two are now part of that. ... I also want to stress \u2013 I have mentioned this to the mayor who is here today \u2013 that $63m is on top of the $25m the New South Wales government\u2019s already set aside to get rid of hazardous materials and just to start the clean up. For some families, some families will be given notification they can go back to their properties, perhaps today, tomorrow. Other families have to wait. We want to make sure \u2013 no matter what people\u2019s circumstances \u2013 just the hope of being able to move forward is so important. If we pick up the tab \u2013 sometimes it costs thousands of dollars \u2013 to get the hazardous materials off the property, whether you are insured or not insured, the state government is picking up that cost to get on with rebuilding as soon as you\u2019re physically and emotionally ready to start the rebuilding process. As I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re not just here today and tomorrow but we will be with you for the weeks and months and for some communities years. Gladys Berejiklian is addressing the media \u2013 she is formally announcing the additional areas who can now access the disaster relief funding. Scott Morrison and Gladys Berejiklian have arrived at one of the Green Wattle creek fire evacuation centres \u2013 the Picton Bowling Club. About a dozen people had stayed there last night. If you haven\u2019t seen it, Lenore Taylor has written on what she took out of Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference. A taste: This isn\u2019t about an adjustment to your language, it requires an adjustment to your policy, it requires a credible policy, the kind of policy we know could benefit us economically, that business is begging you to enact so that they can invest. And we know that would mean we could fight for effective international action rather than continue to act as a hindrance. We know we can\u2019t solve the heating that is exacerbating this crisis on our own, so please don\u2019t insult our intelligence again with that \u201c1.3% of global emissions\u201d argument like you did at the start of this fire season. Given the consequences we are suffering, we should be doing everything we can, and we know that we are not. You\u2019ve just kept pretending. You\u2019ll find the whole thing here: Two more areas have been given access to disaster recovery funding. From the release: The commonwealth and NSW governments are providing another $3.5m to extend the community recovery assistance program under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) to the Wingecarribee and Wollondilly LGAs. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said this additional funding brings the total federal-state recovery fund to more than $63m. \u201cHaving witnessed first-hand the devastation these bushfires have inflicted on locals and their communities it is vital the government act right away to provide assistance as quickly as possible,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cWe have already made available support for people who are suffering personal hardship; help for people whose homes have been damaged; funding for firefighting operations and to restore damaged essential public assets; and financial support for small businesses, primary producers and non-profit organisations. \u201cImportantly, we are also supporting these communities to become more resilient to disasters by extending the NSW Bushfires Economic Recovery and Community Resilience Grants Program.\u201d Victoria Mackinlay has published this photo of dead ladybugs washing up on Bondi beach, surrounded by ash The ACCC has responded to the National Electricity Market price report \u2013 and it is not as rosy as Angus Taylor made out. From the ACCC public media release: The average annual bill for households in the National Electricity Market fell in 2018\u201319 compared with the previous year, by $65 or 4%, the latest ACCC electricity markets report has found. But while average household bills fell to $1509 in 2018\u201319, households were still paying about 20% ($254) more than in 2007\u201308, and the average price for a unit of electricity drawn from the grid was about 45% higher in real terms. \u201cThere is still work to be done to make electricity more affordable for households,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. \u201cWe continue to seek action on our previous recommendations, which we believe will help drive bills down.\u201d Further action on environmental scheme costs needed Environmental costs have been the biggest driving factor behind the increase in average household bills over the longer term, due to federal and state government policies aimed at encouraging greater uptake of renewable generation, promoting energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Customers with solar panels made up about 16% of all residential customers in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2018-19, compared to 0.2 per cent in 2007-08. Many of these policies, such as premium Feed-in Tariff (FiT) rebates, result in additional costs for retailers that ultimately flow through to customers\u2019 electricity bills, unless funded through other means. The costs of such schemes accounted for $103 or 41% of the long-term increase in household bills between 2007\u201308 and 2018\u201319. ...For example, the average household pays about $550 a year (or 9.4 cents per kWh) more than a household with solar panels, a situation the ACCC believes raises significant questions about fairness. \u201cThe cost of installing solar panels has reduced significantly in recent years, so environmental schemes like the premium FiT rebates are no longer needed to make solar an attractive option for those households that can afford it,\u201d Sims said. \u201cIndeed, all customers who can, should consider how much they could save by installing solar panels. \u201cWe are primarily concerned about the additional costs such schemes have imposed on households that cannot access or afford to install solar panels,\u201d Sims said. \u201cFunding environmental schemes through government budgets rather than through increased electricity charges should also be considered as a more equitable option.\u201d A very welcome piece of good news from the NSW RFS \u2013 a missing man has been found, safe. Scott Morrison is still making his way to an evacuation centre in Picton Royce Kurmelovs has provided an update on the South Australian fires for us: Adelaide has woken up to the smell of smoke as a haze lingers over the city from fires burning in the Adelaide Hills and on Kangaroo Island in the south, but the South Australian CFS says it is hopeful they will have a handle on the situation in the coming days. While the CFS is not confident enough to issue a statement on containment, cool conditions overnight have allowed fire crews to get on the front foot, with back-burning operations currently being performed in an effort to contain the Cudlee Creek fires in the northwest. So far the blaze in that area has consumed over 25,000 hectares, destroyed homes and properties, injured lifestock and native wildlife. Two people have been confirmed dead within South Australia during the bushfires, and 26 CFS volunteers injured battling the blaze. Road blocks remain in effect areas as fire crews are working to manage hotspots along the perimeter and are wary of flare ups in the coming week. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast temperatures in the 30\u2019s in South Australia, with the mercury to climb as the days wind out. Elsewhere, the \u201ccomplex\u201d series of fires on Kangaroo Island has been downgraded and is being treated as two separate fire fronts with 50 firefighters currently on the scene. A spokesperson for the CFS said mop-up operations are expected to continue. \u201cWe\u2019ll have fire crews on the firegrounds for quite some time. Even if we do get it contained, there\u2019ll be fire crews out there checking the ground doing mop up for a few days yet.\u201d I\u2019ve just been alerted to Scott Morrison addressing the US and Canadian fire fighters at the Sydney RFS headquarters, which was shown on Sunrise (which is why I missed it the first time). He cracked a joke about Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Let\u2019s hope he is talking about Trudeau\u2019s love of a selfie, given the circumstances.: We value the same things, we share the same values, that we will be will all be doing, over this period time \u2013 I will be making sure to pass on my personal thanks to prime minister Trudeau and president Trump later today. I\u2019ll get a pic and send it to them \u2013 I know Justin like his pictures. (There is laughter.) I\u2019m not teasing him, I promise. We\u2019ve often done that together, when we\u2019ve been together. The Grose Valley fire has been raised to \u201cemergency\u201d. The smoke haze has hit Brisbane. As of 10:30am AEDT, here\u2019s what we know the fire situation is across Australia at the moment. In New South Wales there are five fires at watch and act level: Gospers Mountain fire, Green Wattle Creek, Grose Valley, Kerry Ridge, and Upper Turon Rd, Palmers Oaky. In Victoria there are three fires at watch and act level: Tambo Crossing and Wattle Creek, Ensay and Reedy Flat and Brookville. In South Australia there are still two fires burning at Duncan and Menzies on Kangaroo Island, and a watch and act in place for a fire in Cudlee Creek. The weather conditions are a bit milder than yesterday, and there\u2019s no emergency warnings currently in place, but we will update if that changes over the course of the day. Just before Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference, RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons* gave an update on the NSW fires: We have still got an enormous amount of fire burning in the landscape. Conditions are particularly dry and fire behaviour continues to be very challenging for firefighters and those areas affected by fire. A big focus this week, a significant focus this week, and starting today is the implications now for the entire Blue Mountains community along the Great Western Highway. We effectively got fire now stretching from the Darling Causeway, Lithgow area, in the western areas of the or the upper Blue Mountains, and only four, 4, 5km north of the Great Western Highway spreading all the way down to Currajong Heights, that\u2019s due north Winmalee, Springwood, which is not far the Penrith escarpment and region. We have seen widespread damage and destruction being reported across a number of those fire grounds and we have got impact assessment teams already deployed into the field this morning trying to gain access to those impacted fire grounds to do assessments and undertake surveys in order to identify the extent of damage and the extent of destruction. As we indicated last night, the reports are still indicating that we are expecting another heavy toll, unfortunately, with estimates that property loss could be in the dozens of \u2013 of buildings including homes, outbuildings, sheds and businesses. That damage and destruction effectively ranges from places like Lithgow, Clarence, Dargan, Bilpin, all along the Bells Line of Road, we got places down around Balmoral and out towards Buxton and Bargo down on the Green Wattle Creek fire. We have also got down the Currowan fire south, up in the north-west corner of that, the communities of Neriga. There\u2019s a very wide area of impact overnight and those assessments will be undertaken. *apologies for the typo in the original post Anthony Albanese will be up at 1pm. I imagine he wants Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference to sit and marinate for a while, before he adds his two cents, given you know, the prime minister wants us all to be kinder to each other, and leave any division to the side - unless of course, you need to make your own political point. For example: Scott Morrison at the beginning of the press conference: It is time to be kind to each other. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. Scott Morrison half way through the press conference: I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Emissions under this government are on average 50 million tons less than they were under the previous government. Emissions have fallen over the last two years. Emissions are lower than at any time they were under the previous government. We have had record investment in renewables in Australia and now, thankfully, as a result of policies the government has put in place if we are also getting electricity prices down, some $65 a year. And on top of that we are doing it without embracing the reckless job destroying and economy crunching targets that others are seeking to force upon us. I don\u2019t think that is a balanced approach. We will take a responsible approach to taking action on climate change. This \u2018debate\u2019 if you can call it that, given Chris Smith seems to have decided his job, now that he is returning to Sydney radio 2GB is just to yell over anyone who has a different view, or you know, the facts, sums up most of the country right now: Angus Taylor has also decided right now is the perfect time to put out a release on electricity prices coming down: Residential electricity bills are coming down according to the latest Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Inquiry into the National Electricity Market report. The November 2019 report found: a reduction in the average residential electricity retail price across the National Electricity Market (NEM) from FY2017-18 to 2018-19 of approximately 3 per cent, average annual residential electricity bills across the NEM have decreased by $65, or approximately 4 per cent, the most recent annual reduction in household bills of $65 is part of a longer-term trend that has seen bills fall by $209 in real terms since 2013-14, and average household bills across the NEM are at their lowest since 2013-14. (Which we knew they would, because a butt load of renewables have come onto the grid, which was anticipated for quite some time) So to quickly recap that press conference: Scott Morrison defended leaving the country to take a holiday (which he said he planned six weeks ago), having \u201cmade a promise to my kids\u201d but said in hindsight, he would have made a different decision. (Morrison was due to return to work, as scheduled, tomorrow, December 23, according to what his office told the New Daily\u2019s Samantha Maiden last week). I am sure Australians are fair-minded and understand that when you make a promise to your children you try and keep it, but as prime minister you have other responsibilities and I accept that and I accept the criticism and that is why Jenny and I agreed it was important that I returned, particularly after the tragedies we saw late this week. I get it that people would have been upset to know that I was holidaying with my family while their families were under great stress. They know that I will not stand there and hold a hose. I am not a trained firefighter nor am I an expert like those in the next room doing an amazing job. But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time. He has \u201clearnt lessons\u201d including about how his office dealt with the media: I understand there is media interest in the engagement of briefings between my office and the gallery and those sorts of things, I get that. There have been lessons learned this week and they will be imported and included next time. After pointing back to the one comment he made in February linking climate change to worsening disasters \u201camong other factors\u201d for the majority of this (early) bushfire season, Morrison made an explicit point of joining the dots There is no argument, in my view, or the view of the government, and any government in the country, about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world \u2013 but I\u2019m sure people would equally acknowledge the direct connection to any single fire event is not a credible suggestion to make that link. But there will be NO change to Australia\u2019s emissions reduction policy under his government. People can expect my government to do what it promised to do, what it took to the last election. I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Morrison also believes the time to talk about his holiday is in the past, and the time to talk about climate change is not now. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. ... Australians know we need to rally together. The time for argument is not now. It is not to say there is no time to talk about climate change, of course there is and we are talking about it. But let\u2019s do it in a way that does not distract from the very immediate need of protecting people\u2019s lives, protecting their property, honouring those who are out there doing everything they can. And so I simply ask people, particularly this Christmas time, to reflect on that, to come together to support each other and to focus on the things we need to do now and on the other side of these fires, Australia will prevail. We always will. On whether he believes he has shown leadership, Scott Morrison says: This has been going on for a long time, since September, and on each occasion I have been here, whether it is in Taree or out at Wilberforce a couple of weeks ago. Not on all occasions have I gone and been there with a travelling media team. I have been there on occasions just in a low-key way, talking to those in incident control rooms, and it would seem that whether it is myself or others there will always be criticism made but what I have confidence in and have always had confidence in is in the fair mindedness of the Australian people. As I said for I take responsibility for my own decisions and I take responsibility for those I made in relation to my family and, more broadly, in terms of my leadership responsibility for the nation and that is why I am here. On Labor\u2019s proposal for tax breaks for volunteer firefighters who are unable to work while they deal with the bushfire emergency: Q: Labor wants compensation for volunteer firefighters. Is that something you are considering? Scott Morrison: I don\u2019t know what the specific proposal being proposed \u2026 I will take that where it is. But these are things that the government has been considering, in the first instance these are matters for state governments. The RFS and the fire services around Australia are run by state governments so it is not for the commonwealth to step in and make decisions. But these are things that I think can be contemplated. But I very much want to do that in consultation with state and territory governments. As I said to the commissioner today, whatever they need, whatever they think they need to bolster support, sustain the operations that they are running, they simply need to ask. And they will get that support. I think there are immediate issues that need to be addressed there with the rural firefighters, particularly as they get into areas of terrible fatigue now. ... They have been fighting fires for a while now and they are still going. Thankfully, as I was briefed this morning, those parts of the state are more under today than they were when I was there not that long ago. But these are the many issues that I think we need to understand. Let\u2019s not forget, there are 210,000 rural firefighters around the country, and there are thousands of surf-lifesavers who will be patrolling our beaches, those who are volunteering on meals on wheels and carers and others. Australia is a magnificent country because it does have that volunteer spirit. And Australia relies on them and they should be celebrated and we do so. And where there are ways that we can further support that volunteer effort, we are very open to considering this. Let me say one thing, all our firefighters are professionals. They are all professional at what they do. They are well-trained and they are very good at what they do. One of the things we focused on this morning was ensuring how we can better supplement the clearing work and the other things that need to be done in those areas that have been ravaged by fires and ensure that we can get even more prompt defence support into those arrangements. There has been defence liaisons in these \u2026 there has been in Queensland other places, and I am sure we can get some \u2026 at local level as well through the state government. The defence forces being deployed in those, defence force members who are firefighters, are out there fighting fires, just like any other employee would be. They are not in their platoons, they are in their brigades. Scott Morrison on why the government is not considering changing its climate change policy: The Kyoto targets set by the previous Labor government, when we came to government, there was the projection that we would miss those by some 700 million tonnes. Now we\u2019re going to beat them \u2026 And I would hope that not only will we meet, and I\u2019m sure we will, our Paris commitments, that we will beat them as well. And there is a long time between now and 2030 and we will continue to refine our policies because we\u2019re about taking action. But what we will not do is act in a knee-jerk or crisis or panicked mode. A panic approach and response to anything does not help. It puts people at risk. Not just their livelihood but if you walk out there into the control room you will not see people panicking, you will see people be very professional, very focused on the job they have, talking to each other in a very professional way and getting the job done. Government is the same thing. Whether it is taking action on climate change or ensuring that, as the midyear economic statement shows, that the government is on track to achieve a surplus or the further job creation that is all over the last week. Over 100,000 jobs created since last election. You get these results by being calm and by being stable. And having clear goals and having the policies in place to achieve them. Whether that is on taking action on climate change or job creation or ensuring that we get the welfare system targeted to support those who need it most or dealing with the environmental challenges of waste management and plastics and any of these issues, mental health issues, the government is addressing them. On all these issues the government has clear plans and a clear approach to deal with them and is doing it in a very patient and in a very applied and professional way. We get back to climate policy \u2013 there will be NO change. Q: The government has been criticised for using carryover credits. Going forward after these fires, how can your government provide a more genuine commitment to making Australia a responsible global actor when it comes to reducing carbon emissions? Scott Morrison: People can expect my government to do what it promised to do, what it took to the last election. I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Emissions under this government are on average 50 million tonnes less than they were under the previous government. Emissions have fallen over the last two years. Emissions are lower than at any time they were under the previous government. We have had record investment in renewables in Australia and now, thankfully, as a result of policies the government has put in place we are also getting electricity prices down, some $65 a year. And on top of that we are doing it without embracing the reckless job destroying and economy crunching targets that others are seeking to force upon us. I don\u2019t think that is a balanced approach. We will take a responsible approach to taking action on climate change. We are taking action and we will continue to take action. We are part of a global action on the commitments we have made, we are meeting. We are meeting and we are beating. So I do not accept the suggestion that Australia is not carrying its weight. We are carrying our weight. We are meeting and beating our target and there are very few countries who can say that. Q: You said you have learned some lessons from this past week. What are they? Morrison: I think I have already outlined that in my earlier remarks. Question: You were critical of the Victorian police commissioner when she went to dinner during the Black Saturday bushfires. Scott Morrison: I have already made a number of comments today, as you know, where I think I have held myself to that same standard. Equally I would note that I am not the operational leader of an emergency service or police force. I am the prime minister. And as prime minister I was kept regularly and sought to be kept regularly updated on the events. The acting prime minister was in full control of what was it occurring ably supported by Minister Littleproud. The premier was leading, obviously the governments of the operational response here in New South Wales, and I have been in contact with the premier [regularly] on these arrangements \u2026were in place to ensure that I could continue to do and fulfil my responsibilities, but I understand and the reason I have returned is out of a deep respect and sympathy for those Australians who were tragically killed a few nights ago. That demanded my attendance here, I believe, out of simply respect and sympathy for them and what they were going through and that is why I have been pleased to return. That is a decision that Jenny [and I made] and we told the kids about it and Australians are fair-minded. They know at the end of a difficult year people go on leave and they know that when a dad makes a promise to the kids they like to keep it. And events late last week are not where they were today so I think it would be unfair to say the events in very recent days were the same as a week or so ago. Nevertheless, I understand the anxiety and my people have been upset at this and that is why I am pleased to be back. This is not exactly a glowing defence of the deputy prime minister. Q: Why were questions referred to your office; why couldn\u2019t McCormack simply say he was acting? Morrison: These are not the matters I am focused on now, I will leave those matters for others. Australians are worried about the fires and the support necessary to support those out there today. I understand there is media interest in the engagement of briefings between my office and the gallery and those sorts of things, I get that. There have been lessons learned this week and they will be imported and included next time. Question: But you knew about these catastrophic fire conditions. Are you sorry to the residents? Morrison: I already said that. I already said it. Q: Do you believe that the release of the information about this was handled poorly and the public needed to know? Morrison: The deputy minister was the acting prime minister and each time I have taken private family leave as prime minister I followed exactly the same process. There was no change. On my earlier leaves no statement was issued. I took private family leave and no objections were raised by the press on those occasions but it is something we will rectify. (No one knew he was leaving the country). Question: Where have you been and why the secrecy? Scott Morrison: I was in Hawaii, a trip with my family, a trip planned seven weeks ago and when I take family leave, it is a private family time. And then the prime minister asks us to all be kind to each other: Let me finish by saying this, and I apologise for the lengthy nature of my remarks this morning, it is time to be kind to each other. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. If people have something they want to contribute, that is fantastic and I want to thank all those who turned up to fire stations and made donations and you may want to think of dropping off some toys for the children of the firefighters who may not have had time to go out and buy some this Christmas because they have been too busy. These are things that people can do constructively. Australians, we need to rally together. The time for argument is not now. It is not to say there is no time to talk about climate change, of course there is and we are talking about it. But let\u2019s do it in a way that does not distract from the very immediate need of detecting people\u2019s lives, protecting their property, honouring those who are out there doing everything they can. And so I simply ask people, particularly this Christmas time, to reflect on that, to come together to support each other and to focus on the things we need to do now and on the other side of these fires, Australia will prevail. We always will. Australia is the most amazing country on earth. How do I know that? Because I see what is happening out there right now on those fire front and in the communities that have suffered terrible loss. That is why Australia is the best country in the world and that is the country I am proud to lead. know we all support in the cause which we all rally now and focus on supporting efforts of Australians. Scott Morrison says he believes Australians are \u201cfair minded\u201d and will understand why he took his holiday. Two other points. I have returned from leave and I know that has caused some great anxiety in Australia and Jenny and I acknowledge that. If we had your time over again and the benefit of hindsight we would have made different decisions. I am sure Australians are fair-minded and understand that when you make a promise to your children you try and keep it that as Prime Minister you have other responsibilities and I accept that and I accept the criticism and that is why Jenny and I agreed it was important that I returned, particularly after the tragedies we saw late this week. I get it that people would have been upset to know that I was holidaying with my family while their families were under great stress. They know that I will not stand there and hold a hose. I am not a trained firefighter nor am I an expert like those in the next room doing an amazing job. But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time. And so to those Australians who had [cause for upset] and I apologise for that. I think it is important when you confronted with these things you front up and are honest with people and that is what I am seeking to do now. The time for that discussion is over. We need to focus on what is going out there today. And then we move on to power prices: We must take action on climate change and we are taking action on climate change. At the last election I said we would, I said we would meet and beat our Kyoto targets, I said we would meet our Paris commitments at a canter and we will. We welcome the record investment in renewable energy technologies and at the same time we welcome the fact we pursue our climate policies while getting electricity prices down as the ACCC noted today with a $65 reduction as a direct result of the policies in place to get power bills under control in this country. And we will do it without destroying the economy or jobs. We will do it with sensible target to get the balance right. That is what I promised Australians when we went to the last election and that is what I am committed to doing. We are not going to beat our Paris target \u201cin a canter\u201d. Emissions are still rising in Australia and have every year since 2014, when the carbon charge was scrapped by the Coalition. Scott Morrison on the climate change link debate: I appreciate that when things get as anxious as they have become, then people will think, you know, what\u2019s been prepared? Is anything happens? Or have they thought of this? I understand that those anxieties are positively meant and are natural. But I want to reassure you that this- our officials, our commissioners, our firefighters, both those professionals who are paid and those who are unpaid, they are doing this year-round to prepare for events just like this. And that is why this response is something where we\u2019re seeing the best of Australia, not the contrary. Flowing on from that public anxiety, there is also been other issues that have been raised, not just about the response and the resources which I think I have addressed, but also around issues of climate policy. It is also been the case - our Government has always and I have always acknowledged the connection between these weather events and these broader fire events and the impacts globally of climate change. It\u2019s one of many factors as I have said. The drought conditions have certainly been a big contributor in terms of the dryness of the fuel load. There are also many other issues as you would be well aware and they\u2019ll all come under scrutiny as we prepare for what needs to happen next time - issues of management in national parks of fuel loads, issues of back-burning and managing native vegetation and building codes and all of these sorts of things, ensuring our communications programs are important. I mean, there are some fires that have been started by just carelessness. Others sadly have been the result of direct arson. Many have been created by dry lightning strikes. And understanding all of that it will be important as we move through to the next phase. There is no argument, in my view on the view of the government, and any government in the country, about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world but I\u2019m sure people would equally acknowledge the direct connection to any single fire event is not a credible suggestion to make that link. He moves on to the anxiety he says he sees the community dealing with: In talking to the Commissioner, I want to acknowledge what he has acknowledged - and that is as we face these fires at the moment, I want to assure Australians of this because I know people are anxious and I know people in some places are rightly fearful of what is literally at their door, and the haze and the smoke and all of these things heighten that anxiety as you think about your kids and your family and your can see the red tinge at night if you\u2019re close enough, but our fire services in Australia are the best in the world. The response to these disasters, these fires, is the best in the world. This is a time when Australia should be very, very proud that we have the best-resourced, most-coordinated, best-equipped fire services of any nation on earth to deal with this. And that\u2019s because as a country, we\u2019re used to dealing with fires - admittedly and very rightly this season is much more lengthened and started a lot earlier and there isn\u2019t the respite rains that we can expect any time soon and that is making this season harder than we have seen in a long time. But it is also true that after every fire, we sit down, we learn the lessons and we make sure we\u2019re better prepared next time and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened on this occasion. The coordination is seamless between not only the states and the Commonwealth, but between the states and overseas jurisdictions as well. Our defence forces are deploying wherever they\u2019re called upon and particularly now as you look at the burnt-out vast territories across particularly here in New South Wales, but in other states as well, there is wreckage to clear, there are trees to remove, there is access that needs to be provided to people\u2019s properties and businesses and homes, and that\u2019s the work that our defence forces can, are and will continue to play and they have been doing it since September - airlifting, ensuring they\u2019re providing night flights for recognisance, and providing that heavy support that is backing in and complementing the amazing work of our firefighters. There\u2019s some 70,000 firefighters here in New South Wales alone. That\u2019s bigger than the entire of our defence forces and reserves. So we\u2019re talking about an enormous force that has drawn together here in New South Wales and that\u2019s about a third of the national force. So they will continue to get everything that they need and I have run through some matters this morning with the Commissioner and I have been speaking to the Premier as well - there will be a COAG meeting in March and at that meeting, as always, I have already put on the agenda the response capabilities for future disasters and lessons, of course, will be learned by these responses but I do know the response you\u2019re seeing right now is informed by how this work has gone on each and everyday since the last fire. I mean, emergency management Australia which is the Commonwealth agency responsible for our engagement, both in drawing in the ADF and the other systems of support, including the important income support, later today I\u2019ll be announcing with the Premier further disaster assistance payments into new areas of affected areas as three payments have been rolling out. Scott Morrison moves into addressing the issues which have exploded since he left on his holiday: There are over 100 fires active in New South Wales today and many of those are quite serious, but I do remind people that there are also severe fires in South Australia and in Victoria. I spoke to the South Australian Premier last night when I arrived back in Australia to get an update and there\u2019s been loss of life there and there are fears for others. We have heard further news this morning of people missing, an individual missing out in Lithgow where the fires also have raged overnight. No-one wants to be out there fighting these fires, no-one wants these fires to be happening at this time. But when those fires do occur, as they have for a very long time in this country, then those who have - there\u2019s over 200,000 of them in Australia - who have signed up and put their hand up to be there to defend their communities, then they go out and they do this work and they do it on behalf of all of us and they\u2019re getting tired and they\u2019re getting fatigued because this has been going for a very long time and this is one of the key issues I have been in discussion with the Commissioner about thismorning and also with the Premier and I know that Minister Littleproud, who joins me here and I thank him for that, David, and the work you have been doing, and the Deputy Prime Minister during my absence, we will continue to look at all of these issues as we go forward. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service and all the fire services across Australia will continue to get everything they need from the Commonwealth. As you know, the operational response to these disasters is delivered and is run at a state level, but with great Commonwealth support. Scott Morrison continues: A few months ago I was up in Canungra when the first of these dreadful fires started to appear. ...When we got out to Wilberforce just a few weeks ago up in Queensland and here we are again today following the terrible tragedy that occurred earlier this week. Andrew O\u2019Dwyer and Geoffrey Keaton. Their families, Lisa and their little daughter Charlotte, 19 months. Jessica and their 19-month-old son, Harvey. When our volunteers go out there, they do it for so many reasons, but I can\u2019t help but thinking that one of the most important things that inspires them is their love of family - family is community and they\u2019re out there defending their community on that fateful night. And Jenny and I my heart broke when he heard of their terrible loss and their great sacrifice and I just want to extend to them our great sympathies, our love and support. They\u2019re getting tremendous support from their Rural Fire Service family out there at Horsley Park and from the broader families of the firefighting communities around the country. What we, the rest of us, can offer them is our honour, our acknowledgment, and our respect for what they have done for all of us. Scott Morrison: ...Men and women who are out there today here in New South Wales who were out there yesterday, the thousands of men and women around Australia, not just here in New South Wales, up in Queensland, down in South Australia where it\u2019s also been a difficult week, down in Victoria, all those that have come from other states - Tassie, the west, the ACT, up in the Territory. I want to thank those who have come from overseas - the Americans, the Canadians, our Kiwi cousins, those who have come to support us in this hour of need. I particularly want to thank Commissioner Fitzsimmons and the amazing team he leads here in New South Wales and for the opportunity to be briefed this morning. I want to commend the Premier, who I have been speaking to over the course of the last week, and for the tremendous job she\u2019s been doing with her team here in New South Wales to respond to this disaster, this threat, that is ongoing and has been going for many, many months now. The prime minster is now addressing the media. If you can, you should watch this with the sound on. The firefighters all remain so calm, despite what they are facing. The \u201cgot this\u201d at the end just sums up everything about how our volunteers are handling this. The prime minister will head to Picton after the Sydney RFS briefing, to meet with evacuees. Here is what the government has spent: Australia\u2019s aerial firefighting force has been given an $11m funding injection from the Morrison government amid growing concern about the resourcing of firefighters combating the bushfire crisis. On Thursday the federal government announced it would nearly double the commonwealth\u2019s annual contribution to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, which coordinated the 140 aircraft used to battle fires across Australia. \u201cIn response to the request from our national fire chiefs we\u2019re backing our firefighters and our water-bombing fleet with an extra $11m boost,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s on top of the $15m we already deliver each year for aerial firefighting to tackle what has already been a devastating fire season.\u201d There is a lot of commentary over how prepared Australia was for this bushfire season. The fire authorities said they did all the preparations they could - including hazard reduction burns, but the group of former fire chiefs who came to prominence at the beginning of this season (which started early) said they wanted to talk about how to prepare for this new normal. Paul Karp has found Labor\u2019s bushfire policy from the election, given this debate. The bushfire season in Australia is lengthening and already overlapping with the northern hemisphere, increasing the risk that we won\u2019t be able to access the aircraft we need at times of peril. At the same time, the Federal Government\u2019s contribution to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre has plummeted from 50 per cent of funding to just 23 per cent, reducing our overall firefighting capability. The Bureau of Meteorology has identified this summer as Australia\u2019s hottest on record, which included devastating bushfires in Victoria and Tasmania. Now is the time to invest in giving our firefighters the resources they need to keep us all safe. Labor\u2019s national firefighting package will deliver: $80 million to establish the National Aerial Bushfire Fighting Fleet of aircraft It will include retro-fitted Black Hawk helicopters as they are phased out from active use by the Australian Army and Erickson S-64 Air-crane helicopters (or \u2018Elvis\u2019 as they are commonly known) which has a 2,650 gallon tank capable of snorkelling or scooping fresh or salt water. It\u2019s expected that the national fleet will include a standing capability of up to six Large or Very Large Air Tankers, and up to 12 heavy rotary wing helicopters. Australia\u2019s first \u2018smokejumper\u2019 units Smokejumpers are firefighters trained to be rapidly deployed by helicopters at remote fires during the short window during which those fires can be contained. Smokejumpers usually rappel from helicopters and use chain-saws, hoes and other dry firefighting tools to establish a containment perimeter around the fire. They then patrol the perimeter to ensure the fire does not jump containment lines while working with water-bombing aircraft to ensure the contained fire is fully extinguished. $21 million for the National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC) A Shorten Labor Government will stop the Federal Government\u2019s reduction in funding for our firefighting capabilities by returning to a 50-50 funding split between the states and territories and the Commonwealth. Scott Morrison\u2019s return to Australia last night has brought him back on deck a day before he was scheduled back to work - the PMO told reporters, including Samantha Maiden, that Morrison would be back to work on Monday, late last week At least one person died in the Adelaide Hills fire which blazed last night, with another reported missing. More than 50 people have been injured - including 23 firefighters and two police officers. At least 15 homes have been destroyed, with about 30 other structures having also been consumed by the fire. But with residents only returning to take stock of the damage today, the number of structures destroyed is expected to rise. The government has announced the disaster recovery payment has been extended to South Australia. Claims will be open from Monday 23 December 2019. For more information or to make a claim visit www.humanservices.gov.au/disaster or call 180 22 66. Scott Morrison has not yet addressed the media - but here is what he had to say to the RFS at Sydney headquarters. Mike Bowers was at the Green Wattle Creek fire last night. Here is some of what he saw Good morning. It is another day of watch and wait as fire fighters across the east coast and south Australia keep a very, very close eye on what Emergency-level fires have swept across parts of New South Wales and South Australia, and the death toll and number of injured firefighters has risen, as the country\u2019s severe heatwave and bushfire crisis continued on Saturday. Two people were confirmed dead in South Australia, and homes were destroyed and communities evacuated in what authorities described as \u201can awful day\u201d in which fires raged across three states, even creating their own thunderstorms in some parts of NSW. At Lithgow, about two hours\u2019 drive west of Sydney, residents were forced to flee as fires threatened the community of more than 10,000 people and destroyed several homes on the outskirts of the town. At 7pm, a person was reported unaccounted for in the Dargen area, near Lithgow, the ABC reported. Four firefighters in NSW were treated for heat exhaustion on Saturday, the ambulance service said, while another firefighter was reportedly injured after being struck by a truck in Richmond. Scott Morrison has returned to Australia - he flew in late last night. He is starting the day with a briefing with the New South Wales rural fire service headquarters in Sydney. AAP have the morning update: An elderly man whose home was consumed by flames remains missing and dozens of properties have been damaged or destroyed by bushfires which raged during heatwave NSW conditions on Saturday. Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons described the day as \u201cawful\u201d for firefighters, with up to 20 homes lost to the immense Gospers Mountain fire northwest of Sydney alone. At least two more properties were razed near Batemans Bay on the south coast, and others at Balmoral southwest of Sydney. Southerly winds moving upstate on Saturday evening fanned flames in new directions and caused erratic fire behaviour, before creating cooler conditions for the 3000 firefighting and emergency personnel in the field. A fire-generated thunderstorm also formed over fires in the Shoalhaven. With forecasts predicting close to a week of advantageous conditions across NSW, Mr Fitzsimmons said his crews would \u2018make hay\u2019. Tougher conditions would likely return later in the week or next weekend. Two total fire bans will nevertheless be in place on Sunday in the Northern Slopes and North Western regions, under \u201cvery high\u201d fire danger. \u201cOur big focus is on trying to consolidate and establish containment lines across as many fire grounds as we can. We have significant fire spread south of the Bells Line of Road and through the valley system such as the Grose Valley in the Blue Mountains,\u201d Mr Fitzsimmons told reporters. \u201cSo we will be looking at what are the options, what are the fall-back lines and at what point do we start implementing very significant strategies to secure protection for an impending threat to the Blue Mountains, particularly the communities along the Great Western Highway.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In pledging a \u201cnew golden age\u201d for Britain, Boris Johnson has become the third Tory prime minister to promise a break with his party\u2019s Thatcherite past. First came David Cameron, who undertook to deliver a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/06/david-cameron-green-agenda-fades\" title=\"\">green and compassionate Conservatism</a>. Next was Theresa May, with her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38545674\" title=\"\">pledges to tackle Britain\u2019s \u201cburning injustices\u201d</a>. Now Johnson has celebrated his election victory by claiming to herald the dawn of a new, blue-collar conservatism that will \u201c<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnsons-first-speech-outside-downing-street-in-full-after-crushing-election-victory-a4313306.html\" title=\"\">unite and level up</a>\u201d.</p> <p>If Cameron and May teach us anything, it is that the rhetoric of one-nation Conservatism provides an easy feint for a toxic and divisive governing agenda. Cameron set in train a decade of spending cuts that have left public services ravaged and that eroded any semblance of a decent safety net, while delivering expensive tax cuts that have disproportionately benefited the affluent. May doubled down on austerity, introduced a hostile environment that resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">people who have lived legally in Britain for decades wrongly deported</a> and, instead of adopting a unifying approach to Brexit, embraced the firmest of red lines in order to keep the Eurosceptics in her party on side. Johnson\u2019s electoral success is partly the result of running against the record of his predecessors, though he was a senior member of May\u2019s government. If we are to believe his election pitch, this is a government that will unite the country by getting Brexit done, close the stark geographical inequalities by investing in the north and the Midlands and revitalise the nation\u2019s schools and hospitals.</p> <p>The big difference is not ideological: Johnson\u2019s leadership of the Vote Leave campaign and his record in May\u2019s government have shown he is just as comfortable in resorting to xenophobic dog whistles and cosying up to the fanatically Eurosceptic flank of his party as the price of power. It is the size of his majority that means he faces far less of a party management problem than May or Cameron and has earned the right to set his own direction. Some of the constituencies that have been hardest hit by austerity and that stand to lose the most from a hard Brexit have turned blue for the first time in decades, giving Johnson a fresh political imperative to soften May\u2019s approach to cuts and Brexit.</p> <p>There is nothing about his first week that suggests he will take the opportunity to do so. On Brexit, the withdrawal bill has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/20/brexit-withdrawal-bill-whats-new-and-whats-different\" title=\"\">stripped of several measures</a>: protection for workers\u2019 rights; the requirement for parliamentary approval on the government\u2019s negotiating objectives on the future relationship with the EU; and, most shamefully, legal protections for refugee children reunited with family members in the UK. </p> <p>There is a clear choice between accepting alignment with EU regulation or going down the path of an economically calamitous Brexit that risks destabilising the Northern Ireland peace process. Yet in insisting there will be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-12-21/eu-braced-for-harder-brexit-as-boris-johnson-rules-out-following-brussels-rules/\" title=\"\">no alignment</a>\u201d to EU rules after the transition period, Johnson continues to deny this trade-off exists and his bill outlaws any extension to this beyond next December, despite the fact this is not enough time to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal. If he carries on in this vein, Britain is heading for, at best, a bare-bones agreement that will result in a border in the Irish Sea and will bring harsh economic costs in terms of jobs and widening regional inequalities.</p> <p>His domestic agenda stops far short of reversing the pernicious spending cuts of the last decade. Cameron and May have run the NHS into the ground; the last two months have seen its worst-ever performance on waiting times for A&amp;E care and cancer treatment. The extra money pledged is the bare minimum required and will not solve the NHS\u2019s long-term staffing crisis. The government\u2019s plans to increase school funding after a decade of cuts will benefit those serving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/02/disadvantaged-schools-will-gain-least-from-new-tory-funding\" title=\"\">disadvantaged communities</a> far less than those in wealthier areas. The focus on longer sentencing to fight crime flies in the face of all the evidence about how to make communities safer, while cuts to policing, the Crown Prosecution Service and prisons have let crime fester.</p> <p>Under Cameron and May, many low-income families with children lost thousands of pounds a year in tax credits. On this, the Queen\u2019s speech was silent. So the shocking rates of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/18/homeless-households-in-england-up-by-23-in-a-year-official-figures\" title=\"\">homelessness</a> and child poverty in one of the world\u2019s richest countries will continue to rise. There are no signs of Johnson using his sizable majority to confront the big challenges Britain faces head on: how to care for our ageing society; how to improve the educational and social transition to adulthood for young people who do not go to university; how to step up our action on the climate crisis in order to have any hope of preventing catastrophic levels of global heating.</p> <p>Instead, the Queen\u2019s speech hinted at measures to strengthen the government vis-a-vis the courts and parliament. Majority Westminster governments are already overmighty, with too few checks or balances. Yet Johnson is threatening to reform the judicial review process that limits the power of government bodies to act unlawfully. It is judicial review that resulted in employment tribunal fees, the Home Office\u2019s extortionate fees for children to claim their right to citizenship and the racially discriminatory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/03/the-observer-view-on-the-uk-right-to-rent-shame\" title=\"\">right to rent policy</a> being ruled unlawful. This sends an alarming signal about Johnson\u2019s future intention to comply with equality and human rights legislation.</p> <p>Everything Johnson has done and said so far suggests that his claims to represent a new-one nation Toryism are nothing more than the baseless rhetoric we have come to expect from Conservative prime ministers. It is an ominous sign of what might be to come.</p>",

Now Johnson has celebrated his election victory by claiming to herald the dawn of a new, blue-collar conservatism that will \u201cunite and level up\u201d. If Cameron and May teach us anything, it is that the rhetoric of one-nation Conservatism provides an easy feint for a toxic and divisive governing agenda. Cameron set in train a decade of spending cuts that have left public services ravaged and that eroded any semblance of a decent safety net, while delivering expensive tax cuts that have disproportionately benefited the affluent. May doubled down on austerity, introduced a hostile environment that resulted in people who have lived legally in Britain for decades wrongly deported and, instead of adopting a unifying approach to Brexit, embraced the firmest of red lines in order to keep the Eurosceptics in her party on side. Johnson\u2019s electoral success is partly the result of running against the record of his predecessors, though he was a senior member of May\u2019s government. If we are to believe his election pitch, this is a government that will unite the country by getting Brexit done, close the stark geographical inequalities by investing in the north and the Midlands and revitalise the nation\u2019s schools and hospitals. The big difference is not ideological: Johnson\u2019s leadership of the Vote Leave campaign and his record in May\u2019s government have shown he is just as comfortable in resorting to xenophobic dog whistles and cosying up to the fanatically Eurosceptic flank of his party as the price of power. It is the size of his majority that means he faces far less of a party management problem than May or Cameron and has earned the right to set his own direction. Some of the constituencies that have been hardest hit by austerity and that stand to lose the most from a hard Brexit have turned blue for the first time in decades, giving Johnson a fresh political imperative to soften May\u2019s approach to cuts and Brexit. There is nothing about his first week that suggests he will take the opportunity to do so. On Brexit, the withdrawal bill has been stripped of several measures: protection for workers\u2019 rights; the requirement for parliamentary approval on the government\u2019s negotiating objectives on the future relationship with the EU; and, most shamefully, legal protections for refugee children reunited with family members in the UK. There is a clear choice between accepting alignment with EU regulation or going down the path of an economically calamitous Brexit that risks destabilising the Northern Ireland peace process. Yet in insisting there will be \u201cno alignment\u201d to EU rules after the transition period, Johnson continues to deny this trade-off exists and his bill outlaws any extension to this beyond next December, despite the fact this is not enough time to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal. If he carries on in this vein, Britain is heading for, at best, a bare-bones agreement that will result in a border in the Irish Sea and will bring harsh economic costs in terms of jobs and widening regional inequalities. His domestic agenda stops far short of reversing the pernicious spending cuts of the last decade. Cameron and May have run the NHS into the ground; the last two months have seen its worst-ever performance on waiting times for A&amp;E care and cancer treatment. The extra money pledged is the bare minimum required and will not solve the NHS\u2019s long-term staffing crisis. The government\u2019s plans to increase school funding after a decade of cuts will benefit those serving disadvantaged communities far less than those in wealthier areas. The focus on longer sentencing to fight crime flies in the face of all the evidence about how to make communities safer, while cuts to policing, the Crown Prosecution Service and prisons have let crime fester. Under Cameron and May, many low-income families with children lost thousands of pounds a year in tax credits. On this, the Queen\u2019s speech was silent. So the shocking rates of homelessness and child poverty in one of the world\u2019s richest countries will continue to rise. There are no signs of Johnson using his sizable majority to confront the big challenges Britain faces head on: how to care for our ageing society; how to improve the educational and social transition to adulthood for young people who do not go to university; how to step up our action on the climate crisis in order to have any hope of preventing catastrophic levels of global heating. Instead, the Queen\u2019s speech hinted at measures to strengthen the government vis-a-vis the courts and parliament. Majority Westminster governments are already overmighty, with too few checks or balances. Yet Johnson is threatening to reform the judicial review process that limits the power of government bodies to act unlawfully. It is judicial review that resulted in employment tribunal fees, the Home Office\u2019s extortionate fees for children to claim their right to citizenship and the racially discriminatory right to rent policy being ruled unlawful. This sends an alarming signal about Johnson\u2019s future intention to comply with equality and human rights legislation. Everything Johnson has done and said so far suggests that his claims to represent a new-one nation Toryism are nothing more than the baseless rhetoric we have come to expect from Conservative prime ministers. It is an ominous sign of what might be to come.",

I mean, as a woman of colour, the generic use of the term nude jars. Nude bra, nude nails, nude lips, nude slip\u2026 Whose nude are we talking about here? Anyway, I digress. Nude lips and Christmas Day. Not the most obvious bedfellows. A little too muted, too understated, too restrained. On this occasion, I\u2019d rather the celebratory and joyous feel of a bright lip. But I have a checklist. I prefer a matt, but I need one that doesn\u2019t leave my lips with more cracks than a building site. I also require an unapologetically strong pigment. One that not only shows up, but shows up correctly \u2013 it\u2019s disappointing when what appears on your lips is totally different to the shade of the bullet. This is an issue that women of colour \u2013 many of us have dark lips \u2013 will relate to. While these sound like easy asks, the criteria is quite tricky to meet.

I mean, as a woman of colour, the generic use of the term nude jars. Nude bra, nude nails, nude lips, nude slip\u2026 Whose nude are we talking about here? Anyway, I digress. Nude lips and Christmas Day. Not the most obvious bedfellows. A little too muted, too understated, too restrained. On this occasion, I\u2019d rather the celebratory and joyous feel of a bright lip. But I have a checklist. I prefer a matt, but I need one that doesn\u2019t leave my lips with more cracks than a building site. I also require an unapologetically strong pigment. One that not only shows up, but shows up correctly \u2013 it\u2019s disappointing when what appears on your lips is totally different to the shade of the bullet. This is an issue that women of colour \u2013 many of us have dark lips \u2013 will relate to. While these sound like easy asks, the criteria is quite tricky to meet.

The concerts are usually a winter highlight for the school, which teaches both oriental and western classical music to 180 to 200 male and female pupils from the age of six or seven upwards.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They [the authorities] do not have more rights than the parents to stop them performing</p> <footer> <cite>Anas Al Najar, conductor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The orchestra\u2019s conductor, Anas Al Najar, 37, said the unprecedented move was \u201ca very serious sign ... After 10 or 11 years of teaching, the musicians are ready to be on the stage. To perform is every musician\u2019s dream\u201d. Najar, the school\u2019s academic supervisor and a leading virtuoso on the Arabic string instrument, the qanun, said that the musicians\u2019 parents would have been among the audience. He added: \u201cThey [the authorities] do not have more rights than the parents to stop them performing.\u201d</p> <p>The necessary police permission to hold a public event has always been granted before \u2013 most recently for a musical festival of sea and freedom held by the orchestra in October. The school points out that the musicians play as an ensemble, which could not be unravelled to allow for gender separation.</p> <p>The Edward Said school is named after the celebrated Palestinian writer, academic and nationalist intellectual who was a strong promoter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/13/classicalmusicandopera.israelandthepalestinians\" title=\"\">Palestinian music education</a>.</p> <p>The move against mixed-sex performances follows the issuing of a fatwa in November by an Islamic preacher in Khan Yunis, which is traditionally more conservative than Gaza City. On that occasion the target was open-air performances by the separate Sol Band \u2013 a five-member group including graduates of the Gaza school, one of them a girl. The fatwa, published on Facebook, and proposing a ban by the authorities, provoked widespread debate on social media, and was denounced as <a href=\"https://pchrgaza.org/en/?p=13252\" title=\"\">possible hate speech</a> by the respected Palestinian Centre for Human Rights.</p> <p>The PCHR said the fatwa had \u201csmeared the band members as infidels who promote obscenity\u201d and contravened both Palestinian and international laws protecting personal freedom. It called on \u201cthe competent authorities in the Gaza Strip\u201d formally to reject the statements by the preacher, Mohammed Al-Farra.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/archive-zip/giv-3902OECvEJftjfRR/\" data-alt=\"Gaza\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/archive-zip/giv-3902OECvEJftjfRR/\">Gaza</a> <figcaption>Gaza</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been some limits to Hamas\u2019s interventions in Gaza\u2019s social and cultural life \u2013 which nevertheless include gender segregation in government schools, a ban on alcohol, and prohibition of sexual relations between unmarried couples. But it is sensitive to complaints from Salafist and other ultra-conservative groups that it is not doing enough to impose a stricter Islamic regime.</p> <p>Manal Awwad, the Edward Said school\u2019s Gaza branch manager, said: \u201cThe government didn\u2019t refuse the concert itself but they refused to have boys and girls together on the stage. And we refused to accept that idea so we delayed the concert.\u201d</p> <p>In general, the Hamas ministry of culture had supported the school\u2019s activities, she added, but \u201cthey don\u2019t have the decision and this is the problem\u201d. Awwad said that the school had deliberately not yet protested against the move in the hope that the concerts could still go ahead in the future, as they had in the past.</p> <p>Najar said the orchestra\u2019s repertoire was composed mainly of \u201cnational, not romantic songs\u201d, including ones by the revered Lebanese singers Fairuz and Marcel Khalife. He said music was a way of bringing people together. \u201cIt is the language of love and peace,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The Sol Band\u2019s drummer, Mohammed Bashar, 21, said they had never expected the earlier controversy over their performances in public squares in Gaza City and Rafah; they had gone ahead without harassment. The band would continue to release its repertoire of 30 songs, which included non-factional revolutionary numbers from the 70s and 80s, to Falastini satellite TV at the rate of one week. And they wouldn\u2019t be dropping their only female musician. \u201cShe is part of the band,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two orchestral concerts by students and graduates of Gaza\u2019s decade-old music conservatory have been cancelled after the Hamas authorities insisted for the first time that they could not go ahead with girls and boys playing together on stage. The Gaza music school, part of the Palestinian-wide Edward Said National Conservatory of Music, rejected a new single-sex condition which the conductor told the Observer would be a disaster for the 45-member orchestra if sustained by the de facto government. As a result, the two annual public concerts by the Gaza Orchestra, one scheduled for earlier this month in the southern city of Khan Yunis and the other for last Thursday in Gaza City, did not take place. The concerts are usually a winter highlight for the school, which teaches both oriental and western classical music to 180 to 200 male and female pupils from the age of six or seven upwards. The orchestra\u2019s conductor, Anas Al Najar, 37, said the unprecedented move was \u201ca very serious sign ... After 10 or 11 years of teaching, the musicians are ready to be on the stage. To perform is every musician\u2019s dream\u201d. Najar, the school\u2019s academic supervisor and a leading virtuoso on the Arabic string instrument, the qanun, said that the musicians\u2019 parents would have been among the audience. He added: \u201cThey [the authorities] do not have more rights than the parents to stop them performing.\u201d The necessary police permission to hold a public event has always been granted before \u2013 most recently for a musical festival of sea and freedom held by the orchestra in October. The school points out that the musicians play as an ensemble, which could not be unravelled to allow for gender separation. The Edward Said school is named after the celebrated Palestinian writer, academic and nationalist intellectual who was a strong promoter of Palestinian music education. The move against mixed-sex performances follows the issuing of a fatwa in November by an Islamic preacher in Khan Yunis, which is traditionally more conservative than Gaza City. On that occasion the target was open-air performances by the separate Sol Band \u2013 a five-member group including graduates of the Gaza school, one of them a girl. The fatwa, published on Facebook, and proposing a ban by the authorities, provoked widespread debate on social media, and was denounced as possible hate speech by the respected Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. The PCHR said the fatwa had \u201csmeared the band members as infidels who promote obscenity\u201d and contravened both Palestinian and international laws protecting personal freedom. It called on \u201cthe competent authorities in the Gaza Strip\u201d formally to reject the statements by the preacher, Mohammed Al-Farra. There have been some limits to Hamas\u2019s interventions in Gaza\u2019s social and cultural life \u2013 which nevertheless include gender segregation in government schools, a ban on alcohol, and prohibition of sexual relations between unmarried couples. But it is sensitive to complaints from Salafist and other ultra-conservative groups that it is not doing enough to impose a stricter Islamic regime. Manal Awwad, the Edward Said school\u2019s Gaza branch manager, said: \u201cThe government didn\u2019t refuse the concert itself but they refused to have boys and girls together on the stage. And we refused to accept that idea so we delayed the concert.\u201d In general, the Hamas ministry of culture had supported the school\u2019s activities, she added, but \u201cthey don\u2019t have the decision and this is the problem\u201d. Awwad said that the school had deliberately not yet protested against the move in the hope that the concerts could still go ahead in the future, as they had in the past. Najar said the orchestra\u2019s repertoire was composed mainly of \u201cnational, not romantic songs\u201d, including ones by the revered Lebanese singers Fairuz and Marcel Khalife. He said music was a way of bringing people together. \u201cIt is the language of love and peace,\u201d he added. The Sol Band\u2019s drummer, Mohammed Bashar, 21, said they had never expected the earlier controversy over their performances in public squares in Gaza City and Rafah; they had gone ahead without harassment. The band would continue to release its repertoire of 30 songs, which included non-factional revolutionary numbers from the 70s and 80s, to Falastini satellite TV at the rate of one week. And they wouldn\u2019t be dropping their only female musician. \u201cShe is part of the band,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "As Labour heads into another leadership contest, it will be the votes of the party\u2019s 550,000 members that will matter most in the end. They will have the final say after a 12-week contest that will start next month. Since 2015, the membership has been strongly supportive of Jeremy Corbyn, and he won thumping majorities in 2015 and 2016 thanks largely to them. But after the recent catastrophic election defeat, Labour\u2019s fourth in a row, are some losing patience? Do they want more Corbynism, or is the brand now tainted by failure? Shannon Jezzard, a 24-year-old Labour councillor in Harlow, Essex, is a member of the pro-Corbyn grassroots movement Momentum. She voted for Corbyn in the past two leadership elections. \u201cI really liked his consistent voting record \u2013 opposing cuts and austerity \u2013 and felt like he was always on the right side of history, especially when it came to the Iraq war,\u201d she says. Jezzard would like to see more Corbynism in the form of Rebecca Long Bailey, a long-term ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, as the next leader. \u201cI think she\u2019s a great candidate \u2013she has good politics, but without the baggage of longer-standing MPs, and is genuinely likeable. I think it\u2019d be good to get out of the London bubble and see someone lead the party from up north.\u201d Backing Long Bailey for leader over Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry or Lisa Nandy might seem the obvious choice for Labour members who have previously supported Corbyn. The shadow business secretary has strong links with the union movement, whose endorsement will also be important in the forthcoming contest. However, other young members disagree. Jonny Lawrence, 25, a PhD student, backed Corbyn in the last two leadership contests but encountered hostility towards him in the general election campaign. \u201cI canvassed loads for Anneliese Dodds in Oxford East and the main issue coming up on the doorstep for us was Corbyn as a leader.

Lawrence is now leaning towards Nandy, a candidate who has forged an identity and a message entirely separate from Corbyn and his allies. \u201cI do think she was right on Brexit and how we need to go about rebuilding the party,\u201d he says. \u201cOur focus needs to be, as she has said, on restoring faith in the towns across the UK that Labour can provide a better future for. \u201cIn reality, the manifesto\u2019s flagship policies were out of touch and were much more appealing to me and my demographic than the demographic we needed to win.\u201d Alice Gent, 21, says she \u201cstrongly aligns to the left of [Labour] and its values\u201d.

      "body": "<p><strong>Domaine des Valanges, Saint-V\u00e9ran, France 2018 (\u00a312, <a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/products/domaine-des-valanges-saint-veran-778241\">the Co-op</a>) </strong>Calling an election in the run-up to Christmas may not be very far up the long list of Boris Johnson\u2019s worst misdemeanours. But I doubt I\u2019m the only one who wishes he\u2019d chosen a different time to stir up the foul storm we\u2019ve just endured. How many of us are only now picking up the pieces of our shattered festive preparations? I suspect last-minute shopping will be the lot of millions of us today, and that includes choosing what to drink on this much-needed holiday. I\u2019ll start with two classic French dry whites that should be on the shelves of a store near you: the crystal-clear, lime and cut-grass class of Les Ruettes Sancerre 2018 (\u00a314, <a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/les-ruettes-sancerre-case-of-6/p/p21126716\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/les-ruettes-sancerre-case-of-6/p/p21126716\">&amp;</a><a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/les-ruettes-sancerre-case-of-6/p/p21126716\">S</a>) and the golden apple and almond of Domaine des Valanges\u2019s top-notch chardonnay.</p> <p><strong>Taste the Difference Gran Reserva, Rioja, Spain 2012 (\u00a312, <a href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries/buy-6/sainsburys-rioja-gran-reserva--taste-the-difference-75cl?storeId=10151&amp;langId=44&amp;krypto=6wcc1dMwWVju8Ca2qKMMl1aXLoBE%2F9nxNGDELNWy7zOtO%2Fp2lbSLk0MNbzc6eMwnCQV7l1a%2F6DudfjocVzElR6Urx%2FP5od0NeJD4Vsd6I22Pm3dsG6QDf3%2BHf7KEEWcC&amp;ddkey=https%3Agb%2Fgroceries%2Fbuy-6%2Fsainsburys-rioja-gran-reserva--taste-the-difference-75cl\">Sainsbury\u2019s</a>) </strong>For the red wine for the Christmas meal, I tend to go one of two ways: either something light and racy to cut through all the fatty richness; or something rich and mellow to wrap all the meat (or pulses), vegetables and sauces up in a velvety hug. The former could be a pinot noir, such as the refreshing raspberry tang of Taste the Difference Rheinhessen Pinot Noir 2018 (\u00a38, Sainsbury\u2019s) or the silky-supple gorgeousness of Ren\u00e9 Lamy Chassagne-Montrachet 2015 (\u00a324, <a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/products/rene-lamy-chassagne-montrachet\">the Co-op</a>). For the latter, it could be something pepper spicy and rich, such as Domaine Font de Michelle Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, France 2016 (\u00a323.99, <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/domaine-font-de-michelle-chateauneuf-du-pape-rhone--france/058622-29487-29488\">Waitrose</a>) or, for a softer, more relaxed alternative, the superb-value grand reserva Rioja made for Sainsbury\u2019s by the excellent CVNE.</p> <p><strong>Waitrose Sauternes Ch\u00e2teau Suduiraut, France 2011 (\u00a315.99 for 37.5cl, <a href=\"https://www.waitrosecellar.com/all-wines/popular-regions/waitrose-sauternes-chateau-suduiraut\">Waitrose</a>) </strong>For puddings, cheese and sheer sugary indulgence, a dessert wine is more than a must (if you\u2019ll excuse what just about passes for a cracker-worthy wine pun on the word for pre-fermented grape juice). Actually, as a Christmas morning aperitif, few wines are more joyously suited (and, at 5% or so abv, more appropriately weighted) than the gently foaming, floral sweet wines of Asti in Piemonte, such as <a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/asti-spumante-case-of-6/p/p21127273\">M&amp;S\u2019s Asti NV (\u00a37)</a>. Also excellent value, Les Jardiniers Muscat de Saint-Jean de Minervois, Languedoc, France (\u00a35.25, 37.5cl, <a href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/buy-6/sainsburys-muscat-de-st-jean-de-minervois-375cl\">Sainsbury\u2019s</a>) is gently honeyed and just lovely with a mince pie and a hunk of cheese. But for stilton and the richer desserts, Sauternes is hard to beat, with Waitrose\u2019s collaboration with the respected Ch\u00e2teau Suduiraut a finely balanced, luxurious treat.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Domaine des Valanges, Saint-V\u00e9ran, France 2018 (\u00a312, the Co-op) Calling an election in the run-up to Christmas may not be very far up the long list of Boris Johnson\u2019s worst misdemeanours. But I doubt I\u2019m the only one who wishes he\u2019d chosen a different time to stir up the foul storm we\u2019ve just endured. How many of us are only now picking up the pieces of our shattered festive preparations? I suspect last-minute shopping will be the lot of millions of us today, and that includes choosing what to drink on this much-needed holiday. I\u2019ll start with two classic French dry whites that should be on the shelves of a store near you: the crystal-clear, lime and cut-grass class of Les Ruettes Sancerre 2018 (\u00a314, M&amp;S) and the golden apple and almond of Domaine des Valanges\u2019s top-notch chardonnay. Taste the Difference Gran Reserva, Rioja, Spain 2012 (\u00a312, Sainsbury\u2019s) For the red wine for the Christmas meal, I tend to go one of two ways: either something light and racy to cut through all the fatty richness; or something rich and mellow to wrap all the meat (or pulses), vegetables and sauces up in a velvety hug. The former could be a pinot noir, such as the refreshing raspberry tang of Taste the Difference Rheinhessen Pinot Noir 2018 (\u00a38, Sainsbury\u2019s) or the silky-supple gorgeousness of Ren\u00e9 Lamy Chassagne-Montrachet 2015 (\u00a324, the Co-op). For the latter, it could be something pepper spicy and rich, such as Domaine Font de Michelle Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, France 2016 (\u00a323.99, Waitrose) or, for a softer, more relaxed alternative, the superb-value grand reserva Rioja made for Sainsbury\u2019s by the excellent CVNE. Waitrose Sauternes Ch\u00e2teau Suduiraut, France 2011 (\u00a315.99 for 37.5cl, Waitrose) For puddings, cheese and sheer sugary indulgence, a dessert wine is more than a must (if you\u2019ll excuse what just about passes for a cracker-worthy wine pun on the word for pre-fermented grape juice). Actually, as a Christmas morning aperitif, few wines are more joyously suited (and, at 5% or so abv, more appropriately weighted) than the gently foaming, floral sweet wines of Asti in Piemonte, such as M&amp;S\u2019s Asti NV (\u00a37). Also excellent value, Les Jardiniers Muscat de Saint-Jean de Minervois, Languedoc, France (\u00a35.25, 37.5cl, Sainsbury\u2019s) is gently honeyed and just lovely with a mince pie and a hunk of cheese. But for stilton and the richer desserts, Sauternes is hard to beat, with Waitrose\u2019s collaboration with the respected Ch\u00e2teau Suduiraut a finely balanced, luxurious treat.

Us national newspaper journalists can fairly be accused of not getting off the beaten track often enough. We shouldn\u2019t expect plaudits when we do. But it does explain the happy choice this week, of the polished gem that is Persian Cottage in Middlesbrough. It\u2019s a brightly lit, wood-floored space just beyond the town centre, where the ornate tablecloths come plastic-covered for a quick wipe down.</p> <p>That evening we had recorded a fine show. We had conducted a detailed interrogation of the breaded chicken-and-cheese drunk-food wonder that is the parmo, to the dismay of some locals who didn\u2019t want the city known only for that, and the utter delight of others. Now we needed dinner. I took a punt based on a long-held but quietly kept belief: you will rarely eat badly in a Middle Eastern grill house. Even the mediocre ones are good. Which means that the good ones, like Persian Cottage, are cracking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f4a8041777668bd804b6a03a2cb1d4ab5583bcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f4a8041777668bd804b6a03a2cb1d4ab5583bcd/0_263_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Still smoking lightly from the charcoal\u2019: mixed grill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Still smoking lightly from the charcoal\u2019: mixed grill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The basic proposition \u2013 meats grilled over charcoal, rugged dips and salads \u2013 hides huge regional variations. At Persian Cottage that regional variation starts with the rice. I try to avoid hyperbole, but sod it: Persian rice is the best way with rice. It is the rice of your dreams, if your dreams involve rice, which sometimes they should do. It is light and fluffy and every grain is separate so that even with the traditional application of a little butter \u2013 foil wrapped pats are provided here for a bit of self-mixing \u2013 it never turns into some bolus of carbs. It is a wonder of the culinary world.</p> <p>I wanted to know how it\u2019s done, so I turned to the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sabrina-ghayour\" title=\"\">Sabrina Ghayour</a> and her book <em>Persiana</em>. Apparently, it\u2019s a two-stage process. First the rice must be parboiled and rinsed to shift the starch. Then it must be steamed. It sounds like a faff, but it\u2019s a worthwhile faff. Here we have it both with the woozy aromatics of saffron, and \u201cgreen\u201d with handfuls of fresh herbs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c508f3b5db4b10777765d644db3bac3f58d82b92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c508f3b5db4b10777765d644db3bac3f58d82b92/0_237_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Night-dark, sweet-sour and rugged\u2019: fesenjan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Night-dark, sweet-sour and rugged\u2019: fesenjan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It accompanies a groaning mixed grill of kebabs, still smoking lightly from the charcoal.

From a list of stews, we have fesenjan, a night-dark dish of chicken braised in a rugged sweet-and-sour sauce of blitzed walnuts and pomegranate paste. Aubergine comes in two different ways. There\u2019s the deep green of kashk e bademjan, for which it\u2019s fried until falling apart then mashed with walnuts, mint and whey, so that it\u2019s vibrating with acidity and vigour. By contrast, in mirza ghasemi, the aubergine is grilled, then beaten with garlic, tomato and crushed pieces of boiled egg, and a motherload of fried onions. It\u2019s altogether deeper and darker. Naturally we have hummus, the lightest of takes courtesy of a ballast of tahini, and a classic fattoush of cracked wheat and flatleaf parsley and lemon.

You fail to add that the reason for this immense violence is prohibition. Prohibition gives criminal gangs control of the estimated $425bn that the drugs trade generates worldwide every year. Drug money, not drugs per se, is the issue. No one, from the cartels in Mexico to county lines gangs in Britain, is involved in violent crime over drugs, but over the vast money to be made through the trade. The only way to control the money is through legalisation. Until drugs are legalised and regulated, with strict quality and sales controls, similar to those applied for alcohol, such criminality will continue.<br><strong>Tony Jackson</strong><br>Camusterrach, Applecross Scottish Highlands<br></p> <h2>Couldn\u2019t make it up </h2> <p>Those interviewed in the article about women reading more fiction than men (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/07/why-women-love-literature-read-fiction-helen-taylor\" title=\"\">Why women love literature</a>\u201d, The New Review, 8 December) claimed that women are more empathetic, more social, more curious and that they have a bit more imagination than men.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s about time people began to call out carbon offsetting for what it is (\u201cIf only saving the planet were as easy as planting a tree before speeding off in our SUVs\u201d, Comment). But if we\u2019re going to take issue with flight redemption initiatives, then we need to also call out the carbon offsetting delusion that is recycling, which promotes the notion that simply by putting mountains of packaging in the recycling bin and then paying someone else to deal with it, the slop of our profligate lifestyle is somehow neutralised. Our recourse to the bottomless pit that is the recycling bin has encouraged us to be less responsible shoppers and disposers of waste than ever, and facilitated the unchecked explosion of the use of plastic packaging. It would be bad news even if the waste were actually being recycled, but we now know that much of it isn\u2019t; it is simply being transported to lands far, far away or ending up in our oceans. The time has come to rethink our approach to recycling: it has to be a last-ditch option, not a get-out card. There is only one way out of the climate crisis and that\u2019s for us all to try to use less carbon in the first place, and to put pressure on companies to do the same. Jane Tidbury Brittany, France How to halt drug violence Your article on the killing of a young boy notes that \u201cillegal drugs markets are... a \u2018golden thread\u2019 running through many accounts of violence in London and elsewhere\u201d (\u201cThe long path to Jaden Moodie\u2019s murder\u201d, Viewpoint). Correct. You fail to add that the reason for this immense violence is prohibition. Prohibition gives criminal gangs control of the estimated $425bn that the drugs trade generates worldwide every year. Drug money, not drugs per se, is the issue. No one, from the cartels in Mexico to county lines gangs in Britain, is involved in violent crime over drugs, but over the vast money to be made through the trade. The only way to control the money is through legalisation. Until drugs are legalised and regulated, with strict quality and sales controls, similar to those applied for alcohol, such criminality will continue. Tony Jackson Camusterrach, Applecross Scottish Highlands Couldn\u2019t make it up Those interviewed in the article about women reading more fiction than men (\u201cWhy women love literature\u201d, The New Review, 8 December) claimed that women are more empathetic, more social, more curious and that they have a bit more imagination than men. It seems that reading fiction has not prevented these women, in particular, from making such sweeping statements. Craig Hutton Smethwick, West Midlands The road to cleaner air Air pollution kills more people in the UK than prostate and breast cancers combined, and, as you point out, it harms children\u2019s cognitive development (\u201cExperts raise new fears over UK\u2019s killer air pollution\u201d, News). We need urgent action. Long commutes to work are a major cause of air pollution, as well as global warming, and expensive and miserable for most people involved. Instead of building new, faster roads (which encourages people to apply for jobs even further from where they live), the government needs to ensure jobs are near to homes. New housing estates need to provide commercial buildings, too. Public sector recruitment must prioritise local candidates. And empty shops in town centres must be turned into homes.

For California farmers with thousands of acres to irrigate and millions of dollars on the line, the smelt are in the way \u2013 the state<strong> </strong>listed the species as endangered in 2009, and in effect constrained how much water can be pulled from the delta.</p> <p>Now, the creatures caught in the crossfire of the state\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/19/trump-california-water-wars-environmental-standards-memo\">water wars</a> have all but disappeared, and biologists worry that newly empowered forces within the Trump administration could usher them into oblivion.</p> <h2>A delicate balance</h2> <p>From the deck of the research boat, gliding down Cache Slough, it\u2019s easy enough to imagine how the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta used to look \u2013 before the Gold Rush, before colonial settlers built their farms and ranches, before they constrained the marsh with levees and cut its flow with dams and diversions, before massive pumps began sucking it dry, before all the infrastructure drove native wildlife to the brink of extinction.</p> <p>Leaning back in the boat, Durand watches his crew of students and research assistants toss a cone-shaped net off the stern, arc through the air and splash into the water. \u201cThe whole process is just beautiful,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the helm, Christopher Jasper, a graduate student, motors forward, dragging the trawl down the slough for five minutes.

Photographs: Mette Lampcov/The Guardian</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the course of the day, they count a total of 78 fish, including some native species, like the splittail, and some invasive ones, including a massive catfish. But no smelt.</p> <p>Soon after UC Davis researchers first began sampling in the delta, nearly 40 years ago, the delta smelt populations suffered a huge blow: their numbers had suddenly declined by more than 80%. Their numbers dipped even lower after a period of extended drought in the late 80s and early 90s, then lower still during California\u2019s most recent drought, which lasted from 2012 through 2016. During these dry spells, California\u2019s cities and farms needed to pump more and more delta water \u2013 leaving these fish without enough fresh, cold water to survive.</p> <p>Because most Delta smelt live for just one year, even temporary environmental changes can decimate the population. It\u2019s not just the overpumping, but the pumps themselves that have strained the smelt.

He and other officials who drafted the reports \u201care career professionals\u201d, Souza said in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cWe have led this effort with our teams over the past year and this is a career conservation professional documentation.\u201d</p> <p>Westlands contests that the biological opinion benefits them in any way. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the new biological opinions will produce a single drop of additional water for Westlands,\u201d says Tom Birmingham, the agency\u2019s general manager. \u201cWhat the new biological opinions do is provide a degree of operational flexibility,\u201d he says, allowing the pumps to take more water when more is available.</p> <p>\u201cI have confidence in the ability of the agencies to conduct real-time monitoring, and to adjust operations of the project based on real-time monitoring,\u201d he says, noting that federal and state operations are already using these techniques to scan the estuary for turbid conditions that could attract smelt.</p> <p>Shortly after the new biological opinions were released, Westlands concluded negotiations to permanently lock in its water service contract, which entitles them to 1.15m acre-feet of water per year \u2013 <a href=\"https://data.lacity.org/A-Livable-and-Sustainable-City/LADWP-Water-Supply-in-Acre-Feet/qyvz-diiw\">about twice</a> what the city of Los Angeles uses annually. Birmingham points out that the provision to convert its contract is courtesy of a 2016 law, which was approved by a bipartisan Congress and signed into law by Barack Obama.</p> <p>Westlands, he says, is being unfairly antagonized by environmental groups. \u201cI read the criticisms of the new biological opinions,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I have to ask myself, have the people expressing those criticisms read the same document?\u201d</p> <h2>California fighting words</h2> <p>Back on the research boat, as an afternoon of sampling winds down, and the weather warms and mellows and stills, it\u2019s impossible not to notice the spicy scent of dung and fertilizer in the air. Durand points at a group of cows, sleepily grazing and dumping at the banks of Cache Slough. \u201cAs biologists, we call those ecosystem inputs,\u201d he says with a laugh. Dung from these cows, and runoff from the nut orchards and fruit farms a few yards inland infuse nutrients into the water that triggers algal blooms. Sometimes, too many nutrients in the water cause plants and algae to overgrow, die and drain the system of oxygen. But this time of year, the system could use a bit of nutrient infusion to feed the delta\u2019s fish.</p> <p>Agriculture and nature can work together, Durand says, so long as people are willing to let them. \u201cEverybody wants to be the good guy, and do right by the environment,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that, having talked to some of the local farmers and ranchers in this area.\u201d</p> <p>The trouble is, once environmental groups and government officials start talking about reallocating water rights and rationing, \u201cthose are triggers, those are fighting words in California\u201d, he says. \u201cRevolutions are expensive, I guess, and no one wants to be the one to pay for them.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the federal government\u2019s chipping away of protections for endangered fish, environmental and fishing industry groups have banded together to <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/environment/article/Fishing-groups-sue-federal-agencies-over-latest-14879831.php\">sue</a> the federal government, as well, alleging that fewer protections for smelt, steelhead trout, and Chinook salmon will devastate the delta ecosystem and commercial fisheries will be the collateral.</p> <p>California\u2019s state government has joined the morass as well: California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom declared that the state is drafting litigation as well. \u201cAs stewards of this state\u2019s remarkable natural resources, we must do everything in our power to protect them,\u201d Newsom announced. \u201cThe next generations of Californians deserve nothing less.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1218511473de42045d05821be0654adf61478314\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1218511473de42045d05821be0654adf61478314/0_0_3300_2200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Research scientist John Durand, Chris Jasper, a graduate student in ecology, and Avery Kruger, a research specialist, check out a Mississippi grass shrimp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Research scientist John Durand, Chris Jasper, a graduate student in ecology, and Avery Kruger, a research specialist, check out a Mississippi grass shrimp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mette Lampcov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In response, the federal reclamation commissioner, Brenda Burman, derided Newsom\u2019s preference \u201cto have judges dictate these important projects instead of the career professionals at the federal and state levels who have developed a plan based on the best science and significant input from the public.\u201d If Californians want a legal fight, she said in a statement to the Guardian, \u201cthat\u2019s their choice, we\u2019ll see them in court\u201d.</p> <p>Westlands has reportedly <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/water-and-drought/article238511218.html\">threatened</a> to walk away from state efforts to broker water-sharing deals if Newsom sues.</p> <p>It could take years for the full effects of the new policy and litigation to become apparent. \u201cIn the meantime, know what\u2019s ironic?\u201d says Rosenfield. \u201cEven if the smelt disappeared, and we no longer had to worry about protecting them, it\u2019s not like we could get much more water out of the system.\u201d</p> <p>A 2019 <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8mh3r97j#main\">study</a> by Rosenfield and his colleagues at the San Francisco Bay Institute and the Nature Conservancy found that the amount of water the pumps could pull was most often limited by the need to keep saltwater at bay. If enough fresh water isn\u2019t, to paraphrase Donald Trump, shoved out to sea, the sea will shove into shore, flooding the estuary with salt water. \u201cAnd, no one wants salt water,\u201d Rosenfield says. \u201cYou cannot apply saltwater to farmland. That\u2019s what the Romans did to punish their enemies.\u201d<br><br>In most years between 2011 and 2018 \u2013 at peak drought \u2013 maintenance issues, and a lack of storage capacity limited pumping more than the smelt did, as did protections for other threatened and endangered fish. \u201cThe smelt are just a scapegoat,\u201d Rosenfield says.</p> <p>Durand says he\u2019s sick of talking about delta smelt. \u201cAt the end of the day, sure, it\u2019s just a crummy little fish and there aren\u2019t a lot of them left,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then, every time we lose a species it\u2019s just a sign that there are more losses to come.\u201d</p> <p>If the delta smelt go, California may be able to pump some more. But then their cousins, the longfin smelt, could disappear next, and then the steelhead trout, and then the various populations of Chinook salmon. \u201cWhere do we draw the line?\u201d Durand says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much more stress the system can take.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a warm November morning, John Durand squints over the stern of a small research boat, and gestures toward gray-blue water, and the chaotic tangles of tube-like tule reeds. \u201cCache Slough right here had been known as a hotspot for delta smelt,\u201d he says. But it\u2019s been four years since Durand and his team of researchers from the University of California, Davis, have found the finger-length fish that gleam golden and \u201csmell kind of like cucumber\u201d in the brackish streams and sloughs of northern California\u2019s bay delta. Does he think we\u2019ll see any today? Durand chuckles and combs his fingers through his white goatee. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because the smelt are a small fish, and now they\u2019re a rare fish, but they still loom large over all our environmental and water policies,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to put on a little fish.\u201d For conservationists and ecologists like Durand, the delta smelt are harbingers, their diminishing numbers a signal that the delta\u2019s ecosystem is dangerously close to collapse. For California farmers with thousands of acres to irrigate and millions of dollars on the line, the smelt are in the way \u2013 the state listed the species as endangered in 2009, and in effect constrained how much water can be pulled from the delta. Now, the creatures caught in the crossfire of the state\u2019s water wars have all but disappeared, and biologists worry that newly empowered forces within the Trump administration could usher them into oblivion. A delicate balance From the deck of the research boat, gliding down Cache Slough, it\u2019s easy enough to imagine how the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta used to look \u2013 before the Gold Rush, before colonial settlers built their farms and ranches, before they constrained the marsh with levees and cut its flow with dams and diversions, before massive pumps began sucking it dry, before all the infrastructure drove native wildlife to the brink of extinction. Leaning back in the boat, Durand watches his crew of students and research assistants toss a cone-shaped net off the stern, arc through the air and splash into the water. \u201cThe whole process is just beautiful,\u201d he says. At the helm, Christopher Jasper, a graduate student, motors forward, dragging the trawl down the slough for five minutes. Then the crew lifts the net up, splashes the contents into a bucket. \u201cAll right, what have we got?\u201d Jasper positions his pen over a clipboard. \u201cAmerican shad, 67mm,\u201d yells Caroline Newell, her indigo hair exploding out of the back of her UC Davis baseball cap. \u201cOh, you\u2019re looking a little stressed there, buddy,\u201d she says, struggling to lay a flailing Sacramento splittail flat so she can measure it, before tossing it overboard. Over the course of the day, they count a total of 78 fish, including some native species, like the splittail, and some invasive ones, including a massive catfish. But no smelt. Soon after UC Davis researchers first began sampling in the delta, nearly 40 years ago, the delta smelt populations suffered a huge blow: their numbers had suddenly declined by more than 80%. Their numbers dipped even lower after a period of extended drought in the late 80s and early 90s, then lower still during California\u2019s most recent drought, which lasted from 2012 through 2016. During these dry spells, California\u2019s cities and farms needed to pump more and more delta water \u2013 leaving these fish without enough fresh, cold water to survive. Because most Delta smelt live for just one year, even temporary environmental changes can decimate the population. It\u2019s not just the overpumping, but the pumps themselves that have strained the smelt. The smelt are poor swimmers, and they\u2019re drawn to cloudy, turbid patches of water, where they like to hide and feed. The trouble is, the behemoth pumps run by the state and federal government, which can draw up to 10,000 and 5,500 cubic feet of water per second, respectively, can cause rivers to run backward, sucking smelt and other fish into their system. In an attempt to engineer their way out of problems born from an over-engineered ecosystem, the US Bureau of Reclamation built a \u201cfish collection facility\u201d a couple of miles north of the pumps. Fish headed toward the machinery are corralled with nets and redirected to collection tanks, where they\u2019re catalogued before being trucked back into other parts of the estuary. \u201cThe problem is, while they\u2019re going through that system of canals, or waiting in a truck, they\u2019re exposed to all these other fish, all these predators that are happily snacking on them the whole time,\u201d says Jon Rosenfield, a fish biologist at San Francisco Baykeeper, an environmental watchdog group. Those that make it through the labyrinth, face hordes of bass who swarm the spots where trucks release their bounty. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bass have been trained to show up at certain times to feed,\u201d Rosenfield says. And after all of that, the smelt may still die from the stress of the whole ordeal, or they may get caught up in the pumps again \u2013 rinse and repeat. A 2012 study found that the whole system was, ultimately, inefficient, though the reclamation bureau says the program has been tweaked to separate predators and make the experience more comfortable for the fish. All the while, delta smelt have also been coping with the encroachment of invasive species. Invasive overbite clams and Asian clams have been leaving the smelt with less to eat. The striped bass and largemouth bass are invaders, as are Mississippi silversides, which feed on smelt eggs and young \u2013 though scientists have contested whether these predators are responsible for smelt declines. Underlying many of these issues is the climate crisis, which has fueled extended periods of drought and heatwaves that have made the waters uncomfortably warm for smelt, and other species struggling to survive in a shifting delta ecosystem. It\u2019s unclear how many smelt are left in the estuary. The last time the UC Davis researchers caught one was in 2016. Surveyors from the California fish and wildlife department netted two in 2017, and none since. Based on data collected in early 2017, US Fish and Wildlife extrapolated that about 48,000 were still surfing the sloughs, but researchers say it\u2019s unclear how many delta smelt still exist in the wild. \u201cI\u2019d guess at least a thousand or more, but we have no way of actually knowing,\u201d Durand says. \u201cAt this point, they barely register in the ecosystem.\u201d So, why do they still get so many Californians so riled up? Water wars Even Donald Trump has an opinion on the delta smelt. At a March 2016 campaign rally in Fresno, California \u2013 in the state\u2019s agricultural heartland \u2013 then presidential candidate Trump mocked the environmentalists who were desperate \u201cto protect a certain kind of three-inch fish\u201d. \u201cThey have farms here and they don\u2019t get water,\u201d he said, as the crowd, holding up green \u201cFarmers for Trump\u201d signs booed. \u201cIt is so ridiculous they\u2019re taking the water and shoving it out to sea.\u201d That night, Trump promised the farmers more water. Ever since then, his administration has been making moves to make good on that pledge. Last fall, Trump signed a memorandum directing federal agencies to review and roll back environmental standards slowing down the flow of water to farms in the Central Valley. In February this year, the president nominated David Bernhardt to serve as his interior secretary. Before joining the administration, Bernhardt worked as a lobbyist and lawyer for the Westlands Water District, the nation\u2019s largest agricultural water contractor. The agency serves some of California\u2019s wealthiest, most powerful farmers \u2013 delivering up to 1.19m acre-feet of irrigation water from the delta each year. In 2014, Bernhardt represented Westlands in an appeals case challenging Endangered Species Act protections for delta smelt. Upon taking office, he named the water district in his ethics recusal letter, promising not to \u201cparticipate personally and substantially\u201d in policy issues that could affect his former clients, unless he obtained a waiver. Watchdog groups say Bernhardt hasn\u2019t quite kept his word. Even as he oversaw a board effort to weaken Endangered Species Act protections to ease conditions for the oil and logging industries, he delivered a huge victory to Westlands, rolling back protections for the delta smelt and the endangered Chinook salmon and paving the way for more pumping. When scientists from the marine fisheries service in July submitted a thousand-page report warning that more pumping would jeopardize several species including endangered winter-run Chinook salmon and the southern resident killer whales that eat salmon, the interior department pulled the document. New reports, called biological opinions, released in October and overseen by the department\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service found that the salmon wouldn\u2019t be imperiled, and a separate delta smelt opinion similarly concluded that the fish would be just fine. The agency touted \u201csmarter delta operations through real-time adaptive management and greater management oversight of delta pumping operations informed by updated science\u201d to help the smelt and other endangered species recover even as the mammoth state and federal pumps drained more water out of the ecosystem. On Thursday, the Trump administration released its final environmental impact statement on the pumping plan, which claims to manage water in an \u201cenvironmentally and economically sound manner\u201d. That\u2019s much easier said than done, Rosenfield says. \u201cThe \u2018real-time management\u2019 part especially has some huge air quotes around it.\u201d The idea is that federal scientists will monitor the water, and signal for the pumps to be turned down.

He and other officials who drafted the reports \u201care career professionals\u201d, Souza said in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cWe have led this effort with our teams over the past year and this is a career conservation professional documentation.\u201d Westlands contests that the biological opinion benefits them in any way. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the new biological opinions will produce a single drop of additional water for Westlands,\u201d says Tom Birmingham, the agency\u2019s general manager. \u201cWhat the new biological opinions do is provide a degree of operational flexibility,\u201d he says, allowing the pumps to take more water when more is available. \u201cI have confidence in the ability of the agencies to conduct real-time monitoring, and to adjust operations of the project based on real-time monitoring,\u201d he says, noting that federal and state operations are already using these techniques to scan the estuary for turbid conditions that could attract smelt. Shortly after the new biological opinions were released, Westlands concluded negotiations to permanently lock in its water service contract, which entitles them to 1.15m acre-feet of water per year \u2013 about twice what the city of Los Angeles uses annually. Birmingham points out that the provision to convert its contract is courtesy of a 2016 law, which was approved by a bipartisan Congress and signed into law by Barack Obama. Westlands, he says, is being unfairly antagonized by environmental groups. \u201cI read the criticisms of the new biological opinions,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I have to ask myself, have the people expressing those criticisms read the same document?\u201d California fighting words Back on the research boat, as an afternoon of sampling winds down, and the weather warms and mellows and stills, it\u2019s impossible not to notice the spicy scent of dung and fertilizer in the air. Durand points at a group of cows, sleepily grazing and dumping at the banks of Cache Slough. \u201cAs biologists, we call those ecosystem inputs,\u201d he says with a laugh. Dung from these cows, and runoff from the nut orchards and fruit farms a few yards inland infuse nutrients into the water that triggers algal blooms. Sometimes, too many nutrients in the water cause plants and algae to overgrow, die and drain the system of oxygen. But this time of year, the system could use a bit of nutrient infusion to feed the delta\u2019s fish. Agriculture and nature can work together, Durand says, so long as people are willing to let them. \u201cEverybody wants to be the good guy, and do right by the environment,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that, having talked to some of the local farmers and ranchers in this area.\u201d The trouble is, once environmental groups and government officials start talking about reallocating water rights and rationing, \u201cthose are triggers, those are fighting words in California\u201d, he says. \u201cRevolutions are expensive, I guess, and no one wants to be the one to pay for them.\u201d In response to the federal government\u2019s chipping away of protections for endangered fish, environmental and fishing industry groups have banded together to sue the federal government, as well, alleging that fewer protections for smelt, steelhead trout, and Chinook salmon will devastate the delta ecosystem and commercial fisheries will be the collateral. California\u2019s state government has joined the morass as well: California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom declared that the state is drafting litigation as well. \u201cAs stewards of this state\u2019s remarkable natural resources, we must do everything in our power to protect them,\u201d Newsom announced. \u201cThe next generations of Californians deserve nothing less.\u201d In response, the federal reclamation commissioner, Brenda Burman, derided Newsom\u2019s preference \u201cto have judges dictate these important projects instead of the career professionals at the federal and state levels who have developed a plan based on the best science and significant input from the public.\u201d If Californians want a legal fight, she said in a statement to the Guardian, \u201cthat\u2019s their choice, we\u2019ll see them in court\u201d. Westlands has reportedly threatened to walk away from state efforts to broker water-sharing deals if Newsom sues. It could take years for the full effects of the new policy and litigation to become apparent. \u201cIn the meantime, know what\u2019s ironic?\u201d says Rosenfield. \u201cEven if the smelt disappeared, and we no longer had to worry about protecting them, it\u2019s not like we could get much more water out of the system.\u201d A 2019 study by Rosenfield and his colleagues at the San Francisco Bay Institute and the Nature Conservancy found that the amount of water the pumps could pull was most often limited by the need to keep saltwater at bay. If enough fresh water isn\u2019t, to paraphrase Donald Trump, shoved out to sea, the sea will shove into shore, flooding the estuary with salt water. \u201cAnd, no one wants salt water,\u201d Rosenfield says. \u201cYou cannot apply saltwater to farmland. That\u2019s what the Romans did to punish their enemies.\u201d In most years between 2011 and 2018 \u2013 at peak drought \u2013 maintenance issues, and a lack of storage capacity limited pumping more than the smelt did, as did protections for other threatened and endangered fish. \u201cThe smelt are just a scapegoat,\u201d Rosenfield says. Durand says he\u2019s sick of talking about delta smelt. \u201cAt the end of the day, sure, it\u2019s just a crummy little fish and there aren\u2019t a lot of them left,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then, every time we lose a species it\u2019s just a sign that there are more losses to come.\u201d If the delta smelt go, California may be able to pump some more. But then their cousins, the longfin smelt, could disappear next, and then the steelhead trout, and then the various populations of Chinook salmon. \u201cWhere do we draw the line?\u201d Durand says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much more stress the system can take.\u201d",

Though there is religion\u2026 and a saint, Saint Maurice, whose image is found in several places, including a church in ski resort St Moritz (which is named after him). Saint Maurice was black, which for a third-century saint was unusual.</p> <p>Maurice\u2019s history is fascinating, subtle and unexpected. It reveals much about how leaders of the past have used diversity to indicate their authority. Saint Maurice may not even have existed, but he became a focus of pilgrimage, and in later centuries Frederick the Great co-opted Maurice\u2019s image to show how powerful he was (the Roman Empire would have huge parades of people of different ethnicity to indicate the empire\u2019s far-reaching power).</p> <p>There are several such stories in Audible\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000cm56\" title=\"\">In Search of Black History With Bonnie Greer</a>.</strong> Black history and experience is proving to be a fruitful area for podcasts: Nikole Hannah-Jones\u2019s <em>1619</em> explored how African Americans were crucial to US independence; Reni Eddo-Lodge\u2019s <em>About Race</em> is as fantastic as you would expect; and Afua Hirsch has a podcast, <em>We Need To Talk About The Briti</em><em>sh Empire</em>, coming out in February.</p> <p>Greer chooses to go back further than most. The accomplished playwright and critic has been a trustee of the British Museum in her time, and a good chunk of her podcast looks at artefacts from there, what they truly are and how they arrived. Her purpose is to rejig our common, deeply held assumptions. So we learn that not all black people in Europe arrived as slaves, that legionnaires came from diverse communities, that the Roman Empire was held back from expansion past Egypt by the African Kushites, led by Kandake, a queen. Every episode contains a historical gem that makes you gasp; a seemingly small fact that changes how you think.</p> <p>Occasionally, Greer\u2019s presentation can seem a little slow; she has a habit of seizing on the last sentence an interviewee says, repeating it with emphasis, and then explaining what the person has just said, even though they just said it. But once you get used to this, and understand these shows as a type of lecture, then the pace becomes more relaxing. Greer clearly wants our shared history to be more than the tales of white guys\u2019 exploitation and derring do \u2013 don\u2019t we all! \u2013 and her delight in discovering that it\u2019s much broader, diverse and surprising than we think transfers itself to the listener.

      "bodyText": "In Search of Black History with Bonnie Greer | Audible Originals The 1Xtra Breakfast Show with Dotty | BBC Radio 1Xtra The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show | BBC Radio 2 Yes, yes, Christmas is upon us, fa-la-la-la-laa-la-la-la-la-laaaaa etc, but before we get there, allow me to recommend an improving new podcast for you, that features no unexpected angel guests or straw-padded, makeshift cots. Though there is religion\u2026 and a saint, Saint Maurice, whose image is found in several places, including a church in ski resort St Moritz (which is named after him). Saint Maurice was black, which for a third-century saint was unusual. Maurice\u2019s history is fascinating, subtle and unexpected. It reveals much about how leaders of the past have used diversity to indicate their authority. Saint Maurice may not even have existed, but he became a focus of pilgrimage, and in later centuries Frederick the Great co-opted Maurice\u2019s image to show how powerful he was (the Roman Empire would have huge parades of people of different ethnicity to indicate the empire\u2019s far-reaching power). There are several such stories in Audible\u2019s In Search of Black History With Bonnie Greer. Black history and experience is proving to be a fruitful area for podcasts: Nikole Hannah-Jones\u2019s 1619 explored how African Americans were crucial to US independence; Reni Eddo-Lodge\u2019s About Race is as fantastic as you would expect; and Afua Hirsch has a podcast, We Need To Talk About The British Empire, coming out in February. Greer chooses to go back further than most. The accomplished playwright and critic has been a trustee of the British Museum in her time, and a good chunk of her podcast looks at artefacts from there, what they truly are and how they arrived. Her purpose is to rejig our common, deeply held assumptions. So we learn that not all black people in Europe arrived as slaves, that legionnaires came from diverse communities, that the Roman Empire was held back from expansion past Egypt by the African Kushites, led by Kandake, a queen. Every episode contains a historical gem that makes you gasp; a seemingly small fact that changes how you think. Occasionally, Greer\u2019s presentation can seem a little slow; she has a habit of seizing on the last sentence an interviewee says, repeating it with emphasis, and then explaining what the person has just said, even though they just said it. But once you get used to this, and understand these shows as a type of lecture, then the pace becomes more relaxing. Greer clearly wants our shared history to be more than the tales of white guys\u2019 exploitation and derring do \u2013 don\u2019t we all! \u2013 and her delight in discovering that it\u2019s much broader, diverse and surprising than we think transfers itself to the listener. Put it on your headphones to take your mind off the dullness of present-wrapping, and then surprise everyone at Christmas dinner with your newly learned amazing facts. Another non-Christmassy, but very festive, aspect of last week in audio was the exceedingly high proportion of Stormzy. The UK\u2019s favourite grime/pop star \u2013 perhaps the UK\u2019s favourite star at the moment \u2013 has been working hard this week to promote his new album. Not only did he edit the Observer Magazine last Sunday, he also went to his old primary school for Vice. Radio-wise, he talked to 1Xtra\u2019s Dotty, a long-time supporter, in a surprise appearance on the day of his album release, before going on Zoe Ball\u2019s Radio 2 Breakfast Show on Monday, co-hosting Annie Mac\u2019s Radio 1 evening programme the same day and making an appearance on Manny Norte\u2019s Capital Xtra show. The Dotty appearance, as ever, saw Stormzy at his most relaxed \u2013 Dotty is brilliant at making artists reveal themselves \u2013 and on Ball\u2019s show, there was a very sweet moment when one of Stormzy\u2019s primary school teachers phoned in to talk to him. Emma Cook, formerly Miss Wheeler, taught Stormzy when he was plain Michael Omari Jr. \u201cHe was a pixie,\u201d she said. \u201cI do remember having a parents evening when I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be writing \u2018da\u2019 instead of \u2018the\u2019, you won\u2019t be passing your Sats with that.\u201d \u201cMy hairline was mad back then,\u201d said Stormzy, when he saw a picture she sent in. And: \u201cLove you, Miss!\u201d A moment that only live radio can give you. Awwwww. Three non-Christmassy music shows A Life at the Piano: Elton John Special A bit of a coup for Classic FM here: the Elt joins Tim Lihoreau at the Royal Academy of Music, where Elton studied for five years as a young man. In this one-hour show, Elton talks about his classical music passions, his time at the academy, and how both inspired his songwriting. Lihoreau is himself a pianist, so creates a nice rapport and understanding, plus Elton is one of the pop world\u2019s greatest interviewees: never anything other than utterly truthful and pant-wettingly funny. A must-listen. The Untold: Jay-Z and Me Part II Radio 4\u2019s Untold strand is consistently a network highlight, and it has already told the first part of the story of Hannah Williams, whose singing was sampled by Jay-Z for his multi-platinum hit 4:44. Unfortunately, as her music was deemed a sample, rather than a feature (she didn\u2019t write the song), she only got around \u00a31,200\u2026 This is Part II of the story, which follows Hannah after she quit her job as head of music at the University of Winchester in order to pursue her life with her band, Hannah Williams and the Affirmations. Rewiring Raymond Scott Raymond Scott made electronic music far ahead of his time.

About 10% (if that) couldn\u2019t care less, and trying to catch their eye, let alone hope that one\u2019s drip might be changed through the night, despite the loud electronic beeping that must be such a distraction to their staff station texting, is a lost cause.</p> <p>But Stafford, in those days and in the throes of demi-semi-privatisation, seemed a small sprawl of target-ticking before healthcare or even empathy: genuinely nasty, hence such a shame this wasn\u2019t done with more nuance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63ca815e639de6292ed87155d5e427cf23a5f2de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63ca815e639de6292ed87155d5e427cf23a5f2de/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billy Barratt in Responsible Child\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Billy Barratt in Responsible Child.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Miller/BBC/Kudos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000cff1/responsible-child\" title=\"\"><strong>Responsible Child</strong></a> sought to highlight the mild madness of us having an extant law that allows children as young as 10 to be tried as adults when it comes to murder.

      "bodyText": "The Cure (Channel 4) | All 4 Responsible Child (BBC Two) | iPlayer Sticks and Stones (ITV) | ITV Hub Shrill (BBC Three) | iPlayer Toxically lazy healthcare and pompous management putting profit before lives\u2026 bullying worthy of the Bullingdon Club\u2026 bad and stupid laws: it was almost as if the entire week\u2019s dramas/docudramas were originally scheduled to land about three weeks before the election. What a difference it might have made. In Scotland, Labour might even have managed to have scraped a higher share of the polling than before women got the vote. As such, I\u2019m not sure how well agitprop theatre transfers to the screen. Ever. We saw it chiefly in The Cure, Channel 4\u2019s retelling of the Staffs hospital crisis (for which read scandal) of the mid-00s. It contained, occasionally, wonderful acting, chiefly from Sian Brooke as doughty campaigner Julie Bailey, whose mother died because of neglect and who led a campaign that told a small and nasty and truthful story. But, oh, the trowelling on of morality, in which every campaigner was a salt-of-the-earth, laugh-a-minute pillar of society. Alex Macqueen was, for some reason, permitted to play the villain, the head of the fledgling private trust, with no subtlety whatsoever: had Alex had a Baron Richprick moustache he would have twirled it, cartoonishly. Even the Stafford people, who bridled somewhat at the threat of their A&amp;E facilities being summarily closed, were portrayed as worthily, if donkey jacketedly, misguided, and this was about as subtle as it got. Anyone who\u2019s spent any time in an NHS ward over the past few years, and I\u2019ve done my fair share of sudden weeks, knows that 90% of nurses are overworked, harried, beset by pointless protocol, yet, by and large, wonderful, and always go the extra mile. About 10% (if that) couldn\u2019t care less, and trying to catch their eye, let alone hope that one\u2019s drip might be changed through the night, despite the loud electronic beeping that must be such a distraction to their staff station texting, is a lost cause. But Stafford, in those days and in the throes of demi-semi-privatisation, seemed a small sprawl of target-ticking before healthcare or even empathy: genuinely nasty, hence such a shame this wasn\u2019t done with more nuance. Similarly, Responsible Child sought to highlight the mild madness of us having an extant law that allows children as young as 10 to be tried as adults when it comes to murder. As an argument, it works. As a drama, it didn\u2019t. There were grand performances in this drama based on a real-life case \u2013 Michelle Fairley, Stephen Campbell Moore, Billy Barratt \u2013 but way too much clunky expositioning. \u201cYou know if Ray was tried through the youth courts the decision would lie solely with the judge? Who\u2019d make a decision based around all aspects of the child\u2019s life? But this is murder. And he has to face a jury,\u201d the barrister explains to the solicitor, who might reasonably have been expected to know all this already. How could this have been done more subtly? I racked my brains, but that was for six minutes in bed last night and I\u2019m not yet being paid to be a TV dramatist. Someone was. Most entertaining, if thunderously flawed, was Sticks and Stones, a tale of gaslighting/bullying at work, in which a team of unappealing property managers \u2013 as if there\u2019s any other kind \u2013 turns on the weakest of their flock, nice guy Thomas, an increasingly good, if stressed (as in iron-band-round-head) Ken Nwosu.

      "bodyText": "Australian households saved $65 on their power bills over the past year, according to the competition watchdog. The latest Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report into the national electricity market, released on Sunday, found average annual residential electricity bills dropped about 4% compared with the previous year. But despite \u201cmodest\u201d savings the watchdog warned that electricity affordability \u201cis still a concern that requires attention\u201d \u2013 particularly because solar panels reduce bills for those households which have them, while others shoulder the cost of feed-in-tariffs. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and energy minister, Angus Taylor, took credit for the result, citing the Coalition\u2019s reforms creating a default market offer which the ACCC found had a positive impact since it came into force on 1 July. Between July 2018 and September 2019, the average annual residential bill was $1,509, a decrease of $65 in real terms. But average bills and effective prices are \u201cwell above levels a decade ago\u201d, up $254 \u2013 or about 20% \u2013 since 2007-08, the ACCC said. In that time, environmental costs such as solar feed-in-tariffs added $103 to the average bill and network costs added $81. Retail and other costs contributed $53 and wholesale electricity prices added $20 to the average bill, but retail margins shaved $3 off. Network costs peaked in 2014-15 and have since declined, but environmental costs continue to add to bills, including $8 per customer in the past year. Customers with solar panels now make up about 16% of all residential customers in the national electricity market. The average household pays about $550 a year more than a household with solar panels. ACCC chair Rod Sims said the regulator is concerned about additional costs imposed by schemes such as feed-in-tariffs on households that cannot access or afford to install solar panels. \u201cThe cost of installing solar panels has reduced significantly in recent years, so environmental schemes like the premium [feed-in-tariffs] rebates are no longer needed to make solar an attractive option for those households that can afford it,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, all customers who can, should consider how much they could save by installing solar panels.\u201d Reforms to retailer pricing was estimated to benefit 900,000 customers on default electricity plans in South Australia, NSW, south-east Queensland and Victoria, with those consumers receiving automatic reductions in their prices. \u201cHouseholds on default plans \u2026 are estimated to save between $152 and $455 in 2019\u201320, depending on their state and distribution zone,\u201d Sims said. The ACCC recommended a suite of changes to further lower bills including: Writing down the value of state-owned network assets or providing rebates on network charges for privatised assets where there has been over-investment Abolishing environmental green schemes where they are no longer needed or moving from a direct charge to energy users to governments picking up the bill for green schemes in their budgets as a \u201cmore equitable option\u201d Improving the ability for customers to engage in the retail market and identify the cheapest electricity plans by reforming the way retailers are allowed to price and advertise Facilitating new investment in generation in a way that enhances competition to place downward pressure on wholesale costs Frydenberg and Taylor said: \u201cWhile we welcome the positive findings of the ACCC, the government remains committed to getting prices down and maintaining the reliability of our electricity system.\u201d The federal government is still considering a list of proposed new electricity generation projects to support through its underwriting scheme, including a coal generator upgrade at Lake Macquarie proposed by Delta Energy.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has signalled the Australian government will not increase its efforts to combat climate change despite an extended bushfire crisis and a record-breaking heatwave. Returning to work on Sunday after a controversial family holiday in Hawaii, the Australian prime minister apologised for his absence on top of the mea culpa he offered on Friday while still overseas. At a press conference after a visit to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service headquarters in Sydney, Morrison called on Australians to \u201cbe kind to each other\u201d and reject division \u2013 but then accused those who want more action against global heating of political point-scoring. Morrison acknowledged that his absence \u2013 leaving deputy prime minister Michael McCormack in charge since Monday \u2013 had caused \u201cgreat anxiety\u201d and said if he had his time over he \u201cwould make different decisions\u201d. Morrison asked Australians to be \u201cfair-minded\u201d, arguing he went on holiday to keep a promise to his children, and put a positive spin on the widespread community backlash at his absence. \u201cI am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so to those Australians who ... I had caused upset to I apologise for that.\u201d Morrison then sought to turn the page on the episode by unilaterally declaring \u201cthe time for that discussion is over\u201d. Morrison said there was \u201cno argument\u201d about the links \u201cbetween broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world\u201d but it was \u201cnot a credible suggestion\u201d to make a direct connection to any single fire event. Global heating is leading to longer, hotter, drier summers which experts agree increases bushfires\u2019 frequency and severity. But Morrison said it was \u201cone of many factors\u201d, listing others including backburning, vegetation management, building codes, carelessness, arson and lightning strikes. On Saturday, McCormack said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d agreed that \u201cfurther action\u201d to combat climate change is needed. Morrison appeared to snuff out hope his government will improve its policies, which have caused Australia to be rated worst out of 57 countries for its handling of climate change by a group of thinktanks. \u201cI do not accept the suggestion that Australia is not carrying its weight,\u201d he said. Morrison claimed that McCormack was \u201cmaking exactly the point I\u2019m making\u201d \u2013 citing existing commitments in the Paris agreement to decrease Australia\u2019s emissions by 26% by 2030 \u2013 although he also suggested there may be room for \u201cfurther refinement\u201d before 2030. Australia needs to cut emissions by 695m tonnes cumulatively across the next decade to meet its 2030 target. The Morrison government has said more than half of that cut, 367m tonnes, will come from accounting \u2013 using carryover credits from meeting earlier Kyoto targets \u2013 and not from practical emissions reduction. The centrepiece of Australia\u2019s policy is a $2.55bn fund to pay polluters to reduce emissions, after the Liberal-National government abolished Australia\u2019s carbon price in 2014. Asked about the use of carryover credits, Morrison replied that \u201cpeople can expect my government to do what it promised to do, what it took to the last election\u201d. \u201cI know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing.\u201d Morrison said the government would not act in a \u201cknee-jerk, crisis or panicked mode\u201d \u2013 likening his refusal to increase ambition on climate change with the steady professionalism of those managing the bushfire emergency. \u201cA panic approach and response to anything does not help. It puts people at risk. \u201cNot just their livelihoods but, I mean, if you walk out there into the control room you will not see people panicking, you will see people be very professional, very focused on the job they have, talking to each other in a very professional way and getting the job done. Government\u2019s the same thing.\u201d Minutes after calling for an end to division, arguing, partisanship and point scoring, Morrison said the Coalition is reducing emissions without the \u201creckless job-destroying and economy-crunching targets that others are seeking to force upon us\u201d. The government\u2019s own projections show Australia is on course for 50% renewables by 2030 \u2013 a target which Morrison labelled as reckless and economy-wrecking in the May election campaign. Morrison flagged that he will discuss resourcing for future emergency management with states and territories at a meeting in March. Morrison said the government is considering calls to pay volunteer firefighters, but noted that is \u201cin the first instance\u201d a matter for state governments. Morrison later visited the families of Geoff Keaton and Andrew O\u2019Dwyer, two volunteer firefighters killed late on Thursday near the town of Buxton, and conveyed his sympathies. Labor leader Anthony Albanese told reporters in Sydney it was a \u201cgood thing\u201d Morrison is back but there was \u201cno change\u201d in the prime minister\u2019s approach to the bushfires or climate change. \u201cThe deputy prime minister yesterday said [that] new measures were needed \u2026 and today, going from the acting prime minister to the real prime minister, we have a dismissal of the need for any action on climate change,\u201d he said. Albanese said Morrison\u2019s holiday was \u201ca matter for his judgement\u201d. \u201cHe chose to leave. He chose also to do it in a way that I think created a major issue of secrecy.\u201d Earlier, the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian and federal emergency management minister David Littleproud announced an additional $3.5m of disaster recovery funding to the Wingecarribee and Wollondilly local government areas.

A decade-long strategy to reinvigorate Disney\u2019s film division has reached its zenith as the all-conquering Avengers: Endgame, which passed Avatar to become the biggest grossing film of all time at $2.8bn, paved the way earlier this year for the best performance by a Hollywood studio in box office history. When the final ticket stubs are counted, Disney will have made over $11bn in 2019, having smashed its own record for annual global box office sales of $7.6bn way back in July. And that is without adding more than $2bn from films released by 20th Century Fox, which Disney bought as part of a $71bn deal to take control of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s global entertainment assets. \u201cIt is like a perfect storm for Disney that is the equivalent of a 100-year flood at the box office,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at Comscore. Disney\u2019s dominance of Hollywood is complete. Seven of the record nine films released this year that will end their run taking in $1bn-plus are Disney titles: Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Captain Marvel, Toy Story 4, Aladdin, Frozen II and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, starring Daisy Ridley.

This was followed in 2009 by the surprise $4bn purchase of Marvel Comics\u2019 superhero universe, bringing in thousands of characters including Iron Man and Captain America, which took Disney into new live-action territory. The third transformational deal was snapping up George Lucas\u2019s Lucasfilm, maker of Star Wars and the Indiana Jones franchises, in a $4bn deal in 2012. In each case the deals were criticised by City investors but it is Disney that has been laughing all the way to the bank. In 2008, just before the launch of its first Marvel film \u2013 Iron Man, starring Robert Downey Jr \u2013 Disney\u2019s share price was about $15, valuing the business at $26bn. A little over a decade on and Disney is a stock market behemoth 10 times the size with a share price of almost $150, valuing it at well over $260bn. \u201cThe spectacular year that Disney has had in 2019 is a testament to the decision-making process over the course of many years that resulted in their assembling of some of the biggest brands in film, and then creating content that is appealing to all demographics of people around the world,\u201d said Dergarabedian. Next year the steam will come out of the Disney machine with a weaker release slate, partly due to the end of the current cycle of the Marvel and Star Wars franchises.
