African Americans were not well represented in our cinema, and if they were they were caricatured and marginalised. It was sort of a way of saying, \u2018Hey<em>, we\u2019re </em>the Hollywood Africans. It\u2019s the same deal: we\u2019re playing like blackface for white people.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This was an era in which <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/jean-michel-basquiat-artist-or-celebrity/561728/\">art became enmeshed with celebrity</a> \u2013 and while that meant young artists like Basqiaut could prosper, it also ensured their work was seen as \u201cspectacle\u201d, rather than art. \u201cIt was given the same degree of analysis that we might give a K-pop star today,\u201d McCormick says.

They were ostracised and alienated from this \u2018normal America\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>This era of artists met and bonded on the street and in the nightclubs. \u201cPeople liked to dance,\u201d McCormick reminisces. \u201cNow, maybe<em> </em>Jackson Pollock liked to dance, but I\u2019m sure he danced like the ugliest white guy on the planet. This was a generation that had the beat, it had the rhythm.\u201d</p> <p>This work came at a time of great change, in the midst of the Aids crisis. \u201cWe went from partying every night to going to memorial services every week,\u201d McCormick says.

Malcolm was very influenced by what was going on in New York\u201d.</p> <p>By the 80s, he recalls, \u201cwe were all a little bit punk \u2013 even if some people were into dance music, others were into hip hop \u2026 There was this hybridity, and fashion was very much interspersed in our culture.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKeith [whose work was featured in the Witches collection] cared very much about the ability for his art to interact with the real world \u2013 the day-to-day.\u201d This continues today, with his work most accessible on T-shirts and fridge magnets.</p> <h2><strong>Self-portrait no 9 - Andy Warhol</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3220cdf4a2ce722becb789dd6c126af6212b7873\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3220cdf4a2ce722becb789dd6c126af6212b7873/0_0_2999_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Warhol Self Portrait no.9 , 1986 National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne Purchased through The Art Foundation of Victoria with the assistance of the National Gallery Women\u2019s Association, Governor, 1987 \u00a9 Andy Warhol/ARS, New York.

Many of us had moved to New York because of the Factory and Warhol\u2019s books.\u201d</p> <p>Two decades on from his seminal work in the pop art movement, Warhol became something of a mentor to artists like Haring and Basquiat. \u201cEveryone talks about how he was a little vampiric in his relationship to people, but he was very generous and very supportive. There was a beautiful connectivity \u2013 an intergenerational conversation.\u201d</p> <p>In this portrait, one year before his death, Warhol renders himself with the same pop art methods that inspired others. \u201cHe had a particular way about reaching people,\u201d McCormick says. \u201cAbout how you can do signifiers without being didactic, and how personality and life can become part of the art\u201d. \u201cAlso,\u201d he adds, \u201cAndy queered things up\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>The midnight sun - Francesco Clemente</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2607230d342188c3d04115d8d9aa875f875f898b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2607230d342188c3d04115d8d9aa875f875f898b/0_0_3000_2557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francesco Clemente\u2019s The Midnight Sun XII (1982).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"852\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He was just an incredible painter\u2019: Francesco Clemente\u2019s The Midnight Sun XII (1982).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Markel/National Gallery of Victoria</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Francesco Clemente migrated from Italy to join the scene in New York.

It was all pastels and soft edges.</p> <p>\u201cClemente had been going to India since the \u201870s and he brought in much more poetic, much more Italian, a little more mythical, allegorical [influences]. But he was also just an incredible painter. Great painters recognise great painters as something entirely distinct from all the people who don\u2019t push paint in such a magical way.\u201d</p> <p>Clemente and Basquiat are also often lumped together as neo-expressionists; whether you agree with that label or not, it\u2019s true that they defined an era of raw and emotive art. This then went \u201cout of favour\u201d towards the end of the \u201880s with the rise of <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/n/neo-geo\">neo-geo</a> (think Jeff Koons) which was \u201cmuch more about intellectualising your emotions\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Alistair Butler - Robert Mapplethorpe</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36ce32862b35a84b1a93ae3a20cbc10c7203edf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ce32862b35a84b1a93ae3a20cbc10c7203edf9/0_0_2403_3000/801.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s photograph of Alistair Butler (1980).\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s photograph of Alistair Butler (1980) is \u2018an ecstatic thing\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u201c</strong>This is an ecstatic thing,\u201d McCormick says. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a photo of an orgasm, it\u2019s one to bring you towards that ecstatic state.\u201d It might sound provocative, but when seen in the context of Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-mapplethorpes-photographs-remain-subversive-shock-value\">broader work</a> it\u2019s just a statement of fact.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Maybe<em> </em>Jackson Pollock liked to dance, but I\u2019m sure he danced like the ugliest white guy on the planet\u2026This was a generation that had the beat.</p> </blockquote> <p>The New York-based photographer had \u201ca wonderful sense of beauty, which was based off \u2018the other\u2019,\u201d McCormick says.</p> <p>\u201cObviously sexuality and fetish are part of it, but it\u2019s more interesting than that \u2026 Beauty had been so codified by then \u2013 from Boticelli to the pinup girls in the Hollywood magazines.\u201d</p> <p>Mapplethorpe portrayed the beauty of people who were \u201cinherently different \u2013 by lifestyle or by body\u201d.

Paik grew up in Korea and moved to New York in the 1960s where, McCormick says, he became \u201cone of the seminal figures of Fluxus \u2013 with Yoko Ono and all sorts of interesting people\u201d. It was another \u201cgang of friends getting together\u201d that, in fact, had much in common with Haring, Basquait and co.</p> <p>Fluxus wanted to playfully destroy the boundaries between \u201cart\u201d and \u201clife\u201d, and experiment with the nature of what art could be. The movement was also fiercely anti-consumerist and, for Paik, this was most evident in <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/523659/why-is-television-dumb-and-other-musings-by-nam-june-paik/\">his work relating to television</a>. \u201cI remember his first video was like the earliest TV you could imagine, just a video of the moon, called <a href=\"http://www.newmedia-art.org/cgi-bin/show-oeu.asp?ID=150000000023709&amp;lg=GBR\">Moon Is The Oldest TV</a>,\u201d McCormick recalls.</p> <p>In the MTV generation of the 80s, Paik went on to become \u201cthe father of video art\u201d. In Video Flag Z, he \u201creconstituted American identity as a Korean living in America\u201d. He may not have been a \u201cbratty kid\u201d but, like Basquait, Paik had a perspective so few others in the white art world could offer.</p> <p><em>\u2022 NGV\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/exhibition/keith-haring-jean-michel-basquiat/\">Keith Haring | Jean-Michel Basquiat: Crossing Lines</a> is showing in Melbourne until 11 April 2020</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 The Stories of a Scene series is supported by the National Gallery of Victoria</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "New York curator and cultural critic Carlo McCormick is proud and serene as he describes the National Gallery of Victoria\u2019s blockbuster 2020 exhibition, Crossing Lines, as a \u201ccelebration\u201d. He\u2019s also quick to note that this is not just a celebration of the men whose names are on the door. \u201cKeith [Haring] and Jean-Michel [Basquiat] are really ciphers that signify a whole group of artists and community,\u201d says McCormick, who guest curated the show. \u201cEvery bit of modernism was actually a gang of friends getting together.\u201d And there\u2019s no arguing that this gang \u2013 \u201ca bunch of bratty kids\u201d \u2013 defined an era. \u201cAt that time, museums were very insular,\u201d McCormick says. \u201cThey were for blue-haired old ladies ... And there was a whole group of narcissistic white men who thought they knew better. They looked down on us.\u201d Haring, and Basquiat defied this. Coming from marginalised communities \u2013 Haring was gay, Basquiat was black \u2013 they made vibrant and often political art that was \u201cvernacular and younger and more youth-oriented\u201d, and then they made that kind of art the norm. McCormick discussed with the Guardian 10 works (and the people behind them) that cemented this radical legacy \u2013 three of which are currently on show at the NGV. Untitled 1982 - Keith Haring Whether on subway walls, scraps of paper or large industrial tarps (like this piece), Keith Haring\u2019s work \u201cwas meant to be universal\u201d. The young artist developed an iconic visual language of simple motifs \u2013 dogs, babies, hearts \u2013 and used them to communicate his generation\u2019s not-so-simple energy and anxieties. \u201cWe were all Cold War babies,\u201d McCormick says, reflecting on his reading of Untitled 1982, which is part of Crossing Lines. \u201cEvery age is an age of anxiety \u2013 there\u2019s plenty for kids to be worried about now \u2013 but for us it was knowing that, at any moment, our world could blow up.\u201d He notes that Haring\u2019s dogs aren\u2019t barking, as usual: \u201cThey\u2019re almost like Egyptian statues that you would see guarding the dead. \u201cHis work always seems really nice, but when you look at it \u2013 the TV sets etc \u2013 it was always a lot about control,\u201d McCormick says. Haring also frequently cited homosexuality and Aids (the artist died of Aids-related complications in 1990). \u201cThis was a moment where the politics [in art] turned into a kind of social politics \u2026 [Haring] could express his difference or his fears \u2013 but it was kinda smiley.\u201d Hollywood Africans in front of the Chinese Theatre with footprints of movie stars - Jean-Michel Basquiat Jean-Michel Basquiat rocketed to fame in his late teens and early twenties. Within a few years, the Brooklyn-born artist of Haitan and Puerto Rican descent went from doing local graffiti under a pseudonym, to exhibiting at the country\u2019s best galleries. \u201cThis work is at a moment when [he\u2019s] getting bigger,\u201d McCormick says. In the work, which is currently hung at the NGV, Basquiat is depicted (on the right) with fellow black artists Toxic and Rammellzee. \u201cThey\u2019re living large, but there\u2019s a lot of tragedy built into their success. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a tribute to his fellow black people in the art world [and a] barbed joke. African Americans were not well represented in our cinema, and if they were they were caricatured and marginalised. It was sort of a way of saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re the Hollywood Africans. It\u2019s the same deal: we\u2019re playing like blackface for white people.\u2019\u201d This was an era in which art became enmeshed with celebrity \u2013 and while that meant young artists like Basqiaut could prosper, it also ensured their work was seen as \u201cspectacle\u201d, rather than art. \u201cIt was given the same degree of analysis that we might give a K-pop star today,\u201d McCormick says. That degree of analysis has certainly changed since the artist\u2019s death from overdose, at age 27 in 1988. Pile of crowns for Jean-Michel Basquiat - Keith Haring \u201cKeith really loved Jean-Michel,\u201d McCormick says. \u201cIt\u2019s a memorial. Think of the momento mori in Renaissance paintings; the reminder of death.\u201d The crown was Basquiat\u2019s most iconic symbol, used frequently in his work. \u201c[They] had this incredible mutual respect,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey had much in common, generationally and in terms of [being outsiders] \u2026 All these people came [downtown] because they were different. They were ostracised and alienated from this \u2018normal America\u2019.\u201d This era of artists met and bonded on the street and in the nightclubs. \u201cPeople liked to dance,\u201d McCormick reminisces. \u201cNow, maybe Jackson Pollock liked to dance, but I\u2019m sure he danced like the ugliest white guy on the planet. This was a generation that had the beat, it had the rhythm.\u201d This work came at a time of great change, in the midst of the Aids crisis. \u201cWe went from partying every night to going to memorial services every week,\u201d McCormick says. He notes a \u201ctremendous gravitas\u201d in this; they are aware of a moment passing. \u201c[It\u2019s] the way that spring is fun, but fall is something else because you feel winter coming on.\u201d Vivienne Westwood\u2019s Witches collection (83-84) Yes, Vivienne Westwood is British. But her iconic punk aesthetic had a lasting impact in the US and McCormick argues it actually had its origins in New York. \u201cI hate to be such a provincial New Yorker, but before [Westwood\u2019s collaborator Malcolm McLaren] created the Sex Pistols as his little boy band, he managed the New York Dolls ... Malcolm was very influenced by what was going on in New York\u201d. By the 80s, he recalls, \u201cwe were all a little bit punk \u2013 even if some people were into dance music, others were into hip hop \u2026 There was this hybridity, and fashion was very much interspersed in our culture.\u201d \u201cKeith [whose work was featured in the Witches collection] cared very much about the ability for his art to interact with the real world \u2013 the day-to-day.\u201d This continues today, with his work most accessible on T-shirts and fridge magnets. Self-portrait no 9 - Andy Warhol People forget, McCormick says, that Andy Warhol was at \u201cthe total nadir\u201d of his career in the 80s. \u201cHe was very uncool. [But] what really brought him back was the fact that there was this whole generation \u2013 me included \u2013 who adored him. Many of us had moved to New York because of the Factory and Warhol\u2019s books.\u201d Two decades on from his seminal work in the pop art movement, Warhol became something of a mentor to artists like Haring and Basquiat. \u201cEveryone talks about how he was a little vampiric in his relationship to people, but he was very generous and very supportive. There was a beautiful connectivity \u2013 an intergenerational conversation.\u201d In this portrait, one year before his death, Warhol renders himself with the same pop art methods that inspired others. \u201cHe had a particular way about reaching people,\u201d McCormick says. \u201cAbout how you can do signifiers without being didactic, and how personality and life can become part of the art\u201d. \u201cAlso,\u201d he adds, \u201cAndy queered things up\u201d. The midnight sun - Francesco Clemente Francesco Clemente migrated from Italy to join the scene in New York. He wasn\u2019t the nightclub type \u2013 \u201cless Mudd Club, more like Mr Chow\u2019s\u201d, McCormick says \u2013 and his work had a different energy to it. It was all pastels and soft edges. \u201cClemente had been going to India since the \u201870s and he brought in much more poetic, much more Italian, a little more mythical, allegorical [influences]. But he was also just an incredible painter. Great painters recognise great painters as something entirely distinct from all the people who don\u2019t push paint in such a magical way.\u201d Clemente and Basquiat are also often lumped together as neo-expressionists; whether you agree with that label or not, it\u2019s true that they defined an era of raw and emotive art. This then went \u201cout of favour\u201d towards the end of the \u201880s with the rise of neo-geo (think Jeff Koons) which was \u201cmuch more about intellectualising your emotions\u201d. Alistair Butler - Robert Mapplethorpe \u201cThis is an ecstatic thing,\u201d McCormick says. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a photo of an orgasm, it\u2019s one to bring you towards that ecstatic state.\u201d It might sound provocative, but when seen in the context of Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s broader work it\u2019s just a statement of fact. Maybe Jackson Pollock liked to dance, but I\u2019m sure he danced like the ugliest white guy on the planet\u2026This was a generation that had the beat. The New York-based photographer had \u201ca wonderful sense of beauty, which was based off \u2018the other\u2019,\u201d McCormick says. \u201cObviously sexuality and fetish are part of it, but it\u2019s more interesting than that \u2026 Beauty had been so codified by then \u2013 from Boticelli to the pinup girls in the Hollywood magazines.\u201d Mapplethorpe portrayed the beauty of people who were \u201cinherently different \u2013 by lifestyle or by body\u201d. Alistair Butler, the model used for this work, was a New York dancer originally from the Bahamas. \u201cHaring, Basiquat, all of them, this is a generation of really questioning people \u2013 they\u2019re all sponges. They take from everything around them.\u201d When The Worlds Collide - Kenny Scharf Kenny Scharf grew up on the west coast, but met Keith Haring at art school in New York. Like Haring, McCormick says, \u201chis stuff looks so cartoony, happy \u2013 really fun. But it\u2019s all candy-coated. It\u2019s a bitter pill\u201d. When The Worlds Collide is another work about nuclear catastrophe: a grotesque and lurid collision of utopia and its demise. \u201c[This] generation was promised a beautiful future. There was going to be better living through technology ... we were all going to be flying around in space! Instead we\u2019re the punk generation of no future.\u201d Untitled (We Don\u2019t Need Another Hero) - Barbara Kruger Feminist art was fantastic in 1980s New York, McCormick says, but unfortunately \u201cit was just being ignored\u201d. Barbara Kruger was the exception: the graphic designer-turned-artist became known for her acid-tongued text works that took aim at consumerism, the patriarchy and the intersection of the two. \u201cShe took the seductive language of advertising and consumerism, to throw it back in a way that rips it apart,\u201d McCormick says. \u201cPop art took popular culture in a kinda acquiescent way, without really questioning so much \u2013 it\u2019s just a Brillo box \u2013 [but she used it] to subvert and to question.\u201d In this work, the images are taken from 1950s advertising: the boy\u2019s posture is reminiscent of Rosie the Riveter, and the title is a Tina Turner song from two years prior. Kruger led the way for dense, appropriation-fuelled art while \u201cprofoundly speaking to the women\u2019s condition from [the New York] scene\u201d. Video Flag Z - Nam June Paik Like Warhol, Nam June Paik was a \u201cforefather figure\u201d in the 80s scene. Paik grew up in Korea and moved to New York in the 1960s where, McCormick says, he became \u201cone of the seminal figures of Fluxus \u2013 with Yoko Ono and all sorts of interesting people\u201d. It was another \u201cgang of friends getting together\u201d that, in fact, had much in common with Haring, Basquait and co. Fluxus wanted to playfully destroy the boundaries between \u201cart\u201d and \u201clife\u201d, and experiment with the nature of what art could be. The movement was also fiercely anti-consumerist and, for Paik, this was most evident in his work relating to television. \u201cI remember his first video was like the earliest TV you could imagine, just a video of the moon, called Moon Is The Oldest TV,\u201d McCormick recalls. In the MTV generation of the 80s, Paik went on to become \u201cthe father of video art\u201d. In Video Flag Z, he \u201creconstituted American identity as a Korean living in America\u201d. He may not have been a \u201cbratty kid\u201d but, like Basquait, Paik had a perspective so few others in the white art world could offer. \u2022 NGV\u2019s Keith Haring | Jean-Michel Basquiat: Crossing Lines is showing in Melbourne until 11 April 2020 \u2022 The Stories of a Scene series is supported by the National Gallery of Victoria",

Not always, sometimes they get punished but mostly they get away with it.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe support from my club was there. Also players and everything. For me this was not enough. These people need to be punished. They need educating. We all, even you, failed in this. If people are really honest we have so many people coming into the stadium and in that game when it happened against me, Chelsea fans got arrested. And why? Because Chelsea fans reported the fan who abused Son. On the other side, nothing happened. It\u2019s the people who were around.

He questioned why no one in the crowd came forward with information and pointed out that a Chelsea supporter was arrested during the same game after being reported by fellow fans for allegedly racially abusing the Spurs forward, Son Heung-min. \u201cI\u2019m very careful with this,\u201d R\u00fcdiger said. \u201cI\u2019m not in the investigations. I\u2019m not a police officer. I just hope always people do their job right. But nothing happened and, to be honest, it was not a surprise. They always get away with it. Not always, sometimes they get punished but mostly they get away with it. \u201cThe support from my club was there. Also players and everything. For me this was not enough. These people need to be punished. They need educating. We all, even you, failed in this. If people are really honest we have so many people coming into the stadium and in that game when it happened against me, Chelsea fans got arrested. And why? Because Chelsea fans reported the fan who abused Son. On the other side, nothing happened. It\u2019s the people who were around. That\u2019s why I say if we don\u2019t stand up racism won.\u201d Racism has blighted English football in recent times and R\u00fcdiger, who was speaking to four white journalists, spoke about the isolation black players feel when they are abused. He questioned whether the authorities are doing enough to tackle the problem and argued that walking off the pitch will have no effect. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to offend but you [white] people will never understand what goes through my mind in this moment\u201d he said. \u201cOr other black players\u2019 minds. I am alone. I am totally alone. It\u2019s nice if people are speaking up for me but at the end of the day it just replays. Authority-wise I\u2019m alone. \u201cWalking off the pitch doesn\u2019t make sense if they still don\u2019t get punished. Does it make sense to walk off the pitch? I don\u2019t think so. The consequence may be I am again the booed man. What point is it no one gets punished? At the end, how people write stuff, I will be the bogeyman again. If there is no punishment for these people racism won.\u201d R\u00fcdiger pointed out what happened when Porto\u2019s Moussa Marega tried to leave the pitch after being allegedly racially abused during his side\u2019s 2-1 win over Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es last week. \u201cIt was clear everyone heard it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd his own team-mates held him back to stay on the pitch. He was alone. And he was booked for going out because he was racially abused. It\u2019s simple, we are alone in this. We have to deal with it in our way.\u201d For all his anger R\u00fcdiger said he will not shy away from speaking up. He became a father last Thursday and wants to provide a good example for his son, Djamal. \u201cI will always stand up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about myself. It can be homophobic or something like that. It\u2019s about standing up for people. \u201cIf it happens at football it is also happening outside and outside my son is going to be growing up. I will do my best to make sure my son is not stupid like other people. Sorry for this word. I don\u2019t have any other words for this.\u201d",

Having not won a grand slam since 2010, having finished in the top half of the table only once since then \u2013 they came third in 2017 \u2013 they travel to Scotland in a fortnight, looking to set up a tilt at the perfect campaign in Paris against Ireland in the final round. Three tries, the decisive third an intercept by the outstanding Romain Ntamack, were enough to see off Wales.</p> <p>It is surely not a coincidence the transition from promising performances to hard-edged results has been negotiated with Shaun Edwards in charge of the defence. No less poetic is that this latest display of cussedness should be put on in Cardiff, Edwards\u2019s home for so many years as Wales\u2019s defence coach.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone was telling me, \u2018Remember to go in the right dressing room,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, honestly, I took one step towards the Welsh one and then I remembered and returned.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/22/france-wales-six-nations-rugby-shaun-edwards-fabien-galthie\">Fabien Galthi\u00e9 and Shaun Edwards\u2019 French revolution outmuscles Wales | Ian Malin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tryline stand of his new team in the approach to half-time was instrumental in France\u2019s win, keeping Wales scoreless when they chose to scrum a series of penalties on France\u2019s five-metre line, trailing 17-9.</p> <p>\u201cI honestly believe if they\u2019d scored there, Wales would have won the game. It was tough defence, but they did well. The attitude has been first class. They\u2019re really buying into how I want them to defend. And it\u2019s not just that, it\u2019s the style of play as well. French teams in the past maybe overplayed in their own half etc. It\u2019s mixing that French flair with some structured rugby.\u201d</p> <p>The frustration of Wales\u2019s new coach, Wayne Pivac, is becoming palpable. In many ways, Wales are playing better rugby, certainly in attack, than they did last season, when they won a grand slam. What better place to make it tell than the venue for their next assignment, Twickenham.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big challenge, isn\u2019t it? For this team it\u2019s all about improving, but we\u2019re heading in the right direction. We\u2019re putting in long hours and working very hard, and if one or two things had stuck, we\u2019d have been very happy with this performance.\u201d</p> <p>Wales\u2019s defeat, their first at home in the Six Nations in three years, their first against France in 10, came at a cost. George North was forced off after only 10 minutes with the latest episode in his concerning history of head injuries.</p> <p>At the other end of the match, his partner on Wales\u2019s other wing, Josh Adams, was also withdrawn with an ankle injury. They have a fortnight to recover, before Twickenham looms on the horizon.</p>",

It\u2019s the same with our disallowed try.\u201d There is no doubt, the big decisions tended to go France\u2019s way, but few could begrudge them, such have been the horrors they have endured in their last two fixtures against Wales, giving up sizeable leads in the World Cup quarter-final and last season\u2019s Six Nations opener in Paris. France\u2019s disallowed try would have been the best of the match but Anthony Bouthier\u2019s pass in the buildup was forward. Otherwise, they finally enjoyed a measure of luck, not least when they were awarded a penalty at a scrum a few minutes after Willemse\u2019s infringement, just after their tighthead had been shown yellow following a couple of scrum penalties Wales\u2019s way. Wales were very much aggrieved at that one, claiming that Demba Bamba had bored in across the scrum. Again, it depends which team you support. What is not in dispute is that France already look made of sterner stuff than the team we have become used to of late. Having not won a grand slam since 2010, having finished in the top half of the table only once since then \u2013 they came third in 2017 \u2013 they travel to Scotland in a fortnight, looking to set up a tilt at the perfect campaign in Paris against Ireland in the final round. Three tries, the decisive third an intercept by the outstanding Romain Ntamack, were enough to see off Wales. It is surely not a coincidence the transition from promising performances to hard-edged results has been negotiated with Shaun Edwards in charge of the defence. No less poetic is that this latest display of cussedness should be put on in Cardiff, Edwards\u2019s home for so many years as Wales\u2019s defence coach. \u201cEveryone was telling me, \u2018Remember to go in the right dressing room,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, honestly, I took one step towards the Welsh one and then I remembered and returned.\u201d The tryline stand of his new team in the approach to half-time was instrumental in France\u2019s win, keeping Wales scoreless when they chose to scrum a series of penalties on France\u2019s five-metre line, trailing 17-9. \u201cI honestly believe if they\u2019d scored there, Wales would have won the game. It was tough defence, but they did well. The attitude has been first class. They\u2019re really buying into how I want them to defend. And it\u2019s not just that, it\u2019s the style of play as well. French teams in the past maybe overplayed in their own half etc. It\u2019s mixing that French flair with some structured rugby.\u201d The frustration of Wales\u2019s new coach, Wayne Pivac, is becoming palpable. In many ways, Wales are playing better rugby, certainly in attack, than they did last season, when they won a grand slam. What better place to make it tell than the venue for their next assignment, Twickenham. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big challenge, isn\u2019t it? For this team it\u2019s all about improving, but we\u2019re heading in the right direction. We\u2019re putting in long hours and working very hard, and if one or two things had stuck, we\u2019d have been very happy with this performance.\u201d Wales\u2019s defeat, their first at home in the Six Nations in three years, their first against France in 10, came at a cost. George North was forced off after only 10 minutes with the latest episode in his concerning history of head injuries. At the other end of the match, his partner on Wales\u2019s other wing, Josh Adams, was also withdrawn with an ankle injury. They have a fortnight to recover, before Twickenham looms on the horizon.",

The news may concern Joe Biden. The former vice-president is seeking victory in the first southern state to vote, in order to establish himself as the moderate alternative to Bernie Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator who won Nevada on Saturday. Biden finished a distant second as Sanders performed strongly with minority voters.

Steyer also spent heavily in Nevada but failed to qualify for its debate. On Sunday, with results still coming in, he was in a close contest for fifth place with Amy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota. Former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2013 whose campaign formally queried the Nevada results after placing third \u2013 Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg will also debate in South Carolina. Bloomberg, another billionaire, is not competing in South Carolina, focusing instead on Super Tuesday, 3 March, when a host of states will vote. The Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is the only candidate left in the race who has not yet qualified for the South Carolina debate. The deadline for meeting poll-based qualifications set by the Democratic National Committee is Monday. On Twitter, Steyer said he was \u201cproud of everything we accomplished in Nevada. We\u2019re only gaining strength as the electorate gets more diverse and more representative of the country.\u201d In South Carolina, Steyer has campaigned heavily and focused on issues important to black voters including support for historically black colleges and universities and reparations for slavery. Speaking to the Guardian this week, one South Carolina voter, Najeema Davis Washington, said Steyer \u201ccaught [her] attention years ago\u201d with his advocacy for combating climate change and the racial wealth gap, issues she said \u201cspeak to what affects African Americans most\u201d.

      "body": "<p>A man who seems so laid back he could probably serve as a draught excluder at the gates of Winterfell Castle, it spoke volumes that after a senior career spanning 19 years, it wasn\u2019t until seven months into Peter Crouch\u2019s retirement from professional football that the scales blinding him from the truth about referees finally fell from his eyes. A recent conversation over drinks with Mike Dean convinced the veteran of more than 600 games to realise that referees are human just like the rest of us, rather than unthinking, emotionless, card-brandishing cybernetic androids who simply materialise, fully formed like some sort of buzz-killing fun-assassins dispatched Terminator-style from the future.</p> <p>A man who does not so much polarise opinion among football fans of various teams as pull off the impressive feat of completely uniting it, Dean once found himself the subject of an unsuccessful petition signed by more than 100,000 Arsenal fans calling for him to be forbidden from refereeing any more of their team\u2019s games. Renowned for his showmanship, occasional pomposity and apparent desire to be the centre of attention in any match he is tasked with officiating, he has for some time now been the best known and most unpopular of England\u2019s top-flight refs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/22/burnley-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">VAR thwarts Bournemouth at every turn as Dwight McNeil seals Burnley win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t ever thus, however. As an overweight, teenage couch potato on the Wirral in the mid-80s, Dean decided to take up the whistle, cards and notebook in an effort to shed some excess weight. Working his way through the ranks while holding down a full-time job as a mass-executioner of chickens in a processing plant, he swapped fowls for fouls on a full-time basis after 16 years. He has since gone on to become one of the most disrespected match officials in the country, the prevailing opinion of football fans being that he is truly terrible at his very difficult job. He isn\u2019t, of course, but that\u2019s beside the point. Despite the occasional high-profile rick, the very nature of refereeing suggests you don\u2019t become as well known and reviled as Dean has over the years without doing plenty right.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sort of seeing the person behind the ref, y\u2019know,\u201d said Crouch to his co-presenters following Dean\u2019s guest appearance on the most recent episode of the BBC\u2019s That Peter Crouch Podcast. \u201cI never really thought about what he did. In 1985 he started his referee\u2019s journey when I was four years old and he\u2019s still reffing at the highest level now, at 51. You have to give him some kudos for that. I never thought of the journey, or how he\u2019d got there and I\u2019m a little bit ashamed of that, honestly.\u201d</p> <p>Given the infrequency of public utterances from match officials, getting Dean to appear on his podcast was quite the coup for Crouch and his backroom team even if one could be forgiven for suspecting their guest didn\u2019t take much persuading. Premier League referees are currently forbidden from speaking to the media immediately after games, on the grounds that their boss, Mike Riley, head of the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, believes they could be too emotionally involved in \u201cwhat they\u2019ve just been through\u201d and might say something ill-advised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aec6ef6fe8735a6ec4670f901950ac0e3f330483\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aec6ef6fe8735a6ec4670f901950ac0e3f330483/740_146_1261_757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tranmere fan, referee Mike Dean, centre, celebrates with fellow supporters after their first goal in theLeague Two playoff semi-finals against Forest Green.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tranmere fan, referee Mike Dean, centre, celebrates with fellow supporters after their first goal in theLeague Two playoff semi-finals against Forest Green.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a world where Dean\u2019s colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/12/bournemouth-contact-premier-league-over-referee-jon-mosss-sarky-remarks\" title=\"\">Jon Moss recently came under fire</a> for mildly mocking Bournemouth\u2019s Dan Gosling, it is difficult to imagine the more garrulous Dean being reluctant to pass up the opportunity to grab the microphone firmly with both hands to explain himself in the wake of a contentious match. He certainly wasn\u2019t backwards in coming forwards with his opinions on That Peter Crouch Podcast, although the convivial, laid-back tone of the show meant he was unlikely to be subjected to a particularly tough grilling.</p> <p>Having originated as a vehicle for its likeable star to provide his unique and amusing insights into life as a professional footballer, the show\u2019s decision to provide a working referee with the opportunity to lift the lid on his day-to-day life proved something of a masterstroke. Invited to demonstrate he is not the show-stealer bloated with self-regard many perceive him to be, Dean did not exactly go out of his way to disabuse listeners of any such notions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a touch of arrogance about me when I walk out on the pitch; I know there is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a lot of confidence in myself because I believe in my own ability.\u201d Moments previously, having explained that the passing of time means he is no longer able to run as far or as fast as he used to, Dean had explained \u201cwithout being big-headed\u201d that he can \u201cmake decisions from 30 yards away and the players turn around and because it\u2019s me I\u2019ll get away with it\u201d.</p> <p>Despite his high opinion of himself, Dean did come across as being extremely likeable, good naturedly detailing \u2013 among other vicissitudes of the job \u2013 the tedium of constantly being \u201cbooked\u201d by beermat-brandishing pub-goers when trying to enjoy a night out with the wife. As Tranmere\u2019s most famous fan, he made headlines last May when footage emerged of him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/14/the-fiver-we-will-never-have-another-referee-like-mike-dean\" title=\"\">ostentatiously cheerleading</a> in the away end at Forest Green after his side secured their place in the League Two play-off final. For all his grumbling about lack of originality, one suspects he will be even more forlorn when the beermat-waving stops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5db85c94e67af09a933c041dd615f873178c8a6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5db85c94e67af09a933c041dd615f873178c8a6c/2062_76_1028_617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Before his podcast with Mike Dean, Peter Crouch\u2019s main contact with referees had been on the pitch in his playing days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Before his podcast with Mike Dean, Peter Crouch\u2019s main contact with referees had been on the pitch in his playing days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Brunskill Ltd/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years it has become fairly customary for many live-match broadcasters to have a former whistle blower on hand to explain contentious decisions, albeit cloistered alone in what looks like a cupboard all the better to emphasise their pariah status.

      "bodyText": "A man who seems so laid back he could probably serve as a draught excluder at the gates of Winterfell Castle, it spoke volumes that after a senior career spanning 19 years, it wasn\u2019t until seven months into Peter Crouch\u2019s retirement from professional football that the scales blinding him from the truth about referees finally fell from his eyes. A recent conversation over drinks with Mike Dean convinced the veteran of more than 600 games to realise that referees are human just like the rest of us, rather than unthinking, emotionless, card-brandishing cybernetic androids who simply materialise, fully formed like some sort of buzz-killing fun-assassins dispatched Terminator-style from the future. A man who does not so much polarise opinion among football fans of various teams as pull off the impressive feat of completely uniting it, Dean once found himself the subject of an unsuccessful petition signed by more than 100,000 Arsenal fans calling for him to be forbidden from refereeing any more of their team\u2019s games. Renowned for his showmanship, occasional pomposity and apparent desire to be the centre of attention in any match he is tasked with officiating, he has for some time now been the best known and most unpopular of England\u2019s top-flight refs. It wasn\u2019t ever thus, however. As an overweight, teenage couch potato on the Wirral in the mid-80s, Dean decided to take up the whistle, cards and notebook in an effort to shed some excess weight. Working his way through the ranks while holding down a full-time job as a mass-executioner of chickens in a processing plant, he swapped fowls for fouls on a full-time basis after 16 years. He has since gone on to become one of the most disrespected match officials in the country, the prevailing opinion of football fans being that he is truly terrible at his very difficult job. He isn\u2019t, of course, but that\u2019s beside the point. Despite the occasional high-profile rick, the very nature of refereeing suggests you don\u2019t become as well known and reviled as Dean has over the years without doing plenty right. \u201cI\u2019m sort of seeing the person behind the ref, y\u2019know,\u201d said Crouch to his co-presenters following Dean\u2019s guest appearance on the most recent episode of the BBC\u2019s That Peter Crouch Podcast. \u201cI never really thought about what he did. In 1985 he started his referee\u2019s journey when I was four years old and he\u2019s still reffing at the highest level now, at 51. You have to give him some kudos for that. I never thought of the journey, or how he\u2019d got there and I\u2019m a little bit ashamed of that, honestly.\u201d Given the infrequency of public utterances from match officials, getting Dean to appear on his podcast was quite the coup for Crouch and his backroom team even if one could be forgiven for suspecting their guest didn\u2019t take much persuading. Premier League referees are currently forbidden from speaking to the media immediately after games, on the grounds that their boss, Mike Riley, head of the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, believes they could be too emotionally involved in \u201cwhat they\u2019ve just been through\u201d and might say something ill-advised. In a world where Dean\u2019s colleague Jon Moss recently came under fire for mildly mocking Bournemouth\u2019s Dan Gosling, it is difficult to imagine the more garrulous Dean being reluctant to pass up the opportunity to grab the microphone firmly with both hands to explain himself in the wake of a contentious match. He certainly wasn\u2019t backwards in coming forwards with his opinions on That Peter Crouch Podcast, although the convivial, laid-back tone of the show meant he was unlikely to be subjected to a particularly tough grilling. Having originated as a vehicle for its likeable star to provide his unique and amusing insights into life as a professional footballer, the show\u2019s decision to provide a working referee with the opportunity to lift the lid on his day-to-day life proved something of a masterstroke. Invited to demonstrate he is not the show-stealer bloated with self-regard many perceive him to be, Dean did not exactly go out of his way to disabuse listeners of any such notions. \u201cThere\u2019s a touch of arrogance about me when I walk out on the pitch; I know there is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a lot of confidence in myself because I believe in my own ability.\u201d Moments previously, having explained that the passing of time means he is no longer able to run as far or as fast as he used to, Dean had explained \u201cwithout being big-headed\u201d that he can \u201cmake decisions from 30 yards away and the players turn around and because it\u2019s me I\u2019ll get away with it\u201d. Despite his high opinion of himself, Dean did come across as being extremely likeable, good naturedly detailing \u2013 among other vicissitudes of the job \u2013 the tedium of constantly being \u201cbooked\u201d by beermat-brandishing pub-goers when trying to enjoy a night out with the wife. As Tranmere\u2019s most famous fan, he made headlines last May when footage emerged of him ostentatiously cheerleading in the away end at Forest Green after his side secured their place in the League Two play-off final. For all his grumbling about lack of originality, one suspects he will be even more forlorn when the beermat-waving stops. In recent years it has become fairly customary for many live-match broadcasters to have a former whistle blower on hand to explain contentious decisions, albeit cloistered alone in what looks like a cupboard all the better to emphasise their pariah status. Fitness permitting, Dean hopes to put next season behind him before retiring but revealed his dread at the prospect of no longer being able to do his job. \u201cGod knows what I\u2019ll do when I can\u2019t referee again,\u201d he told Crouch and his cohorts, although \u2013 like the man on whose podcast he guested \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to imagine a man of his high profile remaining sidelined for very long.",

And few were thinking that beforehand \u2013 except Fury, and those close to him, including his cousin, Andy Lee. Most pundits \u2013 including this one \u2013 went with a Wilder stoppage. We were wrong. There is no fighter like him, although once there was. Fury\u2019s swagger brings to mind another heavyweight of Irish heritage, Jack Doyle, who swung hard, sang beautifully and for a lucrative living in the 1930s, and who loved with enthusiasm, from Cork to Hollywood. He knocked out his share of opponents, then himself. Doyle, who was in the grip of drink, ill-discipline and a raging libido most of his life, often reminded detractors of his freewheeling existence, \u201cA generous man never went to hell.\u201d He died alone and destitute in a London flat in 1978, 10 years before Fury was born. The new champion, who has battled mental illness and addiction to alcohol and drugs, entered the arena on Saturday to the strains of Patsy Cline\u2019s Crazy. He sang the gathering out with American Pie. Even Bob Arum and Frank Warren sang along. \u201cA long, long time ago I can still remember how That music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they\u2019d be happy for a while \u2026\u201d",

Forecasters have issued a yellow weather warning as the 75mph storm brings a fresh deluge of rain, up to 50mm (2in) in some places. A 500 mile-wide jet of cold air from Greenland will bring winter\u2019s \u201csting in the tail\u201d in one of the wettest Februarys on record in 254 years. There was a short respite from the more stormy conditions on Sunday afternoon but there were predictions of a fresh wave of bad weather coming in overnight with the number of flood warnings in force in England increased to 86 \u2013 spanning an area from Dorset to Carlisle \u2013 along with 183 flood alerts. In Wales, the number of flood warnings in force increased to 14 on Sunday, with 28 alerts with snow expected across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England overnight. While the extreme weather should settle down over Tuesday and Wednesday \u2013 accompanied with a notable dip in temperatures \u2013 the Met Office said further heavy rain is expected later in the week. The bleak outlook follows more than a fortnight of downpours and flooding that started with Storm Ciara, continued with Storm Dennis and then kept going with the storms over the weekend, which \u2013 contrary to some reports \u2013 have not been named by the Met Office. As the weather continued to cause misery for many communities, the environment secretary, George Eustice, was forced to defend Boris Johnson\u2019s defiance of calls to visit flood-stricken areas. Eustice denied the prime minister had not been engaged, adding that they had been in daily conference calls. \u201cIt was agreed that I would make a visit to look at our preparedness over that weekend,\u201d Eustice said. He added: \u201cAnd in a cabinet government it\u2019s not a one-man show, it\u2019s right that on certain operational things such as this that the prime minister will ask one of his cabinet members to lead. I can\u2019t see anything wrong with that.\u201d Meanwhile, politicians in south Wales appealed directly to the chancellor for help. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, the group including four MPs described flooding in the Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) area as \u201ca national emergency on our doorsteps\u201d. The area was one of the hardest hit by the storm with more than 600 households and a similar number of businesses affected. Dozens of businesses in Pontypridd town centre, visited by the Prince of Wales on Friday, were \u201csubmerged\u201d along with the Treforest industrial estate where 4,000 jobs are based. The RCT county borough council is facing bills of \u00a330m to repair damaged roads, walls and council properties as well as seven bridges that will have to be rebuilt. The letter, signed by by Labour MPs Chris Elmore, Chris Bryant, Beth Winter and Alex Davies-Jones, says: \u201cWales has borne the brunt of the damage and RCT in particular has been hit hardest of all, whilst having the fewer resources. \u201cWe therefore urge you as a matter of urgency to provide specific one-off funding for RCT.\u201d The letter said charitable donations had reached almost 200,000, with hundreds of people helping those affected by the flooding.

In a speech marking the 10th anniversary of the landmark Marmot review into health inequalities in England, he will say ministers should address the crisis in the budget as part of Boris Johnson\u2019s stated intention to \u201clevel up\u201d the country. Ashworth\u2019s comments come as Labour figures show people who live in so-called \u201cred wall\u201d constituencies, the party\u2019s former strongholds in the Midlands and the north that switched to the Conservatives in December\u2019s general election, suffer notably more ill health than those in more prosperous areas. Noting that child poverty is a key indicator of health problems later in life, Ashworth will say the next Labour leader should make tackling this issue \u201ca moral crusade\u201d for the party. A decade after his 2010 report, Sir Michael Marmot, a leading epidemiologist and expert on health inequality, will address what has happened since then in an update to be published on Tuesday. A Labour analysis based on data from the House of Commons library has shown what the party describes as health disparities between former \u201cred wall\u201d areas and better-off ones. Comparing health outcomes in 20 red wall constituencies with those represented by the cabinet ministers Rishi Sunak, Priti Patel, Matt Hancock and Dominic Raab, the analysis found that men in the poorer areas live 5.9 fewer healthy years on average and women 7.7 fewer years. The party found deaths from cardiovascular disease was above the English average in all 20 of the sample red wall constituencies while deaths from cancer was above average in 95% of them. Above-average child poverty levels were found in 80% of the constituencies, whether or not housing costs were taken into account, while the proportion of adults and children who were overweight or obese was above the average in all 20. In his speech, Ashworth will call on the government to reverse years of spending cuts to address the crisis. \u201cInequality in health is the worst inequality of all,\u201d he will say. \u201cSurely there can be no greater social injustice than people dying sooner because of poverty and austerity? \u201cThis is a national disgrace and requires urgent government action.

The result was largely ordained before anyone could cast a ballot. Hardliners appear to have swept the parliamentary contest \u2013 taking all 30 seats in Tehran \u2013 because the authorities ensured that they would. The Guardian Council, which is loosely under the control of the supreme leader, had disqualified around half of the thousands of candidates for the 290-seat body, including 90 serving members.

      "body": "<p>There is something rich and strange and generous in Matteo Garrone\u2019s new live-action version of the Pinocchio story, for which the director and his co-screenwriter Massimo Ceccherini have gone back to the original 1883 children\u2019s tale by Carlo Collodi. They have given us a story which combines sentimentality and grotesqueness in a very startling way. It often looks like a horror film. This Pinocchio could almost have been one of the stories that Garrone dramatised in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/17/tale-of-tales-review-matteo-garrone-salam-hayek-john-c-reilly-toby-jones\">his freaky-fabular movie Tale of Tales</a>, and the story is very different from the legendary 1940 Disney musical version (without which, admittedly, no one would care about any new remake or reinvention).</p> <p>Walt Disney, for example, never had Pinocchio being brutally hanged from a tree by two swindlers who wanted to rob him. But one of the interesting things about this drama is that Pinocchio - the magical wooden puppet who yearns to be a \u201creal boy\u201d \u2013 gains this authentic humanness by being exploited, by suffering and finally getting re-born with skin and hair ... in a stable, as it happens.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1VH-8ezqTw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v1VH-8ezqTw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Pinocchio himself is played here with a woodified face by child actor Federico Ielapi, and his father-creator Geppetto is played by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/mar/23/awardsandprizes.oscars2003\">exuberant Roberto Benigni</a> - who himself directed a Pinocchio film in 2002 and (a bit insufferably perhaps) played the lead. As the ageing and sad Geppetto he is more under control and there is something touching about his hyperactive comic persona being subdued.</p> <p>Entranced and inspired by a visiting puppet show, Geppetto carves one of his own and the melancholy, poor and childless man is astonished and delighted when he comes to life. He has a son. But Geppetto\u2019s joy is short lived when Pinocchio is taken from him, at ending up first with the marionettes of puppet master Mangiafuoco (Gigi Proietti) from whom Pinocchio gets his freedom, only to be tricked and abused by two old rogues Gatto (Rocco Papaleo) and Volpe (co-writer Massimo Ceccherini). But Pinocchio is helped by a kindly cricket (Davide Marotta) and by a fairy (Marine Vacth) and by a bizarre gorilla judge (Teco Celio) whose topsy-turvy worldview is such that he will only look kindly on Pinocchio if he claims to be a criminal.</p> <p>There is so much that Garrone\u2019s Pinocchio appears to resemble: there\u2019s a bit of Tod Browning\u2019s Freaks (and a bit of Frankenstein): echoes of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland and the Old and New Testament. The moment when Pinocchio\u2019s nose grows because he is lying is still fascinating - a parable which has taught generations of little Disney fans never to fib. Audiences for this film, however, may notice that Pinocchio\u2019s nose does not grow when he lies to the gorilla judge. Perhaps the normalisation of lying is part of the humanising process. Pinocchio\u2019s wooden face really is very strange. It does not look like that of any sort of boy, but rather a man or woman or cyborg in early middle age. There\u2019s more than a touch of R2D2 about him.</p> <p>In the end, perhaps Pinocchio is a parable of parenthood: when we have a child, there is something uncanny and strange about him or her, like a doll brought to life. In our hearts, perhaps, we can\u2019t quite believe that this is a human being like us, who will come to have thoughts and feelings independently of us - become \u201creal\u201d, in fact.</p> <p>Next year, Guillermo del Toro is due to bring out his own version of Pinocchio and it is reportedly going to be \u201cdarker\u201d. Well, we shall have to see how that turns out, although what I liked about Garrone\u2019s adaptation is that it didn\u2019t just put a \u201cdark\u201d spin on a story which is assumed to be straightforwardly Disney-cute in its original form. The salty-sweet taste Garrone confects will perhaps be a little rich for some and the sentimental streak is certainly there. Pinocchio is a thoroughly bizarre story; Garrone makes of it a weirdly satisfying spectacle.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is something rich and strange and generous in Matteo Garrone\u2019s new live-action version of the Pinocchio story, for which the director and his co-screenwriter Massimo Ceccherini have gone back to the original 1883 children\u2019s tale by Carlo Collodi. They have given us a story which combines sentimentality and grotesqueness in a very startling way. It often looks like a horror film. This Pinocchio could almost have been one of the stories that Garrone dramatised in his freaky-fabular movie Tale of Tales, and the story is very different from the legendary 1940 Disney musical version (without which, admittedly, no one would care about any new remake or reinvention). Walt Disney, for example, never had Pinocchio being brutally hanged from a tree by two swindlers who wanted to rob him. But one of the interesting things about this drama is that Pinocchio - the magical wooden puppet who yearns to be a \u201creal boy\u201d \u2013 gains this authentic humanness by being exploited, by suffering and finally getting re-born with skin and hair ... in a stable, as it happens. Pinocchio himself is played here with a woodified face by child actor Federico Ielapi, and his father-creator Geppetto is played by the exuberant Roberto Benigni - who himself directed a Pinocchio film in 2002 and (a bit insufferably perhaps) played the lead. As the ageing and sad Geppetto he is more under control and there is something touching about his hyperactive comic persona being subdued. Entranced and inspired by a visiting puppet show, Geppetto carves one of his own and the melancholy, poor and childless man is astonished and delighted when he comes to life. He has a son. But Geppetto\u2019s joy is short lived when Pinocchio is taken from him, at ending up first with the marionettes of puppet master Mangiafuoco (Gigi Proietti) from whom Pinocchio gets his freedom, only to be tricked and abused by two old rogues Gatto (Rocco Papaleo) and Volpe (co-writer Massimo Ceccherini). But Pinocchio is helped by a kindly cricket (Davide Marotta) and by a fairy (Marine Vacth) and by a bizarre gorilla judge (Teco Celio) whose topsy-turvy worldview is such that he will only look kindly on Pinocchio if he claims to be a criminal. There is so much that Garrone\u2019s Pinocchio appears to resemble: there\u2019s a bit of Tod Browning\u2019s Freaks (and a bit of Frankenstein): echoes of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland and the Old and New Testament. The moment when Pinocchio\u2019s nose grows because he is lying is still fascinating - a parable which has taught generations of little Disney fans never to fib. Audiences for this film, however, may notice that Pinocchio\u2019s nose does not grow when he lies to the gorilla judge. Perhaps the normalisation of lying is part of the humanising process. Pinocchio\u2019s wooden face really is very strange. It does not look like that of any sort of boy, but rather a man or woman or cyborg in early middle age. There\u2019s more than a touch of R2D2 about him. In the end, perhaps Pinocchio is a parable of parenthood: when we have a child, there is something uncanny and strange about him or her, like a doll brought to life. In our hearts, perhaps, we can\u2019t quite believe that this is a human being like us, who will come to have thoughts and feelings independently of us - become \u201creal\u201d, in fact. Next year, Guillermo del Toro is due to bring out his own version of Pinocchio and it is reportedly going to be \u201cdarker\u201d. Well, we shall have to see how that turns out, although what I liked about Garrone\u2019s adaptation is that it didn\u2019t just put a \u201cdark\u201d spin on a story which is assumed to be straightforwardly Disney-cute in its original form. The salty-sweet taste Garrone confects will perhaps be a little rich for some and the sentimental streak is certainly there. Pinocchio is a thoroughly bizarre story; Garrone makes of it a weirdly satisfying spectacle.",

Of the 13% who said they had three or more, half said they continued to pirate content online, with the most common reason being that what they pirated wasn\u2019t available on the services they paid for. Research by Roy Morgan in December last year found 14 million Australians were subscribed to some form of pay television service, including Foxtel, Netflix and Stan.

The content lobby group has argued that piracy continues in Australia despite this. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d Creative Content Australia chair Graham Burke told Guardian Australia.

Lacazette also drops out, with Nketiah replacing him. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e529aa08f08e133247489bf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T15:35:41.670Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Teams!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Arsenal (an artetaballing! 4-3-3): </strong>Leno; Bellerin, Mustafi, Luiz, Kolasinac; Xhaka, Ceballos, Ozil; Pepe, Nketiah, Aubameyang. <strong>Subs:</strong> Martinez, Sokratis, Lacazette, Torreira, Nelson, Guendouzi, Saka.</p> <p><strong>Everton (a sophisticate\u2019s 4-4-2): </strong>Pickford; Sidibe, Holgate, Mina, Baines; Sigurdsson, Delph, Schneiderlin, Iwobi; Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. <strong>Subs: </strong>Stekelenburg, Keane, Bernard, Gomes, Coleman, Davies, Kean.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e52669b8f0811db2fafcd67\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T11:53:57.761Z\">11.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There\u2019s quite a lot going on here. Both teams have new managers and both have improved since appointing them. But can we really be arsed yet another discussion about whether the name of a manager who\u2019s done nothing merits the suffix \u201cball\u201d, or with examining Carlo\u2019s Ancelotti\u2019s stellar career of success with other people\u2019s teams, when we could just talk about Bukayo Sako instead? Of course we can\u2019t, so here we go.</p> <p>In the 37 years I\u2019ve been hopelessly obsessed with this thing of ours, never has there been such a hilarious, disgusting raft of brilliant young English talent. Why, it\u2019s almost as though these things are cyclical; that the influx of foreign players has raised domestic standards; and that those who are good enough will always find a way!</p> <p>Saka, then. He first attracted attention in the dog-days of early season, when Arsenal were only worth watching if they were playing in the Europa League, because their younger players had yet to be enervated by Unai Emery\u2019s masterplan. He scored a lovely goal away to Eintracht Frankfurt, but yet more impressive were his two assists and the general intelligence of his play. Still, it was fairly surprising that, when Arsenal needed a left-back, it was to him they turned, and the way he has embraced the challenge is nothing short of shocking. Not because Saka\u2019s talent is in dispute, but because 18-year-olds tend not to establish themselves in any top-flight team, never mind in the wrong position; attackers playing in defence even less so. </p> <p>It\u2019s fair to say that, as the game and the world have changed, what defenders do has changed too. Kids tend to play small-sided games with the focus on skill rather than physicality and the internet has made the game accessible in all its forms, while at the elite level, attack has triumphed over defence. Saka, though, mixes this modern approach with the timeless elements that will always distinguish reliable players from useful players: attitude, decision-making and nous. He is entirely unfazed by the frankly ludicrous situation in which he finds himself, his ability to select the correct cross for each situation is far more impressive than his ability to execute it, and his solidity at the back is more noteworthy than his enterprise going forward. He is the very model of a modern English ftbllr. </p> <p>Anyway, this should be a really good game. Arsenal are unbeaten in 2020 and, following a succession of draws, have won three on the spin. Everton, meanwhile, haven\u2019t lost since their FA Cup humiliation at Anfield, have won their last two and are \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 starting to look like a team. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 4.30pm GMT</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T15:17:01.480Z\">at 3.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Ok: that, then is us. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Ta-ra. Mikel Arteta is pleased with his team\u2019s spirit, coming back from Greece to get a good result, and says that the first 65 minutes is exactly what he wants to see from his team; I guess he thinks Arsenal played better than I did. He says that Leno redeemed himself and that Aubameyang is Arsenal\u2019s most important player, so he hopes he\u2019ll stay at Arsenal. He wasn\u2019t sure he was physically capable of doing what he asked of him, but now he knows that he is. He goes on to say that Gomes will definitely start the next game \u2013 Manchester United at home, next Sunday \u2013 but is disappointed to be going home with no points. Carlo Ancelotti is happy with his team\u2019s performance, but unhappy with how his players defended. He expected Arsenal to tire in the closing stages and praises his strikers, adding that the introduction of Andre Gomes made a difference. Here\u2019s our match report. Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang says it\u2019s been a tough week and that Arsenal did well to find the energy. Bernd Leno confirms that, and is happy that Arsenal won. Aubameyang \u2013 or \u201cOber\u201d to nickname terms\u2019 Geoff Shreeves - thanks his keeper for a couple of good saves, while Leno says perhaps his starting position could have been better for Richarlison\u2019s goal, but it was unlucky for him and it doesn\u2019t matter because his team won, the most Arsenal of answers. Each manager will find plenty to like and plenty to dislike about what was an extremely engaging afternoon\u2019s entertainment. When Arsenal put it together, they\u2019re a difficult proposition for any team, but they only do it in bursts and lack the resolution to back that up. Everton, meanwhile, were much better when they were chasing the game and had no choice but to press Arsenal high up the pitch. Had they had the confidence to do that sooner, they might have got more out of the game than a few nice vibes. Three wins in a week for Arsenal, who played well for about 20 minutes; it proved to be enough, but only just. Everton, meanwhile, persevered well and ought to have got at least a point. But they finished poorly at clutch, so stay 11th while Arsenal move 9th. 90+5 min Kean turns well and moves towards goal; he has options, but opts to shoot from 20 yards, sending the ball skipping wide. Silly behaviours. 90+4 min Another cross, another Calvert-Lewin leap, but this time he can\u2019t get over the ball, sending it back across the face, Arsenal get it away and Gomes barges Aubameyang, who grateful accepts the foul while the ref disburses a yellow card. 90+3 min The corner goes short while Arsenal aren\u2019t paying attention, then back to Bernard on the edge of the box, alone and palely loitering. He flips a lovely ball into the middle and Calvert-Lewin is up ... but heads wide! Everton have had enough chances to win this, never mind draw. 90 +2 min Everton shift from side to side but slowly, while Arsenal more or less wait for a cross and hope to clear it. Sidibe\u2019s effort wins a corner... 90+1 min \u201cOn the contrary, it\u2019s the rest of the world that doesn\u2019t allow lots of overly physical play,\u201d says Nick, taking back control an email at a time. 90 min Leno enjoys a little sit-down, as Ancelotti warns the fourth official that there\u2019d best be requisite time added on. The board says five minutes. 89 min Gomes curves a ball in behind the Arsenal defence and Richarlison is in the hunt, but Leno, who\u2019s had a very good second half, rushes out to clear. 88 min Richarlison leaves a leg in on Guendouzi, and is just the right side of the line, avoiding a second yellow card \u2013 but only just. 87 min Pickford gets wide trying to play out, selling a dummy which even a Trump voter wouldn\u2019t buy before playing Sigurdsson into trouble. Guendouzi ploughs into the tackle and the ball breaks to Nketiah, who unfuls a rasping curler which cleanses the underside of the bar and bounces to safety. People will only criticise Pickford for that because he play for England; it\u2019d be great keeping if he didn\u2019t. 85 min Sigurdsson humps a crossfield ball into touch. He\u2019s been horrible today. 85 min It\u2019s all Everton now. 84 min \u201cIt isn\u2019t \u2018playing in a dangerous manner\u2019 when contact is made,\u201d says Rick McGahey. \u201cPIDM refers to forcing the opponent to alter their play in order to avoid getting or causing injury (hence the call on players lowering their head below the waist when opponents are present). If Luiz backed off due to the high boot, then its PIDM. Kicked in the head by an opponent? A straight foul for kicking the opponent. But England likes to allow lots of overly physical play, no way that is Luiz\u2019s fault, should have been called.\u201d I disagree, but see the rationale. 82 min A change apiece, Kean replacing Delph; Sigurdsson will go into central-midfield; and Guendouzi replaces Ozil, who\u2019s had yet another acrylic afternoon. 80 min Except hear come Everton again, a long diag finding Richarlison down the left! He snaps across a ball for Calvert-Lewin, attacking the near post, who allows it to run across his body so that he can punch in with the inside of his right foot, but can\u2019t quite get the purchase. Arsenal are doing very well to still be leading. 79 min This has not been good from Arsenal, but hanging on in such circumstance would be good for Arsenal. 78 min Everton are coming. Richarlison finds Delph, then collects his low, skewed shot inside the box, dragging one of his own across Leno; the keeper\u2019s outstretched leg does enough, with Aubameyang inserting himself into the space then occupied by the loose ball to clear. 76 min Ceballos swerves a shot wide, his final contribution. He\u2019s replaced by Lucas Torreira. 75 min JR comes back on the first Everton goal: \u201cIt was a close call. Calvert-Lewin was about mid-kick/maximum foot height when Luiz stuck his melon in. I could see it called either way but I guess considering Luiz\u2019s noggin was even close enough to move just a little and get kicked I\u2019d lean toward dangerous play.\u201d I\u2019d lean the other way. Luiz knows what\u2019s going on and chooses to put his face there. 73 min Saka loses possession and Sidibe finds Bernard, whose cross is a goodun! Richarlison is up first, and heads down, the ball breaking to Calvert-Lewin, onside because somewhere far from there, Xhaka is playing him on. But the striker is almost too close, allowing Leno to spread himself and block. That\u2019s a really good save, the precise one he was trying to make when Everton scored their second. 72 min I\u2019d not be surprised to see Mesut Ozil walking towards the touchline in the near future. He\u2019s done very little today, and is not entirely reliable in a rearguard. 70 min Everton are pressing Arsenal higher up the pitch now, and Arsenal look a little flustered. They\u2019re in that liminal zone where they almost want to concede so that it\u2019s done and they can commit to attack with time to score, rather than semi-sit back and rely on a useless defence. 68 min Bernard is one of those players I\u2019ve never seen have a good game, a reality I\u2019d have worn more comfortably if I\u2019d noticed the wings tatted on his neck. They bring a new meaning to the saying \u201cplay with your head up\u201d. 66 min And there\u2019s some, a loose pass from Saka sending Everton onto the attack. Richarlison, who\u2019s spending increasing amounts of time on the left touchline, then puts a ball into the middle, which is cleared directly to Sigurdsson ... who lashes a first-timer somewhere past Neptune and towards Selhurst Park. 64 min Calvert-Lewin flashes a snap-shot wide. As long as this stays 3-2, Everton are well in the game, because Arsenal can insert some hideous defending just like that. 63 min \u201cInterested in hearing about what folk think of your settler/dictator axis in predicting the coaching success of former players,\u201d says Mike Hellberg. \u201cWouldn\u2019t Inzaghi have been a settler?\u201d Not necessarily, or at least that\u2019s not my only criterion \u2013 I\u2019m also looking for players who played with the hearts versus players who played with their heads. You can, for example, be a striker and still spend a lot of time thinking about the game and how to get the most from your talent. 62 min \u201cI would suggest that if you were to re-watch the first goal of the game, as I just have several times,\u201d says JR in Illinois, \u201cyou would see that Calvert-Lewin literally kicked Luiz in the head. And I mean \u2018literally\u2019 in the literal sense of the word, not in the new way where it can also mean the opposite of literally. If you were to see Calvert-Lewin\u2019s boot connecting with Luiz\u2019s head would it change your opinion that the goal should have been allowed?\u201d Yes, maybe. I guess I\u2019d want to see whether Calvert-Lewin was through his shot before Luiz waved his swede in there. 61 min David Luiz is back in business. 60 min And Bernard replaces Iwobi. 59 min While Luiz receives treatment, Andre Gomes replaces Schneiderlin. 58 min Nice from Holgate, launching a long one to Richarlison, who\u2019s pulled left. He then squares up Mustafi, who does nothing apart from back off, then rolls a sidefooter into the path of the onrushing Lewin; David Luiz does just enough to disrupt him, on the slide, but stays down thereafter. 57 min Sigurdsson shakes off Ceballos in centrefield and Ceballos goes down, clutching his entire phizog. But no one cares, so play proceeds and thew ball goes wide to Sidibe, who crosses straight at Leno. 56 min Bernard and Gomes are getting ready. 56 min Xhaka marauds forward, finding Ozil on the right, and he clips an aimless chip into Pickford\u2019s arms. 54 min Everton are just inching their way back into this, Sidibe driving a shot into ankles. 54 min \u201cWondering if Mustafi\u2019s blue rinse hints at early retirement,\u201d tweets Kevin Towl. 52 min Arsenal are all over Everton, for whom Andre Gomes is now warming up. 50 min \u201cIt seems that Rangers are continuing to ruin their chances of a first league title since their financial problems and demotions,\u201d says David Wall. \u201cI wonder what it was that the Rangers board saw in Steven Gerrard, a guy with experience of butchering title challenges from positions of advantage under both Benitez and Rodgers, to make them think he could lead a side successful through a title run-in.\u201d I\u2019m not sure about that. I wouldn\u2019t blame him for the title Benitez didn\u2019t win, I\u2019d blame Ronaldo \u2013 and Macheda - and though he slipped at a crucial moment under Rodgers, his team-mates had ample time to rescue him and could not. I think that Celtic are just a better team, though didn\u2019t see much from Gerrard as a player or as a pundit to make me think he\u2019d be a good manager. He played on instinct, settling games rather than dictating them, and isn\u2019t a good talker. 49 min Everton might get themselves a pummelling here. This is exactly the kind of situation in which Mesut Ozil excels. 48 min Ancelotti must be fuming. I daresay he even lowered an eyebrow. Twenty-three seconds! That\u2019s what it took for Arsenal to shove Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s half-time team-talk up his nostril. Bellerin moved the ball out to Pepe, who lifted a cross towards Aubameyang, and with Sidibe dreaming of pink flying hippos and fluffy toilet seats, the master finisher despatched a header into the corner. 46 min We go again. And yes, Graeme Souness really did say that. Half-time email: \u201cHi, do you think there were genuine issues of high-foot in both or one of the Everton goals? asks Harry Bowie. \u201cFeel like in the second the studs-out from Richarlison was a bit suspect, but Leno should be ready to put his chests or head into studs to prevent a goal, I suppose.\u201d Graeme Souness thought Calvert-Lewin\u2019s foot was high when he scored the first one, but I disagree. His foot was high, but it wasn\u2019t close to booting a head. As for the second, football is a contact sport, he yerdadded, and Richarlison had every chance of getting to it, which he did. Half-time entertainment: it\u2019s been an important afternoon in Scotland, with Rangers drawing and Celtic winning. Nine in a row is very, very close. That was a hugely entertaining half of football, Arsenal giving goals away as quickly as they can score them. The second should be a belter. Everton win a corner that\u2019s not properly cleared, and when the ball\u2019s tossed back in, Mina wins the second ball and Leno spreads himself when he needs to come and get the ball, as though he\u2019d rather make a save than get hit. Except there\u2019s no save to be made until Richarlison takes an unchallenged poke which is enough to beat the aforementioned spread. Poor defending, poor keeping, absolute Arsenal. 45+3 min In commentary, Gary Neville and Bill Leslie note that they can hear the discussions at \u201cStockley Park\u201d, as officials try to decide if that foul deserved a yellow or a red. They both reckon that fans should be able to hear them and that\u2019d solve the problem of VAR; I can\u2019t think of anything I want less at a game that that. Football is an emotional experience, not a pedagogical one. 45+2 min Bellerin and Calvert-Lewin crunch each other in pursuit of a loose ball, then Richarlison slices Ceballos in half. Brows are then connected as outrage abounds, before the ref hands out a yellow card and everyone gets on with it. 45+1 min There\u2019ll be five added minutes. 45 min Everton win a free-kick down the left which Baines sticks into the box. And, though things have changed since that first goal, not everything has changed; Richarlison still has a free header, but he gets under the ball and send it high and wide. 43 min Everton need half-time. They\u2019ve barely had a kick since, er, Kolasinac went off and Saka came on. 41 min Saka shakes his way past Sidibe, on the outside, who responds with a desperate slide-tackle that just about does the job. 39 min Almost all of Arsenal\u2019s attacks have come down their left, which must be nauseating for Nicolas Pepe, because it\u2019s not a coincidence. He spends a lot fo time keeping the width, which is important because it drags the opposing defence across, facilitating goals like the one scored by Aubameyang. But it\u2019s not especially helpful if you\u2019re a winger who likes to cut inside and generally take part in the game. 36 min Bit of possession for Everton. They started really well, and you could easily argue that there wasn\u2019t lots to be done about Arsenal\u2019s first goal. But the second was very poor defensively, starting from the front. 35 min \u201cIt\u2019s taken me a while to be convinced,\u201d says Richard Harris, \u201cbut I think Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be in the England Euro 2020 squad, rather than Danny Ings. He\u2019s better in the air and holds the ball up well so if he stays fit and keeps scoring I think Southgate will go with a player he knows. Having that sort of goal in his locker won\u2019t be lost on the England boss.\u201d Both have their uses, and who goes depends on who\u2019s fit. I\u2019d expect Rashford to make it, and it\u2019s hard to see someone telling Kane he\u2019s not fit. As for who to chose between these two, Ings perhaps makes more sense in terms of offering something that isn\u2019t there otherwise, but Calvert-Lewin will end up being a better player. He\u2019s got plenty of time to make himself a sure thing, but for now, he\u2019s just a talented player in form. David Luiz is allowed to stroll out from the back and you can\u2019t play a high line with no pressure on the ball. He slides a perfect pass into the path of Aubameyang, who leaves Sidibe standing coming from out to in, and obviously he opens his body and passes his usual finish into the bottom corner. 31 min Schneiderlin tugs back Nketiah and is booked. 29 min Arsenal break and Pepe sweeps a ball into the box, to meet Ozil, on the charge; that is not a misprint. But Pickford is out just quickly enough to smother. 29 min Alex Ferguson used to tell his strikers to get to the near post because that\u2019s where you get your goals \u2013 who knows what\u2019ll happen when the ball passes there \u2013 and Nketiah knows it. He\u2019ll need to add more to his game, but he\u2019s absolutely got the knack. This is a lovely goal! Saka is out by the touchline, close to the by-line, and has a defender in close proximity. So he simply bends a luscious cross into the near post which Nketiah reads perfectly, leaping to punch a side-footer past Pickford. That is an expert\u2019s finish, and Bukayo Saka is a star. 26 min Xhaka collects off Luiz and finds Aubameyang, whose eyes light up when he sees Saka gliding up in support. He takes possession and the ball makes its way over to Pepe, who drives into Pickford\u2019s midriff; he collects at the second attempt. 24 min Pepe gets himself into space down the right, cuts inside onto his left foot and wellies a hopeful shot over the bar, crtl c, ctrl x. 22 min \u201cThere\u2019s yonks to go in this game I admit,\u201d says Stephen Carr, \u201cbut I do think it\u2019s worth pointing out how much better Ancelotti has done at Everton than Arteta has at Arsenal.\u201d Yes, although you could argue the job they need to do are different. Ancelotti had a fairly well-balanced squad, whereas Arteta can\u2019t really invent decent defenders. But it\u2019s also fair to say that, if you appoint a young manager, they\u2019re likely to be learning on the job. The majority of what Ancelotti is going to know, he knows already. 21 min I guess, if we\u2019re looking on their bright side, Arsenal now have a better XI on the pitch than they did at kick-off. But Everton look good for another goal at some point. 20 min \u201cEr,\u201d says tom Shaw, \u201ccan you tell me why Everton had to change their kit because because royal blue clashes with Arsenal\u2019s red? Maybe I\u2019ve got exceptional eyesight, but I can tell the difference.\u201d I can only give you my best guess, which begins with \u201cGr\u201d and ends with eenbacks\u201d. 19 min Saka replaces Kolasinac. 17 min Oh dear. Kolasinac is hurt \u2013 his arm is in a sling and he\u2019s holding his shoulder. He\u2019ll have to go off, having only just come back from injury. 16 min The Emirates: London\u2019s greatest dance floor. 15 min Sidibe and Kolasinac contest a high ball \u2013 even the air winces - and their bodies mince. Kolasinac absorbs the worst of it and accepts treatment. 14 min \u201cI\u2019m watching this on a small screen, admittedly,\u201d says Thomas Atkins, \u201cbut Mustafi\u2019s haircut makes him look like mid-noughties horrorshow centre-half Pascal Cygan from a distance. Seems to be playing like him too.\u201d Given a roll of honour which includes Squillachi, Senderos, Silverstre, Stepanovs and Chambers, I\u2019d say Cygan was one of the better centre-backs signed by Wenger. 13 min Arsenal win a corner down the right which Pepe swings in. Mustafi is up too, but he\u2019s under it rather than on a run, and heads over the top. 12 min This is an enjoyable game. Both sides are looking to attack, and neither seems all that au fait with is commonly referred to as \u201cdefending\u201d. 10 min Arsenal are Mustafis and Luizes in defence and Calvert-Lewin gets in behind. But the former slides in, to concede a corner which comes to nothing. 9 min Everton counter at speed, and Wicharlison weleases Irobi, who cuts into the box and has men in the middle. But he tries to punch an ambitious finish into the far top corner and it\u2019s not a bad effort, but he\u2019d have been much better seeking to square. 8 min Do we think beards are ever going to cease being \u201cfashionable\u201d? It\u2019s been years now. I ask this because Sidibe has a strange version, that\u2019s like a goatee only it has bits which proceed up the jawline. 7 min Mustafinbauer strides forward and finds Aubameyang down the left. He has men in the middle too, but dallies and dithers until Sidibe slides in, blocking the eventual cross behind. The corner comes to nowt. 5 min Possession for Arsenal, who are settling. Ceballos slings a pass wide for Pepe, who attracts three men, allowing him to poke back to Bellerin, who\u2019s unmarked. But he flings his head up and arches his back back, sweeping over the bar close to the near post. 3 min \u201cCharles, you\u2019re not entirely wrong but you have misread Trump a bit,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cMaking the UK people American citizens would imply that Trump would give you equal status. Trump will offer you indentured servant status instead.\u201d I look forward to Boris Johnson building a bridge across the Atlantic Ocean. We\u2019ve all seen Arsenal play football. Everton win a free-kick 30 yards out and Arsenal\u2019s marking is extremely arsenal, so when Sigurdsson curls it in, there are 62 attackers behind the defensive line. The ball then hits Luiz on the shoulder because of course it does, but what about what happens next! Calvert-Lewin vaults into an overhead kick, somehow sending the ball to Leno\u2019s right, with his right foot, from bang in front of goal. Brilliant finish. 1 min For those watching in black and white, Everton are playing in their navy change kit, because their usual royal blue clashes with Arsenal\u2019s red. 1 min Off we go! Shkodran, we still know it\u2019s you. \u201cIf we\u2019re doing predictions,\u201d says Charles Antaki, \u201cthen mine is that Bernie will win the nomination, Trump will reign for 10 more years or until the world goes to blazes literally and figuratively, and Boris will make us all take US citizenship.\u201d I think this is a Stan Kroenke riff. Here they come! The players are tunnelled, Leighton Baines humming Menswear\u2019s latest number. But I can\u2019t stop looking at that Everton midfield, which is extremely slow. Ancelotti will need to have a plan to mitigate that, because Arsenal have an extra man and extra technique. So how is this one going to go? I think there\u2019s a good chance Everton cause Arsenal problems to begin with, and although the bookies don\u2019t agree with me, I can see a score draw. Ancelotti says the players are working well and that Lucas Digne felt something in the week, so he preferred not to risk him. That\u2019s about it. \u201cI\u2019m intrigued!\u201d emails Harry Christie. \u201cWhat\u2019s your beef with Laca? He\u2019s profligate but his hold-up play and general work-rate is crucial to getting up the pitch and surely is a better option than Bambi on Ice Nketiah?\u201d No beef, I think he\u2019s an alright player. But he\u2019s slow and doesn\u2019t score enough \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t get in any of the teams with whom Arsenal want to compete, and he\u2019s not good enough to justify Aubameyang hanging about on the left. If you could combine them you\u2019d have a player. Geoff Shreeves asks Mikel Arteta if he wants Arsenal to play well today. Yes, Arteta does want Arsenal to play well today. He (Arteta, not Shreeves) also says that he wanted fresh players today, and is impressed by Everton under Ancelotti. Amazingly, he\u2019s not bothered when Shreeves tells him that Everton have yet to win at the Emirates; how can he possibly discount the significance of the 1-1 draw in October 2006? Pah. Longtime followers of this blog will know that it\u2019s not really a blog about football but a blog about nineties jungle, and Sky have just played this so. In some ways I\u2019m surprised by the teams Arteta\u2019s been picking. He was essentially given six months to build something, but I still don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen what will be his first XI next season. He\u2019s shown a lot more faith in Lacazette than I expected, given there\u2019s not a chance he thinks he\u2019s good enough for where Arsenal want to go, and it\u2019s also slightly odd how seldom Aubameyang has played centre-forward. The question, though, is whether Schneiderlin and Delph spend their afternoon chugging about \u2013 ok, that bit isn\u2019t a question \u2013 as Ceballos and Ozil dance between them. I\u2019d not be at all surprised to see that in the second half, but if Everton can get in amongst them early on, I\u2019d be equally unsurprised to see Everton score first. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how Arsenal\u2019s fabled defence deals with Everton\u2019s strikers. Richarlison has the raw materials to develop into a serious player \u2013 I\u2019m not surprised Barca were interested in him, nor that Everton knocked them back, because where are they getting anyone even nearly as good? If Sigurdsson and Iwobi can get him enough of the ball, he can give Luiz and Mustafi plenty, and that\u2019s even before we consider that he\u2019s got Calvert-Lewin next to him. It\u2019s great to see Mason Holgate establishing himself in the Everton side. I remember seeing him in a pre-season game maybe three years ago, and he looked a player then; I\u2019m not surprised to see that he\u2019s now ahead of Michael Keane in the pecking order, because I am intimately familiar with the politics of chicken coops. As for Everton, Walcott is out and Bernard on the bench. Delph, meanwhile, returns from suspension and Iwobi comes back in off the bench. In defence, Sidibe is preferred to Coleman, while Digne is injured. And, in great news, Andre Gomes is back on the bench. Yes, ok, Saka isn\u2019t playing. Very funny. It\u2019s the way you tell them. I wonder if that shows us that Arteta\u2019s priority is the Europa League, because nothing I\u2019ve seen of Sead Kolasinac says that he\u2019s superior in any department, other than battering muggers. Otherwise, Ozil is in because it\u2019s a home game against a less good team, and so does Ceballos, who was good against Newcastle. Lacazette also drops out, with Nketiah replacing him. Arsenal (an artetaballing! 4-3-3): Leno; Bellerin, Mustafi, Luiz, Kolasinac; Xhaka, Ceballos, Ozil; Pepe, Nketiah, Aubameyang. Subs: Martinez, Sokratis, Lacazette, Torreira, Nelson, Guendouzi, Saka. Everton (a sophisticate\u2019s 4-4-2): Pickford; Sidibe, Holgate, Mina, Baines; Sigurdsson, Delph, Schneiderlin, Iwobi; Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Stekelenburg, Keane, Bernard, Gomes, Coleman, Davies, Kean. There\u2019s quite a lot going on here. Both teams have new managers and both have improved since appointing them. But can we really be arsed yet another discussion about whether the name of a manager who\u2019s done nothing merits the suffix \u201cball\u201d, or with examining Carlo\u2019s Ancelotti\u2019s stellar career of success with other people\u2019s teams, when we could just talk about Bukayo Sako instead? Of course we can\u2019t, so here we go. In the 37 years I\u2019ve been hopelessly obsessed with this thing of ours, never has there been such a hilarious, disgusting raft of brilliant young English talent. Why, it\u2019s almost as though these things are cyclical; that the influx of foreign players has raised domestic standards; and that those who are good enough will always find a way! Saka, then. He first attracted attention in the dog-days of early season, when Arsenal were only worth watching if they were playing in the Europa League, because their younger players had yet to be enervated by Unai Emery\u2019s masterplan. He scored a lovely goal away to Eintracht Frankfurt, but yet more impressive were his two assists and the general intelligence of his play. Still, it was fairly surprising that, when Arsenal needed a left-back, it was to him they turned, and the way he has embraced the challenge is nothing short of shocking. Not because Saka\u2019s talent is in dispute, but because 18-year-olds tend not to establish themselves in any top-flight team, never mind in the wrong position; attackers playing in defence even less so. It\u2019s fair to say that, as the game and the world have changed, what defenders do has changed too. Kids tend to play small-sided games with the focus on skill rather than physicality and the internet has made the game accessible in all its forms, while at the elite level, attack has triumphed over defence. Saka, though, mixes this modern approach with the timeless elements that will always distinguish reliable players from useful players: attitude, decision-making and nous. He is entirely unfazed by the frankly ludicrous situation in which he finds himself, his ability to select the correct cross for each situation is far more impressive than his ability to execute it, and his solidity at the back is more noteworthy than his enterprise going forward. He is the very model of a modern English ftbllr. Anyway, this should be a really good game. Arsenal are unbeaten in 2020 and, following a succession of draws, have won three on the spin. Everton, meanwhile, haven\u2019t lost since their FA Cup humiliation at Anfield, have won their last two and are \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 starting to look like a team. Kick-off: 4.30pm GMT",

      "body": "<p>Their propensity to do things the hard way shows little sign of disappearing just yet but, as Mikel Arteta punched the sky and celebrated with his backroom staff, Arsenal could sense something a little different in the air. This win over a bright Everton side felt significant, even in an arena that knows false dawns like few others, and all of a sudden their path towards the European spots does not look quite as fraught.

The confirmation they have contracted the virus brings the number of people with Covid-19 in the UK up to 13. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the patients caught the virus onboard the Diamond Princess. The cruise ship had been held for more than two weeks off the coast of Japan. The patients are being transferred from Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral, Merseyside, to specialist NHS infection centres. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said \u201ca full infectious disease risk assessment\u201d was done before Saturday\u2019s flight back from Japan and stressed that no one who boarded the flight had displayed any symptoms of the virus. A total of 32 passengers \u2013 30 British and two Irish citizens \u2013 were taken to the Arrowe Park hospital after their plane touched down in England.

Harkin, who is from Derry but lives across the border in County Donegal, said she and her partner were healthy and safe but would remain in Australia for the next two weeks. The news of four new coronavirus cases came as more than 100 Britons who had been flown back from China ended their two-week quarantine in Milton Keynes. The evacuees had been kept in isolation at Kents Hill Park hotel and conference centre from 9 February. The British nationals and their family members were treated there after travelling on an evacuation flight from the Chinese city of Wuhan \u2013 the centre of the coronavirus outbreak.

      "body": "<p>Christian Petzold\u2019s Undine is an intriguing, bemusing oddity of a film: a suspense drama-thriller with a fey supernatural twist. It\u2019s a sphinx that, if not exactly without a secret, has less of a secret than it thinks it has. And it is possible to come away from the film less than convinced, but very impressed by the sheer force of Petzold\u2019s film-making talent (recently so stunning in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/14/transit-review-christian-petzold-franz-rogowski\">his drama Transit</a>) but which has been here deployed for something which is a bit flimsy and silly.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/27/frantz-star-paula-beer-to-see-berliners-voting-for-the-far-right-shocked-me\">Paula Beer plays Undine</a> who, as her name suggests, may have intense sympathies with water. She lives in Berlin, and is a stylish and elegant historian who lectures on the city\u2019s architectural history at the Berlin City Models exhibition. But she is also conducting an unhappy adulterous affair with Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), which is reaching its unhappy end at the film\u2019s opening - revealing a flash of something angry and even violent in Undine.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aEblSb3VgI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1aEblSb3VgI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But in the midst of this traumatic episode, Undine is to have a fateful encounter with a strange man who has heard her lecture, and appears to be in love with her. This is Christoph, an underwater diver played by Franz Rogowski - a sensual screen presence with a little of Joaquin Phoenix.

      "bodyText": "Christian Petzold\u2019s Undine is an intriguing, bemusing oddity of a film: a suspense drama-thriller with a fey supernatural twist. It\u2019s a sphinx that, if not exactly without a secret, has less of a secret than it thinks it has. And it is possible to come away from the film less than convinced, but very impressed by the sheer force of Petzold\u2019s film-making talent (recently so stunning in his drama Transit) but which has been here deployed for something which is a bit flimsy and silly. Paula Beer plays Undine who, as her name suggests, may have intense sympathies with water. She lives in Berlin, and is a stylish and elegant historian who lectures on the city\u2019s architectural history at the Berlin City Models exhibition. But she is also conducting an unhappy adulterous affair with Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), which is reaching its unhappy end at the film\u2019s opening - revealing a flash of something angry and even violent in Undine. But in the midst of this traumatic episode, Undine is to have a fateful encounter with a strange man who has heard her lecture, and appears to be in love with her. This is Christoph, an underwater diver played by Franz Rogowski - a sensual screen presence with a little of Joaquin Phoenix. Soon Undine and Christoph are having a passionate affair, and he introduces her to his mysterious professional world, little guessing that she may be far more at home in it than he ever could be. Their relationship is passionately sensual, though Undine is perplexed at the sheer rapture with which Christoph listens to her lectures about Berlin\u2019s planning history. Is there a metaphorical dimension to this? Maybe. Certainly their emotional connection has restored something like happiness to her, and effaced the mad furious unhappiness of her former liaison. But then she is to chance across Johannes once again and a terrible destiny begins to stir in those watery depths with which Undine feels such empathy. In truth, Undine is a bit of a shaggy dog story, or maybe a slimy giant catfish story; though it is just so skilfully made, beautifully acted and directed. Rogowski brings something unstable and dangerous to the part and so, in a more contained way, does Beer. What might this cast and this director do if they were working on a more compelling and substantial story? As it stands, Undine is a diverting and handsomely crafted piece of fantasy.",

there will be a ban on the Venice Carnival as well as on all events, sporting as well, until March 1 inclusive,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n  <p>Earlier, Zaia reported the first two cases of coronavirus in Venice as officials struggled to contain an outbreak of the disease.Almost all of Italy\u2019s cases are clustered in the north, with roughly a dozen towns on lockdown meaning that people are not allowed to enter or leave the towns\u2019 boundaries.</p> \n  <p>The governor of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said that there were 89 cases in his region, most of which had popped up in small towns in the countryside.</p> \n  <p>It comes as hotel reservations in Venice were down one-third during the first weekend of Carnival, though the floods in the lagoon city late last year are likely

<p>Despite a decline in cases from China it is \u201cextremely concerning\u201d to see developments elsewhere, experts have said.</p> \n  <p>Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia (UEA), said: \u201cThe dramatic increase in case in South Korea most of which are associated with a religious sect has been unprecedented so far in the epidemic. Although far less dramatic Japan is the country with most cases after China and South Korea and is also experiencing a growing epidemic.\u201d </p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cThe identification of the large cluster of cases in Italy yesterday is a big worry for Europe and we can expect there to by quite a few more cases identified in the next few days.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Hunter said the situation in Iran \u201chas major implications for the Middle East\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is unlikely that Iran will have the resources and facilities to adequately identify cases and adequately manage them if case numbers are large,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>He noted that another concern with the Iranian cases is wider armed conflicts in the region. \u201cAs we have seen with Ebola in the Democratic Republic and Poliomyelitis in Syria, war facilitates the spread of infectious disease.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Prof Andrew Tatem from the University of Southampton, said that there was previously a relatively low number of cases outside of China but recent news was worrying.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe fact that cases have been confirmed in both Canada and Lebanon that seem to have come from Iran suggests that a significant outbreak is ongoing there and may have been occurring for some time.\u201d </p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cIran normally has some strong travel connections to countries where health systems may be weaker, such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan \u2013 importations and outbreaks here would be particularly concerning in terms of capacities to detect the virus and contain spread.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Dr Robin Thompson from the University of Oxford said we were at an important stage of the outbreak. \u201cFast isolation of even mild cases in affected areas is important for preventing substantial person-to-person transmission in Europe. It is critical that public health guidelines are followed.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T12:42:50.820Z\">at 12.42pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5270638f086a28115b0e98\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T12:31:36.282Z\">12.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>China\u2019s president said measures to deal with the coronavirus outbreak have been effective, but the battle is still at a crucial stage.</p> \n  <p>On Sunday, state TV quoted Xi Jinping as saying the situation is showing a positive trend after arduous efforts but remains serious and complex.</p> \n  <p>He said the outbreak will have a relatively big hit on the economy and society but the government will step up policy support to help achieve economic and social development targets for 2020.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5267a08f08e13324748810\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T11:58:43.506Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 100 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a>, as numbers continued to rise on Sunday following government measures to limit the spread of the outbreak.

Here are a selection of them, including whether we should panic: </p> \n  <h2><strong>What is Covid-19 - the illness that started in Wuhan?</strong></h2> \n  <p>It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.</p> \n  <h2><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></h2> \n  <p>The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.</p> \n  <h2><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></h2> \n  <p>UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.</p> \n  <h2><strong>Is the outbreak a pandemic?</strong></h2> \n  <p>A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \u201cthe worldwide spread of a disease\u201d. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO\u2019s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.</p> \n  <h2><strong>Should we panic?</strong></h2> \n  <p>No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency</a> of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5240a38f08e13324748757\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T09:16:13.778Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In South Korea\u2019s fourth-biggest city, Daegu, 90 new cases were confirmed on Sunday, bringing the city\u2019s total to 247. <br></p> \n  <p>More than half of the people confirmed to have been infected are either members of \u2013 or connected to \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/world/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-shincheonji.html\">the Shincheonji Church of Jesus</a>, a secretive religious sect with a strong presence in Daegu. </p> \n  <p>The mayor asked all Shincheonji members with symptoms to come forward and be tested, with hundreds yet to be reached by authorities.<br></p> \n  <p>Moon described the situation in Daegu and Cheongdo \u2013 the birthplace of Shincheonji\u2019s founder Lee Man-hee \u2013 as a \u201cnational crisis\u201d, adding the cities would receive \u201cfull support\u201d for any lacking medical supplies and personnel.</p> \n  <p>Shincheonji, accused of being a cult by mainstream Christian groups, claims its founder has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on judgment day.</p> \n  <p>But with more church members than available places in heaven, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts.</p> \n  <p>In a video statement read out by its spokesman, Shincheonji apologised for \u201ccausing concern\u201d, but insisted it was cooperating with health authorities for the \u201cearly cessation\u201d of the situation.</p> \n  <p>The spokesman refuted public criticism blaming his church over the spike in the number of infections, noting the virus had broken out in China. \u201cPlease be aware that the Shincheonji Church of Jesus and its members are the biggest victims of the COVID-19,\u201d he said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T10:38:09.905Z\">at 10.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e523fd38f0811db2fafccc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/robinmckie\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T09:03:53.776Z\">9.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A repatriation flight carrying 32 Britons and Europeans from the coronavirus-infected cruise ship Diamond Princess landed in the UK on Saturday \u2013 amid growing fears for the welfare of some UK passengers left behind in Japan.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/coronavirus-cruise-ship-diamond-princess-passengers-land-in-uk\">Passengers from coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess land in UK</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e523eb98f0811db2fafccc3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T09:00:46.882Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">South Korea spike in cases leads president to raise alert level to 'highest'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>President Moon Jae-in said South Korea was raising its alert level on the new coronavirus to the \u201chighest\u201d in the face of a sudden spike in the number of infections.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 incident faces a grave turning point.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Angela Giuffrida, Patrick Wintour and Sam Jones\u2019s roundup of today\u2019s coronavirus developments across the globe. Four of the 32 British and Irish Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers taken to Arrowe Park, Merseyside on Saturday have tested positive for coronavirus strain Covid-19, the chief medical officer for England has said. Prof Chris Whitty said: \u201cFour further patients in England have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 13. \u201cThe virus was passed on in the Diamond Princess cruise ship and the patients are being transferred from Arrowe Park to specialist NHS infection centres.\u201d We are pausing the live blog now but will update it again is there are more major developments. There have been a lot of updates today in terms of how the coronavirus is spreading and what measures are being taken to stop it. Here is a summary of the main points. Turkey and Pakistan have closed their borders with Iran in an effort to stop the potential spread of coronavirus. It comes after Iran reported 43 cases of the disease and eight deaths. Turkey will also be halting incoming flights and said all highways and railways at the border would shut at 5pm local time. A provincial official in Pakistan and the country\u2019s Frontier Corps confirmed that it had also sealed its land border with Iran. More than 100 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy, as the government adopts measures to limit the spread of the outbreak. Milan\u2019s mayor, Giuseppe Sala, announced that all schools would be closed from Monday. Universities in both Lombardy and Veneto have also been shuttered until early March. Italians across the country\u2019s north prepared for weeks of quarantine on Sunday as lockdown measures hit tens of thousands. Over 50,000 residents in 11 towns \u2013 10 in Lombardy and one in the neighbouring region of Veneto \u2013 now face what the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said on Saturday could be weeks of lockdown. The final two days of the Venice carnival have been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. Fashion week in Milan was also also affected and Giorgio Armani, whose show was scheduled for 4pm on Sunday afternoon, announced on Saturday night that guests should not come to the venue. Instead, the collection would be shown to an empty room. In the UK, 118 people flown out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, were leaving Kents Hill Park training and conference centre in Milton Keynes on Sunday for the first time in 14 days. They had been quarantined there. The European Union sees \u201cno need to panic\u201d over a coronavirus outbreak in Italy that has killed two people and infected more than 100 in the country. The bloc\u2019s economic affairs commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said: \u201cThe EU has full confidence in the Italian authorities and the decisions they are taking.\u201d \u201cWe share concern for possible contagion [but] there is no need to panic.\u201d Venice carnival will close early this year due to concerns about the coronavirus, which has spread in northern Italy. Below is a photograph of a police officer wearing a protective face mask and standing next to a masked carnival reveller at the event. The Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has said that if the virus outbreak persists it may have a big impact on Japan and global economies through supply chain disruptions. France should produce more vital goods, such as drugs and electric batteries, as the coronavirus outbreak highlights the danger of relying on imports from China, the country\u2019s finance minister said. Bruno Le Maire spoke to Reuters on Sunday as the virus spread in Europe, with Italy particularly affected. Le Maire said the emergency called for accelerating a shift in industrial policy towards making key goods within national or European Union borders, using state aid when necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s not protectionism, it\u2019s just responsibility,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a meeting of financial leaders in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \u201cIt costs a lot at the starting point so you need the support of public funding. China is doing the same, the United States are doing the same, I don\u2019t know why Europe would not do the same for strategic assets like electric batteries.\u201d The Irish singer Rebecca Harkin is among those who have been evacuated from the Coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess. The musician is now in quarantine in Australia. She and her partner were working as musicians on the ship and were evacuated to Australia along with many others. They will spend two weeks in quarantine in Darwin. Pakistan has closed its land border with Iran, as Afghanistan suspends travel to the neighbouring country amid concerns about the growing numbers of people being infected by new coronavirus. \u201cTo prevent the spread of the novel \u001dcoronavirus and protect the public, Afghanistan suspends all passenger movement (air and ground) to and from Iran,\u201d the office of the National Security Council of Afghanistan said in a statement posted on Twitter. A provincial official in Pakistan and the country\u2019s Frontier Corps also confirmed that the country had sealed the land border with Iran. Iran has now had eight deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country outside China. The latest three deaths reported on Sunday were among 15 new confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus, bringing the overall number of infections to 43. Four new infections surfaced in the capital Tehran, seven in the holy city of Qom, two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said. Authorities have ordered as a \u201cpreventive measure\u201d the closure of schools, universities and other educational centres in 14 provinces across Iran from Sunday. Afghanistan and Pakistan share porous borders with Iran that are often used by smugglers and human traffickers, while millions of Afghan refugees currently live in the Islamic Republic. Fears were raised that the virus could easily spread over the border. Health authorities said that 18 of the 39 South Koreans from the south-eastern region who had made a group pilgrimage to sites in Israel later tested positive for the virus. Israel\u2019s foreign ministry issued added warnings about travel to South Korea and Japan due to the coronavirus, and the health ministry is ordering Israelis returning from those countries to remain in home quarantine. This was previously ordered for those returning from Hong Kong, China, Macau, Thailand and Singapore. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will be adding additional restrictions on entry to Israel from countries including Australia and Japan. Iran has seen the lowest parliamentary election turnout since 1979, with senior figures blaming the new coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThe turnout across the country was 42.57% ... In Tehran, it was around 25%. Across Iran, over 24 million people voted,\u201d interior minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli told a televised news conference. The final results showed big gains by hardline loyalists close to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on all state matters. Khamenei, who on Friday said that voting was \u201ca religious duty\u201d, blamed the low turnout on the \u201cnegative propaganda\u201d about the new coronavirus by Iran\u2019s enemies. \u201cThis negative propaganda about the virus began a couple of months ago and grew larger ahead of the election,\u201d said Khamenei, according to his official website. \u201cTheir media did not miss the tiniest opportunity for dissuading Iranian voters and resorting to the excuse of disease and the virus.\u201d The turnout is seen as a referendum on the popularity of the Islamic Republic\u2019s rulers. It was 62% in the 2016 parliamentary vote and 66% of voters cast ballots in 2012. Giuseppe Conte says cases of the the Covid-19 virus in Italy have risen dramatically in the past two days. The prime minister told a press conference Italy would not try and suspend the Schengen treaty as such a draconian measure would be disproportionate. Schools in Milan will be closed, however, and people will not be allowed in and out of affected areas. Social and sporting events in Lombardy and Veneto have also been cancelled. As of Sunday morning, there were 89 confirmed coronavirus cases in Lombardy (with two in its industrial centre, Milan) 16 in Veneto, three in Piedmont (including two in Turin) and two in Emilia-Romagna The virus can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Hand-washing is a first line of defence Here is a roundup of the areas where cases of Covid-19, the virus\u2019s official designation, have been confirmed: China: 77,000 people have been infected and 2,442 have died. South Korea: 602 people have been infected by the virus and five people have died. Japan: more than 130 people have been infected and four have died. Singapore: 85 people infected. Thailand: 35 cases. Malaysia: 22 cases. Taiwan: 26 cases, including one death. Australia: 17 cases. Vietnam: 16 cases. Philippines: three cases, including one death. India: three cases Nepal: one case. Sri Lanka: one case. Cambodia: one case United States: 35 cases. Canada: eight cases. Italy: 132 cases, two deaths. Germany: 16 cases. France: 12, including one death. Britain: nine cases. Russia: five cases. Spain: two cases. Finland: one case. Sweden: one case. Belgium: one case. Iran: 43, eight deaths, the largest number of fatalities of any country outside China. United Arab Emirates: 11 cases Israel: one case. Lebanon: one case. Egypt: one case. Turkey will close its border with Iran as a precautionary measure to halt the possible spread of coronavirus. It comes after reports emerged of 43 cases of the disease in Iran, with eight deaths \u2013 the highest death toll outside of China. The Turkish health minister Fahrettin Koca said on Sunday that all highways and railways would be closed as of 5pm (14.00 GMT). Flights from Iran were suspended, he told reporters. The Japanese government faces growing questions about whether it is doing enough to counter the coronavirus, after 773 cases were announced by early Sunday evening. Most of the infected people were from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined near Tokyo. A third passenger from the ship \u2013 a Japanese man in his 80s \u2013 died on Sunday. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, instructed government agencies to urgently prepare medical provisions and draft a comprehensive plan to curb the spread. Jordan will not allow entry to citizens of China, Iran and South Korea and other foreigners travelling from those countries in response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak. The minister of state for media affairs, Amjad Adayleh, said the decision was part of \u201cpre-emptive measures ... following the rise in cases of coronavirus in South Korea, Iran\u201d and China. Adayleh said the ban would be \u201ctemporary\u201d and imposed on all non-Jordanians coming from the three nations among the worst affected by the illness. \u201cJordanians who come from those countries will be placed in quarantine for two weeks to ensure they have not contracted the coronavirus,\u201d he said. Milan fashion week has also been affected by the outbreak. Giorgio Armani, whose show was scheduled for 4pm on Sunday afternoon, announced on Saturday night that guests should not come to the venue. Instead, the collection would be shown to an empty room. \u201cThe decision was taken to safeguard the wellbeing of all his [Armani\u2019s] invited guests by not having them attend crowded spaces,\u201d said a press release. On Sunday, the head of the civil protection department, Angelo Borrelli, said during a press conference that thousands of beds were at the ready in military barracks or hotels to house quarantined or sick individuals, if needed. The number of those infected with the virus had now grown to 132, including the two people who died, Borrelli said. Italians across the country\u2019s north prepared for weeks of quarantine on Sunday as lockdown measures hit tens of thousands. More than 100 cases have now been reported in Italy, with two deaths from the virus since Friday. Most of the reports centred around the small town of Codogno, about 43 miles (70km) south-east of Milan. Over 50,000 residents in eleven towns - 10 in Lombardy and one in the neighbouring region of Veneto - now face what prime minister Giuseppe Conte said on Saturday could be weeks of lockdown. In Casalpusterlengo, a 10-minute drive from Codogno, locals lined up outside supermarkets wearing facemasks. Photographs emerged showing them gathering supplies. Shoppers were made to wait, then allowed to enter in groups of 40 inside the store to stock up on provisions. \u201cIt\u2019s inhuman,\u201d said one man, speaking to AFP, who gave his name as Sante. \u201cFighting over four sandwiches is just disgusting.\u201d Another woman, Emanuela, told AFP-TV that residents were nervous. \u201cI\u2019m really scared. We\u2019re going through a really tough situation,\u201d said the woman, a nurse who works in the area. Blockades had not yet been put up, and cars were still driving around the area of Codogno and Casalpusterlengo, but police were patrolling. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing to set up the checkpoints for the containment zone,\u201d a police officer told AFP, saying that initially the perimeter would be narrow but could widen over time. \u201cWe\u2019re about 10 criminal police teams here, so nothing related to this kind of situation, but we\u2019ve been called in from Bologna, Turin and Genoa to give a hand,\u201d she added. The coronavirus is communist China\u2019s \u201cbiggest health emergency\u201d, said president Xi Jinping. The virus has killed over 2,400 people and Xi Jinping said Sunday that it was necessary to learn from \u201cobvious shortcomings exposed\u201d during China\u2019s response. The new coronavirus has drawn comparisons to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak of 2002-2003 which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong, and led to criticism over authorities\u2019 cover-up. While China has been praised by the World Health Organization for its handling of the epidemic this time, the death of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang, who was reprimanded for warning about the virus, sparked calls for political reform and freedom of speech. In comments reported by state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday, Xi said the epidemic \u201chas the fastest transmission, widest range of infection and has been the most difficult to prevent and control\u201d. \u201cThis is a crisis for us and it is a big test,\u201d he said. He said it was the \u201clargest public health emergency\u201d since communist China\u2019s founding in 1949 Xi\u2019s comments come as the number of virus infections hit almost 77,000 in mainland China - with countries such as South Korea on high alert and Italy taking containment measures as well. Xi acknowledged that the epidemic will \u201cinevitably have a large impact on the economy and society\u201d, but he stressed the effects will be \u201cshort-term\u201d and controllable. Some 118 people flown out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, were leaving Kents Hill Park training and conference centre in Milton Keynes on Sunday for the first time in 14 days. The group, who were brought back to Britain earlier this month, included about 10 children and a family of four. Health secretary Matt Hancock said: As the final group flown from Wuhan leave supported isolation in Milton Keynes today, they must be commended for their patience and perseverance. All 118 are in good health and pose no risk to the public \u2013 and this is thanks to the dedicated team of healthcare professionals and other staff who have worked round the clock to keep each and every one of them safe and supported. I\u2019m incredibly proud that once again our NHS and public health teams \u2013 including at Milton Keynes Hospital and Milton Keynes council \u2013 have gone the extra mile to deal with this situation.\u201d Professor Keith Willett NHS strategic incident director, said: The guests from Kents Hill Park Hotel are leaving today, and I\u2019d like to thank them for the very responsible compliance they have shown during their time in self-isolation. In the upcoming weeks, more of us may need to spend time at home to reduce the spread of the virus, and those in Milton Keynes have set the best example of how to self-isolate, while remaining calm and patient in what must have been a difficult situation. I would also like to thank all of the NHS staff and partners, as well as colleagues at Public Health England, who have worked to make their stay as comfortable as possible, as well as doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals across the NHS who have successfully treated patients.\u201d The final two days of the Venice Carnival have been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. The head of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, said on Sunday that the event, which draws tourists from around the world, would no longer continue on Monday and Tuesday after more than 100 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy. Zaia told reporters that events scheduled for Sunday in the lagoon city would continue as planned. \u201cBut as of this evening there will be a ban on the Venice Carnival as well as on all events, sporting as well, until March 1 inclusive,\u201d he said. Earlier, Zaia reported the first two cases of coronavirus in Venice as officials struggled to contain an outbreak of the disease.Almost all of Italy\u2019s cases are clustered in the north, with roughly a dozen towns on lockdown meaning that people are not allowed to enter or leave the towns\u2019 boundaries. The governor of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said that there were 89 cases in his region, most of which had popped up in small towns in the countryside. It comes as hotel reservations in Venice were down one-third during the first weekend of Carnival, though the floods in the lagoon city late last year are likely to have scared off visitors. Despite a decline in cases from China it is \u201cextremely concerning\u201d to see developments elsewhere, experts have said. Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia (UEA), said: \u201cThe dramatic increase in case in South Korea most of which are associated with a religious sect has been unprecedented so far in the epidemic. Although far less dramatic Japan is the country with most cases after China and South Korea and is also experiencing a growing epidemic.\u201d He added: \u201cThe identification of the large cluster of cases in Italy yesterday is a big worry for Europe and we can expect there to by quite a few more cases identified in the next few days.\u201d Hunter said the situation in Iran \u201chas major implications for the Middle East\u201d. \u201cIt is unlikely that Iran will have the resources and facilities to adequately identify cases and adequately manage them if case numbers are large,\u201d he said. He noted that another concern with the Iranian cases is wider armed conflicts in the region. \u201cAs we have seen with Ebola in the Democratic Republic and Poliomyelitis in Syria, war facilitates the spread of infectious disease.\u201d Prof Andrew Tatem from the University of Southampton, said that there was previously a relatively low number of cases outside of China but recent news was worrying. \u201cThe fact that cases have been confirmed in both Canada and Lebanon that seem to have come from Iran suggests that a significant outbreak is ongoing there and may have been occurring for some time.\u201d He said: \u201cIran normally has some strong travel connections to countries where health systems may be weaker, such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan \u2013 importations and outbreaks here would be particularly concerning in terms of capacities to detect the virus and contain spread.\u201d Dr Robin Thompson from the University of Oxford said we were at an important stage of the outbreak. \u201cFast isolation of even mild cases in affected areas is important for preventing substantial person-to-person transmission in Europe. It is critical that public health guidelines are followed.\u201d China\u2019s president said measures to deal with the coronavirus outbreak have been effective, but the battle is still at a crucial stage. On Sunday, state TV quoted Xi Jinping as saying the situation is showing a positive trend after arduous efforts but remains serious and complex. He said the outbreak will have a relatively big hit on the economy and society but the government will step up policy support to help achieve economic and social development targets for 2020. More than 100 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy, as numbers continued to rise on Sunday following government measures to limit the spread of the outbreak. Here\u2019s a selection of photos from the northern region, which has been worst hit. The worst-affected areas in Italy are Lombardy \u2013 home to Italy\u2019s financial capital, Milan \u2013 and Veneto, Italy\u2019s industrial heartland What\u2019s happening and where? The World Health Organization (WHO) is worried about the number of cases with no clear link \u2013 including those with no travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case. However, the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, WHO\u2019s director general said on Saturday. It added that there have been more than 1,200 cases in 26 countries. South Korea The country declared a \u201cred alert\u201d on Sunday after a surge in coronavirus infections and two more deaths. On Sunday it was confirmed that coronavirus cases in the country jumped to 602 and the death toll rose to five. China There have been a reported 76,936 cases of the disease caused by the virus, known as Covid-19, including 2,442 deaths. In mainland China there were 648 new confirmed cases on Saturday, up from 397 a day earlier. The virus epicentre of Hubei province reported 96 new deaths, of which 82 were in the provincial capital Wuhan. The World Athletics Indoor Championships, scheduled for Nanjing from March 13-15, were postponed until next year. Other sporting events have been postponed. The International Monetary Fund predicted on Saturday the outbreak would lower China\u2019s growth this year to 5.6%. Hong Kong There have been 74 confirmed cases, up from 69 on Saturday. The death toll is two. Italy In the country\u2019s northern Lombardy region 89 cases were reported on Sunday, up from 54 a day earlier. The total number of cases in the country has now reached more than 100. Veneto, the other worst hit area, said it had 19 cases, up seven from Saturday. Two people have died. Authorities have banned public events and told workers in affected areas to stay home. Iran There have been a further 15 ases of the new coronavirus, health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said, taking the total to 43 with a death toll of eight. France It currently had one patient with the virus but new cases were reportedly \u201cvery likely\u201d. Japan Elderly passengers from aboard a cruise ship moored near Tokyo died, as hundreds more disembarked after two weeks in quarantine. Tokyo Metropolitan Government said it would either cancel or postpone major indoor events it has sponsored for the next three weeks. Iran has confirmed eight deaths from the the new coronavirus, with the number infected rising to 43. Most of the infections have been in Qom. The health minister, Saeed Namaki, urged people to avoid travelling to the city, a major site for Shia pilgrims 75 miles (120km) south of the capital, Tehran. \u201cThe virus came from China to Qom city. A Merchant from Qom who died of the virus used to regularly travel to China ... Flights were suspended between the two countries but he used indirect flights,\u201d Namaki said. \u201cObviously we do not recommend trips to Qom or any other holy Shia cities in Iran,\u201d Namaki said on state television. The health ministry spokesman, Kianush Jahanpur, announced the 15 new cases earlier on Sunday. \u201cSo far, we have 43 infected cases and the death toll is eight,\u201d he told the television. Eight of the new infections were in Qom, where authorities have shut down schools and religious seminaries. In Tehran and some other cities, schools have been closed until Tuesday. The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Italy had reached 115. The governor of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said that there were 89 cases in his region, most of which had popped up in small towns in the countryside. Almost all of Italy\u2019s cases are clustered in the north, with roughly a dozen towns on lockdown meaning that people are not allowed to enter or leave the towns\u2019 boundaries. After Lombardy, the next hardest-hit region is Veneto, in the north-east, with at least 17 cases. Sports events in the affected northern areas, including local kids sports team practices to three Serie A soccer matches, were cancelled. Bishops in several dioceses in northern Italy issued directives that holy water fonts be kept empty, that communion wafers be placed in the hands of the faithful and not directly into their mouths by priests. Congregants were also told to refrain from shaking hands or exchanging kisses during the symbolic \u201csign of the peace\u201d ritual. Government reports show nine patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus. As of 22 February, a total of 6,152 people have been tested \u2013 the government said \u2013 of which 6,143 were confirmed negative and nine positive. The Department of Health and Social Care will be publishing updated data here every day at 2pm. An evacuee released from a two-week coronavirus quarantine centre has said it is \u201cfantastic\u201d to be allowed to return home. Some 118 people flown out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, were leaving Kents Hill Park training and conference centre in Milton Keynes on Sunday for the first time in 14 days. The group, who were brought back to Britain earlier this month, included about 10 children and a family of four. Paul Walkinshaw, from Manchester, left with his wife, Lihong, having been on holiday visiting her parents in the city of Shiyan for the lunar new year when family members contacted them and told them about the outbreak. Speaking to reporters as he left the centre on Sunday morning, he said: \u201cIt feels fantastic to leave although it feels weird not having to wear a mask and gloves in public. The first 48 hours were hard when we were confined to our rooms, after that it was fine.\u201d The 39-year-old praised \u201cfriendly\u201d staff and the local community for their support and said he was looking forward to sleeping in his own bed again. It comes as dozens of evacuees from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship spent their first night quarantined at Arrowe Park hospital on the Wirral. Thirty-two people, who spent more than two weeks trapped on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan, arrived in Merseyside on Saturday evening. All of those who arrived at Arrowe Park tested negative for Covid-19 before flying back to the UK. Parts of Iran face lockdown in an attempt to control the spread of coronavirus that has now claimed eight lives and led to 43 infections in the country. \u201cIf the situation gets any worse city staff will be expected to convert to teleworkers,\u201d said Pirouz Hanachi, the mayor of Tehran, Iran\u2019s capital. Government authorities have also been fighting an information war amid widespread distrust on social media about whether the public is being told the truth about the scale of the outbreak. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claimed Iran\u2019s enemies were spreading mistrust, and even said the low turnout in Iran\u2019s parliamentary elections on Friday was due to western scare stories. The coronavirus outbreak had claimed its first victim in the Middel East in the religious city of Qom last Wednesday about an hour\u2019s drive from Tehran. The number of people on Tehran\u2019s streets has been noticeably lower, with many shops shut and face masks in short supply and increasingly expensive. In Tehran and 13 other affected provinces, the authorities have introduced increasingly drastic \u201cpreventive measures\u201d including the closure of schools, universities, cinemas and theatres. Public buses in Tehran could also be seen being disinfected, and posters were being put up urging people to clean, and not shake hands. The school system is being shut for a minimum of two days starting on Sunday to allow for disinfection spraying. There was also widespread advice to stay home and avoid places where people congregate. Some football matches were cancelled. Metro stations were not shut, but water fountains and shops were all being closed. The council said it was also taking new steps to dispose of waste. At the airport, roughly a third of passengers were wearing masks, but there were no special controls on people leaving the country. Turkey, Iraq and Pakistan have either closed borders or are imposing extra health checks. Despite the precautions the vast majority were carrying on daily lives as normal. Some of the families of those that have died in Qom claim to know of no contact with anyone in China prompting claims that this might be an indigenous disease. The minister for health denied this, saying one victim traded in China and had travelled there indirectly. The strain discovered in Iran matched that in China, he said. He has recommended no travel to or from Qom, as well as promising to distribute free coronavirus packages to residents in the area, including masks and educational brochures. More than 100 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy, as numbers continued to rise on Sunday following government measures to limit the spread of the outbreak. The governor of Italy\u2019s northern Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said cases of the illness in his area had risen in a day from 54 to 89, with total cases in the country now at more than 100. In an emergency decree approved late on Saturday \u2013 just hours after two people died \u2013 the government adopted special powers to be able to stop people leaving or entering the worst impacted zones. A spokesman for the governor of the northern region Veneto said the number of cases there had risen to 19, seven more than on Saturday. The worst-hit areas in Italy are Lombardy \u2013 home to Italy\u2019s financial capital, Milan \u2013 and Veneto, Italy\u2019s industrial heartland. They jointly account for 30% of gross domestic output. Milan\u2019s mayor, Giuseppe Sala, announced that all schools would be closed from Monday. Universities in both Lombardy and Veneto have also been shuttered until early March. With the confirmed cases of Coronavirus in Italy at 79, focused in the north of the country, Milan\u2019s fashion week is being affected by the outbreak. Giorgio Armani, whose show was scheduled for 4pm on Sunday afternoon, announced on Saturday night that guests should not come to the venue. Instead, the collection would be shown to an empty room. \u201cThe decision was taken to safeguard the wellbeing of all his [Armani\u2019s] invited guests by not having them attend crowded spaces,\u201d read a press release. Instead, models still presented the clothes, with the show streamed on the brand\u2019s website, as well as Instagram and Facebook. Dolce &amp; Gabbana\u2019s show on Saturday afternoon was scheduled to go ahead as usual. But the designers have also addressed the outbreak. They announced last week that they have contributed money to Humanitas University to fund research into the Coronavirus. In a statement, they said \u201cwe felt we had to do something to fight this devastating virus, which started from China but is threatening all mankind. In these cases, it is important to make the right choice. This is why we thought Humanitas University would be the ideal partner, whose excellence and humanity make it a special entity.\u201d Although the Milan fashion shows have felt largely business as usual, the coronavirus outbreak has affected the event. Those travelling to Milan have been screened at airports for the virus, and a lot of Chinese press and buyers usually in attendance have not travelled to the shows. Three Chinese designers on the schedule have cancelled their shows. Britons in Cambodia who left another cruise ship, the Westerdam, and who have been cleared for travel, are also being assisted by the Foreign Office to make their way home. All have tested negative after one case was diagnosed onboard. In an effort to help stop the spread of the virus in the UK, the health service is piloting home testing, where NHS staff, including nurses and paramedics, will visit people in their homes. As dozens of evacuees from a the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship begin their two-week quarantine in the UK, more than 100 others rescued from China are due to be released from isolation. Thirty-two people, who spent more than two weeks on the cruise ship off the coast of Japan, are settling in at an accommodation block at Arrowe Park hospital on the Wirral \u2013 their home for the next 14 days. The group, reportedly made up of 30 Britons and two Irish nationals, will undergo regular health checks while in quarantine. Some made gestures from their coaches as they arrived at the Merseyside facility on Saturday evening \u2013 one forming a heart symbol with her hands and another an OK signal. Meanwhile, a group who have spent the past two weeks holed up in a centre in Milton Keynes are due to be allowed home on Sunday. Around 150 people, who arrived in the UK on February 9 on an evacuation flight from the virus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan, have been staying at the Kents Hill Park training and conference centre. They too will have been regularly tested and as of Saturday afternoon the Department of Health said no new cases of coronavirus had been detected in the UK. Infection toll in China reaches 2,345 as South Korea raises its alert level and Iran confirms sixth death from virus In South Korea the national toll of 556 cases is now the highest outside China, apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Japan has confirmed that a woman who tested negative and left the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship later tested positive, raising more questions about the effectiveness of quarantine measures. A dozen towns in northern Italy in effect went into lockdown on Saturday after deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China, and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad. A repatriation flight carrying 32 Britons and Europeans from the coronavirus-infected cruise ship Diamond Princess landed in the UK on Saturday \u2013 amid growing fears for the welfare of some UK passengers left behind in Japan. The French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said new cases of coronavirus were \u201cvery likely\u201d in France and health authorities were ready in case of an epidemic. Mainland China noted a significant fall in the number of new cases, with 397 reported on Saturday. The total number of cases in mainland China to 76,288 and there have been 2,345 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the window of opportunity to stem the deadly epidemic was \u201cnarrowing\u201d amid concern about a surge in cases with no clear link to China. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has accused foreign media of trying to use the outbreak of coronavirus in Iran to discourage people from voting in a general election. This negative propaganda began a few months ago and grew larger approaching the election and in the past two days, under the pretext of an illness and a virus, their media did not miss the slightest opportunity to discourage people from voting,\u201d said Khamenei on his official website. [Our enemies] are even opposed to any election by the Iranian people\u201d. Iran shut schools, universities and cultural centres across 14 provinces from Sunday following five deaths in the Islamic Republic, the first in the Middle East. Iran\u2019s outbreak surfaced on Wednesday and quickly grew to 28 confirmed infections. \u201cThe concern is ... that we have seen ... a very rapid increase (in Iran) in a matter of a few days,\u201d said Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO\u2019s global infectious hazard preparedness department. Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from Iran, and its flagship carrier Kuwait Airways has suspended flights to the country. Although Egypt is the only African country with a confirmed case, the World Health Organization warned that the continent was vulnerable, urging more African Union cooperation. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said necessary treatment tools such as respiratory support machines were \u201cin short supply in many African countries and that\u2019s a cause for concern\u201d. The Chinese authorities are encouraging citizens to return to work, a month after announcing the unprecedented quarantine of millions of people. Authorities are caught between urgent need to restart economy and efforts to contain virus. Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, have been the focus of disease prevention efforts. But the disease had spread far across the country, and some of the worst-affected places are the manufacturing and economic centres that power China\u2019s economy. Read more here. The French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said new cases of coronavirus were \u201cvery likely\u201d in France and health authorities were ready in case of an epidemic. \u201cToday, there is only one infected patent in France, who is hospitalised in Lyon. His health condition is not worrying. All the others, apart from an 80-year old man who died, were released cured and are not contagious,\u201d V\u00e9ran said in an interview with Le Parisien/Aujourdhui en France-Dimanche newspaper. \u201cOther cases \u2013 it is very likely. An epidemic? We are getting ready for it,\u201d V\u00e9ran added. He said the number of laboratories in France equipped with diagnostic tests would be increased to reach a capacity of \u201cseveral thousands\u201d of tests a day, against 400 now. The number of cases of the new coronavirus in Italy\u2019s Lombardy region has risen to 89, the governor of the region, Attilio Fontana, said on Sunday. That brings the total number of cases in the country to more than 100, Fontana said, speaking on Sky TV. Asked on Friday if the new cases put the crisis at a tipping point, the World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the \u201cwindow of opportunity is narrowing, so we need to act quickly before it closes completely\u201d. My colleagues Sarah Boseley, Hannah Devlin and Martin Belam have answered questions on the virus. Here are a selection of them, including whether we should panic: What is Covid-19 - the illness that started in Wuhan? It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild. Is the outbreak a pandemic? A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \u201cthe worldwide spread of a disease\u201d. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO\u2019s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China. Should we panic? No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children. In South Korea\u2019s fourth-biggest city, Daegu, 90 new cases were confirmed on Sunday, bringing the city\u2019s total to 247. More than half of the people confirmed to have been infected are either members of \u2013 or connected to \u2013 the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive religious sect with a strong presence in Daegu. The mayor asked all Shincheonji members with symptoms to come forward and be tested, with hundreds yet to be reached by authorities. Moon described the situation in Daegu and Cheongdo \u2013 the birthplace of Shincheonji\u2019s founder Lee Man-hee \u2013 as a \u201cnational crisis\u201d, adding the cities would receive \u201cfull support\u201d for any lacking medical supplies and personnel. Shincheonji, accused of being a cult by mainstream Christian groups, claims its founder has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on judgment day. But with more church members than available places in heaven, they are said to have to compete for slots and pursue converts. In a video statement read out by its spokesman, Shincheonji apologised for \u201ccausing concern\u201d, but insisted it was cooperating with health authorities for the \u201cearly cessation\u201d of the situation. The spokesman refuted public criticism blaming his church over the spike in the number of infections, noting the virus had broken out in China. \u201cPlease be aware that the Shincheonji Church of Jesus and its members are the biggest victims of the COVID-19,\u201d he said. A repatriation flight carrying 32 Britons and Europeans from the coronavirus-infected cruise ship Diamond Princess landed in the UK on Saturday \u2013 amid growing fears for the welfare of some UK passengers left behind in Japan. President Moon Jae-in said South Korea was raising its alert level on the new coronavirus to the \u201chighest\u201d in the face of a sudden spike in the number of infections. \u201cThe Covid-19 incident faces a grave turning point. The next few days will be crucial,\u201d Moon said following a government meeting. \u201cThe government will raise the alert level to the highest level according to experts\u2019 recommendations,\u201d he added. South Korea has seen a rapid surge in the number of coronavirus cases in recent days after a cluster of infections emerged from a religious sect in the southern city of Daegu last week. The national toll of 556 cases is now the highest outside China, apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. A dozen towns in northern Italy in effect went into lockdown on Saturday after the deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China. In some Lombardy and Veneto towns, schools, businesses and restaurants have closed. The mayor of Milan, Italy\u2019s business capital and the regional capital of Lombardy, shuttered public offices. A 78-year-old man infected with the coronavirus died in Veneto, and a postmortem performed on a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy came back positive, although it wasn\u2019t clear if illness from the virus caused her death. Late on Saturday, civil protection officials said 79 people had contracted the virus, including the two who died, and one who recovered. Of the remaining 76 people infected, 54 were in Lombardy, 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia-Romagna, two \u2013 a Chinese couple from Wuhan \u2013 in Lazio, and one in Piedmont. It comes amid a growing cluster of cases in the country with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad. Lombardy government authorities said the region\u2019s cases were traceable to a 38-year-old Italian who had not travelled to China, but it remained unclear how this man had been infected. Ten towns in Lombardy received orders to suspend nonessential activities and services. Luca Zaia, the Veneto regional president, said on Saturday that the contagion showed that the virus was transmitted like flu, and that trying to pinpoint a single source for the cases or to establish a link to China were no longer effective containment measures. Welcome to this morning\u2019s coronavirus live blog. I will be here to give you updates on the latest news throughout the day. A summary of the news on Sunday: Japan has confirmed that a woman who tested negative and left the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship later tested positive, raising more questions about the effectiveness of quarantine measures. A dozen towns in northern Italy in effect went into lockdown on Saturday after deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China, and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad. South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, on Sunday put the country on the highest possible alert in its fight against the coronavirus. The measure empowers the government to lock down cities and take other sweeping measures to contain the outbreak. Russia has denied allegations that it is spreading disinformation about the new coronavirus outbreak. US officials said Russian-linked accounts were making unfounded claims on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram through thousands of profiles that the US started the outbreak. Almost a third (31%) of UK consumers will consider avoiding foreign travel if the coronavirus outbreak continues, new research indicates. The consultancy firm Retail Economics, which commissioned the poll of more than 2,000 people, calculated that this could result in \u00a317bn of holiday spending being put on hold. As dozens of evacuees from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship begin their two-week quarantine in the UK, more than 100 others rescued from China are due to be released from isolation.",

      "bodyText": "It has become an almost annual event. Heavy rain leads to widespread flooding, and people claim that we didn\u2019t see it coming. Except we did. In 2007 the UK experienced a series of floods and the government commissioned a report from Michael Pitt, which stated: \u201cThe scale of the problem is, as we know, likely to get worse. We are not sure whether last summer\u2019s events were a direct result of climate change, but we do know that events of this kind are expected to become more frequent. The scientific analysis we have commissioned as part of this review (published alongside this report) shows that climate change has the potential to cause even more extreme scenarios than were previously considered possible. The country must adapt to increasing flood risk.\u201d The Labour government acted on the report\u2019s recommendations. Central government spending on flood defences increased by 10% in the financial year 2008-09, with an additional 10% increase in 2009-10. But then austerity happened. In 2011-12 and 2012-13, spending on flood defences was cut sharply. Although the floods of December 2013, when a tidal surge hit towns along the east coast, prompted the government to increase spending, this has never matched the 10% increases we had after the Pitt review; the average increase in flood spending each year since 2010-11 has been a pitiful 1.2%. Indeed, spending in 2018-19 as a share of GDP was substantially lower than it was in the last year of the Labour government. Money wouldn\u2019t have stopped the rain from falling, but it would have kept many of the homes that were flooded over the decade dry. Flood defence projects pay for themselves many times over. Today the costs of UK flooding illustrate the lost decade brought about by austerity. The Johnson government may pretend that austerity is over, but that is merely a play on words. The fiscal contractions of George Osborne\u2019s tenure as chancellor reduced the size of the state that Johnson inherited \u2013 and we will not see that reversed in any significant way by the new government. Anyone who claims that Johnson is \u201cmoving left\u201d on economics because he is not shrinking the state even further is making a basic mistake \u2013 failing to distinguish between the overall size of the state and minor changes to the size of the state. Beyond the folly of austerity, the failure to enact measures that could have prevented flood damage illustrates something else about the attitude of Conservative governments in general, and this one in particular: a lack of interest in evidence. The Pitt review in 2007 collected all the evidence available at the time, and made clear recommendations that spending on flood defences needed to adapt to a reality where periodic, severe flooding would become normal. The warnings in the Pitt review have proved correct, yet that expertise was ignored by Conservative governments \u2013 just as they ignored the opinions of a majority of macroeconomists over austerity, and the opinions of a majority of trade experts on Brexit. There is an obvious pattern here. Tory governments are more interested in policy-based evidence than in evidence-based policies. Why? Part of the answer lies in the failure of the broadcast media, with only a few honourable exceptions, to hold Conservative governments to account. I have not seen any television reports on the recent flooding that have mentioned austerity \u2013 let alone the Pitt review.

This is South Carolina, and South Carolinians are pretty leery about that title \u2018socialist\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so I think that that would be a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in. If you look at how well we did [in the 2018 midterms] and look at the congressional districts, these were not liberal or what you might call progressive districts. These were basically moderate and conservative districts that we did well in.</p> <p>\u201cAnd in those districts, it\u2019s going to be tough to hold on to these jobs if you have to make the case for accepting a self-proclaimed democratic socialist.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 win also prompted alarm among the punditocracy. The MSNBC Host Chris Matthews <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/23/msnbc-chris-matthews-sanders-nevada-win-nazi-invasion\">landed in hot water</a> after comparing the senator\u2019s surge \u2013 he ran strongly in Iowa and won New Hampshire \u2013 to the Nazi invasion of France.</p> <p>The former Bill Clinton strategist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-carville\">James Carville</a> was more measured, <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/politics/james-carville-says-people-who-think-bernie-will-beat-trump-are-as-stupid-as-climate-deniers/\">saying</a> on the same network: \u201cIf you want to vote for Bernie Sanders because you feel good about his programme, because you don\u2019t like the banks on Wall Street, you don\u2019t like pharmaceuticals, that\u2019s completely legitimate, I understand that.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re voting for him because you think he\u2019ll win the election because he\u2019ll galvanize heretofore sleepy parts of the electorate, then politically you\u2019re a fool \u2013 and that\u2019s just a fact.\u201d</p> <p>The demographics of Sanders\u2019 victory, however, suggested that he may have earned a foothold in diverse states which mirror the Democratic base more closely than Iowa and New Hampshire.</p> <p>In Nevada, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/nevada\">according to CNN entrance polls</a>, Sanders took 51% of the Latino vote, way ahead of any rival, and did well with African Americans.</p> <p>Perhaps indicating his confidence that Nevada would not be a close finish, Sanders gave his victory speech in Texas. The Lone Star state votes on 3 March, also known as Super Tuesday \u2013 the day on which the candidacy of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/22/clint-eastwood-bloomberg-president-trump\">billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg</a> will be tested at the polls for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve brought together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition that is not only going to win <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nevada\">Nevada</a>, it\u2019s going to sweep this country,\u201d Sanders said in San Antonio.</p> <p>No clear rival has yet emerged.

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders took a resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday, bolstered significantly by Latino voters and extending his lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Some party insiders raised concerns about whether the progressive senator from Vermont can hope to beat Donald Trump in November. The next state to vote is South Carolina, which holds its primary next Saturday. On Sunday, on ABC\u2019s This Week, the most powerful Democrat in the southern state was asked if Sanders describing himself as a democratic socialist would be off-putting to voters. \u201cA lot of people think so,\u201d congressman Jim Clyburn said. \u201cI do believe it will be an extra burden for us to have to carry. This is South Carolina, and South Carolinians are pretty leery about that title \u2018socialist\u2019. \u201cAnd so I think that that would be a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in. If you look at how well we did [in the 2018 midterms] and look at the congressional districts, these were not liberal or what you might call progressive districts. These were basically moderate and conservative districts that we did well in. \u201cAnd in those districts, it\u2019s going to be tough to hold on to these jobs if you have to make the case for accepting a self-proclaimed democratic socialist.\u201d Sanders\u2019 win also prompted alarm among the punditocracy. The MSNBC Host Chris Matthews landed in hot water after comparing the senator\u2019s surge \u2013 he ran strongly in Iowa and won New Hampshire \u2013 to the Nazi invasion of France. The former Bill Clinton strategist James Carville was more measured, saying on the same network: \u201cIf you want to vote for Bernie Sanders because you feel good about his programme, because you don\u2019t like the banks on Wall Street, you don\u2019t like pharmaceuticals, that\u2019s completely legitimate, I understand that. \u201cIf you\u2019re voting for him because you think he\u2019ll win the election because he\u2019ll galvanize heretofore sleepy parts of the electorate, then politically you\u2019re a fool \u2013 and that\u2019s just a fact.\u201d The demographics of Sanders\u2019 victory, however, suggested that he may have earned a foothold in diverse states which mirror the Democratic base more closely than Iowa and New Hampshire. In Nevada, according to CNN entrance polls, Sanders took 51% of the Latino vote, way ahead of any rival, and did well with African Americans. Perhaps indicating his confidence that Nevada would not be a close finish, Sanders gave his victory speech in Texas. The Lone Star state votes on 3 March, also known as Super Tuesday \u2013 the day on which the candidacy of the billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg will be tested at the polls for the first time. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition that is not only going to win Nevada, it\u2019s going to sweep this country,\u201d Sanders said in San Antonio. No clear rival has yet emerged. In Nevada, former vice-president Joe Biden finished second, followed by former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. Buttigieg was Sanders\u2019 main rival in Iowa and New Hampshire. Biden is targeting a win in South Carolina, where he is popular with African American voters. Speaking to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Biden disputed that South Carolina was \u201cmy firewall\u201d and said: \u201cI\u2019m running for the same exact reason when I started: to restore some dignity to the office, to make sure African Americans and minorities get treated well, and \u2026 to unify the country and the party.\u201d He also said drops in his support among African Americans in South Carolina were down to greater spending by other candidates, including the billionaire Tom Steyer. Despite a bruising week of news reports and a poor debate performance, Bloomberg is aiming to emerge as a hugely well-financed standard-bearer for moderates who fear a Sanders nomination. Kevin Sheekey, his campaign manager, said in a statement: \u201cThe Nevada results reinforce the reality that this fragmented field is putting Bernie Sanders on pace to amass an insurmountable delegate lead.\u201d Sanders supporters maintain that he can play well in racially diverse areas. Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats, a leftwing group born out of the senator\u2019s 2016 campaign, said that in Nevada, \u201cin a diverse electorate that looks the most like Super Tuesday states, Democrats chose Bernie Sanders as their candidate to defeat Donald Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the Democratic voters with the most energy behind them look and think a lot more like [New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] than Joe Biden.\u201d Polls show Sanders leading in California and Texas, huge Super Tuesday prizes with large Latino populations. Not all mainstream Democrats professed themselves worried about Sanders. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday the Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said his Vermont counterpart was as viable as the moderates against him. \u201cI think Bernie Sanders will beat Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump. I think Elizabeth Warren would beat Donald Trump.\u201d In general, polling backs that up although notional head-to-heads are tight and Trump\u2019s approval rating is climbing. A CBS News poll released on Sunday said 65% of voters expect the president to win re-election. Murphy continued: \u201cWhat we need is a candidate who has a base of enthusiastic supporters \u2026 who\u2019s authentic, who speaks truth to power, who can throw a punch and who can take a punch. \u201cI think anybody who\u2019s polling in the top four or five fits that bill, but Bernie\u2019s base of support, the enthusiasm behind him, I think speaks to the strength of his candidacy \u2013 both in the primary and as a general election candidate as well.\u201d Saying he was \u201cnot endorsing anyone\u201d, Murphy added: \u201cBernie\u2019s done very well in the opening primaries, but this thing is not a done deal.\u201d",

Some other countries have poured substantial sums into the contest, viewing winning as a point of national pride.</p> <p>While almost every other participating country has to take part in a semi-final before qualifying for the final, the UK has a historic automatic pass to the final due to the amount of money the BBC puts into Eurovision. However, there have long been complaints that individual countries\u2019 votes often reflect political allegiances rather than musical qualities, and the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union at the end of January is unlikely to have endeared the nation to many continental viewers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC has decided against allowing viewers to choose the UK\u2019s entry to this year\u2019s Eurovision song contest, following the poor performance of the British public\u2019s recent choices. Instead, Eurovision presenter Graham Norton will unveil Britain\u2019s representative on Thursday, with the singer and song having been selected by record label BMG without public consultation. The unveiling of the entry will take place on Greg James\u2019 Radio 1 Breakfast Show and Ken Bruce\u2019s Radio 2 morning programme on Thursday morning. Norton confirmed the details while announcing details of the BBC\u2019s coverage in the contest, which will be held in Rotterdam in May. He optimistically asked: \u201cWill we finally hear those elusive words, \u2018United Kingdom, douze points?\u2019\u201d Britain\u2019s last four Eurovision entries were chosen by the public, and three of them finished in either last or second last place. The most recent contestant, 19-year-old Michael Rice, won just 11 points in last year\u2019s Tel Aviv contest, finishing 26th. In a bid to avoid another embarrassing national defeat, the process has been handed to one of the world\u2019s biggest record labels \u2013 who have publish hits by the likes of Lewis Capaldi, George Ezra and Jess Glynne \u2013 in the hope that they can find a way to make Europeans vote for the UK. BMG was asked to find a \u201csong with broad international appeal\u201d and secure a singer \u201cwho embodies the spirit and values of the Eurovision Song Contest\u201d, although it is unclear whether they have chosen a new or an established act. However, there is no guarantee that taking back control from the public and giving the choice to experts will lead to British success on the continent. The last time the BBC unilaterally chose artists for Eurovision through an internal selection process, the results varied wildly, with only Blue\u2019s relatively successful 2011 entry bucking a long-trend of underperformance. Some countries have a highly competitive national singing competition to choose their Eurovision entry, with the likes of Sweden saying the process has contributed to their success in the competition. Many recent Eurovision winners have also benefited from already being stars across Europe before the contest begins, meaning audiences are already aware of them when voting begins on the night. Some other countries have poured substantial sums into the contest, viewing winning as a point of national pride. While almost every other participating country has to take part in a semi-final before qualifying for the final, the UK has a historic automatic pass to the final due to the amount of money the BBC puts into Eurovision. However, there have long been complaints that individual countries\u2019 votes often reflect political allegiances rather than musical qualities, and the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union at the end of January is unlikely to have endeared the nation to many continental viewers.",

      "body": "<p>Prada has always been a brand that dictates the rest of fashion. That tradition was stepped up in Milan on Sunday with a groundbreaking announcement at the brand\u2019s headquarters. Designer Raf Simons is to work alongside Miuccia Prada. The two will be co-creative directors.</p> <p>They are two of the most influential designers in fashion, which makes this an unprecedented alpha alliance \u2013 the fashion equivalent of Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp teaming up to manage Barcelona, or Bruce Springsteen and Madonna forming a supergroup. As CEO Patrizio Bertelli said through an interpreter in his introduction to the duo: \u201cHere, again, the Prada Group have proven to be at the forefront of change.\u201d</p> <p>Simons and Prada looked relaxed in each other\u2019s company as they explained how the partnership \u2013 officially coming into effect on 2 April \u2013 will work. \u201cWhen we both believe in it [an idea], we\u2019re going to do it,\u201d Simons said. \u201cWhen one doesn\u2019t believe in it, we won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe like each other, we respect each other, we will see where that takes us,\u201d said Prada. Simons will live between Antwerp, where his eponymous label is based, and Milan, to work on Prada. The first official Prada-Simons collection will be shown in September.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2020/feb/22/milan-fashion-week-autumnwinter-2020-the-key-shows-in-pictures\">Milan fashion week autumn/winter 2020: the key shows \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prada is now 70 and in her 42nd year designing for the company founded by her grandfather in 1913. She was clear, however, this was not a first move towards her retirement, with Simons in position to eventually take over. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cI like working and this way I will work a bit more \u2026 I anticipate more discussion, more ideas.\u201d</p> <p>Simons spoke at length about how their alliance was partly prompted by what he sees as the sidelining of creativity in fashion. \u201cA business can do super, super good [now] without having creatives or, to add to that, without strong creatives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the main reason we are doing this, but we do believe collaborating between creatives can reposition, also, that aspect of the whole business.\u201d</p> <p>Simons and Prada have known each other since around 2005, when Simons was appointed the creative director of Jil Sander, then owned by the Prada Group. They have remained friends since, and hinted that similar alliances have come close in the past. During a conversation between the two designers <a href=\"http://system-magazine.com/issue8/miuccia-prada-raf-simons/\">published by System magazine</a> in 2016, Prada said: \u201cOne thing I would really love to do is to work with Raf, and maybe with other people \u2013 it would be so much fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e643445838ec7d3857bdcf75d2d9c010ad30ed63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e643445838ec7d3857bdcf75d2d9c010ad30ed63/0_0_3937_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Prada autumn/winter 2020 womenswear show in Milan last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Prada autumn/winter 2020 womenswear show in Milan last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Moncada/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The duo share an ability to draw on culture, politics and art to make fashion that is thoughtful without being too serious. Designing pretty clothes for the sake of pretty clothes is not something either of these designers are interested in. If Prada\u2019s Instagram bio reads \u201cthinking fashion since 1913\u201d, Simons has said \u201cI don\u2019t want to show clothes, I want to show my attitude, my past, present and future.\u201d</p> <p>Although they broadly agree on a point of view, they come from different places \u2013 a factor that makes a co-designed collection an intriguing idea. Belgian-born Simons, 52, began his career as a furniture designer and is regularly inspired by club and street culture, with menswear a strong suit.

      "bodyText": "Prada has always been a brand that dictates the rest of fashion. That tradition was stepped up in Milan on Sunday with a groundbreaking announcement at the brand\u2019s headquarters. Designer Raf Simons is to work alongside Miuccia Prada. The two will be co-creative directors. They are two of the most influential designers in fashion, which makes this an unprecedented alpha alliance \u2013 the fashion equivalent of Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp teaming up to manage Barcelona, or Bruce Springsteen and Madonna forming a supergroup. As CEO Patrizio Bertelli said through an interpreter in his introduction to the duo: \u201cHere, again, the Prada Group have proven to be at the forefront of change.\u201d Simons and Prada looked relaxed in each other\u2019s company as they explained how the partnership \u2013 officially coming into effect on 2 April \u2013 will work. \u201cWhen we both believe in it [an idea], we\u2019re going to do it,\u201d Simons said. \u201cWhen one doesn\u2019t believe in it, we won\u2019t do it.\u201d \u201cWe like each other, we respect each other, we will see where that takes us,\u201d said Prada. Simons will live between Antwerp, where his eponymous label is based, and Milan, to work on Prada. The first official Prada-Simons collection will be shown in September. Prada is now 70 and in her 42nd year designing for the company founded by her grandfather in 1913. She was clear, however, this was not a first move towards her retirement, with Simons in position to eventually take over. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cI like working and this way I will work a bit more \u2026 I anticipate more discussion, more ideas.\u201d Simons spoke at length about how their alliance was partly prompted by what he sees as the sidelining of creativity in fashion. \u201cA business can do super, super good [now] without having creatives or, to add to that, without strong creatives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the main reason we are doing this, but we do believe collaborating between creatives can reposition, also, that aspect of the whole business.\u201d Simons and Prada have known each other since around 2005, when Simons was appointed the creative director of Jil Sander, then owned by the Prada Group. They have remained friends since, and hinted that similar alliances have come close in the past. During a conversation between the two designers published by System magazine in 2016, Prada said: \u201cOne thing I would really love to do is to work with Raf, and maybe with other people \u2013 it would be so much fun.\u201d The duo share an ability to draw on culture, politics and art to make fashion that is thoughtful without being too serious. Designing pretty clothes for the sake of pretty clothes is not something either of these designers are interested in. If Prada\u2019s Instagram bio reads \u201cthinking fashion since 1913\u201d, Simons has said \u201cI don\u2019t want to show clothes, I want to show my attitude, my past, present and future.\u201d Although they broadly agree on a point of view, they come from different places \u2013 a factor that makes a co-designed collection an intriguing idea. Belgian-born Simons, 52, began his career as a furniture designer and is regularly inspired by club and street culture, with menswear a strong suit. Since founding his own label in 1995, he has shown himself to be versatile, having worked as creative director at Jil Sander, Christian Dior and Calvin Klein. Prada, meanwhile, was born in Milan, studied for a PhD in political science in the 70s, and was active in the Italian communist party and women\u2019s rights groups. She has since made her feminism \u2013 and the lives of women \u2013 a key theme in the way she designs. Simons joins the firm at an interesting time. Recently, there have been a few more struggles, both financially and politically. Prada was embroiled in a race row in 2018, thanks to figurines that resembled blackface in their New York store. It was announced earlier this month it had reach a settlement with NYC Commission on Human Rights, agreeing to give all staff in the city diversity training, and the appointment of a diversity and inclusion officer to vet all designs. This announcement is perhaps the mark of a new era, an alliance for perpetuity. \u201cThe contract is forever,\u201d said Prada.",

The inquiry into the 2017 disaster that killed 72 people was due to restart on Monday after a three-week postponement but will not restart until at least the beginning of March. The second phase of the inquiry investigating how the council block was refurbished began on 27 January but was halted after little more than a week. Corporate witnesses including cladding contractor Harley Facades and building operator, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, requested an assurance that prosecutors will not use their oral evidence against them to bring criminal charges against individuals or their firms. An additional delay was triggered last week when the attorney general, Suella Braverman, who must decide whether to give the undertaking, raised fears that the way the demands are phrased could \u201ccreate real practical challenges for the investigation and potential prosecution of any criminal offence arising\u201d. The latest delay makes it increasingly likely the inquiry will not publish conclusions until late 2021 or even 2022. The original request was branded \u201csabotage\u201d by some of the bereaved and survivors. However, such requests have been granted in several public inquiries.

      "bodyText": "Jenny Matthews and Natasha Ambrose are embarking on an unusual world tour: encouraging schoolgirls to consider careers as superyacht captains. Matthews and Ambrose, who are both first officers on superyachts, a role that includes helming the vessels, said they decided to launch a scheme dedicated to encouraging women into the top ranks after discovering that more than 95% of yacht captains and first officers were men. Matthews, 30, said she decided to start the She of the Sea campaign because \u201cafter securing my officer of the watch ticket in 2018, I realised that in the eight years working on deck, I\u2019d never worked with another woman in the deck department [the senior staff who navigate the ship alongside the captain]\u201d. \u201cI wanted to know if there were any other women officers out there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took a long time to find any official statistics, but research by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency shows that just 60 women have qualified as senior yacht seafarers since 2006, out of a total of 1,210 people. Our mission is to rewrite the narrative of women in maritime by raising visibility and awareness.\u201d Matthews, who is from New Zealand and joined the superyacht industry as a stewardess when she was 18, said: \u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest with you \u2013 it\u2019s tough to get a job, full stop.

McCue has built up a following of more than 100,000 people on instagram detailing her life as captain of Celebrity Edge, a $1bn 130,000-tonne cruise ship with capacity for 2,900 passengers. The International Society of Women Airline Pilots campaign has highlighted that there are just 9,746 female airline pilots out of a global total of 185,143. Women make up just 1.42% of air captains, the highest rank. Ambrose, 32, from Chichester, West Sussex, said a core part of the She of the Sea campaign was to let schoolchildren know that working as an officer or engineer on a superyacht sailing the world was a viable career no matter their gender \u2013 if they worked hard at maths and science. \u201cThe only way to really change things is to get people enthused when they are young,\u201d Ambrose said. \u201cOur phrase is, \u2018If she can see it, she can be it,\u2019 and we\u2019re planning our own roadshow to schools in the UK and across the world to encourage girls to study science, maths and engineering so that they can take career paths like this.\u201d Matthews said superyachts \u201care all about maths\u201d. \u201cI never thought that I would be using Pythagoras \u2013 I really, really glazed over it in high school \u2013 but that\u2019s pretty much navigation. Superyachting is literally all Stem [science, technology, engineering and maths], from designing them to building them to working out where they can go and driving them.\u201d The She of the Sea campaign also aims to connect and support women already working in the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s about letting people know that they\u2019re not alone, and we are here for each other,\u201d Matthews said. Recent research by the International Seafarers\u2019 Welfare and Assistance Network shows that 65% of superyacht workers had witnessed or been aware of an incident of sexual harassment at work. More than half (53%) of women superyacht workers said they had experienced discrimination, harassment or bullying from the owner, crew or guests, compared with 30% of men in a survey of 441 superyacht crew.",

The public outcry echoes the outrage seen leading up to the Leveson inquiry in 2011. That independent, judge-led inquiry heard from hundreds of people who had experienced press intrusion and suffered illegal behaviour at the hands of news publishers, including phone hacking. It recommended the creation of a genuinely independent system of self-regulation to cover the print and online press. However, that system doesn\u2019t exist today. The majority of the press either belong to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) \u2013 a complaints body that is not truly independent \u2013 or belong to no regulator at all. Some news publishers belong to Impress, which has been assessed by us as providing effective, independent regulation and public protections. Only the rich can readily afford to seek redress against news publishers. Legislation required to provide affordable access to justice \u2013 section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 \u2013 is on the statute books, but the government has not commenced it. Section 40 would enable ordinary people to have their case heard if they believe they\u2019ve been harmed by the press. It would also protect publishers from high-cost legal challenges and so help secure freedom of speech for reporters and publications. The concerns that led to the hacking inquiry haven\u2019t gone away, yet the government continues to delay implementation of the system agreed by parliament. It isn\u2019t about censoring the press. It\u2019s about making all news publishers accountable within a system of independent self-regulation. Freedom of the press must also be balanced by the need to protect people and provide access to justice when they are wronged, as happens in other areas of business and society, such as utilities, broadcasting and telecoms, and as the government proposes for social media. David Wolfe QC Chair of the Press Recognition Panel \u2022 Joan Smith is right to condemn the tabloid press for declaring \u201copen season\u201d on Caroline Flack, but she lets the Crown Prosecution Service off the hook far too easily (Caroline Flack is misogyny\u2019s latest victim, Journal, 18 February).

They are also supposed to consider \u201cthe views expressed by the victim\u201d, whether prosecution is proportionate to the likely outcome, and whether an out-of-court disposal was possible. Caroline Flack had no previous convictions. It is difficult to see how the public interest test could be met such as to justify a show trial of a vulnerable young woman where the purported victim wanted no part of the prosecution and a repeat of the alleged offence was unlikely.

With England cranking up the pressure on almost every front, his team were looking similarly unsteady and a Farrell penalty awarded for offside in the shadow of the Irish posts widened the gap further. With the wind slightly more in their favour after the interval Ireland could only cling to the memory of England\u2019s second-half collapse from 31-7 up against Scotland last March. Sexton has also been involved in some fine comebacks as a Leinster player, not least against Northampton in the 2011 Heineken Cup final when the Irish province recovered to win from 22-6 down. There was a brief flicker when Robbie Henshaw drove between Tom Curry and Farrell to put Ireland on the scoreboard after 50 minutes but Sexton again scuffed the conversion attempt and the arrival of Luke Cowan-Dickie gave England fresh energy. The Exeter hooker, increasingly prolific at all levels, drove over for his side\u2019s third try after 62 minutes but instead of a try bonus point there was only a late Irish consolation for the replacement Andrew Porter. While it slightly massaged the final score, the gap between the sides on the day was considerable.",

      "bodyText": "Objects made from human remains, often labelled in the west as examples of witchcraft or necromancy, are to go on display for the first time at the British Museum with the hope they will finally be seen in their true light. The museum is to display Tibetan objects, which include a drum made from the tops of two skulls; a trumpet made from a hollowed out thighbone; a ritual cup made from a skull and an apron of intricately carved human bone. To British colonial officials and missionaries in the 19th and early 20th centuries, such items were morbid examples of devil worship. To Tibetans they were objects used to celebrate life. Imma Ramos, the curator of the museum\u2019s forthcoming exhibition on Tantra, hopes that by displaying such sensitive objects it will demystify them. The objects shine light on how, in Tantric Buddhist practice, life is conceived as a preparation for death. \u201cThere is nothing nihilistic about that,\u201d said Ramos. \u201cIt is very much celebrating life. It is a much more positive, holistic attitude to death which is very different to the west where there is a very negative mindset around mortality.\u201d The museum has held a number of consultations and workshops with Tibetans to prepare for the display and the exhibition will include audio interviews. Thupten Kelsang, an Oxford student who has helped gather people for the workshops and consultations, welcomed the display. \u201cThese are esoteric objects, very specialised objects and can sometimes be taken out of context. \u201cI\u2019m happy that with this exhibition Tibetans are finally coming forward and talking and sharing their opinions and life histories and experiences.\u201d The five objects from the museum\u2019s collection, all going on public display for the first time include a two-headed drum (damaru) and a thigh trumpet (kangling) used in the practice of Ch\u00f6d (cutting off), which was developed and popularised by an 11th-century female tantric practitioner Machig Labdr\u00f6n. The instruments are used to invoke divine spirits to feast on your own body, which is a way of surrendering your ego. A 19th-century skull cup (kapala) is going on display with its ornate metal base and cover. It would have been an important ritual object probably used in a communal Tantric practice performed by a group of lamas over several days. Tibetan Tantric practitioners often willingly donated their skulls and bones to a lama and monasteries in order to gain spiritual merit after their death. The bone apron (rus gyan) is an example of one worn by Tibetan monks and lamas during public festival and could have been used in dances with the purpose of generating merit to people watching and expel negative obstacles. It was acquired by John Claude White, a civil servant in colonial India who was part of the British military invasion of Tibet in 1903-04. He is likely to have seen the ritual as \u201cdevil-dancing\u201d, language which is still often used by museums today, said Ayesha Fuentes, who is studying towards a PhD at Soas on the use of human remains in Tibetan Buddhist practice. She hopes the Tantric exhibition will help change the way museums describe Tibetan human remains. \u201cThat language of devil worship and necromancy and sorcery \u2026it originated from colonial scholarship and was disseminated all through the anglophone world. In the States, where I\u2019m from, museum records everywhere will still bring up that language,\u201d she said. The subject of human remains in museum collections is often a charged one and continues to result in numerous repatriation cases. Arts Council England recently advertised for an expert to update its guidance on repatriation and restitution. Museums have also been accused of being overly sensitive about displaying human remains, fearing a backlash that may not exist. The British Museum has more than 6,000 examples of human remain, including Egyptian mummies and Lindow Man, who dates from the mid-first century and is considered the best preserved ancient body ever discovered in Britain. The Tibetan human remains will be part of an exhibition exploring and exploding myths about Tantra, usually equated in the west with sex and yoga. It is the UK\u2019s first major exhibition about beliefs and rituals that began in sixth-century India. A major part of the show will be the importance of divine feminine power and challenging the perception of womanhood as passive and docile. \u2022 Tantra: Enlightenment to Revolution will be at the British Museum, London, 23 April-26 July.",

It was 1989 and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government had characterised those on state benefits as \u201cspongers\u201d.</p> <p>ITV\u2019s current affairs programme World in Action decided to make a programme with that name showing how the wealthy profited substantially more from state handouts and benefits than the poor. It was to be in the risky format of a take-off of a television game show, in which a wealthy family was pitted against a family barely making do. I was the producer and, without hesitation, Nicholas agreed to take part. Largely due to his input, the show was a success and much discussed. Later that year we decided to repeat the exercise, this time with a programme called Beat the Taxman, showing how the wealthy may escape their fair burden of taxation. Nicholas again immediately agreed to front the show.</p> <p>He was not only a great professional, but a man of great warmth whose social conscience allowed him to step outside his safety zone when he felt it important to do so. <br><strong>Don Jordan</strong></p> <p>World in Action\u2019s Spongers was a mock panel show with Nicholas Parsons as the quiz-master, and an assistant, Pandora, who opened magic boxes to reveal how much or how little two couples and their children, the working-class Ackroyds and the middle-class Osbornes, gained in benefits from the welfare state across their lifetimes. The producer, Don Jordan, conceived of the idea as an ingenious way of getting across the otherwise dry statistical evidence that I and others had produced as to who gained most from the welfare state: not the working classes, as most people assumed then (and probably do now), but the middle classes. Nicholas kept bringing me in as \u201cthe Professor\u201d to tell us who was getting what, and to explain why. By the end of their longer lives, the Osbornes were shown to have gained much more than the Ackroyds.</p> <p>Nicholas got very engaged with putting on the show and, displaying an unsuspected (at least by me) understanding of social science, came up with suggestions that sharpened it in a number of ways. The programme got favourable reviews, including one by Nancy Banks-Smith in the Guardian, and has been used by several universities for teaching students of social policy, generating a great deal of amusement and much challenging discussion. A colleague recently told me that, meeting past students now, they often recall Nicholas and the programme, if nothing else. <br><strong>Julian Le Grand</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cOf course I\u2019ll do it.\u201d With those words Nicholas Parsons agreed to host a television programme uncomfortably outside his usual genres. It was 1989 and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government had characterised those on state benefits as \u201cspongers\u201d. ITV\u2019s current affairs programme World in Action decided to make a programme with that name showing how the wealthy profited substantially more from state handouts and benefits than the poor. It was to be in the risky format of a take-off of a television game show, in which a wealthy family was pitted against a family barely making do. I was the producer and, without hesitation, Nicholas agreed to take part. Largely due to his input, the show was a success and much discussed. Later that year we decided to repeat the exercise, this time with a programme called Beat the Taxman, showing how the wealthy may escape their fair burden of taxation. Nicholas again immediately agreed to front the show. He was not only a great professional, but a man of great warmth whose social conscience allowed him to step outside his safety zone when he felt it important to do so. Don Jordan World in Action\u2019s Spongers was a mock panel show with Nicholas Parsons as the quiz-master, and an assistant, Pandora, who opened magic boxes to reveal how much or how little two couples and their children, the working-class Ackroyds and the middle-class Osbornes, gained in benefits from the welfare state across their lifetimes. The producer, Don Jordan, conceived of the idea as an ingenious way of getting across the otherwise dry statistical evidence that I and others had produced as to who gained most from the welfare state: not the working classes, as most people assumed then (and probably do now), but the middle classes. Nicholas kept bringing me in as \u201cthe Professor\u201d to tell us who was getting what, and to explain why. By the end of their longer lives, the Osbornes were shown to have gained much more than the Ackroyds. Nicholas got very engaged with putting on the show and, displaying an unsuspected (at least by me) understanding of social science, came up with suggestions that sharpened it in a number of ways. The programme got favourable reviews, including one by Nancy Banks-Smith in the Guardian, and has been used by several universities for teaching students of social policy, generating a great deal of amusement and much challenging discussion. A colleague recently told me that, meeting past students now, they often recall Nicholas and the programme, if nothing else. Julian Le Grand",

Eustice said that in the US farmers now used lactic acid washes instead of chlorine washes \u2013 a point unlikely to reassure campaigners who object to chlorination not because of the chlorine, but because the process allows farmers to compensate for chicken being kept in unsanitary conditions while alive. In the interview Eustice said the government was committed to high standards for food safety and for animal welfare. But he refused to give an absolute assurance that the current rules would remain. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a clear position in this country that it is illegal to sell chlorine-washed chicken, illegal to sell beef treated with hormones. We\u2019ve no plans to change those things,\u201d he said. In a separate interview, Eustice said in the UK lactic acid washes were used for beef but not for poultry, and that there was \u201croom for a sensible discussion\u201d with the US on this matter. In response, Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said if the government was really committed to maintaining high animal welfare standards, it should accept a Labour amendment to the agriculture bill banning food imports produced to lower welfare and environment standards. Pollard said: \u201cChlorinated chicken being sold in Britain is a genuine risk, unless this backdoor to lower standard US goods imports is closed and a ban is put into law.\u201d In response to the controversy generated by Eustice\u2019s comments, his department issued a statement saying: \u201cThe government will stand firm in trade negotiations to ensure our future trade deals live up to the values of farmers and consumers across the UK.\u201d Eustice also acknowledged that farmers needed an opt-out from the tight post-Brexit immigration rules recently announced by the Home Office and to hint that the seasonal agricultural workers scheme would be expanded. Under the plans announced by the home secretary, Priti Patel, from January 2021 it should no longer generally be possible for workers to come to the UK to take up low-paid, low-skilled jobs. The Home Office said that this year 10,000 people would be allowed entry to the UK to take up seasonal agricultural work, but the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) said that 70,000 seasonal workers were needed to pick fruit and vegetables on British farms. Eustice said the seasonal agricultural workers scheme was still a pilot and that the 10,000 workers being admitted under it this year was a fourfold increase on the 2,500 allowed when it was launched in 2019. When it was put to him that the NFU said 70,000 seasonal workers were needed, he claimed that there would not be a problem this year because EU free movement rules still applied during the post-Brexit transition. But in future the 10,000 limit could be increased again, he suggested. \u201cThe important thing will be in the future, and obviously the pilot will end this year, and we will be in a position to roll out a fully fledged seasonal agricultural workers scheme that can be designed to provide the needs of the agricultural and horticultural sector,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Last year, a few months after my marriage ended, I froze my eggs. I was 34 with endometriosis and three separate doctors had told me that with an egg reserve as low as mine I\u2019d be unlikely to conceive beyond my mid-30s. Considering I hadn\u2019t been able to get pregnant at 31 after trying for over a year with my ex-husband, I believed them. It was now or never. I\u2019ve never felt particularly sad about my infertility. I once described it \u2013 quietly, drunkenly, to my loving parents \u2013 as a get-out-of-jail-free card. I like children, but I don\u2019t believe they are necessary to a meaningful life. Personally, I derive meaning from writing fiction. But there was a loud question in my mind: what if I want children later? What if I fall in love at 38 and am flooded with maternal longing? I returned to the specialist who\u2019d performed the laparoscopy to remove my endo and told her I wanted to freeze my eggs. She was supportive, saying I was the perfect age, not so young it would be a waste of money, not so old that my egg quality had dropped off too much. She emphasised, however, that freezing 15 eggs \u2013 the minimum recommended \u2013 only gave me a 50% chance of producing one baby. \u201cMy hope is you\u2019ll meet someone and have a child naturally in the next few years and not need them,\u201d she said. Luckily Medicare would cover two-thirds of the cost because I had a medical reason for freezing my eggs. Otherwise I\u2019d be looking at over $10,000 per round \u2013 not an option. So in the middle of a divorce, a house move and preparing for my debut novel to come out, I went through IVF, or the first half of IVF: hormone injections, scans and egg retrieval. In the age of the Anthropocene, when our planet is heating at a terrifying rate and we are seven billion and climbing, when plastic is choking the ocean and only 4% of the animals on the planet are wild, how selfish, how overprivileged, how obscene is it to go to all this effort to have my own biological child? When I was married and trying for a baby, I kept having moments of panic. I\u2019d walk around the house, breathing hard, arguing out loud with a doctor who wasn\u2019t there, demanding a C-section. I didn\u2019t realise I was terrified of childbirth until I tried to get pregnant. There\u2019s a word for that phobia, but it doesn\u2019t fully cover what I was feeling. I was more afraid that I would have a child and not be able to keep it safe. I was picturing scenes from the apocalyptic film Threads. After a while I started to welcome my period pain, because it meant I wouldn\u2019t have to be a mother. IVF is so common now, it\u2019s easy to forget how awful it is. I got over my fear of needles because there was no one else to administer the injections. For 11 days I injected myself with anywhere from one to three drugs per night. One night I forgot the nurse\u2019s lesson on how to stab the blunt Orgalutran needle \u2013 used to prevent the early release of eggs \u2013 in at the correct angle and velocity, so that it goes in quickly. You\u2019re supposed to use a little force, but I pushed it gently and it didn\u2019t break the skin. Instead of stopping to try again, my mind went blank and I pushed harder. After several horrifying seconds the needle broke the skin and entered my flesh with slow resistance. I cannot express how weird it is to hear a squeak, similar to when you over-shampoo your hair, and feel the vibration of a blunt needle slowly pushing through your subcutaneous fatty tissue.

      "bodyText": "A Queensland man has admitted to splashing petrol on his former partner and threatening to burn their house down, in a court case successfully prosecuted by the victim because the state\u2019s police refused to bring domestic violence charges. In 2017 police told the victim, Dani*, that there was a prima facie case against her former partner for threatening violence, but because there was \u201ca low level of public interest\u201d they would not bring a charge. Dani then took the rare step of hiring a barrister and prosecuting the criminal case herself. Her barrister, Clem van der Weegen, said the private prosecution and guilty plea should \u201cdeeply embarrass\u201d the Queensland police. At a hearing last year, a Queensland magistrate\u2019s court was told that officers had refused to cooperate with the case and had declined to make written witness statements. They eventually supplied statements after Dani\u2019s legal team complained directly to the police commissioner, Katarina Carroll. Dani said she was warned the process would be costly and time-consuming but that she \u201ccould not allow [his] actions to define the rest of my life\u201d. \u201cIt has been over four years since I believed I was going to die at the hands of my partner,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day I am faced with the challenge of living with post-traumatic stress disorder, the loss of who I was, how I was able to function in life and what I was able to achieve. [His] threat to set me alight has had a profound and irreversible effect on my life and the lives of my children. \u201cNo woman, no victim should ever have to go to these lengths to seek justice. \u201cBut I had heard so many harrowing accounts from DV survivors and so many instances of the Queensland police failing to take DV victims seriously, failing to bring criminal charges to make perpetrators accountable, and failing to keep women and children safe that I felt I really had no choice but to carry on.\u201d On 31 January the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to threatening violence. In doing so, the man admitted to details including that he splashed petrol on Dani and threatened to burn down the house. She was inside the house at the time. The man was sentenced to 130 hours community service and had no conviction recorded. Dani says her story highlights how women can be failed in domestic violence cases where the victim and offender give radically different versions of events The man had previously pleaded guilty to a property offence \u2013 wilful damage \u2013 that occurred on the same night, but was not charged in relation to his domestic violence. At Dani\u2019s urging, police conducted a \u201cfactual review\u201d of the incident in 2017. The officer who conducted the review recommended no domestic violence charges against her former partner. Instead, police turned the tables on Dani and warned she could be charged with assault for hitting the man \u2013 who she says is much larger and was acting in an aggressive manner \u2013 before running to safety. \u201cHis behaviour had become increasingly concerning, and I took my children to stay in a hotel for a week,\u201d Dani previously told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe night I came home he turned to stand over me aggressively and verbally assault me a few centimetres from my face and that\u2019s when I knew I was in danger. \u201cI was scared for my safety. I hit him and ran, put the kitchen bench between us, and froze. I am half his size. The police frame it like it was a fair fight.\u201d Dani said in statements to the police that her former partner claimed he would \u201cburn the fucking house down\u201d. She says he threw the petrol on to her chest, and that it splashed into her face and hair. \u201cAfter deliberately hunting for the fuel in the garage, he ran into the house, ripped the top of the fuel container, swung his arm and doused me, before reaching for the lighter,\u201d she said. \u201cHe bent down and held it to my feet, looking up into my eyes.\u201d Dani told police, and later the court, she believed at the time the man would kill her. In a letter to the Crime and Corruption Commission to complain about the police response, van der Weegen said the investigation had been \u201cheavily reliant on the evidence of the offender \u2026 and almost entirely dismissive of my client\u2019s complaint\u201d. \u201c[Police claimed] that his intention is to burn the house down [rather than commit a violence offence], notwithstanding that my client is present and in the house.\u201d Van der Weegen said police had clearly failed Dani. \u201cI should not have been doing [the prosecution],\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the police that let her down.

It was then resurrected by Julia Gillard, but with concessions to the mining industry so extreme as to render it virtually useless.</p> <p>That the Australian people receive so little recompense for the extraction and export of our natural resources is indefensible. Australia is one of the most resource-rich nations on Earth: latest <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/snapshots/economy-composition-snapshot/\">data</a> from the Reserve Bank of Australia shows that mining makes up 10% of our economic output, and 60% of our exports.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/australia-to-overtake-qatar-on-lng-field-by-2020-energyquest/\">report</a> found that \u201cAustralia exported an estimated 75.1m tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2018-19\u201d and that, by 2020, we will overtake Qatar as the largest exporter of LNG in the world.</p> <p>Yet we earn only around $600m in annual taxes from LNG exporters, compared with Qatar\u2019s take of more than $26bn.</p> <p>Exporters of our natural resources are essentially engaged in asset sales. These assets, which can only be sold once, belong to all Australians, and the failure of our taxation system to secure a reasonable share of their value for the common good is an abject failure of policymakers.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/Corporatetax45th/Submissions\">submission</a> to a 2018 Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into corporate tax avoidance demonstrated the scale of forgone revenue resulting from the extraordinarily lax fiscal regime that governs resource rents in Australia.</p> <p>Juan Carlos Bou\u00e9, a researcher at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, found that, in the decade since 2008, Australia has imposed an effective tax rate (ETR) of 21% on gross industry income from petroleum exploration and production.</p> <p>Bou\u00e9 calculated that, if that income \u201chad attracted the ETRs which oil and gas activities attracted in Denmark and Norway during this same period (49 and 54%, respectively), then the Australian federal government would have received an additional US$71 or 84bn\u201d in revenue.</p> <p>We should be demanding a much higher return on the profits of the multinational mining companies that extract and export our non-renewable energy resources.</p> <p>Yet to use the potential windfall to prop up the disappearing budget surplus, or to engage in further regional pork-barrelling, as has been <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/tax-hike-on-gas-and-oil-on-cards-to-save-surplus/news-story/80728e8d4e4ee0c0b425cd543b770d84\">suggested</a>, would be yet another exercise in short-term politics at the expense of an unparalleled opportunity to invest in Australia\u2019s future prosperity.</p> <p>The forgone revenue as calculated by Bou\u00e9 is more than double the cost over a decade of fully funding the Gonski education plan.</p> <p>The increased revenue from a uniform national resource rent tax, at an internationally competitive rate significantly higher than our current 21% ETR, could underpin a genuinely transformational approach to education funding, through a long-term investment vehicle to provide a secure source of revenue, quarantined from political interference.</p> <p>The funding of education in Australia is a mess. It is highly politicised, with successive governments of both major parties acquiescing to the demands of wealthy independent schools rather than prioritising the right of all Australian children, no matter their socioeconomic background, to a high-quality education.</p> <p>The proceeds from a uniform national resource rent tax should be spent initially on directly funding the Gonski school education plan, with the remaining revenue wholly invested in a sovereign wealth fund dedicated to funding school education.</p> <p>The Education Future Fund could be administered alongside Australia\u2019s other sovereign wealth funds, by the Future Fund. Managed prudently, its proceeds could, within a decade, sustainably fund Australia\u2019s school education sector in perpetuity, even beyond the natural end of demand for non-renewable energy resources.</p> <p>Opposition from the Australian mining sector to a uniform national resource rent tax set at a rate comparable with other jurisdictions would, of course, be vociferous.</p> <p>However, it is doubtful that a campaign against a well-designed resource rent tax would find as receptive an audience as it did in 2010.</p> <p>The annual <a href=\"https://percapita.org.au/our_work/per-capita-tax-survey-2019/\">Per Capita tax survey</a>, which has been conducted since 2010, consistently shows the vast majority of Australians believe that corporate tax avoidance is unfairly skewing our tax system.</p> <p>A policy to recoup our fair share of the proceeds from resource asset sales for investment in the education of our kids would likely find favour with people worried about low wage growth, high house prices and increased costs of living.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/25/ato-slugs-shell-with-755m-bill-in-fight-against-multinational-tax-avoidance\">ATO slugs Shell with  $755m bill in fight against multinational tax avoidance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Further, the mining boom is over, and an industry campaign against a \u201cgreat big new tax\u201d would likely fall on fallow ground. Its success in 2010 was largely due to the industry\u2019s ability to portray itself as a major employer, but since 2012, employment in mining has fallen by almost 20%. It\u2019s much harder for mining billionaires in 2020 to make the case that a tax on their profits is a tax on the incomes of working Australians.</p> <p>If the proceeds of the RRT were invested securely in a sovereign wealth fund, the populace could be convinced that their money, coming from the sale of their assets, was being prudently and independently invested for the betterment of their children\u2019s futures.</p> <p>In short, selling such a policy should be achievable for any politician serious about investing in the future of the nation.</p> <p>While it\u2019s far from the wholesale structural tax reform the country needs, a properly structured uniform national resource rent tax is long overdue.</p> <p>By using it to create an independent sovereign wealth fund to secure the future funding of our education system, policymakers could create a widely supported, sustainable means of providing every Australian child with the best chance in life.</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Dawson is executive director of public policy thinktank Per Capita</p>",

That the Australian people receive so little recompense for the extraction and export of our natural resources is indefensible. Australia is one of the most resource-rich nations on Earth: latest data from the Reserve Bank of Australia shows that mining makes up 10% of our economic output, and 60% of our exports. A recent report found that \u201cAustralia exported an estimated 75.1m tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2018-19\u201d and that, by 2020, we will overtake Qatar as the largest exporter of LNG in the world. Yet we earn only around $600m in annual taxes from LNG exporters, compared with Qatar\u2019s take of more than $26bn. Exporters of our natural resources are essentially engaged in asset sales. These assets, which can only be sold once, belong to all Australians, and the failure of our taxation system to secure a reasonable share of their value for the common good is an abject failure of policymakers. A submission to a 2018 Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into corporate tax avoidance demonstrated the scale of forgone revenue resulting from the extraordinarily lax fiscal regime that governs resource rents in Australia. Juan Carlos Bou\u00e9, a researcher at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, found that, in the decade since 2008, Australia has imposed an effective tax rate (ETR) of 21% on gross industry income from petroleum exploration and production. Bou\u00e9 calculated that, if that income \u201chad attracted the ETRs which oil and gas activities attracted in Denmark and Norway during this same period (49 and 54%, respectively), then the Australian federal government would have received an additional US$71 or 84bn\u201d in revenue. We should be demanding a much higher return on the profits of the multinational mining companies that extract and export our non-renewable energy resources. Yet to use the potential windfall to prop up the disappearing budget surplus, or to engage in further regional pork-barrelling, as has been suggested, would be yet another exercise in short-term politics at the expense of an unparalleled opportunity to invest in Australia\u2019s future prosperity. The forgone revenue as calculated by Bou\u00e9 is more than double the cost over a decade of fully funding the Gonski education plan. The increased revenue from a uniform national resource rent tax, at an internationally competitive rate significantly higher than our current 21% ETR, could underpin a genuinely transformational approach to education funding, through a long-term investment vehicle to provide a secure source of revenue, quarantined from political interference. The funding of education in Australia is a mess. It is highly politicised, with successive governments of both major parties acquiescing to the demands of wealthy independent schools rather than prioritising the right of all Australian children, no matter their socioeconomic background, to a high-quality education. The proceeds from a uniform national resource rent tax should be spent initially on directly funding the Gonski school education plan, with the remaining revenue wholly invested in a sovereign wealth fund dedicated to funding school education. The Education Future Fund could be administered alongside Australia\u2019s other sovereign wealth funds, by the Future Fund. Managed prudently, its proceeds could, within a decade, sustainably fund Australia\u2019s school education sector in perpetuity, even beyond the natural end of demand for non-renewable energy resources. Opposition from the Australian mining sector to a uniform national resource rent tax set at a rate comparable with other jurisdictions would, of course, be vociferous. However, it is doubtful that a campaign against a well-designed resource rent tax would find as receptive an audience as it did in 2010. The annual Per Capita tax survey, which has been conducted since 2010, consistently shows the vast majority of Australians believe that corporate tax avoidance is unfairly skewing our tax system. A policy to recoup our fair share of the proceeds from resource asset sales for investment in the education of our kids would likely find favour with people worried about low wage growth, high house prices and increased costs of living. Further, the mining boom is over, and an industry campaign against a \u201cgreat big new tax\u201d would likely fall on fallow ground. Its success in 2010 was largely due to the industry\u2019s ability to portray itself as a major employer, but since 2012, employment in mining has fallen by almost 20%. It\u2019s much harder for mining billionaires in 2020 to make the case that a tax on their profits is a tax on the incomes of working Australians. If the proceeds of the RRT were invested securely in a sovereign wealth fund, the populace could be convinced that their money, coming from the sale of their assets, was being prudently and independently invested for the betterment of their children\u2019s futures. In short, selling such a policy should be achievable for any politician serious about investing in the future of the nation. While it\u2019s far from the wholesale structural tax reform the country needs, a properly structured uniform national resource rent tax is long overdue. By using it to create an independent sovereign wealth fund to secure the future funding of our education system, policymakers could create a widely supported, sustainable means of providing every Australian child with the best chance in life. \u2022 Emma Dawson is executive director of public policy thinktank Per Capita",

      "body": "<p>When Erin Phillips went down in the third quarter of the 2019 AFLW grand final there was a collective gasp in the stadium. An uneasy silence settled over the crowd as she clutched her knee. It was an unfortunately familiar sight. One we\u2019ve seen repeated across all four seasons of the fledgling competition, including as recently as round two this year when Melbourne\u2019s Ainslie Kemp hobbled off the ground after tearing her ACL for the second time.</p> <p>The number of ACL injuries sustained by players has been a much-discussed topic since the inaugural season. The AFL has previously partnered with La Trobe University to develop a risk-reduction program for the AFLW with a focus on prevention via strengthening exercise, weights and altered running programs. But the partnership will soon grow to include investigating a potential link between menstrual cycles and ACL injuries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/19/tayla-harris-dealing-with-more-aflw-trolling-after-useless-sledge-aimed-at-her\">Tayla Harris dealing with more AFLW trolling after 'useless' sledge aimed at her</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has been plenty of discussion around physiological and biological factors that can mean women are anywhere from two to 10 times more likely to sustain the season-ending injury. Of course, with the AFLW season starting in February, hard grounds are also factor. As is pre-season fatigue. Both have been linked with ACL injuries. Less exposure to the kind of training that can prevent such injuries or access to appropriate support staff (the AFL has set a $450,000 soft cap on women\u2019s football departments) and the part-time nature of the competition are other, influential factors. So too is the simple fact the competition is not yet four seasons old.</p> <p>Menstrual cycles, however, and their possible impact on player performance as well as susceptibility to injury, have not been raised until recently. It reflects a cultural perception of periods and menstrual cycles as being taboo topics, things we just shouldn\u2019t discuss. But that perception is changing. And not just on home soil.</p> <p>In recent weeks, several high-profile teams and clubs revealed they are using information about athletes\u2019 menstrual cycles to tailor training programs, enhance performance and endeavour to avoid injury. Among them, reigning world champions the US women\u2019s football team, who tracked their periods in a bid to improve performance.</p> <p>Chelsea FC, the home of Sam Kerr, revealed last week they had designed training plans for their players around the phases of their menstrual cycle. Manager Emma Hayes said it was important women had a better understanding of their menstrual cycle. \u201cIt comes from a place of wanting to know more about ourselves and understanding how we can improve our performance,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI am a female coach in an industry where women have always been treated like small men,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThe application of anything from rehab to strength and condition to tactical all come from the basis of what men do.\u201d</p> <p>Hayes is right. An analysis from 2014 revealed that of all the sports performance studies conducted between 2011 and 2013, only 3% involved women. This is hardly surprising. The absence of women in clinical trials and the assumption that what works for men will work for women has long persisted, and to the detriment of women.</p> <p>For Brisbane Lions, tracking periods to boost performance and help avoid injury is nothing new. The club has been doing so since the beginning of the AFLW. The Lions use an app where players record how they\u2019re feeling in the different stages of their cycle.</p> <p>Coach Matt Green said the information helps the club more accurately assess the impact of the menstrual cycle on players. \u201cWhen are the right times to be pushing recovery?

      "bodyText": "When Erin Phillips went down in the third quarter of the 2019 AFLW grand final there was a collective gasp in the stadium. An uneasy silence settled over the crowd as she clutched her knee. It was an unfortunately familiar sight. One we\u2019ve seen repeated across all four seasons of the fledgling competition, including as recently as round two this year when Melbourne\u2019s Ainslie Kemp hobbled off the ground after tearing her ACL for the second time. The number of ACL injuries sustained by players has been a much-discussed topic since the inaugural season. The AFL has previously partnered with La Trobe University to develop a risk-reduction program for the AFLW with a focus on prevention via strengthening exercise, weights and altered running programs. But the partnership will soon grow to include investigating a potential link between menstrual cycles and ACL injuries. There has been plenty of discussion around physiological and biological factors that can mean women are anywhere from two to 10 times more likely to sustain the season-ending injury. Of course, with the AFLW season starting in February, hard grounds are also factor. As is pre-season fatigue. Both have been linked with ACL injuries. Less exposure to the kind of training that can prevent such injuries or access to appropriate support staff (the AFL has set a $450,000 soft cap on women\u2019s football departments) and the part-time nature of the competition are other, influential factors. So too is the simple fact the competition is not yet four seasons old. Menstrual cycles, however, and their possible impact on player performance as well as susceptibility to injury, have not been raised until recently. It reflects a cultural perception of periods and menstrual cycles as being taboo topics, things we just shouldn\u2019t discuss. But that perception is changing. And not just on home soil. In recent weeks, several high-profile teams and clubs revealed they are using information about athletes\u2019 menstrual cycles to tailor training programs, enhance performance and endeavour to avoid injury. Among them, reigning world champions the US women\u2019s football team, who tracked their periods in a bid to improve performance. Chelsea FC, the home of Sam Kerr, revealed last week they had designed training plans for their players around the phases of their menstrual cycle. Manager Emma Hayes said it was important women had a better understanding of their menstrual cycle. \u201cIt comes from a place of wanting to know more about ourselves and understanding how we can improve our performance,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a female coach in an industry where women have always been treated like small men,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThe application of anything from rehab to strength and condition to tactical all come from the basis of what men do.\u201d Hayes is right. An analysis from 2014 revealed that of all the sports performance studies conducted between 2011 and 2013, only 3% involved women. This is hardly surprising. The absence of women in clinical trials and the assumption that what works for men will work for women has long persisted, and to the detriment of women. For Brisbane Lions, tracking periods to boost performance and help avoid injury is nothing new. The club has been doing so since the beginning of the AFLW. The Lions use an app where players record how they\u2019re feeling in the different stages of their cycle. Coach Matt Green said the information helps the club more accurately assess the impact of the menstrual cycle on players. \u201cWhen are the right times to be pushing recovery? When are the right times to be eating certain foods that will aid with limiting bloating and aiding in fatigue and all those different types of things?\u201d Professor Kay Crossley, Director of the La Trobe Sport and Exercise Medicine Research Centre, which is working with the AFL, said there was currently limited knowledge about how the menstrual cycle related to injury and performance. \u201cThere is a suspicion that female hormones may be related to injury and possibly to how women respond to training, but a lot more work needs to be done in that space,\u201d she said. While it\u2019s far too early to make any sweeping claims about any links between menstrual cycles and ACLs, it\u2019s encouraging the AFL is committed to exploring the topic. However, it cannot do so in isolation. Exploring any link between menstrual cycles and ACL injuries, or any injury, must be done alongside a plan to address the other factors that contribute to the rate of ACLs in the league: the part-time nature of the competition, the desire to play the game in the warmest part of the year when grounds are at their hardest and the limits on what clubs can spend on support staff.

As things stand, City sit top of the table and have won their last six league games; but that run started after defeat as Chelsea, who are a point behind them with a game in hand, having won their last nine matches in all competitions. And that\u2019s not all, because just two points behind them are Arsenal, last season\u2019s champions and Chelsea\u2019s opponents in next weekend\u2019s WSL Cup final.<br></p> <p>Which is to say that the standard at the top of the WSL is extremely ridiculous, which is to say that it\u2019s extremely difficult to guess \u2013 and it will be a guess \u2013 what will happen when the best teams play. Both City and Chelsea have been brilliant at the back and devastating in attack, City slightly better at the former and Chelsea significantly better at the latter. But the match-up and the match-ups tell us more about what\u2019s likely to happen this afternoon than the comparative kickings handed out to lesser lights. </p> <p>City\u2019s defence \u2013 which has conceded just six times in 15 league games will be asked serious questions by Erin Cuthbert and Beth England, but even if Steph Houghton and pals can cope with that, Ji So-yun poses an even greater threat. And City finding and answer to all that looks a lot less likely than Chelsea curbing Ellen White and Pauline Bremer \u2013 all the more so given the recent departure of Nick Cushing, City\u2019s manager, and the epochal brilliance of Emma Hayes, Chelsea\u2019s long-serving incumbent. But, either way, this is a treat. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 2pm GMT</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T14:39:41.784Z\">at 2.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack\u2019s match report And with that, I\u2019ll bid you farewell. A magnificent game, with attacking play and ambition straight from the top drawer, and some wobbly defending to give it a particular unpredictability. The net result of which is that Chelsea still look marginally best placed to win the title, unbeaten and a point behind with a game in hand they\u2019re unlikely to lose. City attacked with brio though, particularly the outstanding Lauren Hemp on the left, and there\u2019s still all to play for at the top. This race will run and run. Thanks for following, and stay on the site for Suzanne Wrack\u2019s report from the City Academy Stadium. Bye. Next up is City\u2019s interim manager Alan Mahon: \u201cA great game for the spectator,|\u201d he says, \u201cthough obviously a little bit disappointed with some of the defending. We\u2019ll take a point and move on. There\u2019s a lot of games still to come and we\u2019ll crack on. I said in the huddle to the team to be proud because they\u2019re a top team, Chelsea.\u201d On Ellie Roebuck\u2019s injury there\u2019s no definitive news as yet: \u201cI don\u2019t know much at this stage,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the ankle she went over on,it didn\u2019t look great, but we don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019ve got a break now and time to go back to the drawing board and plan the rest of the season.\u201d Emma Hayes is chewing over the game with her usual eloquent candour: \u201cWe\u2019re still undefeated and coming here is such a tough place to come and we struggled throughout the game defensively but now I\u2019ve seen the first goal was offside (other than that I can\u2019t fault the officials) but it was great entertainment for the crowd. You lot ad a wonderful time, your nceks will have been strained from going from side to side. It\u2019s a sign of things when our team are disappointed that a point feels like a loss, but i\u2019m a bit older and wiser and I think a point\u2019s a gain. Hayes is critical of Chelsea and Bright\u2019s defending for City\u2019s second before the turning points in the middle period of the second half, with Chelsea going ahead then surviving a penalty. \u201cI\u2019m Frustrated with how we started after the restarts, diving in from Sophie she\u2019ll be disappointed but a good early decision from Bergy for the penalty save. It didn\u2019t feel like a game of a lot of control from both teams.\u201d A bit of post-match chat with Chelsea\u2019s Magdelena Eriksson and Beth England: the former says \u201cit could have been anyone\u2019s game, we\u2019re not happy with conceding three goals, but have to be happy with a point, City did well \u2013 they are an amazing team with a good structure and are really hard to beat.\u201d England adds, with some understatement: \u201cWe\u2019re still in this title race, we\u2019re not taking our foot off the gas. Goal made up for the early miss, I\u2019ve got to do better than that, and I\u2019m just disappointed we couldn\u2019t keep the win at 3-2.\u201d The throw comes to nothing and Chelsea get it back down the other end. Not for long, but they\u2019re pressing City well enough without the ball to keep themselves out of danger. And that\u2019s our lot. And what a lot it was. A terrific match. Chelsea remain unbeaten, and with their title challenge in their own hands with that game in hand on their opponents, the WSL leaders. 90+11 mins: More smart attacking play from Chelsea as England flicks it wide to Cuthbert whose ball in is eventually worked clear, and City now have a throw on the right midway through Chelsea\u2019s half. 90+9 mins: So, one final sub then, for Man City: The French keeper Benameur comes on for WSL debut in place of the injured Roebuck. 90+7 mins: This doesn\u2019t look good for Roebuck (or City, or England, with Phil Neville among the assembled today) \u2013 a stretcher is brought on and her afternoon\u2019s work is over. She looks to have hurt an ankle. 90+5 mins: Cuthbert launches it into what might crudely describe as a mixer at this desperate late stage of a fluent high-quality game; but Roebuck comes out to gather brilliantly under pressure, but needs treatment after landing awkwardly. Added added time looms. 90+4 mins: City win a free kick that is hoyed into the box and eventually whacked clear by Thorisdottir, enabling England to raid forward down the right and win a free-kick following Scott\u2019s rash hack \u2026 90+2 mins: Chelsea are handling this well so far, though Walsh causes them a couple of flutters with a slide-rule pass in for Stanway but it just runs away from the City attacker. 90+1 mins: Chelsea sub: Spence for Kerr, a midfielder for a star striker. 90 mins: And we will have seven more minutes of this. Few neutrals will complain. 87 mins: Another big Chelsea chance: England picks up a loose ball, runs at Bright, with a player to her left, but then horribly slices the shot wide with her left foot. Fair play to Bright, who kept England at arm\u2019s length and wisely decided not to dive in. And play halts while Bonner is treated for a knock. She has to leave the pitch temporarily. 85 mins: City continue to press, but Thorisdottir snuffs out their latest raid and Chelsea get a rare spell of prolonged possession, as Kerr cutely plays in Cuthbert down the right but her low cross is deflected behind, apparently off a Chelsea player as it\u2019s a goal kick. 83 mins: No sooner do I say that than Chelsea counter and England scampers down the right to send in a presentable cross that needs to be turned behind for a corner. It\u2019s a good ball in too, to Eriksson at the back post but she sends her header a fraction too high. 81 mins: City are pouring forward from all angles and all positions at the moment and it\u2019s thrilling to watch, but Chelsea are clinging on to that unbeaten record. 79 mins: A couple of minutes earlier, there was another Chelsea sub: Ji, who\u2019s been subdued despite scoring, makes way for Thorisdottir and City made a change too, Bremer for White. 78 mins: City press again, as the excellent Hemp initiates another move down the left; it\u2019s worked from left to right and back again and eventually lands at Weir\u2019s feet on the left edge of the six-yard box but she shoots straight at Berger, who saves smartly. \u2026 it\u2019s cleared but comes back and Weir slides a subtle low ball into the box and Hemp beats her marker and the keeper to the ball and slides it into the corner. This is magnificent stuff now. 75 mins: This is the stuff of champions from Chelsea, in the sense that they\u2019d been second-best this half until the past seven or eight minutes, since when they\u2019ve won all the key moments, saving a penalty and scoring two classic opportunists\u2019 goals. City aren\u2019t beaten though, and they win another corner on the right \u2026 What a goal! England picks it up 25-30 yards out and thunders a searingly accurate shot to Roebuck\u2019s right into the middle corner of the net. 72 mins: Amid all that, a Chelsea substitution: Bachmann replaces Reiten. 72 mins: And breathe. Another scramble in the Chelsea six-yard box is worked clear by the visitors as it all becomes deliriously joyously scrappy. Stanway sends it to Berger\u2019s right at saveable height and she palms it away! It\u2019s all happening. The penalty was won after a late challenge by Ingle just as Chelsea were basking in levelling against the run of play And City go straight down the other end and win a spot kick 68 mins: Cuthbert wins a corner for Chelsea when her searching cross from the right for Kerr is headed behind and it\u2019s worked out left, where a cross from England is flicked beyond the City defence for Erikssen to steal in and head it past Roebuck who fumbles it in. 66 mins: City are rampant at the moment. The ball sits up nicely for Weir, 25 yards out, and after her initial blast is deflected out to Hemp, whose shot is deflected for another corner. Which Chelsea clear \u2026 65 mins: City win another corner after more sprightly work from Hemp on the left. The corner prompts a bout of head tennis and the hosts have to work it all the way back to the keeper to retain possession, and the attack eventually breaks down on the right. 63 mins: City are on on the attack again straight from the off, as Stanway forages down the right and plays in Stanway whose close-range effort is blocked. 62 mins: And we have a delay as City\u2019s keeper Roebuck needs treatment, possibly for the whack she\u2019d taken in that earlier goalmouth scramble. But she\u2019s Ok to continue, prompting more cheers from a now-happy home crowd. A big, big half-hour looms now 59 mins: Hemp found some space on the left after a clearance by Bonner and curled a classy ball behind the defence, catching Chelsea square, and Hemp races clear, has time to steady herself and clip it beyond Berger with her right-foot. City are back ahead after a fine counterattacking goal 58 mins: It\u2019s City\u2019s turn to knock out some pretty passing triangles on the right as Beckie and Scott combine with the latter sending a low ball into the box but Ji manages to scramble clear. 57 mins: Just wide. A teasing near-post corner from is met by Reiten ahead of Beckie, but it\u2019s narrowly wide. 56 mins: Cuthbert bullocks down the right, keeping Weir at bay until the City defender gets a foot in at the byline to concede a corner to Chelsea \u2026 54 mins: Chelsea begin to assert themselves again, with England playing in Kerr with a neat defence-splitting pass but it\u2019s just overhit a tad and Roebuck gathers. 53 mins: Chance for Chelsea! Reiten\u2019s close-range volley at the near post, following a good combination from Cuthbert and Mjelde down the right, is beaten away for a corner. The corner is defended successfully following a brief scramble around Roebuck, who takes an inadvertent whack to the nose. 51 mins: Just a little bit of sloppiness in Chelsea\u2019s passing so far this half and City are pressing them hard, Stokes harrying Cuthbert deep into her own half. When City next gain the ball they raid down the right through Beckie but her cross for Hemp is overhit and drifts behind. 48 mins: There have been no substitutions as yet. Houghton meanwhile is caught in possession by Kerr, who scampers down the left. Her initial ball in is cleared but Reiten reestablishes possession only to overhit a diagonal deep-raking cross. 46 mins: Weir and Hemp combine down the left for City and win a corner, when the latter tries to play in the former by the byline and Mjelde has to intercept. But it fails to clear the first defender and the visitors clear And we go again for the second half. City kick us off again. Thanks Daniel. I\u2019ll level with you \u2013 I missed the early exchanges of this due to cricket duties \u2013 but this looks deliciously poised, with City showing their creative potential but Chelsea just so darned hard to beat. Don\u2019t go anywhere, but you can have a quick peak at what\u2019s going on in the men\u2019s games here. Right, that\u2019s me done \u2013 join me for Arsenal-Everton later on. Tom Davies will take you through what promises to be a bazzing second half. City will be the happier of the two sides in a way: they\u2019ve played better; but Chelsea will be happier in another: they\u2019re level. In other words, both managers have work to do. 45 min There\u2019ll be one additional minute. 45 min I should note that this is the final league head-to-head between the top three teams, so if Chelsea wind up top at the final whistle, they\u2019ll be very hard to stop, given their game in hand. 44 min It\u2019s gone a little scrappy. 43 min Elsewhere, Wolves lead Norwich 2-0, Diogo Jota, who scored three in midweek, scoring both, and Man United have just taken the lead against Watford, Bruno Fernandes winning and scoring a penalty. You can follow those games here: 42 min Here come Chelsea again, Cuthbert lifting toward Kerr at the back post, but again the ball is fractionally high. 41 min Save for the fact that it arrived, that goal was not coming. Chelsea looked about to score for the first 20 and didn\u2019t, looked nothing like scoring for the next 20 and did. Football eh. Houghton climbs high to head away Mjelde\u2019s cross, but the ball drop to ... Ji! Who gets right over it to drive hard, and the ball flicks off the head of Stokes before beating Roebuck and nestling in the bottom-left corner! 38 min We\u2019ve seen hardly anything of Ji so far. 37 min Hemp chases a long ball and collects it just by the corner flag. She then cuts back towards her own goal, easily beating Mjelde, who trips her. The free-kick comes to nowt. 35 min Looking at that again, Stokes is lucky. She\u2019s very close to England, but her hands \u2013 both of them \u2013 are up by her face, where they\u2019ve no business chilling. 34 min The corner goes near post and England is there, crouching to flick on. The ball perhaps brushes the hand of Stokes, behind her, and there are beseechings for a penalty, but the ref is having none of it. 33 min Bright finds England, who\u2019s pulled onto the left touchline. She sets off towards goal and crosses, earning a corner... 32 min City have been much the better team since the goal. 30 min Weir, who\u2019s having a good day, dashes across Cuthbert to open up a shooting lane just outside the box. She gets reasonable hold of the ball too, but directs the effort straight at Roebuck. 30 min We\u2019ve not seen much of Mjelde so far, but suddenly she appears, sliding a lovely reverse-pass in front of Kerr, dashing into the box, right-hand side. But Roebuck gets out well and catches the attempted dink. 28 min A long ball beats Chelsea\u2019s entire back four, and Stanway is onto it. But she doesn\u2019t have the pace to get away, and recognising that fact, checks to set up a shot, only to be crowded out. 27 min But here\u2019s England, finding Kerr down the left; Bonner comes across to see her away. 26 min Chelsea have struggled to muster successive passes since the goal. 24 min Chelsea have themselves a situation now. If they commit more players forward, they risk getting buried on the counter, but they can\u2019t really wear a draw. 23 min You can\u2019t say that goal wasn\u2019t coming; you can say that you\u2019d be saying exactly the same had Chelsea scored it. Walsh battles towards the box and when she\u2019s eventually unloaded, Weir is on-hand to send the ball wide, where Beckie delivers a perfect, first-time cross in behind \u2013 it\u2019s more of pass than a cross really; obviously White is exactly there, and she turns an expert\u2019s finish home, off Berger. 21 min There\u2019s no pattern to this whatsoever, but there\u2019s absolutely gallons of tempo. 19 min The corner then goes right across the face of goal! Again, England misses it, and Bright, heaving in two-footed at the back post, can\u2019t apply the touch required. 18 min Chelsea take the sting out, knocking the ball along the back four ... but then they break quickly, sending Ingle away down the left. Her cross is a good one and Kerr is there again, heading down towards the corner ... but Roebuck dives full-length to tip behind. 17 min Wright finds Bright, striding up from the back, and Kerr is there to her left. The ball goes that way too, but her cross is too close to Roebuck, who gets it away. 15 min Walsh sticks one in behind, seeking Stanway, but Berger hares out to kick clear. 14 min Beckie coaxes in another cross towards White, but Ericsson is there to get the ball away, more or less. 14 min City are improving, and Hemp flies down the left but then overhits her cross. 12 min How is this this still goalless? City win a free-kick 30 yards out and Weir floats it directly onto White\u2019s bonce. Again, anything on target is a goal unless it hits the keeper, but the header goes just wide of the near post. 10 min But have a look! Beckie retrieves a cross that floats beyond the back post and slings in a ball that White misses but which falls perfectly for Kerr, arriving onto the scene! Anything on target and it\u2019s a goal, but she opts to give it everything, leathering a shot over the top. It\u2019s one of those where, if anything, Brian, she\u2019s hit it.... 9 min City haven\u2019t got to grips with Kerr at all, and when Reiten turns up down the left, a long ball set her away with a target in the middle. Her cross is a goodun too, but just too high for Kerr, who can only impart a glance, when a full brow was required. 8 min Andersson darts a ball into Kerr, but Houghton cleverly makes to go in then steps off, so she\u2019s ready to collect hen Kerr turns. 7 min City are sitting off Chelsea, but its not really helping \u2013 Chelsea are playing out of defence and through midfield; as I type that, England serves in a cross from the left, looking for England, but Roebuck collects easily enough. 6 min Chelsea look much the better side and Kerr gets away again at inside-right, looking to cross low for England ... but the ball is behind her. 5 min Beckie nicks the ball past Reiten, who nicks her leg. Beckie stays down for a moment, but seems fine. 4 min Things are settling down. Chelsea knock it about, looking to tease City out. 3 min Phew! 2 min Now White finds space down the other end and looks to drill low inside the near post, only for Berger to block behind. The corner comes to nothing. 1 min WHAT A MISS! I SAY, WHAT A MISS! Immediately, Reiten drives at the City defence and slips Kerr in, who flicks the ball over the keeper \u2013 by the way she wheeled away, she thought she\u2019d scored \u2013 but Roebuck gets something on it and the ball squirts across the box to England ... WHO TOTALLY MISSES HER KICK! 1 min Away we go! In less important but still important footballing activity, Man United are playing Watford and Wolves are playing Norwich. Follow all that here: By the looks of things, City will play 4-4-2 \u2013 don\u2019t tell Guardiola \u2013 and Chelsea will play a diamond. So City will be looking to get the ball wide, while Chelsea will intend to win the number\u2019s game in midfield. Here they come! Talk to people, people. Ask people how they are, tell people how you are. \u201cI\u2019ve got wonderful players,\u201d the wonderful Emma Hayes tells BT. In interview, she\u2019s much more bullish than Alan Mahon: she expects her team to win and is clear about how important that is; Mahon gives it the just another game, long way to go shtick. I know who I find more convincing. Gosh, approaching half-time, Lewes are still holding Arsenal. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how England does today. She\u2019s been in terrific form this season, and City will have to go some to contain her. Their midfield need to have a proper one today, because I can\u2019t see their defence doing enough if they\u2019re exposed to a serious amount of pressure. To get you in the mood. City have opted against starting Pauline Bremer, presumably mindful of Chelsea\u2019s attacking prowess. Only Vivianne Miedema and Beth England have more league goals that Bremer this season; I\u2019d expect her to turn up in the second half, when legs are tired. Elsewhere: Manchester United are 2-0 up away to Everton, playing their first game at their new Walton Hall ground. Arsenal, meanwhile, are being held 0-0 by Lewes in the FA Cup. Manchester City: Roebuck, Stokes, Bonner, Houghton (C), Scott, Stanway, Beckie, Hemp, White, Weir, Walsh. Subs: Benameur, Coombs, Bremer, Toland, Park, Wullaert, Fidalgo. Chelsea: Berger, Bright, Ingle, England, Ji, Reiten, Eriksson, Mjelde, Kerr, Cuthbert, Andersson. Subs: Telford, Thorisdottir, Carter, Blundell, Engman, Spence, Bachmann. This is a colossal, monumental, gargantuan piece of fixture. As things stand, City sit top of the table and have won their last six league games; but that run started after defeat as Chelsea, who are a point behind them with a game in hand, having won their last nine matches in all competitions. And that\u2019s not all, because just two points behind them are Arsenal, last season\u2019s champions and Chelsea\u2019s opponents in next weekend\u2019s WSL Cup final. Which is to say that the standard at the top of the WSL is extremely ridiculous, which is to say that it\u2019s extremely difficult to guess \u2013 and it will be a guess \u2013 what will happen when the best teams play. Both City and Chelsea have been brilliant at the back and devastating in attack, City slightly better at the former and Chelsea significantly better at the latter. But the match-up and the match-ups tell us more about what\u2019s likely to happen this afternoon than the comparative kickings handed out to lesser lights. City\u2019s defence \u2013 which has conceded just six times in 15 league games will be asked serious questions by Erin Cuthbert and Beth England, but even if Steph Houghton and pals can cope with that, Ji So-yun poses an even greater threat. And City finding and answer to all that looks a lot less likely than Chelsea curbing Ellen White and Pauline Bremer \u2013 all the more so given the recent departure of Nick Cushing, City\u2019s manager, and the epochal brilliance of Emma Hayes, Chelsea\u2019s long-serving incumbent. But, either way, this is a treat. Kick-off: 2pm GMT",

Man Utd 3-0 Watford (Greenwood, 76)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A sumptuous finish, in off the crossbar.

Manchester United can snatch back fifth spot with victory over Watford, while Wolves could leapfrog Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side should United slip up at Old Trafford. Watford\u2019s upturn in form has hit the buffers \u2013 they are winless in four matches \u2013 but Nigel Pearson\u2019s side may relish the role of underdogs, as they did when they beat United in December. United have been Jekyll and Hyde under Solskj\u00e6r, and finding the net has been a problem; failure to score this afternoon would mean three games without scoring at home for their first time since May 2002. \u201cI feel that Bruno [Fernandes] and Odion coming in will get more goals in the team. That\u2019s been lacking,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThe games we\u2019ve lost \u2013 West Ham, Burnley, Palace, Bournemouth \u2013 we\u2019ve had chances but we haven\u2019t scored goals.\u201d</p> <p>Wolves, meanwhile, are feeling better about themselves after victory in midweek over Espanyol in the Europa League. That led Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo to declare \u201cdreaming is for free\u201d with some giddy Wolves supporters hopeful of going the distance in the competition, but, after a couple of days\u2019 rest, it is back down to business at Molineux. As for Norwich, Daniel Farke\u2019s side badly need a result to prevent them from sinking without trace. \u201cPeople can write us off and say we have no chance to close the gap. But I don\u2019t agree,\u201d said Farke. \u201cIt is possible.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Kick-offs: </strong>2pm (GMT)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-23T12:50:51.850Z\">at 12.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company. Now, here\u2019s Arsenal v Everton: Read Jamie Jackson\u2019s report from Old Trafford: Read Paul MacInnes\u2019s report from Molineux: Do hoover up the team news from the Emirates: Diogo Jota scored twice before Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez rounded off a comfortable victory over bottom club Norwich. Neves also rattled the crossbar. Wolves move up to eighth, two points off Manchester United and five off fourth-placed Chelsea. Next up for Wolves? A trip to Barcelona, to take on Espanyol in the second leg of their Europa League round of 32 tie; they head to Spain on Thursday with a 4-0 aggregate lead. A healthy few days for Nuno and co. Job done. Emphatic finishes by Bruno Fernandes, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood hoist Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side up to fifth. In the end, a very satisfying afternoon\u2019s work for United, who were slow out of the blocks. The brilliant Fernandes passed home a penalty before Martial scooped the ball over Ben Foster, and then the 18-year-old Greenwood got in on the act with arguably the best goal of the lot, sending a rasping strike in off the crossbar. 90 min: We are into three minutes of added time at Old Trafford. Down at Molineux, there will be five minutes of stoppage time. 89 min: Chong goes close to finding a fourth! He opens up on to his left, picks his spot ... but the finish is lacking. Matic superbly supplied Chong. 88 min: Manchester United are almost there. Ighalo went close to adding a fourth a moment ago, but he fires into the side netting after seizing on a poor header by Adam Masina, who inadvertently plunged Foster into trouble. 85 min: Ben Godfrey catches Jonny, the Wolves wing-back, with a poor challenge and the Spaniard is belatedly forced off at Molineux. R\u00faben Vinagre is on. Godfrey was cautioned following a VAR check. 84 min: A half-decent afternoon for Bournemouth and Aston Villa, after demoralising defeats to Burnley and Southampton respectively. Norwich will be eight points from safety with 11 games to play. 81 min: Tom Cleverley replaces Doucour\u00e9, and gets a warm ovation from all quarters of Old Trafford. Ighalo got a decent reception, too. 80 min: A flurry of changes at Old Trafford. Scott McTominay is on for Fred, Tahith Chong replaces Greenwood and Odion Ighalo replaces Martial. Greenwood has scored 11 goals in all competitions this season, the most of any Premier League teenager. No wonder Southgate fancies him for England. A sumptuous finish, in off the crossbar. Greenwood carries the ball out from his own half after Hughes loses possession and drives forward. He skips past one challenge before laying the ball off to his right, playing a lovely one-two with Bruno Fernandes \u2013 who has had a very good game in midfield \u2013 and Greenwood promptly lashes the ball into the far corner. United are moving up to fifth place in style, even if the scoreline is a little flattering. 76 min: As if things couldn\u2019t get any worse for Norwich, Adama Traor\u00e9 has just entered for Wolves. The winger replaces Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez. \u201cHow did rugby lose Traor\u00e9 to football?\u201d emails Mary Waltz. A valid point ... 75 min: Manchester United, as unconvincing as they have been at times, should be home and dry. Bruno Fernandes floats a cross in for Harry Maguire but Slabhead cannot direct his header on target. That was a fine chance. 71 min: There is some concern for Conor Coady, after the Wolves skipper comes off worse from a nasty collision with Josip Drmic. Coady slid in to challenge Pukki and ended up taking a whack. Wolves\u2019 medical staff cover Coady\u2019s face in ice, but the defender is hard as nails and is OK to continue. Coady gets a booking for the challenge and, after a quick concussion test, it\u2019s back to business. 70 min: Isma\u00efla Sarr replaces Roberto Pereyra, as Nigel Pearson makes his first Watford change. Anthony Martial has scored in three successive appearances in all club competitions for the first time since September 2017. 66 min: No hat-trick for Diogo Jota this afternoon. The Portuguese has been replaced by another Portuguese, Pedro Neto. Norwich have made a double change, with Emi Buend\u00eda and Josip Drmi\u0107 on for Rupp and Duda. As for Jota, he\u2019s had worse weeks ... 65 min: Solskj\u00e6r on Martial earlier this week: I think Anthony can step up, get a few more and get to the 20 mark. Definitely. He\u2019s got quality of course, he\u2019s a very good finisher. He takes his chances really well. There\u2019s good technique in his finishing. He\u2019s good receiving the ball at times and dropping off. He can play almost like a false nine as well. Sometimes I\u2019d like him to be stronger physically. 63 min: It has hardly been vintage United, but they are two goals to the good and that Martial goal was a beauty. Martial can be so frustrating \u2013 but there is no doubting his raw ability. Elsewhere, Wolves lead 3-0. They are absolutely cruising. A brisk move, and a superb, nerveless finish. Martial scoops the ball over Ben Foster after initially being repelled by the Watford goalkeeper. The move itself was exquisite, as United clicked into gear with some wonderful one-touch football. Martial\u2019s first effort was saved but he kept his cool and cheekily dinked the ball over Foster to double United\u2019s advantage. 58 min: Room for a left-field stat? Jim\u00e9nez has scored more Premier League goals than any other player this season without ever netting the first goal in a match. Wolves are heading eighth in the Premier League, United fifth ... 55 min: James skips past Dawson, and rolls an inviting ball across goal \u2013 but Greenwood nudges it on! And Martial is too slow to react. 52 min: Watford have an equaliser chalked off by the video assistant referee! Troy Deeney had wheeled away. But Harry Maguire appeals for handball, and United survive another sloppy start after Dawson is penalised. No goal. Wolves are home and hosed. Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez gets in on the act after Jota\u2019s shot cannoned off the inside of a post and he taps in Wolves\u2019 third. Dendoncker kickstarts the move, seizing possession on halfway before slipping in Jota, who goes mightily close. Jim\u00e9nez converts the rebound. They are a slick attacking partnership. 50 min: This second half is shaping up similar to the first from a Manchester United perspective, with Dan James proving to be the dangerman down the left flank. When he\u2019s in possession, Watford look panicked. Other than James\u2019 odd foray forward, a nondescript start to the second period. 46 min: We\u2019re back under way at Old Trafford and Molineux. No changes at half-time. Wolves, who are cruising against Norwich, will be hoping for more of the same. Tim Krul tipped a fine R\u00faben Neves strike on to the crossbar on the brink of the interval. A juicy half-time stat to get stuck into, courtesy of Opta: Bruno Fernandes has scored each of the last 13 penalties he has taken in top-flight football (12/12 with Sporting and 1/1 with Man Utd) since missing for Udinese in April 2016. Elsewhere, City and Chelsea are level-pegging in the WSL: Manchester United 1-0 Watford Wolves 2-0 Norwich City 45 min: We\u2019re into stoppage time at Old Trafford and Molineux. 44 min: It was a jinking, Jorginho-esque run up by Fernandes, his first goal in a Manchester United shirt. That goal ends a run of 235 minutes without a Premier League goal at Old Trafford for United. United look set to take a one-goal advantage with them down the tunnel at the interval. \u201cJust when you think you\u2019ve seen everything in football, a Portugueser comes along with the triple-jump penalty,\u201d emails Justin Kavanagh. Nicely done. Bruno Fernandes watches Ben Foster dive to his right, so promptly rolls the ball to the Watford goalkeeper\u2019s left. 41 min: Penalty to Manchester United ... Fernandes rushed into the box, out came Ben Foster and, despite the Watford goalkeeper shaking his head in disbelief, there is only one outcome for the referee Martin Atkinson. Watford had looked so content. 38 min: James teeds up Fred, but it\u2019s high and wide! Dan James drives down the left, cuts on to his right foot and shoots over. He repeats the formula seconds later, but this time picks out Fred, who really should hit the target. United are, finally, making some strides going forward but Watford are still rather comfortable. 36 min: Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, rightly, gets a lot of love, but Jota is mustard. Now, time for some more red-hot baseball cap chat. \u201cSun visors. Please,\u201d emails Colin Young. Apologies! \u201cIf we call them baseball caps I can only think MAGA. Yeah, I know ...\u201d 30 min: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was bigging up Anthony Martial earlier in the week but the Manchester United forward has been more cold than hot so far at Old Trafford, with the Frenchman blazing an effort painfully wide a moment ago. Up the other end, Doucour\u00e9 went close for a grooving Watford side: Make that five goals in two games. Is there another hat-trick on the cards for Jota? Dendoncker keeps a corner alive and Romain Sa\u00efss smacks the ball across goal, handing Jota the ball on a plate. Jota taps in from close range. 26 min: Diogo Jota, it is fair to say, is a man in form; he has netted seven goals in his last seven home games in all competitions, including four in his last two. A moment ago Jota squared the ball for Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, but an alert Alex Tettey did well to intercept for Norwich. As things stand, Wolves will move up to eighth, level on points with Manchester United. Back to Old Trafford ... 25 min: It\u2019s raining goals. City lead Chelsea in the WSL: 22 min: United seem to have put the wheels in motion \u2013 Daniel James leathered a cross in a moment ago after speeding down the left flank before Aaron Wan-Bissaka fired against the side netting \u2013 but it is baby steps at the moment. United are beginning to pop the ball about a little quicker, but they have been half-hearted when it matters thus far. A little tame in the final phase. Diogo Jota, who helped himself to a hat-trick on Thursday, is at it again. After a VAR check, Wolves are able to celebrate the opener at Molineux. Matt Doherty took hold of the ball on the edge of the area and picked out the Portuguese, who coolly did the rest, firing under the legs of Tim Krul. 17 min: A few moans and groans as Fred surrenders possession and then trips as he tries to win it back. Anthony Martial does not do much better. Plenty of encouragement for Watford, who could move out of the relegation zone with a point. 16 min: De Gea does well to deny Doucour\u00e9! Watford have dominated the opening stages at Old Trafford. Will Hughes drives through the spine of the United midfield, picking out Gerard Deulofeu to his left. The winger delivers a low cross and it runs kindly for Doucour\u00e9, who is eventually crowded out. 11 min: It has all been very sluggish from a Manchester United point of view in the early stages. Nothing to write home about, that\u2019s for sure. Reasons to be cheerful for Watford, with Deeney getting plenty of joy in attack. Watford are a different beast when Deeney\u2019s in the mood. United are yet to get going. 9 min: \u201cLove the blog,\u201d begins Jack on email. \u201cWhat is your stance on goalkeepers wearing baseball caps \u2013 something we should see more of?\u201d Absolutely. Nothing better than a baseball cap being frantically ferried to the goalkeeper from the technical area. A relatively low-key start at Molineux, where Wolves are yet to get into their stride after a brilliant night under the lights on Thursday. 8 min: That mix-up between Maguire and Lindel\u00f6f has not exactly settled the nerves. Manchester United have made a jittery start at Old Trafford, with Maguire again sloppily distributing possession. Watford are feeling pretty good about themselves. 5 min: Shaw makes a big tackle on Troy Deeney, who was in on David de Gea after an incredible mix-up between Lindel\u00f6f and Maguire. Shaw snatches the ball away and Manchester United get away with it. A decent start by both teams at Old Trafford. At Molineux, a baseball cap is the order of the day for Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patr\u00edcio, who is being blinded by the low Black Country sun. 2 min: A lively opening by Dan James, who stretches the Watford right-back Craig Dawson and fizzes in a low cross. Ben Foster gathers. We\u2019re under way. We\u2019re edging closer to kick-off. Fred the Red is out on the pitch, geeing up the crowd. There will be a minute\u2019s silence before Manchester United take on Watford in honour of Harry Gregg: \u201cCleverley hasn\u2019t only played for Watford,\u201d points out Martin Lancon on email. Indeed, the midfielder is on the bench against Manchester United at Old Trafford, where Odion Ighalo and Danny Welbeck could also get on against their former side. \u201cLet\u2019s not fear the game,\u201d says Nigel Pearson. \u201cWe have to embrace the challenge and earn the right to play at this level again next season. The players know they are capable of beating Manchester United, they have proven that but it\u2019s about what we do today.\u201d More from Solskj\u00e6r, who has been talking through his decision to omit Andreas Pereira and Jesse Lingard from the United squad. \u201cWe picked a squad of 18 and we felt it was the right 18 here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got cover on the bench for wide men, forwards, midfielders and defenders, so that was the decision I made.\u201d A reminder that four Serie A matches have been postponed: Team news news: Wolves give Adama Traor\u00e9 a breather after he helped demolish Espanyol on Thursday. Leander Dendoncker replaces the winger, who takes a spot on the bench. Norwich make two changes from their narrow defeat to Liverpool with Christoph Zimmermann replaced by Ben Godfrey and left-back Jamal Lewis comes in for Sam Byram, who has been ruled out for the season. Manchester United will play host for Euro 2021\u2019s opener: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r wants Manchester United to join the top-four feast. \u201cWe need more wins,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s join the party and try and challenge for that top four. Watford are very well organised and are always a threat, we need to be at our best. Mason Greenwood didn\u2019t travel to Bruges [in midweek] but he feels OK.\u201d Team news news: Mason Greenwood makes his first Premier League start since facing Newcastle on Boxing Day, when Scott McTominay, who returns among the Manchester United substitutes this afternoon, suffered a knee injury. Odion Ighalo and Danny Welbeck are on the bench at Old Trafford against their former clubs. Solskj\u00e6r makes two changes from victory over Chelsea, with Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Greenwood replacing Eric Bailly and Brandon Williams. As for Watford, Adrian Mariappa drops to the bench, with Craig Dawson stepping in. And Marcus Rashford remains sidelined for United because of a double back stress fracture, but his nephew has been doing the business in his absence: Manchester United v Watford Manchester United (4-4-2): De Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Lindel\u00f6f, Shaw; Fernandes, Fred, Matic, James; Martial, Greenwood Subs: Romero, Bailly, Williams, McTominay, Mata, Chong, Ighalo Watford (4-2-3-1): Foster; Dawson, Kabasele, Cathcart, Masina; Capoue, Hughes; Pereyra, Doucour\u00e9, Deulofeu; Deeney Subs: Gomes, Mariappa, Cleverley, Welbeck, Chalobah, Gray, Sarr Referee: Martin Atkinson Wolves v Norwich Wolves (3-5-2): Patricio; Boly, Coady, Sa\u00efss; Doherty, Dendoncker, Moutinho, Neves, Jonny; Jota, Jim\u00e9nez Subs: Ruddy, Kilman, Vinagre, Gibbs-White, Podence, Neto, Traor\u00e9 Norwich (4-2-3-1): Krul; Aarons, Hanley, Godfrey, Lewis; McLean, Tettey; Cantwell, Duda, Rupp; Pukki Subs: Fahrmann, Trybull, Vrancic, Buend\u00eda, Stiepermann, Drmic, Idah Referee: Chris Kavanagh Welcome to the Odion Ighalo and John Ruddy derbies. Manchester United can snatch back fifth spot with victory over Watford, while Wolves could leapfrog Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side should United slip up at Old Trafford. Watford\u2019s upturn in form has hit the buffers \u2013 they are winless in four matches \u2013 but Nigel Pearson\u2019s side may relish the role of underdogs, as they did when they beat United in December. United have been Jekyll and Hyde under Solskj\u00e6r, and finding the net has been a problem; failure to score this afternoon would mean three games without scoring at home for their first time since May 2002. \u201cI feel that Bruno [Fernandes] and Odion coming in will get more goals in the team. That\u2019s been lacking,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThe games we\u2019ve lost \u2013 West Ham, Burnley, Palace, Bournemouth \u2013 we\u2019ve had chances but we haven\u2019t scored goals.\u201d Wolves, meanwhile, are feeling better about themselves after victory in midweek over Espanyol in the Europa League. That led Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo to declare \u201cdreaming is for free\u201d with some giddy Wolves supporters hopeful of going the distance in the competition, but, after a couple of days\u2019 rest, it is back down to business at Molineux. As for Norwich, Daniel Farke\u2019s side badly need a result to prevent them from sinking without trace. \u201cPeople can write us off and say we have no chance to close the gap. But I don\u2019t agree,\u201d said Farke. \u201cIt is possible.\u201d Kick-offs: 2pm (GMT)",

In the closing stages Mason Greenwood caught on, starting and finishing a move for the 11th goal of the 18-year-old\u2019s breakthrough season, the final pass to him coming from Fernandes. It is more than a year since United have claimed three consecutive league victories and they go to Everton on Sunday searching to end this run. \u201cI hope [we can beat them] because there are four big league games coming up \u2013 Everton, Manchester City, Tottenham and Sheffield United,\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said. The manager changed two from last Monday\u2019s win at Chelsea \u2013 Victor Lindel\u00f6f replaced Eric Bailly and Greenwood came in for Brandon Williams \u2013 while Nigel Pearson\u2019s only adjustment from a draw at Brighton 15 days ago was a preference for Craig Dawson in place of Adrian Mariappa. The contest nearly began awfully for United when Nemanja Matic and Harry Maguire dithered, allowing Troy Deeney a sight of David de Gea\u2019s goal but he fluffed the chance. \u201cA shambles,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r of the mix-up. United are flaky in defence because of the gap often allowed between rearguard and midfield. Sensing this, Roberto Pereyra skated forward and found Gerard Deulofeu to the left, he passed to the unmarked Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 and the home team were lucky he could not finish.

      "body": "<p>It was a landslide. Bernie Sanders had been expected to win the Nevada caucuses, but not like this. With just 4% of the vote in, news organizations <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KanielaIng/status/1231377141209526272\">called</a> the race for Sanders, since his margin of victory was so large. Sanders has now won the popular vote in all of the first three states, and is currently leading in the polls almost everywhere else in the country. He was already the favorite to take the nomination before the Nevada contest, with Democratic party insiders worrying he was \u201cunstoppable.\u201d His campaign will only grow more powerful now.</p> <p>Importantly, Sanders\u2019 Nevada victory definitively disproved one of the most enduring myths about his campaign: that it could attract left-leaning young white people, but was incapable of drawing in a diverse coalition. In fact, voters of color were a primary source of Sanders\u2019 strength in Nevada; he received <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Taniel/status/1231384394616590336\">the majority of Latino votes</a>. Entrance polls <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaneGoldmacher/status/1231348902688804865\">showed</a> Sanders winning \u201cmen and women, whites and Latinos, voters 17-29, 30-44 and 45-65, those with college degrees and those without, liberal Democrats (by a lot) and moderate/conservatives (narrowly), union and non-union households.\u201d The poisonous concept of the white \u201cBernie Bro\u201d as the \u201ctypical\u201d Sanders supporter should be dead.</p> <p>Some members of the media establishment had no idea what to make of Sanders\u2019 Nevada victory. On MSNBC, James Carville <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryangrim/status/1231343189396803584\">said</a> that \u201cPutin\u201d had won Nevada, and Chris Matthews <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParkerMolloy/status/1231355532340006913\">declared</a> the primary \u201cover\u201d (ill-advisedly comparing Sanders\u2019 victory to the Nazi invasion of France). Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JRubinBlogger/status/1231363289483022336\">admitted</a> that Sanders had been stronger with nonwhite voters than she expected, and it might now be \u201ctoo late\u201d to do anything about him.</p> <p>The other candidates and their supporters did their best to spin a humiliating defeat. Amy Klobuchar said her sixth-place finish \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/curaffairs/status/1231374836087369730\">exceeded expectations</a>\u201d\u2014if sixth place is better than you expected, you\u2019re probably not a viable candidate. Biden vowed, implausibly (and for the third time) that he <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sanders-wins-nevada-but-biden-says-he-beats-him-by-just-moving-on\">would bounce back</a>. Pete Buttigieg <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pete-buttigieg-aims-to-take-down-bernie-sanders-inflexible-ideological-revolution-after-nevada-caucuses\">took to the stage</a> to denounce Sanders, who he said \u201cbelieves in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans.\u201d A Warren supporter rather charmingly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonOverstreet/status/1231314227865911296\">said</a> that while Sanders had won, Warren had the \u201cmomentum,\u201d and the Warren campaign itself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenBurgis/status/1231411371021082626\">said</a> the Nevada \u201cdebate\u201d mattered more than the Nevada \u201cresult.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: the other candidates were crushed, and Nevada was yet more evidence that there is no longer much serious opposition to Sanders. Michael Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/feb/19/debate-tonight-live-democratic-news-nevada-bernie-sanders-mike-bloomberg-latest\">fizzled completel</a>y in his big debut, and Democrats would be <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/02/why-does-anyone-think-michael-bloomberg-would-beat-donald-trump\">out of their minds</a> to enrage every Sanders supporter by nominating <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/02/why-does-anyone-think-michael-bloomberg-would-beat-donald-trump\">a Republican billionaire</a>. Joe Biden has lost badly in all of the first three contests, and it\u2019s very clear that he can\u2019t run an effective campaign.

      "bodyText": "It was a landslide. Bernie Sanders had been expected to win the Nevada caucuses, but not like this. With just 4% of the vote in, news organizations called the race for Sanders, since his margin of victory was so large. Sanders has now won the popular vote in all of the first three states, and is currently leading in the polls almost everywhere else in the country. He was already the favorite to take the nomination before the Nevada contest, with Democratic party insiders worrying he was \u201cunstoppable.\u201d His campaign will only grow more powerful now. Importantly, Sanders\u2019 Nevada victory definitively disproved one of the most enduring myths about his campaign: that it could attract left-leaning young white people, but was incapable of drawing in a diverse coalition. In fact, voters of color were a primary source of Sanders\u2019 strength in Nevada; he received the majority of Latino votes. Entrance polls showed Sanders winning \u201cmen and women, whites and Latinos, voters 17-29, 30-44 and 45-65, those with college degrees and those without, liberal Democrats (by a lot) and moderate/conservatives (narrowly), union and non-union households.\u201d The poisonous concept of the white \u201cBernie Bro\u201d as the \u201ctypical\u201d Sanders supporter should be dead. Some members of the media establishment had no idea what to make of Sanders\u2019 Nevada victory. On MSNBC, James Carville said that \u201cPutin\u201d had won Nevada, and Chris Matthews declared the primary \u201cover\u201d (ill-advisedly comparing Sanders\u2019 victory to the Nazi invasion of France). Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post admitted that Sanders had been stronger with nonwhite voters than she expected, and it might now be \u201ctoo late\u201d to do anything about him. The other candidates and their supporters did their best to spin a humiliating defeat. Amy Klobuchar said her sixth-place finish \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d\u2014if sixth place is better than you expected, you\u2019re probably not a viable candidate. Biden vowed, implausibly (and for the third time) that he would bounce back. Pete Buttigieg took to the stage to denounce Sanders, who he said \u201cbelieves in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans.\u201d A Warren supporter rather charmingly said that while Sanders had won, Warren had the \u201cmomentum,\u201d and the Warren campaign itself said the Nevada \u201cdebate\u201d mattered more than the Nevada \u201cresult.\u201d Let\u2019s be clear: the other candidates were crushed, and Nevada was yet more evidence that there is no longer much serious opposition to Sanders. Michael Bloomberg fizzled completely in his big debut, and Democrats would be out of their minds to enrage every Sanders supporter by nominating a Republican billionaire. Joe Biden has lost badly in all of the first three contests, and it\u2019s very clear that he can\u2019t run an effective campaign. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign has nearly gone broke and in desperation she has resorted to relying on the Super PACs that she previously shunned. Pete Buttigieg can\u2019t win voters of color or young people (and has accurately been described as sounding like \u201ca neural network trained on West Wing episodes\u201d).

He had already led a mob attempting to seize the Bank of England in 1816, but was acquitted at his trial for treason after the chief prosecution witness was exposed as an agent provocateur. After that he had tried to emigrate to the US but lacked the money for his fare.</p> <p>The government kept tabs on him, but he continued plotting, abandoning a plan to drop a bomb on the heads of MPs in the Commons chamber in 1819 as impractical.

      "bodyText": "Two hundred years ago, on 23 February 1820, a new sort of terrorism was foiled when police raided a backstreet stable loft in central London and caught men preparing to assassinate the entire British cabinet. The so-called Cato Street conspiracy has echoes in more modern outrages. At the time it terrified ministers in Lord Liverpool\u2019s Tory cabinet. But the overwhelming likelihood is that the real conspiracy was provoked and inspired by a spy in the pay of the government itself. As James Ings, one of the plotters, an unemployed butcher from Hampshire, claimed at his trial: \u201cThis man has been at all the meetings, he has planned and done everything \u2026 I am sold like a bullock driven into Smithfield market.\u201d The conspiracy was the culmination of a series of demonstrations and uprisings that arose from economic dislocation, high food prices, high unemployment and reduced wages following the Napoleonic wars. It came six months after the Peterloo massacre, when armed troops had broken up a peaceful meeting calling for political reform in Manchester, killing 18 people and injuring hundreds more. Some had already concluded that orderly demonstrations were not enough and that the government needed to be overthrown by force. Among them was Arthur Thistlewood, a 44-year-old Lincolnshire farmer\u2019s son, who had drifted to London and become involved in previous violent protests. He had already led a mob attempting to seize the Bank of England in 1816, but was acquitted at his trial for treason after the chief prosecution witness was exposed as an agent provocateur. After that he had tried to emigrate to the US but lacked the money for his fare. The government kept tabs on him, but he continued plotting, abandoning a plan to drop a bomb on the heads of MPs in the Commons chamber in 1819 as impractical. Now the death of King George III in January 1820 appeared to give him another chance. He believed troops would be deployed away from London to Windsor, to guard the unpopular new king, George IV. His trusted ally was George Edwards, who made plaster statuettes and formerly ran a shop in Eton High Street selling models of the school\u2019s hated headmaster, John Keate, to the pupils for target practice. Edwards showed Thistlewood a newspaper that said the entire cabinet would be meeting for dinner at the government minister Lord Harrowby\u2019s house in Grosvenor Square.

Voluminous wafting scarves are a key prop in the image and mythology of Isadora Duncan, the American pioneer of modern dance whose life was as free-spirited as her art. Durante is hoping to tap into some of that spirit in her latest production, honouring the unconventional dance icon.</p> <p>A leading ballerina with the Royal Ballet in the 1990s, 52-year-old Durante is returning to the stage in Isadora Now, the third outing for her own company. As well as Durante performing Frederick Ashton\u2019s Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan, there will be the rare sight of a 1911 Duncan work, Dance of the Furies, and a new piece by <a href=\"https://www.joyalpuertoritter.com/\">Joy Alpuerto Ritter</a>, recasting Duncan\u2019s freedom of expression and feminist power for current times.</p> <p>Duncan\u2019s flowing, full-bodied dance was a rejection of the restrictions of classical ballet, inspired by her love of ancient Greece and performed in the drawing rooms of the wealthy in London and Paris at the turn of the 20th century. She expressed spirituality and sensuality, and garnered ardent fans \u2013 Rodin called her \u201cthe greatest woman the world has ever known\u201d \u2013 as well as critics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f1f98e3fa0df9cd4bc74784a7b87b4f038100269\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1f98e3fa0df9cd4bc74784a7b87b4f038100269/0_0_2282_3010/758.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The greatest woman the world has known\u2019 \u2026 Isadora Duncan in the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens.\" width=\"758\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The greatest woman the world has known\u2019 \u2026 Isadora Duncan in the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Duncan/courtesy Jerome Robbins Dance Division/NYPL for the Performing Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe was very radical and very shocking,\u201d says Durante. \u201cShe had no inhibitions about showing or saying what she felt through her dance. And she wasn\u2019t afraid of the darkness of life.\u201d Duncan\u2019s own life held tragedy \u2013 the deaths of her children, two by drowning and a third soon after birth, then Duncan\u2019s own death in a freak accident aged 50 when her scarf got caught in the wheels of an open-top car.</p> <p>But Duncan\u2019s influence lives on, and in the studio her expressive abandon, grounded to the earth in bare feet, is proving tricky for Durante\u2019s petite, classically trained physique. Durante was always a passionate dancer, but within the refined context of ballet. \u201cI\u2019m trying but my feet are still in pointe shoes,\u201d she says, metaphorically. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my body yet!\u201d</p> <p>At her peak, Durante was one of the best in the world, and to any casual observer her dancing still looks exquisite, but in the studio she gives a commentary of criticisms and apologies, tough self-judgment being an ingrained part of any ballet dancer\u2019s makeup.

      "bodyText": "\u2018You\u2019ll have to excuse me, I\u2019m just trying to fight with this veil,\u201d says Viviana Durante, wrestling with an unwieldy sheet of coral silk as I walk into her studio. Voluminous wafting scarves are a key prop in the image and mythology of Isadora Duncan, the American pioneer of modern dance whose life was as free-spirited as her art. Durante is hoping to tap into some of that spirit in her latest production, honouring the unconventional dance icon. A leading ballerina with the Royal Ballet in the 1990s, 52-year-old Durante is returning to the stage in Isadora Now, the third outing for her own company. As well as Durante performing Frederick Ashton\u2019s Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan, there will be the rare sight of a 1911 Duncan work, Dance of the Furies, and a new piece by Joy Alpuerto Ritter, recasting Duncan\u2019s freedom of expression and feminist power for current times. Duncan\u2019s flowing, full-bodied dance was a rejection of the restrictions of classical ballet, inspired by her love of ancient Greece and performed in the drawing rooms of the wealthy in London and Paris at the turn of the 20th century. She expressed spirituality and sensuality, and garnered ardent fans \u2013 Rodin called her \u201cthe greatest woman the world has ever known\u201d \u2013 as well as critics. \u201cShe was very radical and very shocking,\u201d says Durante. \u201cShe had no inhibitions about showing or saying what she felt through her dance. And she wasn\u2019t afraid of the darkness of life.\u201d Duncan\u2019s own life held tragedy \u2013 the deaths of her children, two by drowning and a third soon after birth, then Duncan\u2019s own death in a freak accident aged 50 when her scarf got caught in the wheels of an open-top car. But Duncan\u2019s influence lives on, and in the studio her expressive abandon, grounded to the earth in bare feet, is proving tricky for Durante\u2019s petite, classically trained physique. Durante was always a passionate dancer, but within the refined context of ballet. \u201cI\u2019m trying but my feet are still in pointe shoes,\u201d she says, metaphorically. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my body yet!\u201d At her peak, Durante was one of the best in the world, and to any casual observer her dancing still looks exquisite, but in the studio she gives a commentary of criticisms and apologies, tough self-judgment being an ingrained part of any ballet dancer\u2019s makeup. Yet when we meet again a few months later in her dressing room at the Barbican, some of Duncan\u2019s essence has seeped in. \u201cI wish I\u2019d experienced this process back when I was dancing [at the Royal Ballet],\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not just learning the steps, it\u2019s much more like a spiritual journey that she takes you on.\u201d Immersing herself in Duncan\u2019s story has been a revelation for Durante. \u201cShe\u2019s taught me to love my skin, my body, who I am,\u201d she says. \u201cShe celebrated women.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>More than half of all South Korean cases so far have been linked to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus sect, with over 100 more cases coming from a mental health ward at Daenam hopital in the nearby town of Cheongdo.</p> \n<p>Officials believe cases at the hospital may be related to a funeral of the sect leader\u2019s brother, held there at the beginning of February.</p> \n<p>While the exact source of the infections remains unclear, health officials have pointed to a 61-year-old female member of the sect who tested positive on 18 February.

      "bodyText": "Sunday morning found Kim Tae-woo sitting in his convenience store at the normally bustling East Daegu train station, counting the day\u2019s customers on the fingers of one hand. \u201cThings are beyond quiet here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m at a meditation centre. I\u2019m thinking of removing the magazine stand. No one has the peace of mind to flip through them now.\u201d South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, placed the country on red alert on Sunday as its number of coronavirus infections tripled over the weekend to 602. Barring the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, South Korea now has the highest number of infections outside China. Residents of Daegu, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city and the centre of its outbreak, are leaving nothing to chance. The city\u2019s streets were eerily quiet, with stores and restaurants closed and stations, markets and shopping areas devoid of the usual foot traffic. The few people who dared to venture out were masked and wearing gloves. More than half of all South Korean cases so far have been linked to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus sect, with over 100 more cases coming from a mental health ward at Daenam hopital in the nearby town of Cheongdo. Officials believe cases at the hospital may be related to a funeral of the sect leader\u2019s brother, held there at the beginning of February. While the exact source of the infections remains unclear, health officials have pointed to a 61-year-old female member of the sect who tested positive on 18 February. Local authorities are now scrambling to trace all 9,336 members of the church\u2019s Daegu branch as well as out of town visitors who may have come into contact with the woman. A taxi driver, Kwang-ho Lee, wondered why the woman hadn\u2019t done more to stop spreading the disease. \u201cIt\u2019s ruining everyone here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m making less than 10% of my normal income. The other drivers and I are just standing around, waiting all day. Sometimes we\u2019re even too scared to talk to each other because we don\u2019t know who has the virus and who might belong to that cult.\u201d There is widespread anger over the sect\u2019s secretiveness and their apparent unwillingness to cooperate with health officials. According to the authorities, more than 600 members of the Daegu branch are not answering calls or texts and cannot be accounted for. A petition demanding that the government forcibly disband the Shincheonji Church of Jesus was posted on the presidential office\u2019s website on Friday, and has so far attracted more than 300,000 signatures. The public fury directed at both the sect and the authorities was echoed by a bus driver, whose vehicle carried a single passenger. \u201cIf I violate a traffic law, police contact me before the day is over and I get fined,\u201d he said. \u201cHow come they can\u2019t get hold of so many cult members? How can we say South Korea is an IT powerhouse with this going on?\u201d At Dongseung-ro, a popular meeting place for the city\u2019s youth, things were quiet and most of the stores and cafes were closed. Sung-jin Choi and Yoon Na, a couple in their twenties, had decided to go out, masked up and with gloves on. \u201cWe saw on the internet that now is the time to experience this area looking like Gotham City, so we decided to have a look,\u201d said Choi. Na said that some couples were choosing not to meet up because no one is sure whether their partner belonged to the cult. \u201cOnly couples who know each other very well can be sure,\u201d he added. One of the few places in Daegu where more than 20 people had congregated on Sunday was at the city\u2019s medical centre. The hospital has become a dedicated Covid-19 treatment centre, with paramedics and nurses working in full biohazard suits and plastic face visors. Some 30 people were waiting to be examined in a makeshift tent set up outside the main hospital building. Despite the constant activity by staffers, things were curiously quiet, the silence broken only by the comings and goings of ambulances and the odd cough. On the other side of the city, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus building was locked up and the area, as with other parts of Daegu, was deserted. Simon Kim, a spokesman for the church, said it was cooperating fully with authorities. \u201cWe\u2019re the biggest victims of the Covid-19 epidemic,\u201d he said, \u201c[and we have] become a target of hatred\u201d. He said a membership list the church had given the authorities had been leaked, provoking hate speech and members being pressured to leave their jobs. Back at the train station, a group of five people sat around the communal TV set in the ticket hall.

Spray some on to a tissue, and wipe the brush until there is no product coming out of it.</p> <p>To wash, use lukewarm water \u2013 if the water is too hot, it will destroy the glue and loosen the hairs \u2013 and shampoo or a good washing-up liquid. Point the brush with the hairs facing downwards, so the water doesn\u2019t run up into the brush. Lather up some shampoo and wash the bristles. When you rinse, squeeze until the water stops bubbling. Dry gently with a towel and dry them flat overnight.</p> <p>You can treat synthetic and natural brushes in the same way, as well as makeup sponges and powder puffs. With lip or foundation brushes, which can get covered in greasy makeup, get some oil \u2013 olive or baby oil is fine \u2013 and work a little bit through the dry brush.

When I\u2019m on a shoot, or out and about, I use a professional brush cleaner such as Parian Spirit, which is made from citrus and is environmentally friendly. It is also good if you are a bit lazy and don\u2019t want to shampoo your brushes. Spray some on to a tissue, and wipe the brush until there is no product coming out of it. To wash, use lukewarm water \u2013 if the water is too hot, it will destroy the glue and loosen the hairs \u2013 and shampoo or a good washing-up liquid. Point the brush with the hairs facing downwards, so the water doesn\u2019t run up into the brush. Lather up some shampoo and wash the bristles. When you rinse, squeeze until the water stops bubbling. Dry gently with a towel and dry them flat overnight. You can treat synthetic and natural brushes in the same way, as well as makeup sponges and powder puffs. With lip or foundation brushes, which can get covered in greasy makeup, get some oil \u2013 olive or baby oil is fine \u2013 and work a little bit through the dry brush. Then tissue it off to remove the grease, before shampooing it clean. Ellie Tobin is a makeup artist and tutor at the London College of Fashion",

      "bodyText": "So this tournament is brewing up nicely, another tight match to follow Friday\u2019s thrilling opener, and both groups have had a minor upset to throw things open. South Africa were worthy winners today, and look a real threat, while England need to just tighten up in the field a little and build better partnerships with the bat than they did today. Stay on the site for a match report from Raf Nicholson, and thanks for reading. Bye. Heather Knight speaks: \u201cI thought we started very well \u2013 Amy Jnes set the tone brilliantly \u2013 but those wickets towards the end of the power play really hurt us. We finished really well, Nat Sciver batted brilliantly and the lower-order camoes were good. The pitch not the quick Waca surface we expected and would have hoped for at least 140 or so. The captain has praise for her top scorer Sciver: \u201cShe\u2019s very crucual to us \u2013 she\u2019s become a real leader in this group of players so pleased to have her back, she\u2019s really taken responsibility. Long may it continue. We had to believe we\u2019d defend that total \u2013 we\u2019ve got the bowlers and character to do that and we set the tone outstandingly with Brunt and Shrubsole, Ecclestone was brilliant, Glenn really fought hard but they had that big partnership.\u201d Next up is Thailand on Wednesday. \u201cWe like playing at Canberra,\u201d chirps Knight, \u201cand we need to pick ourselves up, park this quickly and move on.\u201d Van Niekerk is named player of the match, after her two wickets and 46 runs. \u201cWe spoke a lot about our planning and preparation and it\u2019s nice when that comes together,\u201d says the South Africa captain. \u201cI have to give credit to our bowlers - Kapp, Khaka and Ismail \u2013 we couldn\u2019t have done it without them. It was a team performance. I just try and hit the stumps as much as possible and tried to stick to my game plan.\u201d As for her batting: \u201cHalfway there I felt a let the team down a bit \u2013 I was batting very slow and thank goodness I had the support I had and knowing we had the power in our batting lineup to win it.\u201d Du Preez speaks: \u201cI\u2019ve always had it in me to be a matchwinner for my team and to do it here on my 100th game is special. Won\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t nervous but it was time for me to step up. I\u2019ve played in all seven World Cups and never come this close, so I think this can be the start of something we can go all the way and bring the trophy home South Africa are going to be a force in this tournament \u2013 having won their trickiest game, you\u2019d fancy them to win the group now, given the way they managed this win. They were better than England in every aspect of the game today, not by much, but by the amount that counts. An England fan\u2019s rueful thought: 19.4 overs: South Africa 127-4 (Du Preez 22, Luus 1), target 124: Knight brings the field in, but to no avail \u2013 a low full toss is clobbered over midwicket to the ropes for the winning four. On her 100th cap, Du Preez has won it for South Africa. 19.3 overs: South Africa 123-4 (Du Preez 18, Luus 1), target 124: After a mankad warning to Luus fro Brunt, a hoik over deep square leg for SIX for Du Preez. South Africa need only one. 19.2 overs: South Africa 117-4 (Du Preez 12, Luus 1), target 124: Another good ball angled in, another scampered single. 19.1 overs: South Africa 116-4 (Du Preez 12, Luus 0), target 124: Brunt bowls beautifully into the slot but it\u2019s dug out for one. 19th over: South Africa 115-4 (Du Preez 11), target 124: Ecclestone appeals for an lbw first off, as they run two leg-byes and England review. But no dice, it\u2019s spearing down the legside. Another mistimed slog lands safely, bringing Du Preez one more, and this is maddening for England because Ecclestone\u2019s bowled well. It gets even more maddening when Tryon finally gets hold of one and wallops it over the midwicket boundary for SIX; and the frustration goes off the scale when Jones fumbles a stumping chance before Ecclestone FINALLY gets the wicket she deserves with a quicker ball that Tryon hoiks at and misses, and middle stump is disturbed. Time to go ball by ball \u2026 18th over: South Africa 105-3 (Tryon 5, Du Preez 10), target 124: Agony for England, relief for South Africa as Sciver spears one into a shuffling Du Preez; she misses, the keeper misses and it goes for four byes behind her. Tryon adds four more with a mis-timed top-edge hook to the fine leg boundary. Then \u2013 A BIG DROP! Du Preez hoiks across the line and Winfield at long-on is late onto it and spills it low by her ankles. Two more follow from another mistimed slog that lands safely. Has the pendulum swung again? Nineteen needed off two. 17th over: South Africa 91-3 (Tryon 0, Du Preez 1), target 124: As happened in England\u2019s innings, both protagonists in a potent partnership fall in swift succession, Van Niekerk being snared by Ecclestone. Du Preez, in her 100th T20 international, gets off the mark third ball but suddenly the Proteas are becalmed and neither of these formidable batters can work Ecclestone away during an excellent, excellent over. Game very much on \u2013 33 needed from three. The South Africa captain slices a backfoot cut off Ecclestone to Tammy Beaumont at backward point and England have broken their opponents open at last. Is it too late? 16th over: South Africa 90-2 (Van Niekerk 46, Tryon 0), target 124: South Africa up the tempo some more, Van Niekerk cracking Glenn over the top on the offside for four more. But Glenn makes amends with a sharp caught and bowled induced from Kapp to end a long partnership. In comes the big-hitting Tryon who can\u2019t work the bowler away for her first two balls faced. Glenn ends with one for 26 from four overs, the last of which was her best. At last! Glenn deceives Kapp with a bit of extra bounce and she clips a return to the bowler. 15th over: South Africa 85-1 (Van Niekerk 41, Kapp 38), target 124: Shrubsole, England\u2019s sole wicket-taker, is brought back for her final over as Chloe Tryon warms up menacingly with some air shots by the dug-out. A frustrated Van Niekerk lashes out with a slog towards deep midwicket \u2013 it lands safely but it wasn\u2019t a convincing shot, bringing only one rather than the six intended. But practice makes perfect, and Van Kiekerk does get the six she and her team need when she steps to offer and hoiks to leg. Suddenly, South Africa are firm favourites: 39 needed from 30 balls. 14th over: South Africa 74-1 (Van Niekerk 32, Kapp 36), target 124: Sciver replaces Glenn, and Fran Wilson prevents a Kapp four with an excellent sprawling stop on the square leg boundary. England are keeping themselves in the game here with some generally accurate bowling but they need to break this partnership, at the risk of stating the screamingly obvious. Fewer misfields, such as the one that gifts a single off the last ball of this over, would also help. Analysis, there. 13th over: South Africa 70-1 (Van Niekerk 30, Kapp 34), target 124: Of course, much has been made in the buildup to the tournament of the danger of finishing second in this group and thus having to face Australia in the semi-final but India\u2019s win on Friday has put the cat among the pigeons somewhat. But if England were to lose this, they\u2019d be under serious pressure against West Indies. Anyway, Brunt returns, canny and economical, yielding four singles. She\u2019s conceded only 11 from her three overs so far. 12th over: South Africa 66-1 (Van Niekerk 28, Kapp 32), target 124: Kapp finds the gap (which rhymes agreeably), as Glenn drops just a fraction short outside off and is cracked off the back foot past backward point for four. She\u2019s fairly on the money for the rest of the over but the breakthrough still eludes England. 11th over: South Africa 58-1 (Van Niekerk 26, Kapp 26), target 124: Ecclestone returns and the South Africans continue to just push and nudge it around for singles, this pair bringing up the 50 partnership. It\u2019s a pretty tidy over but wicketless ones will worry England. Sixty-six needed from nine. 10th over: South Africa 54-1 (Van Niekerk 24, Kapp 24), target 124: Glenn continues and keeps things pretty tight, conceding three singles before getting four off the final ball of the over as a diving Brunt fails to cut off the square drive on the offside. There\u2019s been a little too much of that from England, and South Africa are four ahead of what England were at this stage, having lost two fewer wickets. 9th over: South Africa 47-1 (Van Niekerk 22, Kapp 19), target 124: England shuffle their bowling pack again and bring back Sciver, who\u2019s belted over mid-on for four by Kapp, who helps the following ball round the corner for a single. Sciver just loses a little control by digging one in too short and wide, which is called as such to add one to the total. I\u2019d have kept Ecclestone on for another over at this juncture, I think. 8th over: South Africa 38-1 (Van Niekerk 20, Kapp 13), target 124: The leg-spinner Sarah Glenn gets her first ever World T20 bowl, conceding a lofted two, a couple of singles and a scrambled two from a creditable first over. England could do with a wicket though. 7th over: South Africa 32-1 (Van Niekerk 15, Kapp 12), target 124: Spin, for the first time, as Ecclestone comes on for Shrubsole. There\u2019s not much turn but there is decent bounce \u2013 and a wide, a push for a single, are all South Africa can muster until a glance down to third man brings four for Kapp. England can\u2019t afford to concede those but they\u2019re still very much in this. 6th over: South Africa 26-1 (Van Niekerk 14, Kapp 8), target 124: Brunt comes back, having bowled an excellent first over, and gets a good back-of-a-length stifling thing going with Van Niekerk, who\u2019d threatened to cut loose the previous over. Everyone\u2019s up on the offside too, which is shrewd use of the final powerplay over. A nudge off the hips for a single is all the captain can muster before Kapp unfurls a gorgeous cover drive for four off the final ball of the over. 5th over: South Africa 21-1 (Van Niekerk 13, Kapp 4), target 124: England opt to keep Shrubsole on for now, and Van Niekerk opts to go big, smiting a magnificent SIX, 78 metres and high over the ropes at deep midwicket. A bottom-edged mow along the ground in the same area brings four more and South Africa are motoring at last. Good use of the inswing from the Proteas captain. 4th over: South Africa 10-1 (Van Niekerk 2, Kapp 4), target 124: Sciver comes on for Brunt, and continues where the latter left off with a tight, straight line and challenging length. Five dot balls are her reward, inducing desperation from Kapp off the sixth ball of the over, a mistimed lofted on-drive being slightly misjudged in the deep and just clearing Winfield\u2019s head and trickling to the boundary. She got her fingertips to it, which makes it technically a drop and, who knows, a 50p fine or something. 3rd over: South Africa 6-1 (Van Niekerk 2, Kapp 0), target 124: This is way too reckless from South Africa at this stage. Van Niekerk absolutely chucks the kitchen sink, and perhaps the upstairs shower unit as well, at the first ball of Shrubsole\u2019s over, slicing down to deep backward point but getting away with it. Lee doesn\u2019t though, dollying up the simplest of chances to Winfield with an ill-advised lofted on-drive attempt. This has been an excellent response from England\u2019s seamers so far. Shrubsole gets Lee for a fifth time, inducing a misjudge slog straight to Winfield at mid-on 2nd over: South Africa 5-0 (Lee 4, Van Niekerk 1), target 124: Brunt opens up at the other end and, like Shrubsole, finds plenty of movement in the Perth night air, swinging away from the right-handed Lee, who adds a single with a leg-glance when the bowler strays down legside. Brunt produces one of the balls of the day to beat Lee outside off-stump with a perfect teasing length and then has a big lbw shout following an attempted yorker but it had flicked bat as well as pad. A fine over though. 1st over: South Africa 3-0 (Lee 3, Van Niekerk 0), target 124: South Africa open with a fearsome pair of hitters in Lee and Van Niekerk, England toss the new ball to the seasoned campaigner Shrubsole, who finds some probing inswing from the off, as you\u2019d expect/hope from her. Lee isn\u2019t hanging about, mind, and slogs the second ball high and far and perilously close to Winfield at long-off but it drops short and they run two. It\u2019s a very good opening over and needs to be \u2013 England don\u2019t have a lot to play with here. Innings break reading: South Africa\u2019s women look in decent shape so far, but their men have had a bit of a shocker against Australia: And in case you missed it, Geoff Lemon\u2019s tournament scene-setter: That was an excellent bowling performance from South Africa, their impressive attack more than living up to expectations. And England will really have to be at their unyielding, aggressive best to win this. India managed it the other day bowling second, with aplomb, and England need to learn from that. 20th over: England 123-8 ( Ecclestone 1, Shrubsole 3) Kapp gets the final over and Beaumont shows her class with a brilliantly placed lofted flick to leg for four. Kapp\u2019s comeback is excellent and she snares her lbw, a decision confirmed after Beaumont reviews. England can only dig out two singles off the next two balls \u2013 excellent death bowling from Kapp \u2013 before Shrubsole larrups the final ball of the innings high towards but short of long-on, and they\u2019re able to run two. Kapp ends with figures of two for 19. Kapp gets Beaumont lbw after the batter misses an attempted swipe to leg. The umpire\u2019s finger goes up, Beaumont reviews, to no avail \u2013 it was hitting the top of off. 19th over: England 115-7 (Beaumont 5, Winfield 1) A vital wicket for South Africa as Khaka dismisses Sciver with a slow cutter. Winfield, trying to restore momentum, almost holes out to long-on but the ball drops short. Beaumont then ramps it up \u2013 literally \u2013 by scooping over the keeper\u2019s head for four. She\u2019s a handy person to have coming in at No 7. But she loses Winfield at the other end, whose fine sweep is taken at leg slip by Tryon. Advantage back to South Africa now! A magnificent slower ball from Khaka foxes Sciver and takes her off stump out after a swing and a miss. 18th over: England 109-5 (Sciver 50, Beaumont 0) Ismail is given her last over at this point as South Africa look to break this partnership and she should have had a run out to celebrate straight away but Chetty fumbles a difficult take from a too-low throw from Kapp in the deep. Then Brunt digs out a really fine slower ball and sends it to the ropes with a brilliant on-drive. But the fun doesn\u2019t last and she perishes next ball. They crossed, so Sciver faces the next ball which she nudges fine to the boundary for four and then clips a single to reach a terrific half-century. Ismail ends with 1-26 from four. More good bowling from Ismail, besting Brunt for pace and bounce and inducing an awkward slogged square cut that goes up but not far enough and Khaka takes at deep backward point. 17th over: England 98-4 (Sciver 45, Brunt 3) Lovely, clever cricket from Sciver as she advances to Khaka and just helps the ball over the top of the keeper with a superb ramp shot for four. An eagerly-run two ensues. A mow in front of square on the leg brings two more. Life comes at you fast in T20 and there\u2019s a sense England have got themselves right back in the game in these past two overs. 16th over: England 88-4 (Sciver 36, Brunt 2) At last, England unshackle themselves as Sciver swipes Mlaba over the ropes for a timely SIX. After an easy single, her partner, Brunt, misses a drive but scampers a leg-bye to give the strike back to Sciver, who expertly finds the gap at wide long-on for another four. England might be behind the game here but they\u2019ll be glad to have these two, particularly Sciver, out there at the minute. Though Brunt is well bamboozled by Mlaba last ball, swiping and missing. 15th over: England 75-4 (Sciver 24, Brunt 2) Van Niekerk completes her allocation of overs with another decent display of middle-overs bowling. And, frustrated, England lose a wicket as Wilson holes out desperately. Brunt, who can be handy at this stage of an innings, is sent out at No 6 and is off the mark with a scoop over the keeper\u2019s head. The Proteas\u2019 captain ends with figures of two for 20 from four. Wilson tries to go over the top but her high on-drive is snapped up by Ismail who takes her second catch of the match. 14th over: England 69-3 (Sciver 21, Wilson 12) South Africa give Ismail a third over, and are rewarded with more accurate parsimony, mostly just back of a length but never wayward and England can\u2019t break the chains. Three singles from the over. There hasn\u2019t been a boundary since the 10th. 13th over: England 66-3 (Sciver 19, Wilson 12) The canny Van Niekerk continues, and continues to keep England on a leash at a time when they really need to start finding or clearing the ropes. That they can\u2019t is testament to smart field placing on the legside in particular, though Wilson manages a two from the fifth ball of the over.This pair have been together for five overs now and probably nee 12th over: England 60-3 (Sciver 17, Wilson 8) The effervescent Ismail comes back into the attack, beating Sciver for pace outside off stump and then inducing a slightly mistimed pull for one thanks to the pace she generates off the surface. She mixes up her pace too to keep the batters guessing \u2013 and South Africa on top. Terrific bowling. 11th over: England 56-3 (Sciver 15, Wilson 6) A bit of a middle-overs-meander vibe (ask your grandad) about England\u2019s run rate at the moment, leisurely singles but not a lot more. Four singles and a hastily scrambled two, which requires confirmation from the TV umpire that Sciver was in, from Van Niekerk\u2019s over. 10th over: England 50-3 (Sciver 13, Wilson 2) Wilson misses a reverse sweep that might have been called wide, but isn\u2019t, then misses a conventional sweep that prompts an unconvincing lbw shout from Mlaba, the bowler. And then misses a slog that the keeper, Chetty, can\u2019t convert into a stumping, though they send it upstairs for a check. She finally connects and scores a run with \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a reverse sweep. Sciver, upon whom much now depends, then shows the way by blootering a low full toss to the long-on boundary for four. 9th over: England 45-3 (Sciver 9, Wilson 1) The captain, Van Niekerk, brings herself and her right-arm spin on, and it pays off second ball thanks to Ismail\u2019s superb catch in the deep. A reverse paddle for one gets Wilson off the mark, but it\u2019s one of only two runs from the over. Excellent catch. Knight loft the spinner Van Niekerk down the ground, it looks boundary bound but Ismail darts in from long-on to take it low and on the run. Another big scalp for the Proteas. 8th over: England 43-2 (Sciver 8, Knight 6) The spinner Mlaba returns from the opposite end to where she opened the innings, and Knight paddles her first ball fine on the leg side for one. They\u2019re getting them in ones at the moment, as the left-armer tucks them up, and England must be content with an over of five singles. Gaps are no longer being found and South Africa look hungry in the field. 7th over: England 38-2 (Sciver 6, Knight 3) Khaka continues, swinging into the right-handers to decent effect. Knight clips a single before Sciver, as she can do, takes advantage of a rare overpitched ball, lunging forward and belting it on the full straight past the bowler for a rare (of late) four. 6th over: England 31-2 (Sciver 1, Knight 1) Kapp is given a third over on the bounce, and Sciver is off the mark with a nudge off her hips. Knight gets on the scoreboard too with a high square cut for another single. Kapp is giving a becalmed England very little to work with here, though she does stray down the legside for a wide, generally hitting that off-stump corridor just back of a length, and the dot balls pile up. SA very much on top at the moment. As Nasser in the commentary box says, 31-2 is low off a powerplay at this ground. 5th over: England 28-2 (Sciver 0, Knight 0) Ayabonga Khaka replaces Ismail and strikes first ball, Wyatt bunting it on the full to Lee at backward point. Kaka doesn\u2019t have the pace of Ismail and Kapp but gets swing in the air, and forces the captain, Knight, to be watchful, which she needs to be for a bit after that double blow. This is a good over from the 27-year-old. Both openers gone now. Wyatt lazily slashes Kaka\u2019s indifferent first ball to Lee who takes a low catch. 4th over: England 26-1 (Wyatt 2, Sciver 0) Good bowling from Kapp who cramps up an advancing Jones with a slightly shorter one, though the opening batter still manages to nudge it round the corner for one. Wyatt, facing only her second ball, makes it two from two with a quick single. Good fielding in the deep then prevents two becoming three for Jones, who then perishes with an ill-advised thwack. England send out Nat Sciver next, who runs a quick single off the last ball of a good over. They\u2019re playing some decent between-overs, between-balls music on the PA here (if you like that sort of thing) - Talking Heads, Human League, Abba, Dizzy Rascal. Although time and a place and all that. Jones\u2019s first bad bit of cricket is punished, trying to loft a back of a lenghth ball that wasn\u2019t really loftable and scooping up towards extra cover where Tryon takes a comfortable catch. Big scalp for South Africa as Jones had been playing beautifully 3rd over: England 21-0 (Jones 20, Wyatt 1) Ismail comes into the attack, having been spurned for the first over, and Wyatt drives the first ball she\u2019s faced so far for a single, before Jones punctures the infield again with a magnificent back-foot push for four. Two more follow when Jones doesn\u2019t quite get hold of a short one and pulls it past mid-on. Another slightly mistimed pull brings another single, Ismail digging it in short in general here. \u201cThis World Cup has been a treat to follow so far,\u201d trills our old friend Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cThe emotions, the debutants, the excellent atmosphere, and the close finishes have all made for an exceptional start to the tournament. The women\u2019s game has grown exponentially since the 50-over event in 2017. Matches such as these only improve their appeal. Hopefully the momentum continues today, and we\u2019re treated to another thriller.\u201d 2nd over: England 13-0 (Jones 13, Wyatt 0) Getting a bit blowy out there, as is the custom, and South Africa opt for pace at the other end, Kapp swinging a ripper past Jones\u2019s outside edge to introduce herself using the breeze and the seam expertly. She\u2019s got 77 T20i caps for a reason. But Jones finds the boundary with her fourth ball, adeptly finding the gap between midwicket and mid-on with a deliciously timed clip. A good-cricket-all-round kind of over. Four runs, five dots. 1st over: England 9-0 (Jones 9, Wyatt 0) There\u2019s a good and noisy South Africa following in as Mlaba, the left-arm spinner, is surprisingly tossed the new ball and England opt for their conventional opening pair of Jones, who plays here in the WBBL, and Wyatt. Mlaba is accurate, tossing it up and into the slot, and gets two dots to start with before Jones leathers a full toss past mid-off for four. Jones is even classier next ball, advancing and lofting over mid-off for four more. Good confident start from a good confident batter. The players are out, and the anthems are a-playin\u2019 Can\u2019t resist giving this tweet an airing \u2013 good work from the travelling faithful: This is the third match on this pitch in two days, though as Hazel Potter points out, that\u2019s under 80 overs in total, so we\u2019re still talking about a first-day surface in old money. The chasing team won both yesterday\u2019s matches of course. They line up thusly: England Amy Jones, Danni Wyatt, Natalie Sciver, Heather Knight, Fran Wilson, Katherine Brunt, Tammy Beaumont, Lauren Winfield, Anya Shrubsole, Sophie Ecclestone, Sarah Glenn South Africa Lizelle Lee, Laura Wolvaardt, Marizanne Kapp, Dane van Niekerk, Mignon du Preez, Chloe Tryon, Sune Luus, Trisha Chetty, Shabnim Ismail, Ayabonga Khaka, Nonkululeko Mlaba Dane van de Niekerk reckons defending here in the BBL was a bit tricky, so would rather chase. Heather Knight says she\u2019d have done likewise. She says the team have sat down and regrouped since the Ashes under a new coach and with new younger players and is looking forward to show the work the team have done. Yesterday\u2019s match in this group, also at the Waca, saw West Indies eventually cruise to a seven-wicket victory over Thailand, while the same venue also hosted an eventually comfortable win by the same margin for New Zealand over the Sri Lanka side that eviscerated England in a warm-up last week. And while we\u2019re waiting for the toss, have yourselves an Anya Shrubsole interview: Morning/evening everyone, and welcome to what is likely to be the pivotal fixture in Group B. An England side in transition and under new management, in the form of coach Lisa Keightley, but still boasting plenty of big tournament experience, take on a South Africa team with a historically poor record in this competition but who are improving and are certainly capable of mounting a challenge this time. England had a bit of a chastening past year, having been well beaten in the Ashes last English summer and edged out of the recent Tri Series by Australia and India, but you\u2019d still fancy them to make the final, with a fair wind. Talking of wind, that brings us to Perth and the fact today\u2019s match is being played at the dear old Waca, fabled fast bowlers\u2019 paradise of yore, though it might be in the spin department that England are currently strongest, with Sophie Ecclestone a serious threat and a relative dearth of seam options behind Anya Shrubsole and Katherine Brunt. South Africa have progressed from their group only once in this competiton\u2019s 11-year history but boast plenty of BBL experience in their ranks, which can count for a lot here. Pace bowlers Marizanne Kapp and Shabnim Ismail are capable of giving England the hurry-up and Lizelle Lee, who has 1,434 T20i runs to her name at a strike rate of 107 will threaten at the top of the order. Toss is in 10 minutes or so. Bring it, as they say, on.",

He insisted his wife had performed an essential working role in his constituency in Sarthe, in north-west France, for which she was reportedly paid an average of \u20ac3,000 per month and sometimes up to \u20ac5,200.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the beginning, we worked together \u2026 proof of this will be shown during the trial,\u201d Fillon insisted.</p> <p>He said the confusion had come about because the interview his wife had given in 2007 was in English and that she had been circumspect about her role.</p> <p>\u201cThe word \u2018assistant\u2019 has another meaning in English than in French,\u201d he said, adding his wife had always been \u201cdiscreet\u201d and \u201cshy\u201d.</p> <p>Prosecutors have thrown doubt on his claims, reporting that investigations suggest Mrs Fillon may have dealt with her husband\u2019s post and emails but was not his parliamentary assistant when she was paid a total of around \u20ac1m between 1998 and 2013.</p> <p>A third suspect, Marc Jouland, 62, who took over the Sarthe constituency as a member of the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale when Fillon became a cabinet minister and reportedly continued to employ Penelope Fillon as his \u201cassistant\u201d, will also stand trial on charges of embezzlement. He also denies the accusations.</p> <p>Mrs Fillon, n\u00e9e Clarke, from Llanover near Abergavenny in Wales, is accused of complicity to misuse public funds. She is also under investigation for being paid for an allegedly \u201cfake\u201d job at a French language monthly literary, cultural and political affairs magazine, Revue des Deux Mondes.</p> <p>In last month\u2019s interview, Fillon, whose disgrace left the mainstream right Les R\u00e9publicains party in disarray, ruled out making a political comeback. He said he was speaking to defend his family\u2019s honour. His wife, with whom he has five children, is a candidate at the nationwide municipal elections for her local council, scheduled to be held next month.</p> <p>The trial opens on Monday in Paris and is expected to last until 11 March. Fillon faces up to 10 years in prison and a \u20ac1m fine if convicted of misusing public funds.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former French presidential hopeful Fran\u00e7ois Fillon will stand trial for embezzlement in the aftermath of a \u201cfake jobs\u201d scandal that destroyed his political career. Fillon, 65, who was on track to lead France in 2017, will appear in court with his Welsh-born wife, Penelope. They will deny accusations of misusing more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3840,000) of state money to pay Mrs Fillon in an allegedly non-existent role as the presidential candidate\u2019s parliamentary assistant. The claims left Fillon\u2019s political hopes and a public career spanning 35 years in tatters, changing the course of French politics. In early 2017, the centre-right former prime minister was the clear favourite to win the race to lead France, when the satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchain\u00e9 questioned payments made to his wife out of public funds. After Fillon claimed she had worked as his assistant, the investigative programme Envoy\u00e9 Special uncovered an interview Mrs Fillon, 64, gave to the Sunday Telegraph in 2007 in which, asked whether she worked with or for her husband, she had replied: \u201cI have never actually been his assistant or anything like that.\u201d The accusations, which became known as \u201cPenelopegate\u201d, were especially damaging as Fillon had campaigned as the clean-hands candidate who had never been embroiled in any wrongdoing or political scandal. Fillon, who served as prime minister under the centre-right president Nicolas Sarkozy, tried to outrun the scandal, refusing to abandon his campaign but was eliminated in the first round of the presidential election, leaving the mainstream right without a candidate in the second round for the first time in France\u2019s postwar history. Emmanuel Macron, a little-known former economy minister and banker, stepped into the political vacuum to face the far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the second round run-off. Fillon, now working for an investment bank, has kept a low profile until last month when he gave a pre-trial television interview. He insisted his wife had performed an essential working role in his constituency in Sarthe, in north-west France, for which she was reportedly paid an average of \u20ac3,000 per month and sometimes up to \u20ac5,200. \u201cFrom the beginning, we worked together \u2026 proof of this will be shown during the trial,\u201d Fillon insisted. He said the confusion had come about because the interview his wife had given in 2007 was in English and that she had been circumspect about her role. \u201cThe word \u2018assistant\u2019 has another meaning in English than in French,\u201d he said, adding his wife had always been \u201cdiscreet\u201d and \u201cshy\u201d. Prosecutors have thrown doubt on his claims, reporting that investigations suggest Mrs Fillon may have dealt with her husband\u2019s post and emails but was not his parliamentary assistant when she was paid a total of around \u20ac1m between 1998 and 2013. A third suspect, Marc Jouland, 62, who took over the Sarthe constituency as a member of the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale when Fillon became a cabinet minister and reportedly continued to employ Penelope Fillon as his \u201cassistant\u201d, will also stand trial on charges of embezzlement. He also denies the accusations. Mrs Fillon, n\u00e9e Clarke, from Llanover near Abergavenny in Wales, is accused of complicity to misuse public funds. She is also under investigation for being paid for an allegedly \u201cfake\u201d job at a French language monthly literary, cultural and political affairs magazine, Revue des Deux Mondes. In last month\u2019s interview, Fillon, whose disgrace left the mainstream right Les R\u00e9publicains party in disarray, ruled out making a political comeback. He said he was speaking to defend his family\u2019s honour. His wife, with whom he has five children, is a candidate at the nationwide municipal elections for her local council, scheduled to be held next month. The trial opens on Monday in Paris and is expected to last until 11 March. Fillon faces up to 10 years in prison and a \u20ac1m fine if convicted of misusing public funds.",

      "body": "<p>Zara Steiner, who has died aged 91, was the world\u2019s leading historian of international relations in Europe between the wars. Her two massive and magisterial volumes in the Oxford History of Modern Europe, The Lights That Failed (2005) and The Triumph of the Dark (2011), remain the standard works on the doomed quest of European states for a stable new international order in the 1920s, and the gathering clouds of the 30s, leading to the outbreak of the second world war towards the end of the decade.</p> <p>The two books are as impressive in their breadth as they are in their depth, covering economic developments and relations, arms production, diplomatic negotiations, politics and war, with equal authority. Over more than 2,000 pages, based on a secure command of the scholarly literature and documentation in several languages, the two volumes convey complex sequences of events with limpid clarity. Brilliantly written, full of pungent judgments, arresting phrases and sarcastic asides, they are also a joy to read.</p> <p>No student of the period can afford to ignore them and it is something of an indictment of the insularity of so many British historians today that so much recent work on \u201cappeasement\u201d, and the origins of the second world war, much to its detriment, unfortunately does. Zara\u2019s criticism of Chamberlain, Eden and Halifax, hopelessly out of their depth in the brutal world of the dictators, is unanswerable. In researching European international history between the wars, she remarked, she had encountered \u201cfew heroes, two evil Titans and an assortment of villains and knaves. I have not enjoyed their company.\u201d</p> <p>Born in New York, the daughter of Joseph Shakow, who ran a shop that sold outdoor clothing and supplies to polar explorers, and his wife, Frances (nee Price), Zara showed early academic promise and studied history at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1948. She then took a history degree at Oxford University in two years instead of the usual three, benefiting from being tutored by luminaries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/09/historybooks.royhattersley\" title=\"\">A</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/09/historybooks.royhattersley\" title=\"\">J</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/09/historybooks.royhattersley\" title=\"\">P</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/09/historybooks.royhattersley\" title=\"\"> Taylor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/16/isaiah-berlin-letters-modern-youth\" title=\"\">Isaiah Berlin</a>.</p> <p>But when she asked Taylor if he would take her on as a doctoral student, he told her that the PhD was a German invention that the Americans had bastardised and was not worth pursuing. So in 1950 she relocated to Harvard, where she completed a doctorate, graduating in 1957.</p> <p>In 1955 she married a fellow Harvard graduate, the comparative literature scholar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/george-steiner-obituary\" title=\"\">George Steiner</a>, whom she had met in London, where she was conducting research for her doctoral dissertation and he was working for the Economist. They were introduced by their respective Harvard professors, who knew them both, obviously discussed them a great deal, and bet each other that the two would get married if they ever met.</p> <p>On receiving postcards from the professors urging each of them to \u201cbe a sport\u201d, George and Zara met for tea and agreed at the start that they would send them their own postcard saying \u201cyou lose the bet\u201d. At the end of the afternoon, however, they agreed not to send it after all. Their marriage lasted for more than 60 years, with Zara, among other things an excellent cook and dinner-party hostess, her skills complemented by George\u2019s taste in wine, providing a base of stability for her mercurial husband.</p> <p>Neither marriage to a man noted for his restlessness, nor the birth of two children, respectively in 1958 and 1960, took her away from her writing and research. Her first major book, The Foreign Office and Foreign Policy, 1898-1914, published in 1969, laid bare the complex interactions between ministers, officials and ingrained diplomatic practice and tradition that helped shape Britain\u2019s part in the origins of the first world war. It was followed in 1977 by the wider ranging Britain and the Origins of the First World War, commissioned for a series of short books on \u201cthe making of the 20th century\u201d published by Macmillan.</p> <p>Already in these volumes Zara was broadening out the concept of diplomatic history to reflect developments in international relations theory and include the impact of public opinion, economic interest, the press, and, above all, the input of civil servants. She journeyed up and down the land, examining the private papers of Foreign Office mandarins, buried in dusty files no other scholar had seen, looking for \u201cthe men behind the minutes\u201d, as she called them.</p> <p>On occasion her discoveries could spring surprises: at Sissinghurst, going through the private papers of the diplomat Harold Nicolson, she came across the love letters of his wife, Vita Sackville-West, to Violet Trefusis, and felt obliged to tell her host, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/sep/24/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Nigel Nicolson</a>, of their very intimate contents, promising him she would not make use of them. Nicolson said nothing, but later made good use of them for his revealing book about his parents, Portrait of a Marriage.</p> <p>The success of her first two books prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/feb/03/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Alan Bullock</a> to ask her to write the Oxford History of Modern Europe volume on international relations following on from Taylor\u2019s classic work The Struggle for Mastery in Europe. It was a testimony to Zara\u2019s scholarship that the project eventually expanded into two volumes, and took nearly 30 years to research and write \u2013 though in the early years she also had to carry out the demanding task of editing The Times Survey of Foreign Ministries of the World, a major scholarly undertaking, involving scores of historians and published in 1982.</p> <p>The thoroughness of her research for the Oxford volumes was staggering. On one occasion when the Yale historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/feb/05/academicexperts.highereducationprofile\" title=\"\">Paul Kennedy</a> visited her, he found her \u201cwriting-room bursting, overflowing with papers, articles, tagged books, copies of \u2018an important new dissertation\u2019 on France and the Bulgarians, etc\u201d. She seemed to have read almost everything that had been written on the numerous topics her books covered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/03/zara-steiner-obituary-letter\">Letter: Zara Steiner obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After spending time in Princeton and then Innsbruck, Austria, following George from one job to another, she eventually settled with the family in Cambridge, and in 1968 was elected a fellow of New Hall (a women-only institution, later renamed <a href=\"https://www.murrayedwards.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Murray Edwards College</a>), where she remained, tutoring undergraduates while continuing with her research. She took a leading role in the college\u2019s management, serving as acting president in 1995-96. She offered encouragement to her female students, not only in their academic endeavours but also more generally; many of them remember her with great affection.</p> <p>From the very beginning of her career, Zara was a woman in a man\u2019s world. When she arrived in Oxford in 1948, one of her (male) tutors initially refused to take her on. \u201cI don\u2019t tutor women,\u201d he said. \u201cJust call me sir,\u201d was her reply; and so he did, from then on. As a professional historian, she became part of the male-dominated realm of diplomatic and international relations history.</p> <p>Her volumes in the Oxford History of Modern Europe are the only ones in that series to have been written by a woman; and at a conference she organised in Cambridge in 1989 with officials and diplomats from 20 countries, when she led a discussion on the career difficulties faced by female diplomats, one official told her bluntly: \u201cIn my country, we have no such problems. We just do not let women into the foreign service.\u201d A retired British diplomat whom she interviewed greeted her with the comment: \u201cAn American, a woman and a Jew writing about the Foreign Office? It should not be allowed.\u201d</p> <p>In Cambridge, unlike in Oxford, the colleges are entirely separate from the university and its faculties. Although Zara was one of Cambridge\u2019s most distinguished historians, she never gained an official position in the history faculty, just as, for very different reasons, her husband George never secured an appointment in the English faculty. She remained for the rest of her career just a fellow, then emeritus fellow, of New Hall, and so never acquired the professorial title she so richly merited. Already by the 80s, diplomatic history was going out of fashion, and she was an outsider to the university in more ways than one.</p> <p>It was not until 2007 that she was elected a fellow of the British Academy. But around the world, she was recognised as a great historian, author of a string of important and durable works of scholarship and, not least, a role model for younger female academics.</p> <p>George predeceased her by 10 days. She is survived by their children, David and Deborah, and two granddaughters.</p> <p>\u2022 Zara Alice Steiner, historian, born 6 November 1928; died 13 February 2020</p>",

Zara\u2019s criticism of Chamberlain, Eden and Halifax, hopelessly out of their depth in the brutal world of the dictators, is unanswerable. In researching European international history between the wars, she remarked, she had encountered \u201cfew heroes, two evil Titans and an assortment of villains and knaves. I have not enjoyed their company.\u201d Born in New York, the daughter of Joseph Shakow, who ran a shop that sold outdoor clothing and supplies to polar explorers, and his wife, Frances (nee Price), Zara showed early academic promise and studied history at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1948. She then took a history degree at Oxford University in two years instead of the usual three, benefiting from being tutored by luminaries such as AJP Taylor and Isaiah Berlin. But when she asked Taylor if he would take her on as a doctoral student, he told her that the PhD was a German invention that the Americans had bastardised and was not worth pursuing. So in 1950 she relocated to Harvard, where she completed a doctorate, graduating in 1957. In 1955 she married a fellow Harvard graduate, the comparative literature scholar George Steiner, whom she had met in London, where she was conducting research for her doctoral dissertation and he was working for the Economist. They were introduced by their respective Harvard professors, who knew them both, obviously discussed them a great deal, and bet each other that the two would get married if they ever met. On receiving postcards from the professors urging each of them to \u201cbe a sport\u201d, George and Zara met for tea and agreed at the start that they would send them their own postcard saying \u201cyou lose the bet\u201d. At the end of the afternoon, however, they agreed not to send it after all. Their marriage lasted for more than 60 years, with Zara, among other things an excellent cook and dinner-party hostess, her skills complemented by George\u2019s taste in wine, providing a base of stability for her mercurial husband. Neither marriage to a man noted for his restlessness, nor the birth of two children, respectively in 1958 and 1960, took her away from her writing and research. Her first major book, The Foreign Office and Foreign Policy, 1898-1914, published in 1969, laid bare the complex interactions between ministers, officials and ingrained diplomatic practice and tradition that helped shape Britain\u2019s part in the origins of the first world war. It was followed in 1977 by the wider ranging Britain and the Origins of the First World War, commissioned for a series of short books on \u201cthe making of the 20th century\u201d published by Macmillan. Already in these volumes Zara was broadening out the concept of diplomatic history to reflect developments in international relations theory and include the impact of public opinion, economic interest, the press, and, above all, the input of civil servants. She journeyed up and down the land, examining the private papers of Foreign Office mandarins, buried in dusty files no other scholar had seen, looking for \u201cthe men behind the minutes\u201d, as she called them. On occasion her discoveries could spring surprises: at Sissinghurst, going through the private papers of the diplomat Harold Nicolson, she came across the love letters of his wife, Vita Sackville-West, to Violet Trefusis, and felt obliged to tell her host, Nigel Nicolson, of their very intimate contents, promising him she would not make use of them. Nicolson said nothing, but later made good use of them for his revealing book about his parents, Portrait of a Marriage. The success of her first two books prompted Alan Bullock to ask her to write the Oxford History of Modern Europe volume on international relations following on from Taylor\u2019s classic work The Struggle for Mastery in Europe. It was a testimony to Zara\u2019s scholarship that the project eventually expanded into two volumes, and took nearly 30 years to research and write \u2013 though in the early years she also had to carry out the demanding task of editing The Times Survey of Foreign Ministries of the World, a major scholarly undertaking, involving scores of historians and published in 1982. The thoroughness of her research for the Oxford volumes was staggering. On one occasion when the Yale historian Paul Kennedy visited her, he found her \u201cwriting-room bursting, overflowing with papers, articles, tagged books, copies of \u2018an important new dissertation\u2019 on France and the Bulgarians, etc\u201d. She seemed to have read almost everything that had been written on the numerous topics her books covered. After spending time in Princeton and then Innsbruck, Austria, following George from one job to another, she eventually settled with the family in Cambridge, and in 1968 was elected a fellow of New Hall (a women-only institution, later renamed Murray Edwards College), where she remained, tutoring undergraduates while continuing with her research. She took a leading role in the college\u2019s management, serving as acting president in 1995-96. She offered encouragement to her female students, not only in their academic endeavours but also more generally; many of them remember her with great affection. From the very beginning of her career, Zara was a woman in a man\u2019s world. When she arrived in Oxford in 1948, one of her (male) tutors initially refused to take her on. \u201cI don\u2019t tutor women,\u201d he said. \u201cJust call me sir,\u201d was her reply; and so he did, from then on. As a professional historian, she became part of the male-dominated realm of diplomatic and international relations history. Her volumes in the Oxford History of Modern Europe are the only ones in that series to have been written by a woman; and at a conference she organised in Cambridge in 1989 with officials and diplomats from 20 countries, when she led a discussion on the career difficulties faced by female diplomats, one official told her bluntly: \u201cIn my country, we have no such problems. We just do not let women into the foreign service.\u201d A retired British diplomat whom she interviewed greeted her with the comment: \u201cAn American, a woman and a Jew writing about the Foreign Office? It should not be allowed.\u201d In Cambridge, unlike in Oxford, the colleges are entirely separate from the university and its faculties. Although Zara was one of Cambridge\u2019s most distinguished historians, she never gained an official position in the history faculty, just as, for very different reasons, her husband George never secured an appointment in the English faculty. She remained for the rest of her career just a fellow, then emeritus fellow, of New Hall, and so never acquired the professorial title she so richly merited. Already by the 80s, diplomatic history was going out of fashion, and she was an outsider to the university in more ways than one. It was not until 2007 that she was elected a fellow of the British Academy. But around the world, she was recognised as a great historian, author of a string of important and durable works of scholarship and, not least, a role model for younger female academics. George predeceased her by 10 days. She is survived by their children, David and Deborah, and two granddaughters. \u2022 Zara Alice Steiner, historian, born 6 November 1928; died 13 February 2020",

      "body": "<p>I often find myself thinking back to a fairly unremarkable afternoon in 2010. I was sitting in the day room of a care home while my older brother Miles slept beside me, in his wheelchair. Steve, one of the other severely brain-injured residents dotted around the room in wheelchairs, was in distress. His hands were up by his face in tight fists and he was weeping. Nothing anyone did to comfort or soothe him worked; the look on his contorted face was one of pure anguish.</p> <p>And then, just as Miles was waking up, Steve\u2019s wife Natalia entered the room. Seeing her husband, she dropped her bags and ran to him, holding his face in her hands and covering it in kisses. Normally an outspoken and wonderfully foul-mouthed woman, she spoke now in gentle, incantatory whispers. I\u2019ve never seen relief like the relief that flooded Steve\u2019s face; it spread over his face and even his limbs, his neck softening back into the headrest, hands uncurling. It was a moment of tenderness and care, but also such profound intimacy that I found myself turning away, as if I were intruding.</p> <p>I was initiated into the world of care a week before my 20th birthday, when my family was struck by the first of three consecutive blows. My brother \u2013 a powerful, handsome, funny and gifted 29-year-old, and one of my closest friends \u2013 was left in a coma after a snowboarding accident, and then in a <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/disorders-of-consciousness/\" title=\"\">minimally conscious state </a>(MCS) until his death five years later, in 2011. Nine months after Miles\u2019s accident, my adored stepfather Ron was diagnosed with cancer and, after undergoing surgery and chemotherapy, passed away in 2008. A year after my brother\u2019s death, my father was also diagnosed with cancer \u2013 the same variant as my stepfather\u2019s \u2013 and underwent the same treatments. He died in 2016.</p> <p><em><strong>For the five years</strong></em> between Miles\u2019s accident and his death, my family and I devised a continual roster of visits to his hospitals and then care home. We used a machine to clear his trachea when he choked with a cough, and managed his spasticity and contractures with massage and splints. We helped to reposition him to prevent pressure sores. We brought him home once a week, learning how to manoeuvre his wheelchair up and down a ramp using a remote control and straps, and how to administer his medication, nutrition and hydration via a PEG tube.</p> <p>We talked to him, read to him, played music, took him outside in his wheelchair. Day after day and year after year, we tried everything we could to keep his physical pain \u2013 but also, crucially, his loneliness and grief \u2013 at bay. Much of the time, we couldn\u2019t succeed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the years of care there were tender moments to cherish</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am sure that being so involved in Miles\u2019s care \u2013 a necessity due not only to the particular complexity of MCS, but to the profound fissures in our brilliant but beleaguered NHS and primary care trusts \u2013 helped us to cope with all the loss. Care is work, a repetitive series of duties, and in that sense it sometimes worked as a distraction from our grief. At times, it could even enable us to feel useful \u2013 a precious thing during a period of our lives in which we felt overwhelmingly powerless.</p> <p>But that is not to say it wasn\u2019t also staggeringly hard, or the impact on our lives anything but immense. If the demands of our caring duties were sometimes a welcome distraction from our grief, they also interfered with it. We often felt guilty for not taking the time and space to grieve the loving and vital Miles we\u2019d lost, so absorbed were we in trying to help the altered and vulnerable Miles we now knew.</p> <p>When I first entered the world of care I was halfway through a four-year degree. Travelling constantly between London and Oxford, often writing my essays on the bus or train or by Miles\u2019s bedside, was disorientating and isolating. It was impossible to translate my new reality into the lifestyle my friends and I had previously enjoyed \u2013 the lives of normal students. Where before I\u2019d had essay crises, gone to clubs and watched movies, now I had essay crises, went to the hospital and watched my brother\u2019s face for flickers of awareness. As a result, I found my focus narrowed down almost exclusively to my studies on the one hand and Miles and family on the other.</p> <p>When I returned to London after graduating, I moved back in with my mum, who visited Miles every single day, and alternated with my siblings in visiting him after work. During that time I often felt my family life and the intensity of our duty as carers \u2013 as well as the complex questions we were battling with about his continued care \u2013 were unfathomable to my friends. As a result, I didn\u2019t really communicate any of it; my family life was shut firmly behind a closed door. As you might guess, that wasn\u2019t great for the nurturing of friendships. I am very lucky that many friends tolerated it.</p> <p>During those years of hospital and care home visits there were tender, beautiful moments that I cherish. Wheeling Miles outside on his calmer days, so he could feel the sun and even rain on his face. Taking my now-husband, James, to meet him; watching the interest on his face as James introduced himself. Reading to him until his eyelids became heavy and he fell asleep. Caring for Miles was a privilege, but it could also be profoundly distressing, as well as repetitive and frustrating. Caring for an ill or injured loved one is physically tiring, as well as emotionally exhausting; it can instil a weariness so deep it is difficult to convey. I haven\u2019t felt anything approaching it since, even during the sleep-deprived months of new parenthood.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Caring is a war of attrition, a\u00a0long siege on your resources</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My family and I were, when it came to care, among the most fortunate. A large and close-knit family, we were able to support each other emotionally; when one of us went down, there tended to be someone to pick them up. We were financially stable, and neither my siblings nor I yet had a spouse or children we had to neglect in order to spend time with Miles. We all lived within an hour\u2019s commute of his care home.</p> <p>Many of the other carers we met were not so fortunate. Some didn\u2019t have family around. Others had to travel hours each day. Others were struggling to make ends meet as a result of their new role. I remember in particular a young woman called Megan whose partner \u2013 the family breadwinner \u2013 was in MCS, like Miles. Now Megan found herself balancing demanding visits to the care home with finding work, paying the bills and looking after her two effectively bereaved children.</p> <p>The impact of care on my family and me, as well as on all the unpaid carers we met throughout that time, was all-encompassing. There is an ever-growing army of unpaid carers in the UK, due to our ageing population and breakthroughs in life-saving trauma medicine \u2013 and their struggle is well documented, even if our government repeatedly fails to give it the attention it needs. Aside from ruinous financial ramifications \u2013 unpaid carers are often forced to give up their jobs, work reduced hours, turn down promotions or use both savings and income to care for a loved one \u2013 research shows them to be twice as anxious as the general public, with a reported 72% suffering from mental ill health as a result of their caring role. Caring for a loved one over a protracted period of time is perhaps best understood as a war of attrition, a long siege on the carer\u2019s physical, financial and emotional resources.</p> <p><em><strong>To put a positive spin</strong></em> on our family\u2019s experience would be glib. What happened to Miles was a senseless tragedy; the toll of that tragedy on my family is inestimable. But it did change the way I look at people. Walking into the hidden world of care, and getting to know the paid and unpaid workers within it, taught me more about people\u2019s remarkable strength and grace than I could have learned otherwise. As I sat in that day room, watching the tenderness with which Natalia held her husband\u2019s face and the relief it brought him, I witnessed the genuinely therapeutic power of love and kindness. This wasn\u2019t easy kindness; it was bald, tenacious and powerful, a force to be reckoned with, surviving even the bleakest and most arduous of conditions. Care is the opposite of hatred, exclusion, prejudice and selfishness. It\u2019s a very ordinary act of extraordinary compassion that just about anyone will give themselves over to when the unthinkable happens to someone they love.</p> <p><em>Nightingale by Marina Kemp is published by 4th Estate at \u00a312.99.

      "bodyText": "Environmental groups have called into question the Bank of England\u2019s commitment to tackling the climate emergency while it retains one of Britain\u2019s most senior oil company executives on its governing board. Greenpeace joined with Friends of the Earth and the campaign group Oil Change International (OCI) to condemn the role played on the Bank\u2019s board of directors by Dorothy Thompson, the executive chair of Britain\u2019s largest independent oil company, Tullow Oil. Thompson was appointed to Threadneedle Street in 2014, when she was the head of power station operator Drax Group. She is a senior non-executive on the Bank\u2019s board, known as the Court of Directors, and chairs the audit and risk committee. Criticism of Thompson\u2019s role is embarrassing for Mark Carney, who steps down as governor next month to become Boris Johnson\u2019s special adviser for the crucial Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in November. Britain is hosting the climate conference as governments come under pressure to explain how they plan to cut fossil fuel emissions, especially from the widespread use of oil and oil products such as plastic. Carney has also been appointed as UN special envoy for climate action and finance, replacing the billionaire Michael Bloomberg in the part-time pro bono climate action role. Rosie Rogers, the head of climate finance at Greenpeace UK, said the Bank was \u201ccentral to tackling the climate emergency\u201d and that Carney needed to be \u201cmaking the best decisions possible for the planet free from the influence of the fossil fuel industry\u201d. Hannah McKinnon, the director, energy transitions and futures programme at the OCI, said: \u201cCentral banks are charged with overseeing and regulating one of the greatest transitions of our time: the end of the fossil fuel economy.

Climate breakdown needs to be fought in every arena which can only mean cutting ties between financial institutions and dirty oil companies.\u201d The Bank of England is known to be concerned to protect its environmental credentials after converting to renewable energy at its Threadneedle Street headquarters and introducing schemes to reduce business travel by its staff and recycle banknotes. Carney is most closely associated with a UN-backed campaign that aims to encourage businesses to show how they will reduce their carbon footprint over the next two decades to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. Earlier this month, Carney said that when world leaders meet in Scotland for UN-led climate talks they needed to show they had a plan to reduce carbon emissions. \u201cIt\u2019s not just green assets and divestment campaigns or certain things are so brown or black. Every company ultimately has to have a plan for a transition and what the opportunities are and where the risks are,\u201d he said. As chief executive of Drax, Thompson was applauded for switching the electricity generator from coal to biofuels and introducing measures to reduce harmful gas emissions. Drax has pledged to be carbon negative by 2030. Tullow Oil is a \u00a3550m oil and gas company that explores and produces oil at sites in Kenya, Ghana and Uganda. It has also explored for oil off the coast of Guyana. Thompson stepped up from her role as non-executive chair of Tullow in December after she and other non-executives ousted the chief executive and the head of exploration for poor performance. Tullow has pledged to reduce the level of CO2 emissions per tonne of hydrocarbon it extracts from its wells, but the most recent figure for 2018 \u2013 139 tonnes per 1,000 tonnes of hydrocarbon produced, while lower than in 2017 \u2013 is higher than 2015.

      "body": "<p>Street food markets are the most extravagant swindle visited on the middle classes since the 2010 Liberal Democrat manifesto, and it\u2019s hard to know whether to laugh or cry about it. On the one hand, the notion of scores of yuppies paying \u00a314 for a gourmet \u201csnack\u201d, to be eaten out of a paper tray while balanced awkwardly on a wooden pub bench, in a car park, in February, accompanied by \u201ccrafties\u201d from plastic pint glasses, while lining the pockets of millionaire landlords is pretty funny. On the other hand, they are hallmarks of everything that is going wrong in our big cities.</p> <p>What we eat and the way we eat it has always told us a great deal about politics and society. The explosion of trendy food courts and walled-off markets is no exception. They are exemplars of the financialisation and privatisation of urban space, of a middle-class ennui and yearning for authenticity, and a profits-first, pick-and-mix version of diversity. And such small portions!</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As evidence that the trend has reached a new peak of sublime bathos, even Dairylea Lunchables is now selling a 'street food' range</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The street foodification of everything is perhaps the biggest single culinary trend of the past decade. It\u2019s about rinsing every last inch of urban space for rent extraction, as much as what\u2019s for dinner. London in particular is awash with street food markets. Three branches of the Market Halls chain opened in 2018-19, to go with the <a href=\"https://www.kerbfood.com/\" title=\"\">five Kerb sites</a>, four <a href=\"https://www.streetfeast.com/\" title=\"\">Street Feast</a> sites, three <a href=\"https://www.boxpark.co.uk/wembley/\" title=\"\">Boxpark</a> sites, two <a href=\"https://pergolalondon.com/\" title=\"\">Pergola</a> sites and countless others.

      "bodyText": "Street food markets are the most extravagant swindle visited on the middle classes since the 2010 Liberal Democrat manifesto, and it\u2019s hard to know whether to laugh or cry about it. On the one hand, the notion of scores of yuppies paying \u00a314 for a gourmet \u201csnack\u201d, to be eaten out of a paper tray while balanced awkwardly on a wooden pub bench, in a car park, in February, accompanied by \u201ccrafties\u201d from plastic pint glasses, while lining the pockets of millionaire landlords is pretty funny. On the other hand, they are hallmarks of everything that is going wrong in our big cities. What we eat and the way we eat it has always told us a great deal about politics and society. The explosion of trendy food courts and walled-off markets is no exception. They are exemplars of the financialisation and privatisation of urban space, of a middle-class ennui and yearning for authenticity, and a profits-first, pick-and-mix version of diversity. And such small portions! The street foodification of everything is perhaps the biggest single culinary trend of the past decade. It\u2019s about rinsing every last inch of urban space for rent extraction, as much as what\u2019s for dinner. London in particular is awash with street food markets. Three branches of the Market Halls chain opened in 2018-19, to go with the five Kerb sites, four Street Feast sites, three Boxpark sites, two Pergola sites and countless others. In November, Kerb London opened its first fixed, indoor street food hall in a warehouse in the heart of Covent Garden, in collaboration with multibillion-pound property titans Shaftesbury PLC, which owns large swathes of the West End. And the artisanal-fare-industrial-complex is thriving in other major cities too: Baltic and Duke Street Markets in Liverpool, Hatch and Grub in Manchester, Brum Yum Yum and Digbeth Dining Club in Birmingham. Shipping containers feature heavily throughout. And the new openings are not stopping. Time Out Group is moving from magazines into markets, with its first London food hall to open in Waterloo in 2021.

The government defines high-risk areas as having a <a href=\"http://apps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/cy/151263.aspx\">1% or greater</a> chance of flooding in any year.</p> <p>The data was unearthed by cross-referencing local planning documents and street-level addresses with <a href=\"https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/long-term-flood-risk/map\">the government\u2019s national map of flood zones</a>.</p> <p>Building on land prone to flooding is a risk to new homeowners and compounds the danger for surrounding areas, experts have said, as floodwater that could otherwise be soaked up by green space instead runs quickly off concrete and into rivers.</p> <p>In Herefordshire, which experienced unprecedented flooding last week as the River Wye rose to the highest level since 1795, 325 homes are earmarked for high-risk flood zones over the next few years. Some of this land has already been left underwater by Storm Dennis, according to the Herefordshire council leader, David Hitchiner.</p> <p>John Harrington, the council\u2019s cabinet member for infrastructure and transport, described the government\u2019s housing policy as \u201ccompletely and utterly flawed\u201d and that it was forcing local authorities to approve \u201cidiotic\u201d developments on floodplains so they can meet demands from Whitehall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/recent_floods_chart/giv-3902R2CBml6tfx03/\" data-alt=\"A chart of recent flooding\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/recent_floods_chart/giv-3902R2CBml6tfx03/\">A chart of recent flooding</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cCentral government just say: \u2018There\u2019s a housing target, now go do it.\u2019 It\u2019s really quite stupid.

In three regions hit by severe flooding before Christmas \u2013 Doncaster, Sheffield and Central Lincolnshire \u2013 a further 9,931 new homes are to be built on high-risk flood land. The government defines high-risk areas as having a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any year. The data was unearthed by cross-referencing local planning documents and street-level addresses with the government\u2019s national map of flood zones. Building on land prone to flooding is a risk to new homeowners and compounds the danger for surrounding areas, experts have said, as floodwater that could otherwise be soaked up by green space instead runs quickly off concrete and into rivers. In Herefordshire, which experienced unprecedented flooding last week as the River Wye rose to the highest level since 1795, 325 homes are earmarked for high-risk flood zones over the next few years. Some of this land has already been left underwater by Storm Dennis, according to the Herefordshire council leader, David Hitchiner. John Harrington, the council\u2019s cabinet member for infrastructure and transport, described the government\u2019s housing policy as \u201ccompletely and utterly flawed\u201d and that it was forcing local authorities to approve \u201cidiotic\u201d developments on floodplains so they can meet demands from Whitehall. \u201cCentral government just say: \u2018There\u2019s a housing target, now go do it.\u2019 It\u2019s really quite stupid. It\u2019s devolving responsibility without giving the authority any power or money to deal with the situation. It is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d he said. Concerns have also been raised that homeowners who buy new properties on at-risk land are in \u201cpotential insurance blackspots\u201d as they are not eligible for cover under the government\u2019s Flood Re insurance scheme, potentially leaving them liable for crippling costs in the event of damage. The Association of British Insurers said building on unprotected floodplains was \u201csimply storing up problems for the future\u201d and that stricter checks and sanctions should be introduced to stop developers from finding ways round planning regulations. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cLocal authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need, and our planning policy is clear that housing should be located in the areas at least risk of flooding. Where development in a risk area is absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding.\u201d Scott Cardwell, Doncaster council\u2019s assistant director for economy and development, said the council was only identifying areas in flood zones for housing where they already have planning permission and are \u201cdeliverable, viable, and safe\u201d. He added: \u201cThey have all complied with national planning policy and the sequential and exceptions tests and have had site-specific flood risk assessments and mitigation agreed in conjunction with the Environment Agency and lead local flood authority.\u201d In the valley of Calderdale in West Yorkshire, which has been hit by three major floods in eight years, the council\u2019s leader, Tim Swift, said it had removed some sites at high risk of flooding from its local plan after a risk assessment. However, he said that where houses were still proposed for flood-risk sites they would not be developed \u201cuntil measures have been put in place to ensure that they are safe\u201d. Some council leaders have raised doubts about the efficacy of the measures used by developers to mitigate the flood risk of new homes, such as \u201csustainable urban drainage systems\u201d. Some have said that paving over absorbent land simply exacerbates the problems downstream. Parr called for government to rethink its housing policy and give more powers to environmental watchdogs \u201cto keep developers in check\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s high time both local and central government started treating the climate emergency as if it was real \u2013 because it is. \u201cOne of the problems is that by cutting the budgets of both local authorities and the Environment Agency, the government has effectively tilted the playing field in favour of developers. We have a housing policy that tends to put housebuilders\u2019 profits before people\u2019s chances of not seeing their homes underwater.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Oliver Letwin\u2019s strange and somewhat alarming new book begins at midnight on Thursday 31 December 2037. In Swindon \u2013 stay with me! \u2013 a man called Aameen Patel is working the graveyard shift at Highways England\u2019s traffic HQ when his computer screen goes blank, and the room is plunged into darkness. He tries to report these things to his superiors, but can get no signal on his mobile. What\u2019s going on? Looking at the motorway from the viewing window by his desk, he observes, not an orderly stream of traffic, but a dramatic pile-up of crashed cars and lorries \u2013 at which point he realises something is seriously amiss. In the Britain of 2037, everything, or almost everything, is controlled by 7G wireless technology, from the national grid to the traffic (not only are cars driverless; a vehicle cannot even join a motorway without logging into an \u201con-route guidance system\u201d). There is, then, only one possible explanation: the entire 7G network must have gone down.</p> <p>It sounds like I\u2019m describing a novel \u2013 and it\u2019s true that Aameen Patel will soon be joined by another fictional creation in the form of Bill Donoghue, who works at the Bank of England, and whose job it will be to tell the prime minister that the country is about to pay a heavy price for its cashless economy, given that even essential purchases will not be possible until the network is back up (Bill\u2019s mother-in-law is also one of thousands of vulnerable people whose carers will soon be unable to get to them, the batteries in their electric cars having gone flat). But <em>Apocalypse How?</em> is not a novel. It\u2019s a peculiar hybrid: part fable, part fact. Aameen, Bill and all Letwin\u2019s other characters exist only to illustrate aspects of his wider thesis, which is that our increasing reliance on integrated digital technology may be leading us, and ultimately every country in the world, in the direction of a catastrophe. I exaggerate a little, but think TV\u2019s <em>Survivors</em> minus the mystery virus (though at the moment, we handily have one of those on our hands, too).</p> <p>Letwin, an old fashioned keep-calm-and-carry-on kind of Tory (though he left parliament at the 2019 general election), doesn\u2019t look or sound like a doom-merchant. Even last year, as he led the bloody parliamentary fight to ensure that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/boris-johnsons-super-saturday-bubble-bursts\" title=\"\">Britain did not leave the EU without a deal</a>, he was always smiling: a cherubic figure whose springy hair \u2013 it rises benignly from his head like ice-cream from a cone \u2013 only made him seem all the more graciously donnish. But a doom-merchant he is, or so it would seem. All he needs now is a sign that reads: \u201cThe end is nigh\u201d.</p> <p>The thoughts of rack and ruin started when he was still a member of the cabinet (his last big job was chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster under David Cameron). \u201cIn government, I\u2019d be dealing with all sorts of risks,\u201d he says. \u201cEach day, I put aside a small bit of time in which to think, and on one of these occasions, I forced myself to consider how likely it was that any future administration would be able to protect us from certain risks to a degree that we could be fairly confident the situation in question wouldn\u2019t arise. The more I thought about it, the more it became clear there wasn\u2019t any serious likelihood of that at all. This lodged itself in my mind, and it worried me for months and months.\u201d <em>Apocalypse How? </em>is the 220-page result of all this worry. In its pages, a space-weather event having taken its effect on satellites, Britain falls into chaos for five days, when, to a degree, law and order breaks down and 100,000 vulnerable people die (frail, cold and hungry, neither the emergency services nor the army can reach them, there being no functioning communications system, and no paper record of their whereabouts).</p> <p>Letwin and I meet in Mayfair, at the Legatum Institute, a right-leaning thinktank where he is now a fellow. It\u2019s a luxurious place, halfway between a gentleman\u2019s club and a Harley Street clinic. Sitting in reception, magazines fanned out on a coffee table, I almost expect him to appear before me in a white coat, a stethoscope dangling at his neck. But of course it\u2019s me who\u2019ll be asking the questions, nodding sympathetically as he lets it all out. Does he like to talk? He does. Letwin is, I think, used to being listened to, a privilege afforded him ever since he was a small child (we\u2019ll come back to this). His answers are charming, but prolix. His way of dodging a bullet is to fill the air with words, and never mind if they refer to another matter entirely.</p> <p>Before we get on to the internet, and its terrifying powers, I must ask: what\u2019s it like on the outside? Is he in mourning for life as an MP \u2013 he entered parliament in 1997, as the member for West Dorset \u2013 or does he feel like dancing across Berkeley Square? He grins. \u201cIf you want to have a glimpse of what entering the garden of Eden is like, what you need to do, in my experience, is be an MP for a quarter of a century and then stop. This is just\u2026 totally wonderful. I can\u2019t describe how marvellous it is. I very much enjoyed my time in parliament, though I can\u2019t say I enjoyed the last year. But the first morning of waking up, and not having several hundred emails to deal with\u2026 I hadn\u2019t realised how wonderful the commodity of time is.\u201d He laughs, a high-pitched giggle that makes me think of a baby that has just seen itself in a mirror for the first time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e41abc1855159eca1e197706f44baa14e12b377e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e41abc1855159eca1e197706f44baa14e12b377e/0_23_4230_2540/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Letwin speaking as an independent MP in the Commons on 19 October, 2019, during a crucial debate on the Brexit deal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Letwin speaking as an independent MP in the Commons on 19 October, 2019, during a crucial debate on the Brexit deal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And how does he feel about the country, post-election and post-Brexit? (He was for Remain in the referendum, but he also voted for all Theresa May\u2019s deals and for the one Boris Johnson got through the Commons.) Has it, in some profound way, changed? \u201cThat\u2019s a big question,\u201d he says. \u201cLots of things happen simultaneously in countries; they\u2019re very complicated. But I do think there is a national consensus that we\u2019ve done what we\u2019ve done, and we must now try and get on and be sensible.\u201d He hopes negotiations with the EU will take place in a more \u201csane and rational\u201d environment \u2013 though this isn\u2019t to say that he thinks our trading relationship will be easy to sort out. \u201cIt could go well, or it could go\u2026 <em>less badly</em>,\u201d he says, uncertainly.</p> <p>Did he fall out with anyone over Brexit? Does he, for instance, feel cross with his old friend David Cameron? \u201cNo, not at all!\u201d he yelps. \u201cI\u2019m a huge admirer of his. A referendum was inevitable; it would have created a real problem for our democracy if we hadn\u2019t had one.David was a great prime minister. And I didn\u2019t fall out with anyone else either. I wasn\u2019t cross with anyone, and I didn\u2019t shout at them. Some of my closest friends are Brexiters, like my best man, Charles Moore [the former editor of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>]. What I do regret, though, is that some people were so annoyed with me [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/13/parliament-is-out-of-options-to-stop-no-deal-brexit-tory-mp-oliver-letwin\" title=\"\">over his determination to frustrate</a> no-deal] that they became quite, er, hostile.\u201d Did he feel plucky, taking such a stand? He tuts. \u201cNo! This is not a place where you get shot or imprisoned for political disagreements. It required perseverance, that\u2019s all.\u201d Perseverance, it would seem, comes easily to him. His next book, about the rise of the east and how the west should deal with it, will cover \u2013 gulp \u2013 some 4,000 years of history.</p> <p>But we must talk about the book I\u2019m holding in my hands: <em>Apocalypse How?</em> It all began, he thinks, with his wellington boots, which he had to pull on with alarming regularity while in government. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember the terrible floods that besieged the Lake District during the coalition government? Well, when we finally got through those, I sat down with senior experts in the field, and I asked them: why are these events that are supposed to happen every year in 100 happening each year? And in that moment, I could see it in their eyes. How, they thought, can this minister be so ignorant?\u201d He laughs.</p> <p>\u201cVery patiently, they began to explain to me what should have been blindingly obvious. If you have 1,000 places that have a one in 1,000 chance of flooding, it\u2019s pretty likely one will flood every year \u2013 and even more so if they have a one in 100 chance of flooding. The statistics don\u2019t mean what the layman thinks. If we\u2019re going to avoid flooding, we must <em>assume</em> it is going to happen.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I hear there's a problem about fuel, I fill up. I have a paper record of my contacts. These are sensible precautions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was something else, too: the question of networks. \u201cI was conducting resilience reviews. I\u2019d assumed the various networks essentially to be separate from one another. But as I explored this, it became clear that within not too many years, there would essentially be only one. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/01/smart-home-devices-internet-of-things-domestic-abuse\" title=\"\">internet of things</a> [the billions of devices that will eventually be connected to the internet, from fridges to dustbins] is the revolution that\u2019s coming, and it\u2019s a tipping point: a lot of information is converging, everything that we depend on.\u201d Converging networks are fragile; they can be brought down, in a single stroke, by a space-weather event or sabotage, whether physical (explosives, say) or cyber. And as more and more parts of our lives depend on fewer and fewer of these networks, society becomes ever more vulnerable. This isn\u2019t, he insists, science fiction; it\u2019s a coming reality. Letwin believes we have only to look at Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine\u2019s power grid in 2015 and 2016 to see this.</p> <p>Surely someone, somewhere, is on top of this? Apparently not. According to Letwin, politicians are unwilling to do things for which they won\u2019t be thanked (if the public was successfully protected from digital meltdown, no one would ever know, and thus their efforts would go unacknowledged). They operate on a short-term basis, and they procrastinate. Cost-benefit analysis combined with the difficulty of estimating probabilities is likely to suggest to them that investing in this area simply isn\u2019t worth it. Like all of us, they also tend, for complex psychological reasons, to underprepare for disaster. Needless to say, I\u2019m transfixed by his honesty in this matter \u2013 as if he had not been a career politician himself! The irony, however, seems to elude him.</p> <p>Of course, as he also notes in his book, policymakers could bring in \u201cfree thinkers\u201d to \u201cthink the unthinkable\u201d. But this is tricky. Dominic Cummings\u2019s dim view of special advisers, and his call for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/dominic-cummings-calls-for-weirdos-and-misfits-for-no-10-jobs\" title=\"\">\u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d </a>to apply for jobs at No 10, don\u2019t quite wash with Letwin. \u201cI understand why people get frustrated by bureaucracies. There are moments when you\u2019re facing a very simple crisis, one so great you must just cut a swath through it. The second world war would be an example of that, when defeating the Nazis was the only thing that mattered, and Churchill got this in a way other people didn\u2019t. But that\u2019s only appropriate when the threat is immediate and existential. Most things are more like climate change than the Nazis; they\u2019re not simple, they\u2019re not immediate, and you can\u2019t act alone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7b66280cc0f8870ab1fb964ad51905bc391a305\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7b66280cc0f8870ab1fb964ad51905bc391a305/25_19_2839_2192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher lends her support to Letwin\u2019s 1992 parliamentary bid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"772\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher lends her support to Letwin\u2019s 1992 parliamentary bid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Independent/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All this said, you have to wonder why heads are buried so deeply in the sand when it comes to our digital future. By his telling, the solution isn\u2019t difficult. \u201cWhat it amounts to is an analogue solution to a digital problem,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a perfect back-up, but it would get us through. We need to ensure that stuff we could do 50 years ago has been laid in store in such a way that we can get by.\u201d He\u2019s talking, I think, about old-fashioned things such as landlines, walkie-talkies and, perhaps, reserves of diesel and the kind of robust vehicles that require it.</p> <p>Naturally, I can\u2019t help wondering if all this has affected his own life. Is his house awash with torches, tins and clockwork radios? Is he a secret survivalist? \u201cWell, we have four or five torches. Which work.\u201d He giggles. \u201cAnd if I hear there is a problem about fuel coming along, I fill up. I have a map in the car, and a paper record of my contacts. These are sensible precautions.\u201d Later, I make a joke about yoghurt pots tied together with string. But it falls flat, possibly because at his primary school, unlike mine, children were not taught how to make rudimentary communication devices from household debris.</p> <p>What does he make of the government\u2019s decision to allow the Chinese company Huawei to serve as a supplier to create a new 5G network in Britain? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/29/johnson-faces-tory-rebellion-over-huawei-5g-plans-for-britain\" title=\"\">Many Conservatives</a> believe this will put national security at risk. I expect alarm, but he is entirely (and, to me, bizarrely) unperturbed. \u201cI\u2019m clear there are very good reasons, in terms of our security, why we <em>should</em> have Huawei. The fact that as part of the deal we have transparent understanding of what they\u2019re doing, makes us <em>less</em> exposed, it seems to me, to the Chinese.\u201d It is concerning that the world hasn\u2019t yet found a way of establishing international governance of cyber-security, but he has little to say on the question of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/20/boris-johnson-urged-to-publish-report-on-russian-meddling\" title=\"\">Russian interference in the EU referendum</a>. \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea [whether the Russians meddled in it]. I think it is extraordinarily silly of people to speculate.\u201d Should the government clear the release of the House of Commons\u2019 intelligence and security committee\u2019s report into Russian infiltration? \u201cI don\u2019t know. If it contains things it\u2019s important the government knows, but equally important other people <em>don\u2019t</em> know, then they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Eton is a privilege and a millstone. It creates an often mistaken impression of what you are, and that\u2019s unfortunate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Letwin is not precisely what many people perhaps imagine him to be, for all that he is an Old Etonian with a voice to match. (\u201cOh, I see,\u201d he says, when I point this out. \u201cYou thought I was a seventh earl or something.\u201d) His grandparents were Ukrainian Jews who fled Europe for America. His parents, William and Shirley, were American academics who settled in Britain (his father was professor of political science at the London School of Economics; his mother taught, in the 70s, at that hotbed of radical conservative thought, Peterhouse College, Cambridge). They were also famous hosts, whose salons \u2013 they lived in a house near Regent\u2019s Park \u2013 were attended by the likes of Isaiah Berlin.</p> <p>Letwin was their only child. What was it like growing up in such an atmosphere? \u201cOh, it was absolutely wonderful,\u201d he says, his voice rising. \u201cIt was somewhat chaotic. I spent my first 12 years oscillating between the UK and the US; my parents had academic jobs on each side of the Atlantic in rotation. But I was incredibly lucky. They were enormously lively and endlessly interested in everything, and they had an enormous number of friends and acquaintances. What made it all the luckier was that they were generation blind. The young, the middle-aged and the old were all around the table together, and from a ridiculously early age, I was allowed to be there. Nobody tried to stop me talking. I must have seemed completely ridiculous, but they put up with me. The result was that I had the kind of conversations you usually don\u2019t have as a child: furious arguments with Milton Friedman [the Nobel prize-winning economist]. That was fantastic, and it taught me that it doesn\u2019t matter two hoots how grand someone is \u2013 either what they are saying stands up to scrutiny, or it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Why did his parents send him to Eton? \u201cMy mother was completely in love with England, with a romantic dream of it that has largely disappeared. Eton was part of that.\u201d Is it true he was the cleverest boy there? In Nicholas Coleridge\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/29/nicholas-coleridge-conde-nast-colossus-of-the-glossy-mag-interview\" title=\"\">recent memoir</a> [Coleridge, the former boss of the magazine publisher Cond\u00e9 Nast, was his contemporary], he says Letwin was so bright, people struggled to understand him. \u201cKnowing Nicholas, and loving him as I do, I imagine that book is very romanticised, and doesn\u2019t bear much relation to reality. I was perfectly comprehensible, and simple, and not nearly as clever as some. I was at school with Noel Malcolm [the journalist and historian]. He was at least 10 times cleverer than me.\u201d Still, his reputation for a certain kind of cleverness stayed with him. In the run-up to the 2010 general election, one commentator described him as the Conservative party\u2019s Gandalf.</p> <p>From Eton, he went to Cambridge University, Princeton and then Cambridge again, after which he joined Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Policy Unit \u2013 and thus began his somewhat gaffe-prone political career (among other things, in 2011 he was found to have thrown away confidential letters from constituents in a bin in St James\u2019s Park \u2013 a breach of data protection for which he apologised). Is he, I wonder, surprised that our latest prime minister is an Etonian? Shouldn\u2019t things have changed a bit (a lot) by now? \u201cWell, yes,\u201d he says, with a laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him to be leader! The thing about Eton is that it is a privilege and a millstone. It creates an often mistaken impression of what you are, and that\u2019s unfortunate. On the other hand, it gives you a fantastic education, and it encourages you to be confident, to take up positions, and not to be intimidated by authority. But it is a kind of shortcut, and an unfair privilege, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d</p> <p>Predictably, we run out of time at the Legatum Institute. This part of our conversation takes place later, Letwin talking to me on his (yes) mobile phone as he walks to work \u2013 a situation that makes it all the easier for me to ask, rather crossly: are people like him on their way out? Will they <em>ever</em> be on their way out? As ever, though, he\u2019s gracious, mild-mannered. \u201cYes, I think we are, and that is quite right. Society is dramatically more meritocratic and less old school tie than when I was growing up \u2013 though we\u2019ve got some way to go.\u201d Has he learned to check his privilege? He insists that he has. \u201cI\u2019m extremely conscious that in a thousand ways I\u2019ve been fantastically lucky,\u201d he says. \u201cI bless my luck all the time \u2013 and I know that it is luck.\u201d After we hang up, I picture him beetling along the London pavements, his trouser pockets fat with matches, peanuts and Kendal Mint Cake.

The thoughts of rack and ruin started when he was still a member of the cabinet (his last big job was chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster under David Cameron). \u201cIn government, I\u2019d be dealing with all sorts of risks,\u201d he says. \u201cEach day, I put aside a small bit of time in which to think, and on one of these occasions, I forced myself to consider how likely it was that any future administration would be able to protect us from certain risks to a degree that we could be fairly confident the situation in question wouldn\u2019t arise. The more I thought about it, the more it became clear there wasn\u2019t any serious likelihood of that at all. This lodged itself in my mind, and it worried me for months and months.\u201d Apocalypse How? is the 220-page result of all this worry. In its pages, a space-weather event having taken its effect on satellites, Britain falls into chaos for five days, when, to a degree, law and order breaks down and 100,000 vulnerable people die (frail, cold and hungry, neither the emergency services nor the army can reach them, there being no functioning communications system, and no paper record of their whereabouts). Letwin and I meet in Mayfair, at the Legatum Institute, a right-leaning thinktank where he is now a fellow. It\u2019s a luxurious place, halfway between a gentleman\u2019s club and a Harley Street clinic. Sitting in reception, magazines fanned out on a coffee table, I almost expect him to appear before me in a white coat, a stethoscope dangling at his neck. But of course it\u2019s me who\u2019ll be asking the questions, nodding sympathetically as he lets it all out. Does he like to talk? He does. Letwin is, I think, used to being listened to, a privilege afforded him ever since he was a small child (we\u2019ll come back to this). His answers are charming, but prolix. His way of dodging a bullet is to fill the air with words, and never mind if they refer to another matter entirely. Before we get on to the internet, and its terrifying powers, I must ask: what\u2019s it like on the outside? Is he in mourning for life as an MP \u2013 he entered parliament in 1997, as the member for West Dorset \u2013 or does he feel like dancing across Berkeley Square? He grins. \u201cIf you want to have a glimpse of what entering the garden of Eden is like, what you need to do, in my experience, is be an MP for a quarter of a century and then stop. This is just\u2026 totally wonderful. I can\u2019t describe how marvellous it is. I very much enjoyed my time in parliament, though I can\u2019t say I enjoyed the last year. But the first morning of waking up, and not having several hundred emails to deal with\u2026 I hadn\u2019t realised how wonderful the commodity of time is.\u201d He laughs, a high-pitched giggle that makes me think of a baby that has just seen itself in a mirror for the first time. And how does he feel about the country, post-election and post-Brexit? (He was for Remain in the referendum, but he also voted for all Theresa May\u2019s deals and for the one Boris Johnson got through the Commons.) Has it, in some profound way, changed? \u201cThat\u2019s a big question,\u201d he says. \u201cLots of things happen simultaneously in countries; they\u2019re very complicated. But I do think there is a national consensus that we\u2019ve done what we\u2019ve done, and we must now try and get on and be sensible.\u201d He hopes negotiations with the EU will take place in a more \u201csane and rational\u201d environment \u2013 though this isn\u2019t to say that he thinks our trading relationship will be easy to sort out. \u201cIt could go well, or it could go\u2026 less badly,\u201d he says, uncertainly. Did he fall out with anyone over Brexit? Does he, for instance, feel cross with his old friend David Cameron? \u201cNo, not at all!\u201d he yelps. \u201cI\u2019m a huge admirer of his. A referendum was inevitable; it would have created a real problem for our democracy if we hadn\u2019t had one.David was a great prime minister. And I didn\u2019t fall out with anyone else either. I wasn\u2019t cross with anyone, and I didn\u2019t shout at them. Some of my closest friends are Brexiters, like my best man, Charles Moore [the former editor of the Daily Telegraph]. What I do regret, though, is that some people were so annoyed with me [over his determination to frustrate no-deal] that they became quite, er, hostile.\u201d Did he feel plucky, taking such a stand? He tuts. \u201cNo! This is not a place where you get shot or imprisoned for political disagreements. It required perseverance, that\u2019s all.\u201d Perseverance, it would seem, comes easily to him. His next book, about the rise of the east and how the west should deal with it, will cover \u2013 gulp \u2013 some 4,000 years of history. But we must talk about the book I\u2019m holding in my hands: Apocalypse How? It all began, he thinks, with his wellington boots, which he had to pull on with alarming regularity while in government. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember the terrible floods that besieged the Lake District during the coalition government? Well, when we finally got through those, I sat down with senior experts in the field, and I asked them: why are these events that are supposed to happen every year in 100 happening each year? And in that moment, I could see it in their eyes. How, they thought, can this minister be so ignorant?\u201d He laughs. \u201cVery patiently, they began to explain to me what should have been blindingly obvious. If you have 1,000 places that have a one in 1,000 chance of flooding, it\u2019s pretty likely one will flood every year \u2013 and even more so if they have a one in 100 chance of flooding. The statistics don\u2019t mean what the layman thinks. If we\u2019re going to avoid flooding, we must assume it is going to happen.\u201d There was something else, too: the question of networks. \u201cI was conducting resilience reviews. I\u2019d assumed the various networks essentially to be separate from one another. But as I explored this, it became clear that within not too many years, there would essentially be only one. The internet of things [the billions of devices that will eventually be connected to the internet, from fridges to dustbins] is the revolution that\u2019s coming, and it\u2019s a tipping point: a lot of information is converging, everything that we depend on.\u201d Converging networks are fragile; they can be brought down, in a single stroke, by a space-weather event or sabotage, whether physical (explosives, say) or cyber. And as more and more parts of our lives depend on fewer and fewer of these networks, society becomes ever more vulnerable. This isn\u2019t, he insists, science fiction; it\u2019s a coming reality. Letwin believes we have only to look at Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine\u2019s power grid in 2015 and 2016 to see this. Surely someone, somewhere, is on top of this? Apparently not. According to Letwin, politicians are unwilling to do things for which they won\u2019t be thanked (if the public was successfully protected from digital meltdown, no one would ever know, and thus their efforts would go unacknowledged). They operate on a short-term basis, and they procrastinate. Cost-benefit analysis combined with the difficulty of estimating probabilities is likely to suggest to them that investing in this area simply isn\u2019t worth it. Like all of us, they also tend, for complex psychological reasons, to underprepare for disaster. Needless to say, I\u2019m transfixed by his honesty in this matter \u2013 as if he had not been a career politician himself! The irony, however, seems to elude him. Of course, as he also notes in his book, policymakers could bring in \u201cfree thinkers\u201d to \u201cthink the unthinkable\u201d. But this is tricky. Dominic Cummings\u2019s dim view of special advisers, and his call for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d to apply for jobs at No 10, don\u2019t quite wash with Letwin. \u201cI understand why people get frustrated by bureaucracies. There are moments when you\u2019re facing a very simple crisis, one so great you must just cut a swath through it. The second world war would be an example of that, when defeating the Nazis was the only thing that mattered, and Churchill got this in a way other people didn\u2019t. But that\u2019s only appropriate when the threat is immediate and existential. Most things are more like climate change than the Nazis; they\u2019re not simple, they\u2019re not immediate, and you can\u2019t act alone.\u201d All this said, you have to wonder why heads are buried so deeply in the sand when it comes to our digital future. By his telling, the solution isn\u2019t difficult. \u201cWhat it amounts to is an analogue solution to a digital problem,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a perfect back-up, but it would get us through. We need to ensure that stuff we could do 50 years ago has been laid in store in such a way that we can get by.\u201d He\u2019s talking, I think, about old-fashioned things such as landlines, walkie-talkies and, perhaps, reserves of diesel and the kind of robust vehicles that require it. Naturally, I can\u2019t help wondering if all this has affected his own life. Is his house awash with torches, tins and clockwork radios? Is he a secret survivalist? \u201cWell, we have four or five torches. Which work.\u201d He giggles. \u201cAnd if I hear there is a problem about fuel coming along, I fill up. I have a map in the car, and a paper record of my contacts. These are sensible precautions.\u201d Later, I make a joke about yoghurt pots tied together with string. But it falls flat, possibly because at his primary school, unlike mine, children were not taught how to make rudimentary communication devices from household debris. What does he make of the government\u2019s decision to allow the Chinese company Huawei to serve as a supplier to create a new 5G network in Britain? Many Conservatives believe this will put national security at risk. I expect alarm, but he is entirely (and, to me, bizarrely) unperturbed. \u201cI\u2019m clear there are very good reasons, in terms of our security, why we should have Huawei. The fact that as part of the deal we have transparent understanding of what they\u2019re doing, makes us less exposed, it seems to me, to the Chinese.\u201d It is concerning that the world hasn\u2019t yet found a way of establishing international governance of cyber-security, but he has little to say on the question of Russian interference in the EU referendum. \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea [whether the Russians meddled in it]. I think it is extraordinarily silly of people to speculate.\u201d Should the government clear the release of the House of Commons\u2019 intelligence and security committee\u2019s report into Russian infiltration? \u201cI don\u2019t know. If it contains things it\u2019s important the government knows, but equally important other people don\u2019t know, then they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Letwin is not precisely what many people perhaps imagine him to be, for all that he is an Old Etonian with a voice to match. (\u201cOh, I see,\u201d he says, when I point this out. \u201cYou thought I was a seventh earl or something.\u201d) His grandparents were Ukrainian Jews who fled Europe for America. His parents, William and Shirley, were American academics who settled in Britain (his father was professor of political science at the London School of Economics; his mother taught, in the 70s, at that hotbed of radical conservative thought, Peterhouse College, Cambridge). They were also famous hosts, whose salons \u2013 they lived in a house near Regent\u2019s Park \u2013 were attended by the likes of Isaiah Berlin. Letwin was their only child. What was it like growing up in such an atmosphere? \u201cOh, it was absolutely wonderful,\u201d he says, his voice rising. \u201cIt was somewhat chaotic. I spent my first 12 years oscillating between the UK and the US; my parents had academic jobs on each side of the Atlantic in rotation. But I was incredibly lucky. They were enormously lively and endlessly interested in everything, and they had an enormous number of friends and acquaintances. What made it all the luckier was that they were generation blind. The young, the middle-aged and the old were all around the table together, and from a ridiculously early age, I was allowed to be there. Nobody tried to stop me talking. I must have seemed completely ridiculous, but they put up with me. The result was that I had the kind of conversations you usually don\u2019t have as a child: furious arguments with Milton Friedman [the Nobel prize-winning economist]. That was fantastic, and it taught me that it doesn\u2019t matter two hoots how grand someone is \u2013 either what they are saying stands up to scrutiny, or it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Why did his parents send him to Eton? \u201cMy mother was completely in love with England, with a romantic dream of it that has largely disappeared. Eton was part of that.\u201d Is it true he was the cleverest boy there? In Nicholas Coleridge\u2019s recent memoir [Coleridge, the former boss of the magazine publisher Cond\u00e9 Nast, was his contemporary], he says Letwin was so bright, people struggled to understand him. \u201cKnowing Nicholas, and loving him as I do, I imagine that book is very romanticised, and doesn\u2019t bear much relation to reality. I was perfectly comprehensible, and simple, and not nearly as clever as some. I was at school with Noel Malcolm [the journalist and historian]. He was at least 10 times cleverer than me.\u201d Still, his reputation for a certain kind of cleverness stayed with him. In the run-up to the 2010 general election, one commentator described him as the Conservative party\u2019s Gandalf. From Eton, he went to Cambridge University, Princeton and then Cambridge again, after which he joined Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Policy Unit \u2013 and thus began his somewhat gaffe-prone political career (among other things, in 2011 he was found to have thrown away confidential letters from constituents in a bin in St James\u2019s Park \u2013 a breach of data protection for which he apologised). Is he, I wonder, surprised that our latest prime minister is an Etonian? Shouldn\u2019t things have changed a bit (a lot) by now? \u201cWell, yes,\u201d he says, with a laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him to be leader! The thing about Eton is that it is a privilege and a millstone. It creates an often mistaken impression of what you are, and that\u2019s unfortunate. On the other hand, it gives you a fantastic education, and it encourages you to be confident, to take up positions, and not to be intimidated by authority. But it is a kind of shortcut, and an unfair privilege, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d Predictably, we run out of time at the Legatum Institute. This part of our conversation takes place later, Letwin talking to me on his (yes) mobile phone as he walks to work \u2013 a situation that makes it all the easier for me to ask, rather crossly: are people like him on their way out? Will they ever be on their way out? As ever, though, he\u2019s gracious, mild-mannered. \u201cYes, I think we are, and that is quite right. Society is dramatically more meritocratic and less old school tie than when I was growing up \u2013 though we\u2019ve got some way to go.\u201d Has he learned to check his privilege? He insists that he has. \u201cI\u2019m extremely conscious that in a thousand ways I\u2019ve been fantastically lucky,\u201d he says. \u201cI bless my luck all the time \u2013 and I know that it is luck.\u201d After we hang up, I picture him beetling along the London pavements, his trouser pockets fat with matches, peanuts and Kendal Mint Cake.

But their collapse didn\u2019t put an end to misinformation, which has rippled across the internet and flourished on platforms that resonate with women \u2013 particularly Instagram, where a number of thread pages and accounts have become go-to bibles for young women. Trends such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/cleaneating/\" title=\"\">clean eating</a>, self-care and flat-tummy teas are mutations of the spurious information once available in teen magazines.</p> <p>In my work as a journalist and fact checker, I\u2019ve seen teenagers tell each other that corrosive <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7_hUVrnEZI/\" title=\"\">apple cider vinegar</a> is good for the skin and that eating coconut oil can <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7gaR-OBJLD/\" title=\"\">shorten your period and reduce bleeding</a>.

But this ignores the continuity between the poor guidance printed in these publications and the misleading advice available online today. One of the most pernicious effects of misinformation is everyday physical harm, the small mistakes made by young women resorting to bogus health tips in the absence of legitimate guidance. Today, despite an abundance of online sources, we seem no more willing to have frank and truthful discussions about women\u2019s bodies \u2013 or women\u2019s pain.</p> <p>\u2022 Rachael Krishna is a journalist at Full Fact</p>",

My generation was variously told that it\u2019s normal to be in agony one week a month or for your contraception to destroy your mental health. I was left grossly unprepared for the fairly common realities of being a woman. Recently I asked friends if they had similar experiences: \u201cDid anyone else hear of endometriosis, PCOS or cystitis in your teenage years and from teen magazines?\u201d The responses were telling. \u201cI learned about endometriosis when someone actually listened to me about how painful my periods were,\u201d said one friend. The advice in these magazines has since been mocked and parodied. But if we can now recognise that the guidance was ridiculous, where were the initiatives to replace it with good information? Now, as then, it may simply be that too few people take teenage girls seriously, or care enough about women\u2019s pain. Teen magazines did not survive the digital revolution, and by the 2010s most had become online-only or disappeared altogether. But their collapse didn\u2019t put an end to misinformation, which has rippled across the internet and flourished on platforms that resonate with women \u2013 particularly Instagram, where a number of thread pages and accounts have become go-to bibles for young women. Trends such as clean eating, self-care and flat-tummy teas are mutations of the spurious information once available in teen magazines. In my work as a journalist and fact checker, I\u2019ve seen teenagers tell each other that corrosive apple cider vinegar is good for the skin and that eating coconut oil can shorten your period and reduce bleeding. A deficit of accessible healthcare advice has resulted in a generation muddling together bad advice of the sort found in old teen magazines with expensive modern-day \u201cfixes\u201d. Shaped by the latest wellness fads, young women searching for reliable advice are fed a hodgepodge of digitised playground rumours, jade-egg mysticism and almond milk food vogues. Authority is less dependant on expertise or qualifications than follower count. Many of these accounts are nothing more than crowdsourced puberty manuals with a VSCO filter. There\u2019s a tendency to eulogise teen magazines and demonise their digital successors. But this ignores the continuity between the poor guidance printed in these publications and the misleading advice available online today. One of the most pernicious effects of misinformation is everyday physical harm, the small mistakes made by young women resorting to bogus health tips in the absence of legitimate guidance. Today, despite an abundance of online sources, we seem no more willing to have frank and truthful discussions about women\u2019s bodies \u2013 or women\u2019s pain. \u2022 Rachael Krishna is a journalist at Full Fact",

      "body": "<p>The first time I tried on makeup I was six years old and my older sister decided to cover me in sickly raspberry-coloured glittery lipstick following the \u201cmore is better\u201d mantra and the ethos, \u201cit\u2019s not on the lips, it\u2019s around the lips.\u201d</p> <p>As I was presented to my parents, like a trussed up lamb to the slaughter beamed in from Laboratoire Garnier, Paris, the reaction was resoundingly reticent. Things turned into a Pinter play. My father was quietly horrified, refusing to talk for about six hours, and the incident was largely ignored by my mother who retired to the kitchen to gently throttle a metre of pastry. In the silent judgment that followed, I picked up on the vibe: boys don\u2019t wear makeup. Clearly, I <em>wasn\u2019t</em> born with it, whatever the Maybelline advert may say.</p> <p>My next encounters with makeup were equally bizarre (mainly in various school plays wearing discoloured tones of bronzer, looking like child beauty pageant queen) and didn\u2019t dislodge this idea. \u201cThe word \u2018makeup\u2019 has such feminine connotations,\u201d St\u00e9phane Marais, the makeup artist who has worked with Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez and Emma Watson, told <em>Vogue Homme</em> last year. \u201cNo man wants to admit he\u2019s wearing makeup, as that would necessarily imply that he\u2019s becoming more feminine.\u201d</p> <p>And yet today something (ie my big face) is looking very different. \u201cYou look <em>really</em> good!\u201d a friend says, quickly eyeing my face to work out why. It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve and, nervously, I\u2019ve taken the plunge. I\u2019m wearing a subtle layer of male-specific makeup; concealer under my eyes and tinted moisturiser on my face.

My wife looks disparagingly at me when I say this out loud. She disagrees: \u201cThat\u2019s a nice sentence, but you look the same.\u201d And she\u2019s right. In my neurotic panic at being found out for painting my face, I didn\u2019t really factor in the possibility that absolutely no one would notice. Which shows how far men\u2019s makeup has come.</p> <p>Euromonitor predicts the men\u2019s grooming and beauty market will be worth more than \u00a349bn this year, a quadruple rise from what it generated in 2015. A decade ago the attitude towards it was a hornet\u2019s nest of humour, incredulity and anger.</p> <p>\u201cBack then, men\u2019s makeup was virtually unheard of and men were very much of the mindset that they had to be stereotypical \u2018hurly burly blokes\u2019,\u201d says Alex Dalley, who launched male beauty company <a href=\"https://www.mensmake-up.co.uk/mmuk-man-makeup-for-men-skin-primer.html\" title=\"\">MMUK</a> in 2011. \u201cThe average male grooming routine for men at that time was perhaps a shampoo and shower gel and maybe a moisturiser for the forward thinkers. At that time the concept of MMUK was almost offensive to people and judged as an attack on their masculinity.\u201d As a <a href=\"https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/other_subjects/582000-guyliner-and-manscara-makeup-for-men-launched-by-superdrug-lol\" title=\"\">Mumsnet thread</a> on Superdrug\u2019s men\u2019s beauty line illustrates. \u201cWTF is going on,\u201d wrote user GrinningGorilla about the introduction of guy-liner and manscara in 2008. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I like my men a bit caveman-ish. Makeup FFS? I don\u2019t mind a bit of Nivea moisturiser on my man but makeup???!!!!

The packaging is in no-nonsense (and discreet) black and white, while their online ad is a bid for everyday \u201cwash and go\u201d style usage. In it a massively tattooed Harry Styles lookalike goes in for a baptismal shower. It\u2019s shot like an ad for both the Army Reserve and Head &amp; Shoulders. As he steps out, he puts on moisturiser and concealer alongside his skull ring and his leather jacket.</p> <p>I\u2019m obsessed by the name of the brand and its \u201creal makeup for real blokes\u201d angle. I click on the \u201cabout us\u201d tab and read the story of founder Danny Gray. It\u2019s a story of overcoming adversity (BDD \u2013 body dysmorphic disorder).

      "bodyText": "The first time I tried on makeup I was six years old and my older sister decided to cover me in sickly raspberry-coloured glittery lipstick following the \u201cmore is better\u201d mantra and the ethos, \u201cit\u2019s not on the lips, it\u2019s around the lips.\u201d As I was presented to my parents, like a trussed up lamb to the slaughter beamed in from Laboratoire Garnier, Paris, the reaction was resoundingly reticent. Things turned into a Pinter play. My father was quietly horrified, refusing to talk for about six hours, and the incident was largely ignored by my mother who retired to the kitchen to gently throttle a metre of pastry. In the silent judgment that followed, I picked up on the vibe: boys don\u2019t wear makeup. Clearly, I wasn\u2019t born with it, whatever the Maybelline advert may say. My next encounters with makeup were equally bizarre (mainly in various school plays wearing discoloured tones of bronzer, looking like child beauty pageant queen) and didn\u2019t dislodge this idea. \u201cThe word \u2018makeup\u2019 has such feminine connotations,\u201d St\u00e9phane Marais, the makeup artist who has worked with Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez and Emma Watson, told Vogue Homme last year. \u201cNo man wants to admit he\u2019s wearing makeup, as that would necessarily imply that he\u2019s becoming more feminine.\u201d And yet today something (ie my big face) is looking very different. \u201cYou look really good!\u201d a friend says, quickly eyeing my face to work out why. It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve and, nervously, I\u2019ve taken the plunge. I\u2019m wearing a subtle layer of male-specific makeup; concealer under my eyes and tinted moisturiser on my face. (\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put on with facial hair,\u201d my wife said as she dabbed the stuff on to me earlier in the day.) I consider myself in the mirror and it looks as if I\u2019ve used a very flattering Instagram filter on my face. My wife looks disparagingly at me when I say this out loud. She disagrees: \u201cThat\u2019s a nice sentence, but you look the same.\u201d And she\u2019s right. In my neurotic panic at being found out for painting my face, I didn\u2019t really factor in the possibility that absolutely no one would notice. Which shows how far men\u2019s makeup has come. Euromonitor predicts the men\u2019s grooming and beauty market will be worth more than \u00a349bn this year, a quadruple rise from what it generated in 2015. A decade ago the attitude towards it was a hornet\u2019s nest of humour, incredulity and anger. \u201cBack then, men\u2019s makeup was virtually unheard of and men were very much of the mindset that they had to be stereotypical \u2018hurly burly blokes\u2019,\u201d says Alex Dalley, who launched male beauty company MMUK in 2011. \u201cThe average male grooming routine for men at that time was perhaps a shampoo and shower gel and maybe a moisturiser for the forward thinkers. At that time the concept of MMUK was almost offensive to people and judged as an attack on their masculinity.\u201d As a Mumsnet thread on Superdrug\u2019s men\u2019s beauty line illustrates. \u201cWTF is going on,\u201d wrote user GrinningGorilla about the introduction of guy-liner and manscara in 2008. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I like my men a bit caveman-ish. Makeup FFS? I don\u2019t mind a bit of Nivea moisturiser on my man but makeup???!!!! Next he\u2019ll be wanting to wear my underwear\u2026\u201d In 2017 barely concealed sniggers greeted the reveal that French president Emmanuel Macron spent \u20ac26,000 (\u00a322,000) on makeup in his first three months in office. And in December, the Washington Post hinted that Donald Trump used Bronx Color concealer, which was gleefully reported elsewhere. In the early days of MMUK, Dalley says they would operate like an undercover operation. \u201cMany customers would use different names when ordering and ask that their parcels be delivered in plain envelopes with no reference to makeup on them whatsoever,\u201d he says. \u201cDiscretion was paramount for customers when we began building the brand and helping men find the right products was tricky for an online business.\u201d War Paint is the product I try on for New Year\u2019s Eve. The packaging is in no-nonsense (and discreet) black and white, while their online ad is a bid for everyday \u201cwash and go\u201d style usage. In it a massively tattooed Harry Styles lookalike goes in for a baptismal shower. It\u2019s shot like an ad for both the Army Reserve and Head &amp; Shoulders. As he steps out, he puts on moisturiser and concealer alongside his skull ring and his leather jacket. I\u2019m obsessed by the name of the brand and its \u201creal makeup for real blokes\u201d angle. I click on the \u201cabout us\u201d tab and read the story of founder Danny Gray. It\u2019s a story of overcoming adversity (BDD \u2013 body dysmorphic disorder). At the end of his story is a link to Calm, the anti-suicide charity. \u201cI\u2019m in no way saying that makeup is a cure for bullies, or a miracle serum for low self-esteem,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut using makeup has really helped me manage my BDD.\u201d In a vlog entitled \u201cIs it OK for guys to wear makeup?\u201d beauty blogger Jake Jamie contextualises the rise of male makeup with toxic masculinity and mental health issues, stemming from the \u201cstrong and silent\u201d archetype. \u201cMakeup,\u201d by contrast he says, \u201cenables me to walk down the street with my head held high feeling like the very best version of myself.\u201d It feels like a statement of generational rebellion, as much as a body positive sales pitch.

From Ariana Grande\u2019s endorsement of Bernie Sanders to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s fundraiser with Gwyneth Paltrow, the Hollywood endorsement remains a coveted campaign accolade. And while a recent survey found nine in 10 adults wouldn\u2019t have their vote swayed by a celebrity, the study also found celebrities hold significantly more sway among young voters, a group candidates are eager to reach. Ahead of the California primary on 3 March, here\u2019s who Hollywood\u2019s famous names have said they\u2019ll vote for. Bernie Sanders: pulling in major star power The stars appear aligned for Bernie Sanders, with the candidate receiving more than two dozen endorsements from prominent musicians, actors and athletes. A roll call of musicians including Lizzo, Miley Cyrus, Bon Iver, Willow Smith, Lil Yachty, TI, Zedd, and Noname have voiced their support, while actors including Danny DeVito, Cynthia Nixon, Tessa Thompson, Shailene Woodley, Susan Sarandon, Mark Ruffalo, Jack Nicholson and Justin Long have been feeling the Bern. The comedians John Mulaney, Hasan Minhaj and Jaboukie Young-White, a Daily Show correspondent, are also putting their weight behind the 78-year-old Vermont senator. Other surprising names include Hailey Bieber (model and newlywed to Justin Bieber), the writer and influencer Caroline Calloway, and the celebrated drag queen Lady Bunny. Amy Klobuchar: a slow but steady rise Amy Klobuchar\u2019s Hollywood endorsements have not been as extensive as other candidates\u2019, but they have increased in recent weeks \u2013 perhaps reflective of her recent rise in polling. The American Idol season two runner-up Clay Aiken endorsed the former prosecutor in February. The singer, who is gay, announced his support in a USA Today op-ed titled Why I\u2019m Changing My Vote from Joe Biden to Amy Klobuchar, writing: \u201cThe Democratic party of 2020 is ready for a fresher voice. Klobuchar is that voice.\u201d Other celebrities caught in the \u201cKlobmentum\u201d include the Glee actor Jane Lynch and the writer-director Greg Berlanti (Riverdale, Love, Simon, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina). Pete Buttigieg: Some big (white) names Pete Buttigieg has found big-name support among Hollywood elites such as the actor and Goop CEO Gwyneth Paltrow, who held a fundraiser for the former mayor, the animator Seth MacFarlane and the actor Michael J Fox. However Buttigieg, whose campaign has struggled to reach black voters, suffered an awkward moment when his campaign announced the support of the comedian Keegan-Michael Key, only to walk it back a few hours later. The two did appear together at an event to encourage voter turnout in Nevada, but the campaign clarified it was not an official endorsement (and it wasn\u2019t the first time the campaign has overstated pledges of support from black leaders). Other notable names include the 2018 Miss Black America winner, Ryann Richardson; the actor John Stamos; and the Shameless star Emmy Rossum. Elizabeth Warren: a favorite among Hollywood\u2019s women and LGBTQ+ stars Elizabeth Warren may have slipped in the polls, but her support from Hollywood has not, and especially within its LGBTQ+ community. The Queer Eye star Jonathan Van Ness has been a vocal supporter of the Massachusetts senator. Van Ness, who discussed his own HIV-positive status in 2019, said Warren\u2019s healthcare plan would greatly benefit those living with the condition. \u201cHealthcare shouldn\u2019t be for profit ever, it\u2019s a human right,\u201d Van Ness wrote in his endorsement. Bobby Berk, another Queer Eye star, has also voiced support for Warren. Women in Hollywood are also putting their weight behind Warren: Scarlett Johansson, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Amy Schumer, Patricia Arquette, Busy Phillips, Constance Wu, Amber Tamblyn and Sally Field are standout supporters. Mike Bloomberg: a dark horse The late entrant to the race has secured several endorsements, including the fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, who cited Bloomberg\u2019s \u201csupport for the LGBTQ\u201d as mayor of New York. The Project Runway host Tim Gunn also has endorsed Bloomberg, even joining the candidate\u2019s LGBTQ+ council. The actor Ted Danson (The Good Place, Cheers) endorsed Bloomberg in a lengthy Facebook post, voicing his support for Bloomberg\u2019s commitment to curbing climate change. Judge Judy endorsed the candidate in January, praising his moderate policies and criticizing Trump, saying: \u201cEnough damage has been done. My mission is to see that Mike Bloomberg is in the White House for the next four years.\u201d Joe Biden: not the starriest sky, but a few bright spots While Biden hasn\u2019t received the same enthusiastic, high-profile support from Hollywood as some other candidates, he does have a few big names behind him. In February, the pop icon Cher said she still supported Biden, despite his disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201cI know and believe in him, even if some think he\u2019s a lost cause,\u201d the singer said during an interview on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Other Biden supporters include the actor Tom Hanks, Alec Baldwin and Amy Pascal, the former chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment.",

      "body": "<p>One titan in the room is a challenge. A pair threatens to be a crush. Classical music has many stars. Yet true creative thinkers, who mould the cultural landscape, are a different species: rare, sought after, elusive by nature or necessity. After months of planning, on the eve of announcing a new season, the Barbican Centre has cajoled two such to spend time together on a morning last week, in conversation for the Observer. Both are British but with global reputations. Each has a central role in next year\u2019s programming. Getting a pope and president together could hardly require more meticulous preparation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.askonasholt.com/artists/simon-rattle/\" title=\"\">Simon Rattle</a> arrives promptly. Time-keeping, in every sense, is a conductor\u2019s reason for existing. We\u2019re in \u201chis\u201d green room backstage at the Barbican, home of the London Symphony Orchestra, of which he is music director. He took up the post in 2017, after 16 years at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic, generally reckoned the best orchestra in the world. You can argue over this meaningless term, but it gives you an idea of Rattle\u2019s status. His is one of the few instantly recognisable faces, and names, in his field. He takes a low-key view of superstardom: blue woolly jumper, grey woolly hair, guiding his wheelie suitcase in one hand, a takeaway coffee in the other. Always animated, heavy-browed eyes intense, today he looks more than usually excited. He has news.</p> <p>Is it about the new Centre for Music, the hall estimated to cost \u00a3288m that may one day replace the LSO\u2019s current home at the Barbican? No. If only. We\u2019ll come back to that. Or a job in Munich? Rattle is rumoured to be the favourite to replace the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/01/mariss-jansons-obituary\" title=\"\">late Mariss Jansons</a> at the illustrious Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. \u201cHa, no. I\u2019ve read about that rumour too. Look, it\u2019s a wonderful job, a wonderful orchestra. If I were free we might be talking\u2026\u201d So that\u2019s a no, for now. Surely it\u2019s not baby news? Rattle has five children: two grown-up sons with the American soprano Elise Ross; two school-aged sons, and a daughter, now five, with his third wife, the Czech mezzo-soprano <a href=\"https://www.kozena.cz/en\" title=\"\">Magdalena Ko\u017een\u00e1</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve become a grandfather!\u201dhe exclaims. The baby boy, born hours earlier, is the first child of Rattle\u2019s eldest son, <a href=\"https://www.southbanksinfonia.co.uk/musicians-profile/10183/sacha-rattle/\" title=\"\">Sacha</a>, a formidable solo clarinettist.</p> <p>Discussion of labour and birth is interrupted by the advent, a little late, of <a href=\"http://www.thomasades.com/\" title=\"\">Thomas Ad\u00e8s</a>, composer, virtuoso pianist, conductor, musical phenomenon. Tall, informally chic in black, he resists the culinary possibilities of a Barbican breakfast and asks for a banana. Given his early-to-work habit, he has probably already been at his desk a few hours. He has a ballet to complete (<em><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/the-dante-project-by-wayne-mcgregor-details\" title=\"\">The Dante Project</a></em>, premiering at the Royal Opera House in May. \u201cI\u2019m currently mid-Purgatory\u201d). A centrepiece of the forthcoming Barbican season will be a celebration of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s 50th birthday. \u201cI\u2019m still 48 so I\u2019m not terribly into my 50th to be honest, not my favourite thing. I think I said to the Barbican, if you\u2019re going to do something, please do it properly, thinking the whole thing would go away. Instead of which\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Ad\u00e8s has an engaging way of trailing off with a fruity, rollicking, bass-baritone laugh. To finish the sentence for him: instead of which, an entire strand of the Barbican\u2019s multilayered season is devoted to Ad\u00e8s. Rattle, since his years with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra a champion of the composer, will launch the LSO season with the Luxury Suite from Ad\u00e8s\u2019s first opera, <em>Powder Her Face</em>. Ad\u00e8s himself will return later in the season to conduct, among other things, his own <em>Totentanz</em>. It\u2019s a formidable commitment to a living composer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just come out from under Gerald Barry,\u201d Ad\u00e8s plunges straight in, referring to Barry\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/08/gerald-barry-alices-adventures-under-ground-royal-opera-barbican-beethoven-weekender-250\" title=\"\">Alice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground</a></em>, which recently finished a triumphant run at Covent Garden, conducted by Ad\u00e8s. \u201cIt went off like a rocket.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I heard. Everyone was worried it couldn\u2019t be produced\u2026\u201d responds Rattle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"888184898d5861d6be537d982ec40bcc9ff881eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/888184898d5861d6be537d982ec40bcc9ff881eb/0_56_2598_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ad\u00e8s conducting the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ad\u00e8s conducting the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BCMG/Clive Barda</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was a brilliant production.\u201d</p> <p>Realising this could be an entertaining but extensive diversion, I interrupt. How did he and Rattle meet?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so long ago I can\u2019t recall\u2026 was it the 19th century?\u201d Ad\u00e8s jokes.</p> <p>\u201cWe both had dark hair\u2026\u201d Rattle retorts. Ad\u00e8s looks worried and clutches his head. He is still essentially dark-haired.</p> <p>Rattle remembers precisely. \u201cIt was the grapevine. And it turned out to be right. I was told by several sources that there was this extraordinary young musician, still a student [at King\u2019s College, Cambridge]. I had a look at his music and I asked, has he written an orchestral piece, and the answer came back, not yet\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d done a small, student-y one called \u2026but all shall be well, which still gets done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve conducted it\u2026\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://thomasades.com/compositions/asyla\" title=\"\">Asyla</a> </em>(1997), Ad\u00e8s\u2019s first major orchestral piece, was commissioned by Rattle for the CBSO. He included it in his inaugural concert with the Berlin Philharmonic and persuaded Ad\u00e8s to write another big work, <em><a href=\"http://thomasades.com/compositions/tevot\" title=\"\">Tevot</a></em> (2007), for the Berlin players. \u201cStill my favourite moment was when I first looked at the score of <em>Asyla</em>. There I was, at my great age of fortysomething, saying to Tom, um, you know, I really don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to play this bit. And this very quiet, deep voice said to me [mimics Ad\u00e8s] \u2018I actually think you\u2019ll be able to\u2019. And actually we could.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Ad\u00e8s continues. \u201cI remember arriving in Birmingham for the first rehearsal, and as usual I was slightly late. I opened the door and this sound was coming out which of course I knew, but to hear it for real \u2013 you were all doing it brilliantly, and I thought, something\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat must be such a strange thing for a composer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so weird. It\u2019s what you had in your head but it\u2019s totally different when you hear it.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-UAaMwwjqA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j-UAaMwwjqA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-UAaMwwjqA\">Watch Simon Rattle conduct the third movement of Asyla by Thomas Ad\u00e8s.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like Bart\u00f3k and his <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xnN9N7IgLs&amp;list=ULhGMZPUbSsnM&amp;index=761\" title=\"\">Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta</a></em>,\u201d Rattle goes on. \u201cHe said I\u2019ve written this piece, I can\u2019t wait to hear it because I can\u2019t imagine what it will be like. I suppose no one had used that combination of instruments before.\u201d Rattle\u2019s conversation is peppered with quotations and anecdotes (including one about the Czech composer Jan\u00e1\u010dek teaching his three chickens to say goodnight).</p> <p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Ad\u00e8s agrees. \u201cFor me, with <em>Asyla</em>, it was the cowbells, and the piano tuned a quarter-tone lower. I didn\u2019t know what it\u2019d sound like. Now I use a pretty crude, simple headphone thing to record layers and see what they sound like. In those days that was out of the question\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Ad\u00e8s, the oldest of three brothers, was born in London in 1971. He spends around half his time here, half in Los Angeles, up in the Hollywood hills. His mother is the art historian <a href=\"https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/dawn-ades-interview\" title=\"\">Dawn Ad\u00e8s</a>, a specialist in surrealism, his father <a href=\"http://www.timothyades.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Timothy Ad\u00e8s</a> a poet and translator. Ad\u00e8s senior\u2019s eclectic record collection, from Spanish folk to Steeleye Span to opera to <em>The Rite of Spring</em>, was a source of fascination to his son. Ad\u00e8s may not have realised, as a child, just how fertile this cultural hinterland was.</p> <p>\u201cI know my mum was going all over the world curating exhibitions, but that didn\u2019t necessarily filter into my musical life. I was just a kid at home in north London, going to the library in Crouch End, getting out scores and records, or cassettes, spending hours by myself at the piano. I hated going to school. I especially hated sports day. I\u2019d invent phantom tummy aches and stay at home and listen to these records.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can relate to that,\u201d adds Rattle.</p> <p>The young Ad\u00e8s wrote his Opus 1,<em> <a href=\"http://thomasades.com/compositions/five_eliot_landscapes\" title=\"\">Five Eliot Landscapes</a></em>, when he was 18. <em>Powder Her Face</em> (1995), with a libretto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/29/classicalmusicandopera2\" title=\"\">by the novelist Philip Hensher</a>, made headlines for its sumptuous musical depiction of a blowjob, but its creative poise, wit and economy give it lasting profile. In addition to instrumental works elsewhere, operas for the Royal Opera House followed: <em>The Tempest</em> (2004) and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/31/the-exterminating-angel-review-thomas-ades-salzburg\" title=\"\">The Exterminating Angel</a></em> (2016). Ad\u00e8s has always multitasked: as a virtuoso pianist, as a conductor, and as a programme director of festivals in Aldeburgh and Tanglewood, Massachusetts.</p> <p>\u201cI was fairly chaotic to start with. I\u2019ve got quite good at juggling now. I have more routine. I tend to start sketching things way in advance, as soon as I know I\u2019m doing something \u2013 it\u2019s quite odd. It starts to grow inside you. And you can go back, even a year later, and think, oh that\u2019s not quite how it goes\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt marinates\u2026\u201d Rattle suggests.</p> <p>They start talking about Jan\u00e1\u010dek, beloved of both of them. Ad\u00e8s is about to conduct his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAmuvFglu0g\" title=\"\">Sinfonietta</a>, \u201cmy absolutely favourite piece of music. I nearly brought the score with me for some industrial espionage \u2013 I thought you might give me some tips.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier than you think \u2013 slightly,\u201d Rattle says, reassuringly. His own career conducting opera began with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s <em>The Cunning Little Vixen</em> at Glyndebourne in 1977. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m married to a Czech, and we walk in the forest where Jan\u00e1\u010dek walked, where the opera is set. I first heard his Glagolitic Mass listening to the transistor in my parents\u2019 kitchen in Liverpool as a teenager and I thought: wow.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4cbff673a92e8c9f951b34cfb519cf13025c6c86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cbff673a92e8c9f951b34cfb519cf13025c6c86/0_0_4500_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Rattle conducting the LSO at the Barbican, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Rattle conducting the LSO at the Barbican, 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Allan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rattle describes his upbringing as \u201cmiddle-class, comfortable, but I was a scholarship boy who for that reason had a chance to learn piano, violin and percussion.\u201d The younger child of Denis and Pauline Rattle, with an older sister who used to bring him records and scores home from Liverpool\u2019s libraries, he was surrounded by music all his life. \u201cAnd she knows my family,\u201c he interjects, jabbing a conductorly hand in my direction as if waiting for a late entry from the French horns.</p> <p>It\u2019s true, I did know Rattle\u2019s late parents a little (and, by chance have also met Ad\u00e8s\u2019s). We met at Dartington Summer School of Music when Rattle, already a star, was music director of the CBSO. Denis Rattle, a twinkling businessman with a love of Shakespeare, was a classy jazz pianist who managed to make the left-hand part of a Mozart sonata resemble Art Tatum. Rattle tells how his mother, in her 20s, ran a record shop. His father went in, fancied her and asked her to go dancing. She refused. After a year he said: \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been in every day for a year, and bought a record every time. Will you go dancing now?\u201d And she said: \u201cI suppose I\u2019d better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s why we had such a vast collection of 78s \u2013 lots of jazz, but classical too. It was a long time until I knew the reason.\u201d</p> <p>Ad\u00e8s hasn\u2019t heard that story. Both are touched by Rattle\u2019s tale of love\u2019s quest. Conversation turns to Beethoven, his 250th anniversary year, fear of overkill. Ad\u00e8s recently conducted the symphonies <a href=\"https://brittensinfonia.com/beethoven-symphony-cycle/\" title=\"\">with the Britten Sinfonia</a>. \u201cHis music is transcendent. He\u2019s always pushing against the sky, reinventing the universe. You can imagine he\u2019d have been absolutely impossible. I love his letters \u2013 they\u2019re very funny. I can picture him. I imagine I\u2019d send him an email and get a very tart reply.\u201d</p> <p>Rattle is mid-Beethoven <a href=\"https://lso.co.uk/whats-on/2019-20-season/beethoven-250.html\" title=\"\">with the LSO</a>. \u201cHe demands more of you than any human. I always think how useful it would be, like now, I\u2019m doing Beethoven 9, if I could get him on the phone and say, Look, Ludwig, I could never get that bit right\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI get the feeling that, like certain composers one knows, he might have been quite difficult.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I suspect. But you\u2019re one of the more normal ones and that\u2019s a scary thought.\u201d</p> <p>[Laughter] Ad\u00e8s: \u201cIf you\u2019re a performer yourself, you tend to be a bit more forgiving\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Rattle: \u201cBut as a conductor you are incredibly grateful when someone knows exactly what they want. Even if you do want to strangle them.\u201d</p> <p>They have an unprintable rant about a couple of living composers.</p> <p>\u201cAs a composer you have to ask yourself, have I written down exactly what I want?\u201d Ad\u00e8s ponders. \u201cI always think it\u2019s my fault. That\u2019s because I\u2019m English\u2026 [laughter] My first impulse is to apologise.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f9d21be36d4e65b6cb535d4ee4a830f512ae1e86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9d21be36d4e65b6cb535d4ee4a830f512ae1e86/0_0_1920_2560/750.jpg\" alt=\"The conductor Simon Rattle, left, and composer Thomas Ad\u00e8s.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The conductor Simon Rattle, left, and composer Thomas Ad\u00e8s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His natural courtesy does not extend to Brexit, which has left him \u201cfuelled with fury. It\u2019s a disaster for music. It\u2019s like a collective mass organ failure, like watching someone die. The motives for it were so wrong\u2026 all I can hope is that it will be short-lived.\u201d Inevitably, he adds: \u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>Visas and travel are not the only issue. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky. I haven\u2019t known life outside the EU. I think of friends starting out \u2013 composers in their 20s. Their opportunities have been slashed by 90%. It may not make a difference. But they\u2019ve been cut off from so much of Europe and its musical culture: commissions, tours, grants, simply going to live abroad for a while. It might be possible but it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p> <p>Rattle is only slightly more temperate. \u201cWe have 26 nationalities in the LSO. Just making sure they are able to work has already been a massive task. Our job now is to get on with it, as musicians do. No one wants it to be a disaster. But we are diminished. Can we see any type of advantage, for music, in any way at all? Absolutely not. I have racked my brain every which way because I wish to be optimistic.\u201d</p> <p>As for the Centre for Music, currently stymied by complex delays in moving the Museum of London to Smithfield, Rattle\u2019s patience is being tested: \u201cWe have done a huge amount of work already and would be ready to start immediately. We\u2019ve had tremendous support from the City, but it\u2019s clear we are in a queue and I am extremely concerned at the lack of urgency. Whatever the question may be, where we are sitting now is certainly not the answer. The next six months are going to be crucial and we are going to have to be extremely creative: what can we dream up to make it work?\u201d</p> <p>Composer and conductor go off to have their picture taken. The photographer has to tell them to stop gassing. They\u2019re discussing a detail in one of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s scores. Would this bit be better on a trombone, Rattle wonders, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve never suggested anything like that to a composer before\u2026\u201d It\u2019s lucky Beethoven isn\u2019t alive to take that call. Who knows how the Ninth Symphony might have ended up.</p> <h2>Thomas Ad\u00e8s at 50: Barbican highlights</h2> <p>\u2022 Simon Rattle opens the London Symphony Orchestra season with Ad\u00e8s\u2019s Luxury Suite from <em>Powder Her Face </em>(13 Sept).</p> <p>\u2022 Cleveland Orchestra/Welser-M\u00f6st: Ad\u00e8s\u2019s<em> Angel Symphony </em>(12 Oct)<em>.</em></p> <p>\u2022 Australian Chamber Orchestra/Tognetti: Ad\u00e8s world premiere (20 Oct).</p> <p>\u2022 Birthday concert: Ad\u00e8s conducts the LSO, featuring his <em>Totentanz</em> (7 March 2021).</p> <p>\u2022 BBC Symphony Orchestra/Sakari Oramo: Ad\u00e8s\u2019s <em>Asyla</em> (30 April 2021).</p> <p>\u2022 Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group/Ad\u00e8s: late-night Green Umbrella concert (21 May 2021).</p> <p>\u2022 LA Phil/Dudamel in <em>Dante:</em> concert version of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s ballet score (22 May 2021).</p> <p>\u2022 Britten Sinfonia/Ad\u00e8s: concert of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s <em>The Tempest</em> (28 June 2021).</p> <h2>Other Barbican 2020/21 classical music season highlights</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>London Symphony Orchestra </strong>Simon Rattle conducts Berg\u2019s <em>Wozzeck</em>, with Christian Gerhaher in the title role; Rattle explores music by Hindemith, with Beethoven piano concertos, soloist Krystian Zimerman.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>BBC Symphony Orchestra </strong>John Adams conducts the UK premiere of his opera <em>Girls of the Golden West.</em></p></li> <li><p><strong>Britten Sinfonia</strong> and Ian Bostridge: the tenor explores folk-inspired chamber music.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Academy of Ancient Music </strong>The Elder and Younger Mozart, performed by Robert Levin.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Barbican presents </strong>Joyce DiDonato \u2013 the mezzo-soprano is a featured artist; Antonio Pappano \u2013 as conductor with the LSO and the Coro dell\u2019Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Rome; as pianist in recitals, with the tenor Jonas Kaufmann and mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili.</p></li> <li><p>Sheku Kanneh-Mason \u2013 the cellist makes his Barbican recital debut, with his sister and pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>The Barbican\u2019s 2020-21 classical music season runs from September to July 2021.

      "bodyText": "One titan in the room is a challenge. A pair threatens to be a crush. Classical music has many stars. Yet true creative thinkers, who mould the cultural landscape, are a different species: rare, sought after, elusive by nature or necessity. After months of planning, on the eve of announcing a new season, the Barbican Centre has cajoled two such to spend time together on a morning last week, in conversation for the Observer. Both are British but with global reputations. Each has a central role in next year\u2019s programming. Getting a pope and president together could hardly require more meticulous preparation. Simon Rattle arrives promptly. Time-keeping, in every sense, is a conductor\u2019s reason for existing. We\u2019re in \u201chis\u201d green room backstage at the Barbican, home of the London Symphony Orchestra, of which he is music director. He took up the post in 2017, after 16 years at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic, generally reckoned the best orchestra in the world. You can argue over this meaningless term, but it gives you an idea of Rattle\u2019s status. His is one of the few instantly recognisable faces, and names, in his field. He takes a low-key view of superstardom: blue woolly jumper, grey woolly hair, guiding his wheelie suitcase in one hand, a takeaway coffee in the other. Always animated, heavy-browed eyes intense, today he looks more than usually excited. He has news. Is it about the new Centre for Music, the hall estimated to cost \u00a3288m that may one day replace the LSO\u2019s current home at the Barbican? No. If only. We\u2019ll come back to that. Or a job in Munich? Rattle is rumoured to be the favourite to replace the late Mariss Jansons at the illustrious Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. \u201cHa, no. I\u2019ve read about that rumour too. Look, it\u2019s a wonderful job, a wonderful orchestra. If I were free we might be talking\u2026\u201d So that\u2019s a no, for now. Surely it\u2019s not baby news? Rattle has five children: two grown-up sons with the American soprano Elise Ross; two school-aged sons, and a daughter, now five, with his third wife, the Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Ko\u017een\u00e1. \u201cI\u2019ve become a grandfather!\u201dhe exclaims. The baby boy, born hours earlier, is the first child of Rattle\u2019s eldest son, Sacha, a formidable solo clarinettist. Discussion of labour and birth is interrupted by the advent, a little late, of Thomas Ad\u00e8s, composer, virtuoso pianist, conductor, musical phenomenon. Tall, informally chic in black, he resists the culinary possibilities of a Barbican breakfast and asks for a banana. Given his early-to-work habit, he has probably already been at his desk a few hours. He has a ballet to complete (The Dante Project, premiering at the Royal Opera House in May. \u201cI\u2019m currently mid-Purgatory\u201d). A centrepiece of the forthcoming Barbican season will be a celebration of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s 50th birthday. \u201cI\u2019m still 48 so I\u2019m not terribly into my 50th to be honest, not my favourite thing. I think I said to the Barbican, if you\u2019re going to do something, please do it properly, thinking the whole thing would go away. Instead of which\u2026\u201d Ad\u00e8s has an engaging way of trailing off with a fruity, rollicking, bass-baritone laugh. To finish the sentence for him: instead of which, an entire strand of the Barbican\u2019s multilayered season is devoted to Ad\u00e8s. Rattle, since his years with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra a champion of the composer, will launch the LSO season with the Luxury Suite from Ad\u00e8s\u2019s first opera, Powder Her Face. Ad\u00e8s himself will return later in the season to conduct, among other things, his own Totentanz. It\u2019s a formidable commitment to a living composer. \u201cI\u2019ve just come out from under Gerald Barry,\u201d Ad\u00e8s plunges straight in, referring to Barry\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground, which recently finished a triumphant run at Covent Garden, conducted by Ad\u00e8s. \u201cIt went off like a rocket.\u201d \u201cSo I heard. Everyone was worried it couldn\u2019t be produced\u2026\u201d responds Rattle. \u201cIt was a brilliant production.\u201d Realising this could be an entertaining but extensive diversion, I interrupt. How did he and Rattle meet? \u201cIt\u2019s so long ago I can\u2019t recall\u2026 was it the 19th century?\u201d Ad\u00e8s jokes. \u201cWe both had dark hair\u2026\u201d Rattle retorts. Ad\u00e8s looks worried and clutches his head. He is still essentially dark-haired. Rattle remembers precisely. \u201cIt was the grapevine. And it turned out to be right. I was told by several sources that there was this extraordinary young musician, still a student [at King\u2019s College, Cambridge]. I had a look at his music and I asked, has he written an orchestral piece, and the answer came back, not yet\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019d done a small, student-y one called \u2026but all shall be well, which still gets done.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019ve conducted it\u2026\u201d Asyla (1997), Ad\u00e8s\u2019s first major orchestral piece, was commissioned by Rattle for the CBSO. He included it in his inaugural concert with the Berlin Philharmonic and persuaded Ad\u00e8s to write another big work, Tevot (2007), for the Berlin players. \u201cStill my favourite moment was when I first looked at the score of Asyla. There I was, at my great age of fortysomething, saying to Tom, um, you know, I really don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to play this bit. And this very quiet, deep voice said to me [mimics Ad\u00e8s] \u2018I actually think you\u2019ll be able to\u2019. And actually we could.\u201d \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Ad\u00e8s continues. \u201cI remember arriving in Birmingham for the first rehearsal, and as usual I was slightly late. I opened the door and this sound was coming out which of course I knew, but to hear it for real \u2013 you were all doing it brilliantly, and I thought, something\u2019s happening.\u201d \u201cThat must be such a strange thing for a composer.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so weird. It\u2019s what you had in your head but it\u2019s totally different when you hear it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like Bart\u00f3k and his Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta,\u201d Rattle goes on. \u201cHe said I\u2019ve written this piece, I can\u2019t wait to hear it because I can\u2019t imagine what it will be like. I suppose no one had used that combination of instruments before.\u201d Rattle\u2019s conversation is peppered with quotations and anecdotes (including one about the Czech composer Jan\u00e1\u010dek teaching his three chickens to say goodnight). \u201cExactly,\u201d Ad\u00e8s agrees. \u201cFor me, with Asyla, it was the cowbells, and the piano tuned a quarter-tone lower. I didn\u2019t know what it\u2019d sound like. Now I use a pretty crude, simple headphone thing to record layers and see what they sound like. In those days that was out of the question\u2026\u201d Ad\u00e8s, the oldest of three brothers, was born in London in 1971. He spends around half his time here, half in Los Angeles, up in the Hollywood hills. His mother is the art historian Dawn Ad\u00e8s, a specialist in surrealism, his father Timothy Ad\u00e8s a poet and translator. Ad\u00e8s senior\u2019s eclectic record collection, from Spanish folk to Steeleye Span to opera to The Rite of Spring, was a source of fascination to his son. Ad\u00e8s may not have realised, as a child, just how fertile this cultural hinterland was. \u201cI know my mum was going all over the world curating exhibitions, but that didn\u2019t necessarily filter into my musical life. I was just a kid at home in north London, going to the library in Crouch End, getting out scores and records, or cassettes, spending hours by myself at the piano. I hated going to school. I especially hated sports day. I\u2019d invent phantom tummy aches and stay at home and listen to these records.\u201d \u201cI can relate to that,\u201d adds Rattle. The young Ad\u00e8s wrote his Opus 1, Five Eliot Landscapes, when he was 18. Powder Her Face (1995), with a libretto by the novelist Philip Hensher, made headlines for its sumptuous musical depiction of a blowjob, but its creative poise, wit and economy give it lasting profile. In addition to instrumental works elsewhere, operas for the Royal Opera House followed: The Tempest (2004) and The Exterminating Angel (2016). Ad\u00e8s has always multitasked: as a virtuoso pianist, as a conductor, and as a programme director of festivals in Aldeburgh and Tanglewood, Massachusetts. \u201cI was fairly chaotic to start with. I\u2019ve got quite good at juggling now. I have more routine. I tend to start sketching things way in advance, as soon as I know I\u2019m doing something \u2013 it\u2019s quite odd. It starts to grow inside you. And you can go back, even a year later, and think, oh that\u2019s not quite how it goes\u2026\u201d \u201cIt marinates\u2026\u201d Rattle suggests. They start talking about Jan\u00e1\u010dek, beloved of both of them. Ad\u00e8s is about to conduct his Sinfonietta, \u201cmy absolutely favourite piece of music. I nearly brought the score with me for some industrial espionage \u2013 I thought you might give me some tips.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easier than you think \u2013 slightly,\u201d Rattle says, reassuringly. His own career conducting opera began with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s The Cunning Little Vixen at Glyndebourne in 1977. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m married to a Czech, and we walk in the forest where Jan\u00e1\u010dek walked, where the opera is set. I first heard his Glagolitic Mass listening to the transistor in my parents\u2019 kitchen in Liverpool as a teenager and I thought: wow.\u201d Rattle describes his upbringing as \u201cmiddle-class, comfortable, but I was a scholarship boy who for that reason had a chance to learn piano, violin and percussion.\u201d The younger child of Denis and Pauline Rattle, with an older sister who used to bring him records and scores home from Liverpool\u2019s libraries, he was surrounded by music all his life. \u201cAnd she knows my family,\u201c he interjects, jabbing a conductorly hand in my direction as if waiting for a late entry from the French horns. It\u2019s true, I did know Rattle\u2019s late parents a little (and, by chance have also met Ad\u00e8s\u2019s). We met at Dartington Summer School of Music when Rattle, already a star, was music director of the CBSO. Denis Rattle, a twinkling businessman with a love of Shakespeare, was a classy jazz pianist who managed to make the left-hand part of a Mozart sonata resemble Art Tatum. Rattle tells how his mother, in her 20s, ran a record shop. His father went in, fancied her and asked her to go dancing. She refused. After a year he said: \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been in every day for a year, and bought a record every time. Will you go dancing now?\u201d And she said: \u201cI suppose I\u2019d better.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s why we had such a vast collection of 78s \u2013 lots of jazz, but classical too. It was a long time until I knew the reason.\u201d Ad\u00e8s hasn\u2019t heard that story. Both are touched by Rattle\u2019s tale of love\u2019s quest. Conversation turns to Beethoven, his 250th anniversary year, fear of overkill. Ad\u00e8s recently conducted the symphonies with the Britten Sinfonia. \u201cHis music is transcendent. He\u2019s always pushing against the sky, reinventing the universe. You can imagine he\u2019d have been absolutely impossible. I love his letters \u2013 they\u2019re very funny. I can picture him. I imagine I\u2019d send him an email and get a very tart reply.\u201d Rattle is mid-Beethoven with the LSO. \u201cHe demands more of you than any human. I always think how useful it would be, like now, I\u2019m doing Beethoven 9, if I could get him on the phone and say, Look, Ludwig, I could never get that bit right\u2026\u201d \u201cI get the feeling that, like certain composers one knows, he might have been quite difficult.\u201d \u201cYes, I suspect. But you\u2019re one of the more normal ones and that\u2019s a scary thought.\u201d [Laughter] Ad\u00e8s: \u201cIf you\u2019re a performer yourself, you tend to be a bit more forgiving\u2026\u201d Rattle: \u201cBut as a conductor you are incredibly grateful when someone knows exactly what they want. Even if you do want to strangle them.\u201d They have an unprintable rant about a couple of living composers. \u201cAs a composer you have to ask yourself, have I written down exactly what I want?\u201d Ad\u00e8s ponders. \u201cI always think it\u2019s my fault. That\u2019s because I\u2019m English\u2026 [laughter] My first impulse is to apologise.\u201d His natural courtesy does not extend to Brexit, which has left him \u201cfuelled with fury. It\u2019s a disaster for music. It\u2019s like a collective mass organ failure, like watching someone die. The motives for it were so wrong\u2026 all I can hope is that it will be short-lived.\u201d Inevitably, he adds: \u201cSorry.\u201d Visas and travel are not the only issue. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky. I haven\u2019t known life outside the EU. I think of friends starting out \u2013 composers in their 20s. Their opportunities have been slashed by 90%. It may not make a difference. But they\u2019ve been cut off from so much of Europe and its musical culture: commissions, tours, grants, simply going to live abroad for a while. It might be possible but it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d Rattle is only slightly more temperate. \u201cWe have 26 nationalities in the LSO. Just making sure they are able to work has already been a massive task. Our job now is to get on with it, as musicians do. No one wants it to be a disaster. But we are diminished. Can we see any type of advantage, for music, in any way at all? Absolutely not. I have racked my brain every which way because I wish to be optimistic.\u201d As for the Centre for Music, currently stymied by complex delays in moving the Museum of London to Smithfield, Rattle\u2019s patience is being tested: \u201cWe have done a huge amount of work already and would be ready to start immediately. We\u2019ve had tremendous support from the City, but it\u2019s clear we are in a queue and I am extremely concerned at the lack of urgency. Whatever the question may be, where we are sitting now is certainly not the answer. The next six months are going to be crucial and we are going to have to be extremely creative: what can we dream up to make it work?\u201d Composer and conductor go off to have their picture taken. The photographer has to tell them to stop gassing. They\u2019re discussing a detail in one of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s scores. Would this bit be better on a trombone, Rattle wonders, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve never suggested anything like that to a composer before\u2026\u201d It\u2019s lucky Beethoven isn\u2019t alive to take that call. Who knows how the Ninth Symphony might have ended up.

      "body": "<p>Every budget is billed in advance as the most crucial in recent times, but then most are instantly forgotten. The one Rishi Sunak will deliver in just over two weeks\u2019 time may be one of the few that justifies the hype.</p> <p>The reason so much is resting on the shoulders of the tyro chancellor is that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/21/smaller-than-expected-january-surplus-will-be-blow-to-new-chancellor-public-finances-budget\">budget</a> needs to satisfy a number of different audiences: the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who gave Boris Johnson his 80-seat majority; traditional Conservative voters; the financial markets; and foreign governments looking to see whether the UK will take a lead before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">op26 climate change conference</a> in Glasgow in November.</p> <p>A package that pushes all the necessary buttons is not going to be easy. To take one example, making tax relief on pension contributions less generous for those on higher incomes would help the chancellor\u2019s sums add up and win credibility with the financial markets but antagonise the Tory party\u2019s natural supporters.</p> <p>Sunak\u2019s immediate task is to announce targets for the public finances that are easier to hit than the ones currently in place, but not so weak that the markets take fright.</p> <p>Moving the goalposts will give the government more scope to borrow for infrastructure projects that need to be underway soon if they are to be completed in time to deliver a political dividend for Johnson at the next general election.</p> <p>But unless he can also find a way of making the budget consistent with the government\u2019s 2050 net zero carbon target for the economy a diplomatic failure of catastrophic proportions looms at the end of the year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">op26</a> is the most important summit the UK has hosted since the G8 met at Gleneagles in 2005 \u2013 and the task facing the government is much more daunting than it was then.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/08/g8.development1\">Gleneagles summit</a> was all about the rich countries of the west agreeing to provide debt relief and higher levels of aid for poor nations. Most of the debts would never have been paid anyway and the doubling of aid was easily affordable at a time when the global economy was booming.</p> <p>Even so, it took a lot of time and effort to chisel out a deal. The then prime minister, Tony Blair, and the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, both lobbied hard to overcome resistance to their plan, expending plenty of political capital in the process. Public opinion \u2013 channeled through the Make Poverty History campaign \u2013 was effectively mobilised. Crucially, the Labour government showed leadership by committing to the UN target to spend 0.7% of national income on aid.</p> <p>A deal in Glasgow is going to be immensely more difficult than it was up the road in Perthshire 15 years ago. For a start, there are many more countries involved. For another, some of the biggest players are actively hostile to the idea of setting tougher emissions targets. The contrast between George W Bush \u2013 who was interested in Africa \u2013 and the climate emergency denier who currently occupies the White House is stark. But the US is not going to be alone in Glasgow: Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia will all prove hard to break down.</p> <p>After failing to persuade David Cameron to do the job, Johnson has put the business secretary, Alok Sharma, in charge of summit preparations. But Sharma does not have the heavy-hitting international reputation that is going to impress other governments. That will require Johnson to demonstrate his personal commitment to making Glasgow a success.</p> <p>All of which brings us back to the budget, which provides an opportunity for the government to announce measures that will accelerate the UK\u2019s progress towards a decarbonised economy. These need to be more than the mooted increase in fuel duty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Green New Deal Group (of which I am a member) has estimated it will cost about \u00a3100bn a year for 20 years to make the transition to a net zero carbon economy. Investment on that sort of scale would be necessary to make the UK\u2019s 30m buildings energy efficient, turn buildings into power stations through the use of solar panels, and invest in renewable energy.</p> <p>So where\u2019s the money going to come from? One answer would be a form of green quantitative easing \u2013 money creation by the Bank of England that would pay for the decarbonisation of the economy rather than, as was the case during and after the financial crisis, being pumped into the banking system. The government doesn\u2019t seem keen on this approach, even though there are plenty of economists who think it is wholly feasible.</p> <p>Another possibility would be for the government to borrow the money in the usual way, but this doesn\u2019t appeal to ministers either.</p> <p>There is, though, a third option. At present about \u00a3100bn year is paid into pension schemes, all of it eligible for tax relief currently worth \u00a354bn a year. There is also tax relief on the \u00a370bn a year invested in Isas. The GND <a href=\"https://greennewdealgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/How-to-pay-for-the-Green-New-Deal.pdf\">proposal</a> is that 25% of pension contributions should go into green new deal investment in exchange for that tax relief and that all new Isa contributions \u2013 which currently go into cash or shares \u2013 should be invested in green new deal bonds issued by the government at a guaranteed rate of interest.</p> <p>The idea is to provide a stream of income to transform the economy as well as offering a new secure investment vehicle for savers. Insurance companies and pension funds no longer risk being left with stranded fossil fuel assets and the City would be the place to do green finance. Above all, a strong signal of intent would be sent to the rest of the world.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every budget is billed in advance as the most crucial in recent times, but then most are instantly forgotten. The one Rishi Sunak will deliver in just over two weeks\u2019 time may be one of the few that justifies the hype. The reason so much is resting on the shoulders of the tyro chancellor is that the budget needs to satisfy a number of different audiences: the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who gave Boris Johnson his 80-seat majority; traditional Conservative voters; the financial markets; and foreign governments looking to see whether the UK will take a lead before the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November. A package that pushes all the necessary buttons is not going to be easy. To take one example, making tax relief on pension contributions less generous for those on higher incomes would help the chancellor\u2019s sums add up and win credibility with the financial markets but antagonise the Tory party\u2019s natural supporters. Sunak\u2019s immediate task is to announce targets for the public finances that are easier to hit than the ones currently in place, but not so weak that the markets take fright. Moving the goalposts will give the government more scope to borrow for infrastructure projects that need to be underway soon if they are to be completed in time to deliver a political dividend for Johnson at the next general election. But unless he can also find a way of making the budget consistent with the government\u2019s 2050 net zero carbon target for the economy a diplomatic failure of catastrophic proportions looms at the end of the year. The Cop26 is the most important summit the UK has hosted since the G8 met at Gleneagles in 2005 \u2013 and the task facing the government is much more daunting than it was then. The Gleneagles summit was all about the rich countries of the west agreeing to provide debt relief and higher levels of aid for poor nations. Most of the debts would never have been paid anyway and the doubling of aid was easily affordable at a time when the global economy was booming. Even so, it took a lot of time and effort to chisel out a deal. The then prime minister, Tony Blair, and the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, both lobbied hard to overcome resistance to their plan, expending plenty of political capital in the process. Public opinion \u2013 channeled through the Make Poverty History campaign \u2013 was effectively mobilised. Crucially, the Labour government showed leadership by committing to the UN target to spend 0.7% of national income on aid. A deal in Glasgow is going to be immensely more difficult than it was up the road in Perthshire 15 years ago. For a start, there are many more countries involved. For another, some of the biggest players are actively hostile to the idea of setting tougher emissions targets. The contrast between George W Bush \u2013 who was interested in Africa \u2013 and the climate emergency denier who currently occupies the White House is stark. But the US is not going to be alone in Glasgow: Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia will all prove hard to break down. After failing to persuade David Cameron to do the job, Johnson has put the business secretary, Alok Sharma, in charge of summit preparations. But Sharma does not have the heavy-hitting international reputation that is going to impress other governments. That will require Johnson to demonstrate his personal commitment to making Glasgow a success. All of which brings us back to the budget, which provides an opportunity for the government to announce measures that will accelerate the UK\u2019s progress towards a decarbonised economy. These need to be more than the mooted increase in fuel duty. The Green New Deal Group (of which I am a member) has estimated it will cost about \u00a3100bn a year for 20 years to make the transition to a net zero carbon economy. Investment on that sort of scale would be necessary to make the UK\u2019s 30m buildings energy efficient, turn buildings into power stations through the use of solar panels, and invest in renewable energy. So where\u2019s the money going to come from? One answer would be a form of green quantitative easing \u2013 money creation by the Bank of England that would pay for the decarbonisation of the economy rather than, as was the case during and after the financial crisis, being pumped into the banking system. The government doesn\u2019t seem keen on this approach, even though there are plenty of economists who think it is wholly feasible. Another possibility would be for the government to borrow the money in the usual way, but this doesn\u2019t appeal to ministers either. There is, though, a third option. At present about \u00a3100bn year is paid into pension schemes, all of it eligible for tax relief currently worth \u00a354bn a year. There is also tax relief on the \u00a370bn a year invested in Isas. The GND proposal is that 25% of pension contributions should go into green new deal investment in exchange for that tax relief and that all new Isa contributions \u2013 which currently go into cash or shares \u2013 should be invested in green new deal bonds issued by the government at a guaranteed rate of interest. The idea is to provide a stream of income to transform the economy as well as offering a new secure investment vehicle for savers. Insurance companies and pension funds no longer risk being left with stranded fossil fuel assets and the City would be the place to do green finance. Above all, a strong signal of intent would be sent to the rest of the world.",

      "body": "<p>I have rarely seen a play \u2013 other than <em>Hamlet</em> \u2013 that delivered such varied productions. In the past 18 years I have watched three stagings of <strong><a href=\"https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/a-number/\" title=\"\">A Number</a></strong> \u2013 yet never felt that the experience was merely duplicated, or cloned. Caryl Churchill\u2019s 2002 play is its own proof: it shows the difficulty of establishing one authentic version \u2013 of anything.</p> <p>A man in his 60s meets, one by one, several of his sons. But can they all be regarded as sons when, as it rapidly emerges, some of them are clones? Is one more \u201creal\u201d than the others? And what has caused one young man to be anxious, one vicious, one serenely unfussed by the knowledge that he is not singular?</p> <p>It was startling to see cloning on stage in 2002: Churchill has been unfailingly prescient in spotting vital debates, and her treatment of the nature-versus-nurture argument has always looked incisive. Yet <em>A Number</em> is vivid for other reasons. Where better than on stage to explore how we really distinguish between one person and another \u2013 by appearance, manner or the details of a personal biography? Is it possible to detect the secret life of an individual? And what an alluring opportunity this two-hander offers for actors. One man (could this in the future be reimagined with women?) needs strenuous versatility as he plays all the sons; the other has to chronicle gradual, shaded changes.</p> <p>Roger Allam and Colin Morgan seize these opportunities to wonderful effect. As the sons, Morgan, whose television life as Merlin has not been wasted, is magically transforming: slouching, perturbed and grubby; razor-like and dangerous; neat, benign and eager. Meanwhile, the glorious Roger Allam \u2013 the more glorious because he wears his splendour not openly but tucked into the sleeve of his crumpled cardigan \u2013 dips into the voice he uses as Inspector Thursday in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/12/endeavour-its-inspector-morse-with-a-moustache-and-surprisingly-great\" title=\"\">Endeavour</a></em> and becomes, with the tiniest rearrangement of his round shoulders, concerned, opportunistic, sad, sinister.</p> <p>Polly Findlay\u2019s production tilts the play towards the father: Allam lingers solo between scenes, while Morgan gets kitted out for his next incarnation. It is an emphatic interpretation, with explosive noises and atonal runs on the piano between episodes, and a detailed naturalistic design by Lizzie Clachan, which swivels to show the same house \u2013 lace curtains, leather sofa, luridly coloured tiger paintings \u2013 from different angles. This underlining of variation, and the stress on dramatic effect, brings some clarity of mood and plot to a shadowed play, full of dark twists. Too much so, for me: I missed the eerie ambiguity of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/sep/27/theatre.artsfeatures1\" title=\"\">first staging by Stephen Daldry</a>, minimal in d\u00e9cor and acting (Daniel Craig seemed merely to clench his jaw to differentiate between sons), and the subtle argument of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/oct/07/a-number-theatre-review\" title=\"\">Jonathan Munby</a>\u2019s production which, brilliantly casting real-life father and son Timothy and Samuel West, suggested that these sons were not perhaps more different from each other than were their father\u2019s different selves through a lifetime. What a tribute to Churchill that her work flashes out with these different lights.</p> <p>Anyone interested in the way the reputation of some first-class actors \u2013 Roger Allam is one of them \u2013 seems to simmer for years before boiling up, helped by telly, should pay a visit to <strong><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-visit?queueittoken=e_safetyevent19feb20~q_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000~ts_1582208710~ce_true~rt_afterevent~h_3567e988d66954d0b05b9e92d2d96495ffcac054fbb8bde4cfb1914938513d1b\" title=\"\">The Visit </a></strong>where the marvel that is Lesley Manville lights up the stage in Tony Kushner\u2019s new version of the 1956 play by the Swiss playwright Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt. She is not instinctive casting as the play\u2019s lead: a multi-married moneybags who returns to her rundown home town to wreak vengeance on the man who abandoned her pregnant as a teenager. It seems to be made for a belter; Manville is naturally subtle, glinting, exquisitely multifaceted. She is, though, magnetic as an artificial creature who has made herself, physically, financially and emotionally. She moves like a clockwork doll on prosthetic (don\u2019t ask) legs, one made from china and painted with boys flying kites. She squeals like a vixen. When she rasps out her former lover\u2019s name she seems to take a bite out of the air. She manages to slip from feral to soft focus and make something poignant out of a love song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee69ba30ee1c915d2ad8cafe3b71e2559a3afdac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee69ba30ee1c915d2ad8cafe3b71e2559a3afdac/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lesley Manville with Garrick Hagon in The Visit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lesley Manville with Garrick Hagon in The Visit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What a shame that she is trapped in an evening that is both flabby and over-explicit. No one would expect the author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/14/angels-in-america-tony-kushner-national-theatre\" title=\"\">Angels in America</a></em> to come up with a trim adaptation, but she might have hoped for something more incisive than this three-and-a-half-hour junket. Transplanting the action from a ramshackle European town to a derelict midwestern hole called Slurry, Kushner bludgeons home the play\u2019s anti-consumerist message \u2013 bribed with the promise of money, the townsfolk go mad for shiny shoes and radios \u2013 while Jeremy Herrin\u2019s production is in turn static and unwieldy, as if driven not by plot but by stage machinery. Characters are often stuck side by side, talking and unmoving; the opening scene features chaps from the hokey town lined up at the railway station as if waiting to burst into song. Vicki Mortimer\u2019s design \u2013 massive iron staircases, huge forest \u2013 certainly dominates the famously difficult vastness of the Olivier, but it demands that you watch it doing so. The stage is wreathed in smoke (that\u2019s the best bit); it revolves; it rises and sinks. It seems to be pleading with its audience that something is happening. Not enough is.</p> <p>There is so much that is so right about the ideas behind Alistair Beaton\u2019s adaptation of <strong><a href=\"https://www.royalandderngate.co.uk/whats-on/alone-in-berlin/\" title=\"\">Alone in Berlin</a></strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/hans-fallada\" title=\"\">Hans Fallada</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/07/alone-in-berlin-hans-fallada\" title=\"\">1947 novel</a> is an exceptional work based on a true story. In Berlin in 1940 a quiet couple are driven by the death of their son and the bullying of their Nazi neighbours to an ingenious act of defiance. They write anonymous protest messages on postcards, that most modest of forms, and distribute them in public places. Zealous citizens hand the cards in and, though at first the Gestapo is baffled \u2013 a thread of the plot follows their own internal power struggles \u2013 they eventually identify the couple, capture and kill them. The end is utterly bleak \u2013 the messages have been almost entirely disregarded and their writers are dead \u2013 and yet there is an inspirational belief in the worth of resistance for its own sake. It is a story well worth staging: it can stir.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b604c46c2e3db9cf90e8584bf800e96250d799da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b604c46c2e3db9cf90e8584bf800e96250d799da/0_0_2160_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denis Conway Jessica Walker and Charlotte Emmerson in Alone in Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"926\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denis Conway Jessica Walker and Charlotte Emmerson in Alone in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not in James Dacre\u2019s production, where good wheezes fizzle out. Terrific to call in Jason Lutes to supply graphics that suggest the black-and-white graininess of woodcuts of the period, but they often sit with uneasy artiness beside the grim humdrum action. Excellent notion to add a harsh cabaret touch with occasional songs, but Beaton\u2019s lyrics are toothless and Orlando Gough\u2019s music warbles decoratively rather than darkly. The action trails, and fails to capture the punchiness of the postcard idea. I can envisage a remake of this production that would work.

In the past 18 years I have watched three stagings of A Number \u2013 yet never felt that the experience was merely duplicated, or cloned. Caryl Churchill\u2019s 2002 play is its own proof: it shows the difficulty of establishing one authentic version \u2013 of anything. A man in his 60s meets, one by one, several of his sons. But can they all be regarded as sons when, as it rapidly emerges, some of them are clones? Is one more \u201creal\u201d than the others? And what has caused one young man to be anxious, one vicious, one serenely unfussed by the knowledge that he is not singular? It was startling to see cloning on stage in 2002: Churchill has been unfailingly prescient in spotting vital debates, and her treatment of the nature-versus-nurture argument has always looked incisive. Yet A Number is vivid for other reasons. Where better than on stage to explore how we really distinguish between one person and another \u2013 by appearance, manner or the details of a personal biography? Is it possible to detect the secret life of an individual? And what an alluring opportunity this two-hander offers for actors. One man (could this in the future be reimagined with women?) needs strenuous versatility as he plays all the sons; the other has to chronicle gradual, shaded changes. Roger Allam and Colin Morgan seize these opportunities to wonderful effect. As the sons, Morgan, whose television life as Merlin has not been wasted, is magically transforming: slouching, perturbed and grubby; razor-like and dangerous; neat, benign and eager. Meanwhile, the glorious Roger Allam \u2013 the more glorious because he wears his splendour not openly but tucked into the sleeve of his crumpled cardigan \u2013 dips into the voice he uses as Inspector Thursday in Endeavour and becomes, with the tiniest rearrangement of his round shoulders, concerned, opportunistic, sad, sinister. Polly Findlay\u2019s production tilts the play towards the father: Allam lingers solo between scenes, while Morgan gets kitted out for his next incarnation. It is an emphatic interpretation, with explosive noises and atonal runs on the piano between episodes, and a detailed naturalistic design by Lizzie Clachan, which swivels to show the same house \u2013 lace curtains, leather sofa, luridly coloured tiger paintings \u2013 from different angles. This underlining of variation, and the stress on dramatic effect, brings some clarity of mood and plot to a shadowed play, full of dark twists. Too much so, for me: I missed the eerie ambiguity of the first staging by Stephen Daldry, minimal in d\u00e9cor and acting (Daniel Craig seemed merely to clench his jaw to differentiate between sons), and the subtle argument of Jonathan Munby\u2019s production which, brilliantly casting real-life father and son Timothy and Samuel West, suggested that these sons were not perhaps more different from each other than were their father\u2019s different selves through a lifetime. What a tribute to Churchill that her work flashes out with these different lights. Anyone interested in the way the reputation of some first-class actors \u2013 Roger Allam is one of them \u2013 seems to simmer for years before boiling up, helped by telly, should pay a visit to The Visit where the marvel that is Lesley Manville lights up the stage in Tony Kushner\u2019s new version of the 1956 play by the Swiss playwright Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt. She is not instinctive casting as the play\u2019s lead: a multi-married moneybags who returns to her rundown home town to wreak vengeance on the man who abandoned her pregnant as a teenager. It seems to be made for a belter; Manville is naturally subtle, glinting, exquisitely multifaceted. She is, though, magnetic as an artificial creature who has made herself, physically, financially and emotionally. She moves like a clockwork doll on prosthetic (don\u2019t ask) legs, one made from china and painted with boys flying kites. She squeals like a vixen. When she rasps out her former lover\u2019s name she seems to take a bite out of the air. She manages to slip from feral to soft focus and make something poignant out of a love song. What a shame that she is trapped in an evening that is both flabby and over-explicit. No one would expect the author of Angels in America to come up with a trim adaptation, but she might have hoped for something more incisive than this three-and-a-half-hour junket. Transplanting the action from a ramshackle European town to a derelict midwestern hole called Slurry, Kushner bludgeons home the play\u2019s anti-consumerist message \u2013 bribed with the promise of money, the townsfolk go mad for shiny shoes and radios \u2013 while Jeremy Herrin\u2019s production is in turn static and unwieldy, as if driven not by plot but by stage machinery. Characters are often stuck side by side, talking and unmoving; the opening scene features chaps from the hokey town lined up at the railway station as if waiting to burst into song. Vicki Mortimer\u2019s design \u2013 massive iron staircases, huge forest \u2013 certainly dominates the famously difficult vastness of the Olivier, but it demands that you watch it doing so. The stage is wreathed in smoke (that\u2019s the best bit); it revolves; it rises and sinks. It seems to be pleading with its audience that something is happening. Not enough is. There is so much that is so right about the ideas behind Alistair Beaton\u2019s adaptation of Alone in Berlin. Hans Fallada\u2019s 1947 novel is an exceptional work based on a true story. In Berlin in 1940 a quiet couple are driven by the death of their son and the bullying of their Nazi neighbours to an ingenious act of defiance. They write anonymous protest messages on postcards, that most modest of forms, and distribute them in public places. Zealous citizens hand the cards in and, though at first the Gestapo is baffled \u2013 a thread of the plot follows their own internal power struggles \u2013 they eventually identify the couple, capture and kill them. The end is utterly bleak \u2013 the messages have been almost entirely disregarded and their writers are dead \u2013 and yet there is an inspirational belief in the worth of resistance for its own sake. It is a story well worth staging: it can stir. Not in James Dacre\u2019s production, where good wheezes fizzle out. Terrific to call in Jason Lutes to supply graphics that suggest the black-and-white graininess of woodcuts of the period, but they often sit with uneasy artiness beside the grim humdrum action. Excellent notion to add a harsh cabaret touch with occasional songs, but Beaton\u2019s lyrics are toothless and Orlando Gough\u2019s music warbles decoratively rather than darkly. The action trails, and fails to capture the punchiness of the postcard idea. I can envisage a remake of this production that would work. This doesn\u2019t.

Joshua went on to consolidate those vacant IBF, WBA and WBO straps, before losing and regaining them in a pair of outings with Andy Ruiz Jr last year. A summit meeting between the two British giants would determine the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 2000, and surely threaten the box-office records set with the 2015 showdown between Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao. Eddie Hearn, who promotes Joshua, was clear in his desire to make it happen. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to see a third fight, it was that conclusive, but we will see if he wants to exercise that,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cI probably expect Wilder [to take the rematch]. I don\u2019t see where else he has to go.\u201d He added: \u201cOur preference is to go straight into it because it would be undisputed. We will never get the opportunity in this sport to do it again with two Brits. I have already spoken to AJ, he wants this fight. He has zero fear of fighting Tyson Fury and he wants to be undisputed.\u201d Whoever faces Fury next will face a difficult night against a newly-crowned champion who insisted he\u2019s only scratched the surface of his potential. \u201cI\u2019m my own worst critic,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I can do better. I\u2019ve only just started with this style. It takes years to perfect, but I\u2019m a quick learner, don\u2019t forget. He said I can\u2019t punch. He said I have two pillow fists, so not bad for an old fat guy who can\u2019t punch!\u201d He added: \u201cWith this technique, we can knock out anybody. When I jumped on the scales and weighed over 270lb, people said I had underestimated Wilder. Tonight in there I felt like a beast.\u201d",

You wouldn\u2019t say that it spelled international bestseller, and yet it has sold 2.5 million copies to date.</p> <p>Hailed as a modern successor to Karl Marx\u2019s monumental <em>Capital</em>, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/13/occupy-right-capitalism-failed-world-french-economist-thomas-piketty\" title=\"\">rejuvenated radical leftwing critiques of capitalism</a> and earned Piketty (it rhymes with spaghetti) the epithet of \u201crock star\u201d economist. Seldom has a media cliche been more misleading.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/20/yanis-varoufakis-marx-crisis-communist-manifesto\" title=\"\">Yanis Varoufakis</a>, the brooding, motorbike-riding former Greek finance minister, the term \u201crock star\u201d might serve a shorthand descriptive purpose. But when I meet Piketty in Paris, he looks like George Osborne\u2019s slightly fleshier twin brother (they were born two weeks apart in 1971). What\u2019s more, his preferred pastime is to bury himself in comparative assessments of incremental capital returns in late 19th-century economies. It\u2019s not exactly throwing televisions out of hotel windows.</p> <p>In one respect, however, there is an element of danger about Piketty that has recently come back to haunt him. In November last year he was promoting his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/19/capital-and-ideology-by-thomas-piketty-review-if-inequality-is-illegitimate-why-not-reduce-it\" title=\"\">latest book <em>Capital and Ideology</em></a>, about which I\u2019ve come to interview him, at the University of Toulouse when he was suddenly taken by surprise.

Some of his assumptions and conclusions had their critics, but the quality of writing and breadth of vision was almost universally admired.</p> <p>Piketty is not a Marxist, though it\u2019s untrue, as is sometimes said, that he has never read <em>Capital</em>. Whereas Marx believed that the history of society is the history of class struggles, Piketty argues that human progress is the product of the struggle for equality and education in which ideology plays an instrumental role. \u201cWhat I mean,\u201d he says, explaining his differences with Marx, \u201cis that your class position is not enough to determine your view of what\u2019s the best system of property, education, taxation. We need ideas and ideologies and we need to take them seriously.\u201d</p> <p>The problem with many leftwing ideas is that they have often been wonderful in theory and rather a letdown in practice. Piketty notes that not only was Soviet communism a disaster in itself, but it also undermined the appeal of leftwing thought in general. Just about its only success, he suggests, was in helping to contain capitalism. He attributes the fall of the Soviet Union to the unleashing of \u201chypercapitalism\u201d across the globe, though in truth that development had already been under way for a decade before the USSR\u2019s demise.</p> <p>The point that he repeatedly comes back to is that between 1950 and 1980 nearly all western democracies had high levels of taxation, and yet it was a period of economic growth. While this may be true, recent attempts to impose high tax rates have not enjoyed success.</p> <p>One notable failure was Francois Hollande\u2019s imposition of a 75% supertax in France, which was said to have led to falling tax revenues, capital flight and a brain drain before being withdrawn. \u201cThey did not really try it,\u201d he says with a dismissive Gallic shrug.</p> <p>Briefly an economic adviser to Labour in the UK, Piketty and the party parted company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/thomas-piketty-quits-as-adviser-to-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">as a result of what he saw as its weak EU referendum campaign</a>. \u201cI can understand why Corbyn was not happy with the current way the European Union is organised, but I would have preferred him to suggest something else,\u201d he says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really propose any alternative way of organising Europe or, for that matter, the world economy.\u201d To be fair, economic literacy is an ability for which few modern politicians are renowned. In any case, as Piketty himself argues, ideology trumps economics. </p> <p>Identity politics have electrified the left in a way that redistributive policy hasn\u2019t quite managed to do. So where does that leave Piketty, not just a white heterosexual privileged male, who is therefore seen by a growing constituency on the left as part of the problem, but someone who has actually been accused of domestic violence?</p> <p>\u201cAll I can say about what you just referred to is that if people knew the content of the facts they would have a very different view about this,\u201d he says obliquely, refusing to enlarge, and determinedly not repeating the story he told in Toulouse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70448cc2f254bbd58dcd70f9b49c521c4ff03288\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70448cc2f254bbd58dcd70f9b49c521c4ff03288/37_185_4672_2803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Piketty in his office\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Piketty\u2019s Paris office is lined with books, including translations of his own works.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Piermont/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking more generally, he says that it makes perfect sense that people are very sensitive about these issues. \u201cBut I think they are so important that we need to be very serious about the content of the cases we are referring to.\u201d The French online journal <em>Mediapart</em> took his case very seriously and <a href=\"https://www.mediapart.fr/en/journal/france/200120/thomas-piketty-aurelie-filippetti-and-buried-domestic-violence-case?_locale=en&amp;onglet=full\" title=\"\">last month published a long investigation</a>, including the original agreement with Filippetti signed by Piketty, in which he states: \u201cI would like to express my profound regrets for having lost my calm on several occasions during our relationship and to have made you suffer violence, and I apologise for that.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement to the journal, Piketty said that he and Filippetti had been in a \u201cpathological relationship\u201d in which, he said, Filippetti was \u201cin a state of strong aggressiveness towards my daughters and towards herself\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Seven years ago a French economist named Thomas Piketty published a book entitled Capital in the Twenty-First Century. It was 700 pages long and featured in-depth empirical analysis of various historical tax systems, amounting to a forensic argument against widening inequality. You wouldn\u2019t say that it spelled international bestseller, and yet it has sold 2.5 million copies to date. Hailed as a modern successor to Karl Marx\u2019s monumental Capital, it rejuvenated radical leftwing critiques of capitalism and earned Piketty (it rhymes with spaghetti) the epithet of \u201crock star\u201d economist. Seldom has a media cliche been more misleading. With Yanis Varoufakis, the brooding, motorbike-riding former Greek finance minister, the term \u201crock star\u201d might serve a shorthand descriptive purpose. But when I meet Piketty in Paris, he looks like George Osborne\u2019s slightly fleshier twin brother (they were born two weeks apart in 1971). What\u2019s more, his preferred pastime is to bury himself in comparative assessments of incremental capital returns in late 19th-century economies. It\u2019s not exactly throwing televisions out of hotel windows. In one respect, however, there is an element of danger about Piketty that has recently come back to haunt him. In November last year he was promoting his latest book Capital and Ideology, about which I\u2019ve come to interview him, at the University of Toulouse when he was suddenly taken by surprise. During a question-and-answer session, he was asked by a female student about a complaint of domestic violence filed against him in 2009 by his former partner, Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti, then a Socialist party MP, later to become minister for culture. Thanks to an agreement brokered by the Socialist party at the time, Piketty apologised for his actions and Filippetti quickly dropped the charges. Although the original allegations surfaced in the British press in 2014, the details of the incident had never been publicly discussed. So Piketty was unprepared when the student asked him what he, as someone who had admitted to beating his ex-girlfriend, thought about appearing at the university just three days before a march against violence towards women. The economist did not respond with his customary eloquence. He seemed ruffled and defensive, informing his inquisitor that hers was an \u201cindecent\u201d question and that the case was closed a long time ago. Then he went further and said that the relationship the student referred to was with someone (he didn\u2019t mention Filippetti\u2019s name) who \u201cwas extremely violent towards my daughters\u201d. \u201cI put her out of my home,\u201d he told the stunned audience. \u201cI pushed her outside, which I regret, but I can assure you that given the behaviour towards my daughters, I think that a lot of people would be much more het up than that.\u201d He explained that Filippetti fell through a half-open door but that his actions, while regrettable, did not prevent her from going to work. Shortly afterwards Filippetti\u2019s lawyer served a writ for defamation, asking for damages and the publication of the ruling in the media of her choice. This latest episode had not been reported in the British press, so I arrived at the Paris School of Economics \u2013 France\u2019s answer to the LSE which Piketty helped to set up \u2013 ignorant of the Toulouse outburst. Instead, our discussion is to be focused on the English translation of his latest tome, which weighs in at a forbidding 1,093 pages. Piketty\u2019s fifth-floor office is heavily book-lined and a significant section of the display is made up of the various editions and translations of his own works. His efforts have made him a wealthy man. But he laments the fact that he wasn\u2019t able to pay more tax on the considerable royalties he\u2019s accrued. \u201cI would have liked to have paid 90 to 95% in tax,\u201d he says, a little forlornly. \u201cI didn\u2019t need that money.\u201d Nor has he wanted the huge sums offered to him by hedge funds, who have asked him to come and lecture them on the worrying excesses of capitalism (as if they didn\u2019t know already). Whenever he turns such offers down, he says, the companies just double or triple the fee, but he always says no. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more and more used to a situation in which private money can buy everything, from political parties to media to individuals,\u201d he says, noting that the very people who offer hundreds of thousands of euros for an hour-long lecture are also those who, in the name of \u201ceconomic rationality\u201d, refuse to pay their cleaners a living wage.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago I spent the weekend in a ch\u00e2teau deep in the rural Auvergne region of central France. Even more memorable than the crumbling property with its hectares of forest and decaying outbuildings, were the two elderly men to whom we were introduced when we arrived, who were enjoying an afternoon gin and tonic in the library. One \u2013 the father of my friend Guillaume \u2013 was Guillaume\u2019s mother\u2019s longtime lover until her recent death. The other was his mother\u2019s husband and the owner of the ch\u00e2teau where Guillaume grew up. The two men had remained on excellent terms for 40 years.</p> <p>The setup had all the ingredients of one of those lyrical French films starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu, replete with lavish interiors and rhapsodic landscapes looping through the changing seasons. It also ticked every box for lascivious British assumptions about the French, among whom infidelity, at least among the rich, powerful and famous, has long been something of a hallmark of a specifically French insouciance.</p> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand famously maintained an extra- marital relationship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/francois-mitterrands-love-letters-to-secret-mistress-to-be-published\" title=\"\">Anne Pingeot</a>, which began when she was 20 and he was 47 and continued throughout his presidency. They had a daughter, with whom Pingeot lived in a grand apartment paid for by the state. She remained his mistress until his death in 1996. Indeed, during the entire 20th century, apparently only one French president \u2013 Georges Pompidou \u2013 was known to have been faithful to his wife. How the other wives felt about this remains undocumented; the stereotype of the Parisian woman is that she is as discreet as she is chic.</p> <p>Since #MeToo, French attitudes towards consent and power within relationships both personal and professional have come under the microscope as never before. What was acceptable, even admirable, 20 years ago is now considered beyond the pale. The publication in January of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/10/matzneff-scandal-france-consent-literary-establishment\" title=\"\">Le Consentement</a></em>, a memoir by Vanessa Springora, detailing her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/27/french-publishing-boss-claims-she-was-groomed-at-age-14-by-acclaimed-author\" title=\"\">relationship</a> with the prizewinning writer Gabriel Matzneff when she was 14 and he was in his 50s, was like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/french-prosecutors-open-inquiry-into-author-gabriel-matzneff\" title=\"\">bomb going off</a> in the country.

For decades he has proudly detailed in his published diaries and essays the underage girls and boys he was having sex with when they should have been doing double maths, and openly talked about his sexual predilections on television chat shows. And he didn\u2019t come out of a vacuum. French literature features a sizable library of perversity \u2013 from the Marquis de Sade to Andr\u00e9 Gide, and Robert Desnos to Georges Bataille, not to mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/feb/28/serge-gainsbourg-20-scandalous-moments\" title=\"\">Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s</a> hit Lemon Incest, recorded with his 12-year-old daughter Charlotte in 1984 \u2013 inscribed in which is the notion of the male artistic genius who, like the aristocrat of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, remains above the drab moral conventions that govern the lower orders.</p> <p>There\u2019s a touch of that in the persistent defence by French artists and intellectuals of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/romanpolanski\" title=\"\">Roman Polanski</a>, who has lived in France and continued to make films since he fled the US in 1978 while awaiting sentencing for the rape of a 13-year-old girl. His most recent film, <em>An Officer and a Spy</em>, was one of the biggest critical and box office hits in France in late 2019.

A 2018 documentary, <em>Sexe sans Consentement</em> (Sex Without Consent), features women speaking to the camera about an attack by a male friend. The film ventures into an area that is rarely explored in France: the \u201cgrey zone\u201d where sex is forced, without \u201cphysical violence, threat or surprise\u201d (three of the four conditions for rape in French law, the fourth being \u201ccoercion\u201d).

I can only tell them I agree. I wonder if the jealousy and judgment among women they mention has any link with a history of relaxed attitudes to sexual fidelity, in which notions of loyalty and friendship must be stretched to breaking point. Even when a friendship weathers the tension, as with my friend\u2019s parents in the Auvergne, I suspect that in reality such relationships owe their existence to an era when many women didn\u2019t work and thus could not afford to leave their husbands, and divorce was extremely frowned upon in a country still largely bound by Catholic values.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74f1c5a54342ec3fbae0b1741304da4becd11a82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74f1c5a54342ec3fbae0b1741304da4becd11a82/0_0_2061_1236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serge Gainsbourg with his arm around his daughter Charlotte.

I deal with divorce, so it\u2019s true I see a specific demographic, but from what I see, French people are just as unhappy when their spouses cheat on them as people from any other country.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if <em>partouze</em> (group sex) clubs \u2013 such as the ones disgraced former IMF head <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dominique-strauss-kahn\" title=\"\">Dominique Strauss Kahn</a> was known to frequent \u2013 are ever cited in the cases she deals with. \u201cI think it came up in one dossier I dealt with, and we still talk about it because we thought it was so funny.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>While divorce rates </strong></em>have risen over the decades, domestic violence has reached epidemic proportions. Every three days, a woman is killed by her partner in France, one of the highest rates in Europe. Euriel Fierling, 44, a high school philosophy teacher in a working-class suburb east of Paris, grew up with parents who were both far-left activists. \u201cThat was the world I was brought up in, the radical feminist wave of the 1970s. But 50 years later, the rates of domestic violence, femicide and rape are sky high. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the feminist movement of the 1970s was highly intellectual. It didn\u2019t change anything in wider French society. Here we are, in 2020, talking about femicide. We never made it visible enough. How is that possible?</p> <p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d continues Fierling, \u201cI think the May \u201968 revolution, the sexual liberation of the 1970s, was more about men\u2019s right to sexual freedom than that of women. Since #MeToo, it has been all about women\u2019s sexual emancipation. Now, as well as violence against women, everyone is talking about female pleasure. I have never heard that before. I mean, from this September, for the first time, school textbooks will have 3D representations of the clitoris.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df7e5fc7b9653a691b7bcbfc68b9df063cc3f9f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df7e5fc7b9653a691b7bcbfc68b9df063cc3f9f7/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman sitting, holds and reads the book \u201cLe Consentement\u201d (\u201cThe consent\u201d) from French writer Vanessa Springora.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Explosive memoir: Le Consentement<em> </em>by Vanessa Springora, published in January, details her relationship with the writer Gabriel Matzneff when she was 14 and he was in his 50s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Bureau/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Karila-Danziger agrees that #MeToo signalled a radical change in France, though she cites different reasons. \u201cI really think there\u2019s an incredible liberation for women that\u2019s been going on over the past two or three years. It\u2019s extremely complicated, we\u2019re seeing a real change in our understanding of love, respect, relationships. One phenomenon that is very specific to France is the law that grants equal custody of children to both parents after divorce. The fact that the father is now expected to be equally involved in the everyday aspects of bringing up his children is huge progress.\u201d</p> <p>Writer Emilie Not\u00e9ris, 40, who describes herself as a \u201cqueer text worker\u201d, is excited by the emergence of the voices of women and racial and sexual minorities disturbing the institutional fabric. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire for representation that matches the reality of people\u2019s lived experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Fierling is similarly upbeat, impressed by the recent resurgence of feminism among her students. \u201cFor the whole time I was teaching, up until #MeToo, my students didn\u2019t think feminism concerned them at all. I tried to tell them it was an illusion to think the struggle was over, but until the #MeToo movement they weren\u2019t receptive. In the past couple of years, it\u2019s completely changed. Young women are extremely sensitive now, they explode at any sign of sexism. It\u2019s become a dominant ideology. Now all my students, boys as well as girls, call themselves feminists.\u201d</p> <p>Last week the entire committee of the C\u00e9sars (the French Oscars) resigned in the wake of a letter signed by 400 actors, directors and others from the French film industry, condemning the organisation as \u201ca structure where the majority of members don\u2019t see themselves in the choices made in their name, and which in no way represents the diversity of French cinema\u201d. This has been widely understood to be a specific reference to the 12 nominations received by Polanski\u2019s<em> An Officer and a Spy</em> \u2013 every eligible category except best actress and best supporting actress. Feminist groups, furious at Polanski\u2019s decades-old get-out-of-jail-free card, have been picketing cinemas showing the film; even President Macron\u2019s equality minister, Marl\u00e8ne Sciappa, expressed her dismay at the idea of a man convicted of rape getting a standing ovation at the ceremony. There have been the usual grumbles about \u201cpuritanical feminists\u201d, but overall there\u2019s been a surprising consensus. In the words of culture minister Franck Reister, in the post #MeToo era, even in France, \u201cgenius should be no guarantee of immunity\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A few years ago I spent the weekend in a ch\u00e2teau deep in the rural Auvergne region of central France. Even more memorable than the crumbling property with its hectares of forest and decaying outbuildings, were the two elderly men to whom we were introduced when we arrived, who were enjoying an afternoon gin and tonic in the library. One \u2013 the father of my friend Guillaume \u2013 was Guillaume\u2019s mother\u2019s longtime lover until her recent death. The other was his mother\u2019s husband and the owner of the ch\u00e2teau where Guillaume grew up. The two men had remained on excellent terms for 40 years. The setup had all the ingredients of one of those lyrical French films starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu, replete with lavish interiors and rhapsodic landscapes looping through the changing seasons. It also ticked every box for lascivious British assumptions about the French, among whom infidelity, at least among the rich, powerful and famous, has long been something of a hallmark of a specifically French insouciance. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand famously maintained an extra- marital relationship with Anne Pingeot, which began when she was 20 and he was 47 and continued throughout his presidency. They had a daughter, with whom Pingeot lived in a grand apartment paid for by the state. She remained his mistress until his death in 1996. Indeed, during the entire 20th century, apparently only one French president \u2013 Georges Pompidou \u2013 was known to have been faithful to his wife. How the other wives felt about this remains undocumented; the stereotype of the Parisian woman is that she is as discreet as she is chic. Since #MeToo, French attitudes towards consent and power within relationships both personal and professional have come under the microscope as never before. What was acceptable, even admirable, 20 years ago is now considered beyond the pale. The publication in January of Le Consentement, a memoir by Vanessa Springora, detailing her relationship with the prizewinning writer Gabriel Matzneff when she was 14 and he was in his 50s, was like a bomb going off in the country. Gallimard, which published Matzneff\u2019s diaries, hastily announced that it was halting sales of his books and he was stripped of the state-funded grant he had been receiving. Matzneff had been hiding in plain sight. For decades he has proudly detailed in his published diaries and essays the underage girls and boys he was having sex with when they should have been doing double maths, and openly talked about his sexual predilections on television chat shows. And he didn\u2019t come out of a vacuum. French literature features a sizable library of perversity \u2013 from the Marquis de Sade to Andr\u00e9 Gide, and Robert Desnos to Georges Bataille, not to mention Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s hit Lemon Incest, recorded with his 12-year-old daughter Charlotte in 1984 \u2013 inscribed in which is the notion of the male artistic genius who, like the aristocrat of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, remains above the drab moral conventions that govern the lower orders. There\u2019s a touch of that in the persistent defence by French artists and intellectuals of Roman Polanski, who has lived in France and continued to make films since he fled the US in 1978 while awaiting sentencing for the rape of a 13-year-old girl. His most recent film, An Officer and a Spy, was one of the biggest critical and box office hits in France in late 2019. In the midst of the Weinstein trial, it has so far failed to find a distributor in the US or the UK. The Matzneff scandal brought back to the surface a decades-long debate about consent that, it turns out, remains an unexpectedly controversial subject in France. In 2017, a man, 22, was found not guilty of the rape of an 11-year-old girl by a judge who considered the child to have given her consent. Yet in spite of the nationwide horror at this and other similar cases, the following year the National Assembly voted against bringing statutory rape on to the books (though confusingly it did vote to make it illegal to have sex with a child under 15). It\u2019s a paradox I\u2019ve struggled to understand: how is it that a country that has produced some of the most influential feminist thinkers of the 20th century has a legal system that appears to remain in thrall to the male sexual prerogative? I married a Frenchman, have lived here for 15 years, and have French children. In 2018, I became a French citizen. I suppose that makes me feel like I should understand this all a bit better, but it turns out that though I speak French, I don\u2019t think in French, and I\u2019m going to need some help if I want to begin to decode the myths and realities of the sexy French brand that the puritanical British supposedly admire and even envy.

Yet \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 there is a bleak fallout to this culture. A 2018 documentary, Sexe sans Consentement (Sex Without Consent), features women speaking to the camera about an attack by a male friend. The film ventures into an area that is rarely explored in France: the \u201cgrey zone\u201d where sex is forced, without \u201cphysical violence, threat or surprise\u201d (three of the four conditions for rape in French law, the fourth being \u201ccoercion\u201d). All of the women describe an inability to say no or to fight, how they internalised the sense that they were in some way responsible for what was happening to them. The film also features young men describing their own take on consent: \u201cI find it even more motivating \u2013 even more exciting! \u2013 when a girl says no,\u201d says one with a cheerful grin. The strategy of interweaving these young men\u2019s testimonies with those of the women provides a stark illustration of the failure of education to undo the twin ideals of male conquest and female acquiescence. These ideals are central to the quintessentially French notion of \u201cseduction\u201d, dating back to the 17th century and predicated on a dynamic in which the man is the s\u00e9ducteur, and the woman\u2019s role is to consent. This, in turn, confers some \u201cpower\u201d on the woman \u2013 to spurn the man, to flaunt his love, or to exact favours or payment in return for her attentions. \u201cGallantry\u201d is another value inherited from the pre- revolutionary aristocracy that I have been told is inherent in French social dynamics. Karine Peyrsaubes, 50, a local councillor in St-Germain-en-Laye, a market town west of Paris, says: \u201cI absolutely believe in equality.

Anne Karila-Danziger, 53, a Parisian family lawyer, is adamant there is no more acceptance of adultery in France than anywhere else. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly more tolerance of people\u2019s private lives, but I don\u2019t see it as a tolerance of adultery, and I certainly don\u2019t have the sense it reflects the way ordinary people live. I deal with divorce, so it\u2019s true I see a specific demographic, but from what I see, French people are just as unhappy when their spouses cheat on them as people from any other country.\u201d I ask if partouze (group sex) clubs \u2013 such as the ones disgraced former IMF head Dominique Strauss Kahn was known to frequent \u2013 are ever cited in the cases she deals with. \u201cI think it came up in one dossier I dealt with, and we still talk about it because we thought it was so funny.\u201d While divorce rates have risen over the decades, domestic violence has reached epidemic proportions. Every three days, a woman is killed by her partner in France, one of the highest rates in Europe. Euriel Fierling, 44, a high school philosophy teacher in a working-class suburb east of Paris, grew up with parents who were both far-left activists. \u201cThat was the world I was brought up in, the radical feminist wave of the 1970s. But 50 years later, the rates of domestic violence, femicide and rape are sky high. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the feminist movement of the 1970s was highly intellectual. It didn\u2019t change anything in wider French society. Here we are, in 2020, talking about femicide. We never made it visible enough. How is that possible? \u201cIn fact,\u201d continues Fierling, \u201cI think the May \u201968 revolution, the sexual liberation of the 1970s, was more about men\u2019s right to sexual freedom than that of women. Since #MeToo, it has been all about women\u2019s sexual emancipation. Now, as well as violence against women, everyone is talking about female pleasure. I have never heard that before. I mean, from this September, for the first time, school textbooks will have 3D representations of the clitoris.\u201d Karila-Danziger agrees that #MeToo signalled a radical change in France, though she cites different reasons. \u201cI really think there\u2019s an incredible liberation for women that\u2019s been going on over the past two or three years. It\u2019s extremely complicated, we\u2019re seeing a real change in our understanding of love, respect, relationships. One phenomenon that is very specific to France is the law that grants equal custody of children to both parents after divorce. The fact that the father is now expected to be equally involved in the everyday aspects of bringing up his children is huge progress.\u201d Writer Emilie Not\u00e9ris, 40, who describes herself as a \u201cqueer text worker\u201d, is excited by the emergence of the voices of women and racial and sexual minorities disturbing the institutional fabric. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire for representation that matches the reality of people\u2019s lived experiences.\u201d Fierling is similarly upbeat, impressed by the recent resurgence of feminism among her students. \u201cFor the whole time I was teaching, up until #MeToo, my students didn\u2019t think feminism concerned them at all. I tried to tell them it was an illusion to think the struggle was over, but until the #MeToo movement they weren\u2019t receptive. In the past couple of years, it\u2019s completely changed. Young women are extremely sensitive now, they explode at any sign of sexism. It\u2019s become a dominant ideology. Now all my students, boys as well as girls, call themselves feminists.\u201d Last week the entire committee of the C\u00e9sars (the French Oscars) resigned in the wake of a letter signed by 400 actors, directors and others from the French film industry, condemning the organisation as \u201ca structure where the majority of members don\u2019t see themselves in the choices made in their name, and which in no way represents the diversity of French cinema\u201d. This has been widely understood to be a specific reference to the 12 nominations received by Polanski\u2019s An Officer and a Spy \u2013 every eligible category except best actress and best supporting actress. Feminist groups, furious at Polanski\u2019s decades-old get-out-of-jail-free card, have been picketing cinemas showing the film; even President Macron\u2019s equality minister, Marl\u00e8ne Sciappa, expressed her dismay at the idea of a man convicted of rape getting a standing ovation at the ceremony. There have been the usual grumbles about \u201cpuritanical feminists\u201d, but overall there\u2019s been a surprising consensus. In the words of culture minister Franck Reister, in the post #MeToo era, even in France, \u201cgenius should be no guarantee of immunity\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>In a way, it\u2019s incredible that Supergrass lasted as long as they did. That they survived the mania of Britpop having bounced into mainstream consciousness fully formed in 1995, with the three of them trolleying around on a bed in that video, young and free, their teeth nice and clean. Where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUE4oDunYkc\" title=\"\">Alright</a> became an era-defining anthem as much as a career-bothering albatross that they later hated playing, they triumphed with the punky, eccentric immediacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/24/supergrass-how-we-made-i-should-coco-interview\" title=\"\"><em>I Should Coco</em></a>. It became Parlophone Records\u2019 bestselling debut album since the Beatles\u2019 <em>Please Please Me</em>.</p> <p>The bare basics of what happened next could be taken as rock\u2019n\u2019roll textbook: drugs, chaos, a bonkers offer from Hollywood (Steven Spielberg, very seriously wanting to make a TV show with them) and five more albums released to diminishing commercial returns, despite at least three of them (<em>In It </em><em>for </em><em>the Money</em>; <em>Supergrass</em>; <em>Road to Rouen</em>) being consistently great.</p> <p>For a period, drummer Danny Goffey\u2019s marriage to the fashion designer Pearl Lowe and proximity to the so-called Primrose Hill set of the late 90s made him a tabloid target, and at their peak, Supergrass were playing Wembley Arena-sized shows. Nonetheless, they combusted making their seventh album \u2013 an experience so fraught they called it quits via email and the entire recording was scrapped.</p> <p>And so 25 years since they released <em>I Should Coco</em>, and 10 years since they split up, it\u2019s a genuine kick to see Gaz and Rob Coombes, Danny Goffey and Mick Quinn sitting in a dressing room at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, hoping to reignite a live chemistry they first stumbled on when at least of two of them were still teenagers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUE4oDunYkc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qUE4oDunYkc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUE4oDunYkc\">Watch the video for Alright by Supergrass.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Goffey has a stomach bug; it was his birthday the night before.

Supergrass has always been about manic energy. The essence of playing live is where it really works.\u201d</p> <p>Gaz has had a significant solo career, playing headline shows at London Palladium, but says the timing \u201cfelt right\u201d to revisit this particular time capsule. \u201cI\u2019m really aware that when we\u2019re on the stage and when we\u2019re hanging out in the dressing room and after the gigs, that\u2019s where we were always really good, and really tight together, right to the end.\u201d</p> <p>For all that Britpop has become the most painfully over-analysed moment in recent musical history, few bands made it through the period without walkouts, breakups and extended hiatuses. What do Supergrass make of its legacy now?</p> <p>\u201cI saw more of it because I was living in London at the time,\u201d says Goffey, who moved to Somerset with Lowe and their three children in 2008. \u201cI went out with a few of the more dodgy bands for a period and saw the trends go in Camden Town and all that stuff.\u201d He affects a strut and snaps at his jacket lapels. \u201cThere were all these bands you\u2019d never heard of going round in their little leather jackets. We always politely tried to go \u2018Ahem, we\u2019re not really involved with that.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97795fbeae4d306da50b8ed1c9a9b31f85aa8d70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97795fbeae4d306da50b8ed1c9a9b31f85aa8d70/0_135_2864_1821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supergrass \u2013 left to right, Danny Goffey, Gaz Coombes and Mickey Quinn \u2013 photographed in 1995 at the height of their Britpop fame\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supergrass \u2013 (l-r) Danny Goffey, Gaz Coombes and Mickey Quinn \u2013 photographed in 1995 at the height of their Britpop fame.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was a big movement,\u201d says Quinn softly, sunglasses on. \u201cIt was the first time guitars were in the top 10 since, I don\u2019t know, the early 80s.\u201d We spend the next five minutes debating whether that\u2019s true and whether Suede really did kick off the whole thing (Goffey), or whether the Stone Roses had an overlooked part to play in it all (Quinn). Later, Gaz will marvel at how much of it was \u201cjust absolute bollocks, a lot of it media-led. In your teens and 20s you\u2019re going to say and do stupid things, and when you\u2019re that young you don\u2019t think of the bigger picture. You arrive, you get plied with champagne and whatever else is around, and you just lose that cool. Across all the art forms in the 90s \u2026 it was a strange period.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s surprising that Supergrass managed to outlast so many of their peers and endure as friends that can still hang out, riffing back and forth. Between their first and fifth albums, each of the band became fathers (Danny at 21, Mick at 24 and Gaz at 27); they officially added Rob (Coombes\u2019s older astrophysicist brother) as a member in 2002; Gaz and Rob lost their mum, and Gaz moved from Brighton back to the family home in Oxfordshire; and Goffey developed and kicked a heroin addiction.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like [the friendship] fully disappeared over the last decade and that we never saw each other again,\u201d says Gaz. \u201cThere was always something going on, some reissues and then weddings and birthdays and things,\u201d adds Goffey. \u201cI just wish I had kept a diary because I can\u2019t remember jack shit about most of it.\u201d</p> <p>Watching them sell out over two nights, it\u2019s a relief to see that they are on monstrous form. The last time I saw (and interviewed) Supergrass was as a student in the mid-00s, when my fandom was all-consuming. It was around this time that Gaz joked \u201cwe realise we\u2019ve always been Britain\u2019s fifth-favourite band\u201d, a line that sticks watching them play, as it seems they never really got their due.</p> <p>At the bar, two Dutch fans tell me they can\u2019t get over \u201chow many good songs they do\u201d, while one keen bloke invades the stage after several aborted attempts at crowd-surfing the moshpit. The hits (so many hits! You\u2019ll have forgotten how many) are cut with underrated gems \u2013 She\u2019s So Loose, Mary, Late in the Day \u2013 while Alright is introduced as \u201ca B-side not that many people have heard of\u201d.</p> <p>On the second night, giddiness descends backstage. Friends have arrived from England, including Pearl Lowe, Goffey\u2019s brother Nic and his directing partner Dom Hawley (the two of them have been behind almost every wonderfully daft Supergrass music video). A belated birthday cake is presented to Goffey and the band\u2019s rider of booze is hit with full force.</p> <p>Gaz tells me about the time he was driving from Paris to Rouen in his nippy new BMW when headlights began flashing behind him. \u201cWe\u2019d left the session for the day to stock up\u201d \u2013 on weed for the recording of Supergrass\u2019s fifth album \u2013 \u201cand I was an hour away from Normandy, and I was just driving too fast or a bit silly, when this nutter French driver started chasing me.\u201d They played cat and mouse for a few minutes. Gaz drove faster, then slowed down and opened his window. \u201cI thought, \u2018What is this? What is he doing?\u2019, so I put my arm out telling him to fuck off. And that\u2019s when the blue lights went on. Which was out of order really.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35f1dcfc9c8c8987050cb9b06e5b2497696d4150\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35f1dcfc9c8c8987050cb9b06e5b2497696d4150/0_176_7360_4736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supergrass in concert at Paradiso, Amsterdam, February 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In concert at Paradiso, Amsterdam, February 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Helderman for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t the first time Gaz was caught by the fuzz: the story of his arrest at 15 for possession of cannabis went on to become a song that sealed Supergrass\u2019s reputation as a band built on effervescent youth, idiot drama and brilliant tunes.</p> <p>Back in the car, Rob was in the passenger seat in a panic about all the drugs stashed under the seat. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Should I eat all this grass? Am I going to die\u2026 should I just ingest it?\u201d</p> <p>Goffey starts giggling. \u201cDo you really want all this in the <em>Observer</em>?\u201d Gaz shrugs, eyebrow cocked. \u201cIt\u2019s just stuff that happened! Anyway, I kept apologising to this officer, going \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m soooo stupid, man, I\u2019m just a stupid English idiot. Here, kick my ass!\u2019 And they let us go.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a standard Supergrass story. Like the time they were recording in a studio on a farm and gleefully headed for a relaxing swim in the indoor pool only to find it filled with dead animals. Or when they took acid in the American desert and then had to record a segment on BBC pop programme <em>The O-Zone</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThat got a bit heavy,\u201d says Gaz. \u201cThe guy from Blind Melon, he was really lovely, he gave us the acid\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Goffey picks up the thread. \u201cWe took it a couple of days later, and as we were coming up we got the call that, unfortunately, the guy from Blind Melon had passed away.\u201d Gaz shakes his head. \u201cWe had to record this thing for TV with Jamie Theakston. They\u2019d spent all this money coming over to America and we couldn\u2019t even talk properly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that story is called Dead Man\u2019s Acid,\u201d says Goffey solemnly. \u201cGod rest his soul.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/feb/15/britpop-songs-10-of-the-best-oasis-blur-pulp\">Britpop songs \u2013 10 of the best</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The band\u2019s children are now about the same age as Gaz and Goffey were when they first started a band at 14 and 17, but none of them can imagine their kids packing into a Transit van to tour the country.

He doesn\u2019t care what I do! Occasionally he\u2019ll put on something from <em>Coco</em> and be like, \u2018Fucking hell, you lot were fucking bonkers, why do you play so fast?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Someone, although it never becomes clear who, has booked a suite at Amsterdam\u2019s Soho House for an impromptu predawn portion of the afterparty, at which Gaz and Quinn sit in a corner chatting sweetly about their decades of friendship. They unpick knots and let loose with stories of their favourite tours and star-struck encounters. Both loved meeting David Bowie (he asked them to play his Meltdown festival in 2002; Gaz does a spot-on impression of their 30-second chat) and Robert Smith.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not very good at staying in touch with people,\u201d says Gaz. \u201cDanny will come back and say \u2018I had dinner with Keith Richards last night!\u2019, but I never really did that.\u201d If Goffey is the social butterfly, Quinn more an introvert, and Coombes the elder more philosophical, where does Gaz see himself?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think I just float. I enjoy people, I love getting into whatever\u2019s happening. But I think I\u2019ve grown a lot over the last 10 years since I left the band.

What do Supergrass make of its legacy now? \u201cI saw more of it because I was living in London at the time,\u201d says Goffey, who moved to Somerset with Lowe and their three children in 2008. \u201cI went out with a few of the more dodgy bands for a period and saw the trends go in Camden Town and all that stuff.\u201d He affects a strut and snaps at his jacket lapels. \u201cThere were all these bands you\u2019d never heard of going round in their little leather jackets. We always politely tried to go \u2018Ahem, we\u2019re not really involved with that.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt was a big movement,\u201d says Quinn softly, sunglasses on. \u201cIt was the first time guitars were in the top 10 since, I don\u2019t know, the early 80s.\u201d We spend the next five minutes debating whether that\u2019s true and whether Suede really did kick off the whole thing (Goffey), or whether the Stone Roses had an overlooked part to play in it all (Quinn). Later, Gaz will marvel at how much of it was \u201cjust absolute bollocks, a lot of it media-led. In your teens and 20s you\u2019re going to say and do stupid things, and when you\u2019re that young you don\u2019t think of the bigger picture. You arrive, you get plied with champagne and whatever else is around, and you just lose that cool. Across all the art forms in the 90s \u2026 it was a strange period.\u201d Still, it\u2019s surprising that Supergrass managed to outlast so many of their peers and endure as friends that can still hang out, riffing back and forth. Between their first and fifth albums, each of the band became fathers (Danny at 21, Mick at 24 and Gaz at 27); they officially added Rob (Coombes\u2019s older astrophysicist brother) as a member in 2002; Gaz and Rob lost their mum, and Gaz moved from Brighton back to the family home in Oxfordshire; and Goffey developed and kicked a heroin addiction. \u201cIt\u2019s not like [the friendship] fully disappeared over the last decade and that we never saw each other again,\u201d says Gaz. \u201cThere was always something going on, some reissues and then weddings and birthdays and things,\u201d adds Goffey. \u201cI just wish I had kept a diary because I can\u2019t remember jack shit about most of it.\u201d Watching them sell out over two nights, it\u2019s a relief to see that they are on monstrous form. The last time I saw (and interviewed) Supergrass was as a student in the mid-00s, when my fandom was all-consuming. It was around this time that Gaz joked \u201cwe realise we\u2019ve always been Britain\u2019s fifth-favourite band\u201d, a line that sticks watching them play, as it seems they never really got their due. At the bar, two Dutch fans tell me they can\u2019t get over \u201chow many good songs they do\u201d, while one keen bloke invades the stage after several aborted attempts at crowd-surfing the moshpit. The hits (so many hits! You\u2019ll have forgotten how many) are cut with underrated gems \u2013 She\u2019s So Loose, Mary, Late in the Day \u2013 while Alright is introduced as \u201ca B-side not that many people have heard of\u201d. On the second night, giddiness descends backstage. Friends have arrived from England, including Pearl Lowe, Goffey\u2019s brother Nic and his directing partner Dom Hawley (the two of them have been behind almost every wonderfully daft Supergrass music video). A belated birthday cake is presented to Goffey and the band\u2019s rider of booze is hit with full force. Gaz tells me about the time he was driving from Paris to Rouen in his nippy new BMW when headlights began flashing behind him. \u201cWe\u2019d left the session for the day to stock up\u201d \u2013 on weed for the recording of Supergrass\u2019s fifth album \u2013 \u201cand I was an hour away from Normandy, and I was just driving too fast or a bit silly, when this nutter French driver started chasing me.\u201d They played cat and mouse for a few minutes. Gaz drove faster, then slowed down and opened his window. \u201cI thought, \u2018What is this? What is he doing?\u2019, so I put my arm out telling him to fuck off. And that\u2019s when the blue lights went on. Which was out of order really.\u201d Of course, it wasn\u2019t the first time Gaz was caught by the fuzz: the story of his arrest at 15 for possession of cannabis went on to become a song that sealed Supergrass\u2019s reputation as a band built on effervescent youth, idiot drama and brilliant tunes. Back in the car, Rob was in the passenger seat in a panic about all the drugs stashed under the seat. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Should I eat all this grass? Am I going to die\u2026 should I just ingest it?\u201d Goffey starts giggling. \u201cDo you really want all this in the Observer?\u201d Gaz shrugs, eyebrow cocked. \u201cIt\u2019s just stuff that happened! Anyway, I kept apologising to this officer, going \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m soooo stupid, man, I\u2019m just a stupid English idiot. Here, kick my ass!\u2019 And they let us go.\u201d It\u2019s a standard Supergrass story. Like the time they were recording in a studio on a farm and gleefully headed for a relaxing swim in the indoor pool only to find it filled with dead animals. Or when they took acid in the American desert and then had to record a segment on BBC pop programme The O-Zone. \u201cThat got a bit heavy,\u201d says Gaz. \u201cThe guy from Blind Melon, he was really lovely, he gave us the acid\u2026\u201d Goffey picks up the thread. \u201cWe took it a couple of days later, and as we were coming up we got the call that, unfortunately, the guy from Blind Melon had passed away.\u201d Gaz shakes his head. \u201cWe had to record this thing for TV with Jamie Theakston. They\u2019d spent all this money coming over to America and we couldn\u2019t even talk properly.\u201d \u201cAnd that story is called Dead Man\u2019s Acid,\u201d says Goffey solemnly. \u201cGod rest his soul.\u201d The band\u2019s children are now about the same age as Gaz and Goffey were when they first started a band at 14 and 17, but none of them can imagine their kids packing into a Transit van to tour the country. Gaz\u2019s younger daughter goes to the same school he did. \u201cShe\u2019s 11 and she\u2019s trying to navigate it a bit, with people making a lot of comments,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat, negative?\u201d asks Goffey, incredulous. \u201cNo, more, I don\u2019t know, \u2018Is your dad famous?\u2019\u201d Goffey laughs. \u201cTell them we weren\u2019t in Britpop!\u201d he jokes. \u201cActually, my oldest kid just signed a publishing deal and is in his own band. He doesn\u2019t care what I do! Occasionally he\u2019ll put on something from Coco and be like, \u2018Fucking hell, you lot were fucking bonkers, why do you play so fast?\u2019\u201d Someone, although it never becomes clear who, has booked a suite at Amsterdam\u2019s Soho House for an impromptu predawn portion of the afterparty, at which Gaz and Quinn sit in a corner chatting sweetly about their decades of friendship. They unpick knots and let loose with stories of their favourite tours and star-struck encounters. Both loved meeting David Bowie (he asked them to play his Meltdown festival in 2002; Gaz does a spot-on impression of their 30-second chat) and Robert Smith. \u201cI\u2019m not very good at staying in touch with people,\u201d says Gaz. \u201cDanny will come back and say \u2018I had dinner with Keith Richards last night!\u2019, but I never really did that.\u201d If Goffey is the social butterfly, Quinn more an introvert, and Coombes the elder more philosophical, where does Gaz see himself? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think I just float. I enjoy people, I love getting into whatever\u2019s happening. But I think I\u2019ve grown a lot over the last 10 years since I left the band. It was an opportunity for all of us. We\u2019ve all grown up a bit.\u201d Supergrass: The Strange Ones 1994-2008 (BMG) is out now and they are currently on tour, see supergrass.com",

      "body": "<p>I first heard of Andrew Weatherall back in the summer of 1989, when he wrote about his favourite tracks of the time in the <em>Boy\u2019s Own</em> fanzine. To our surprise, he said that he loved all the ballads on our second album. No one cared about that record apart from diehard fans, but he really dug it.</p> <p>My memories are vague, when it comes to that summer, but I do recall a bunch of us driving around the countryside near Brighton for hours trying to find an acid house party where he was DJing. We eventually met up with him at about five in the morning in a field in Sussex. All of us off our heads on E. We just got on right away.</p> <p>I remember the <em>NME</em> asked him to review a Primal Scream gig and he came to see us play at Exeter University. He turned up in leather trousers with really long hair \u2013 he could have been in the band! (Weatherall wrote an enthusiastic review of the gig under the pen name, Audrey Witherspoon.) After that, we\u2019d go and see him whenever he was DJing in London.</p> <p>We\u2019d already become good mates, when someone suggested that he should mix I\u2019m Losing More Than I\u2019ll Ever Have. He said OK, but his remix was a bit low-key. He loved the song and maybe he thought we\u2019d be offended if he really went to town on it. It was Innes [Andrew Innes, Primal Scream\u2019s guitarist], who told him to do it again and \u201cjust fucking destroy it\u201d. That\u2019s how Loaded came into being, basically. We gave him free rein and he went for it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNvUQka4wk0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sNvUQka4wk0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNvUQka4wk0\">Listen to the Andrew Weatherall mix of Primal Scream\u2019s Loaded.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The thing about Andrew was that he was a non-musician - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/27/rocks-backpages-primal-scream-loaded\" title=\"\">Loaded</a> was only his second time in a recording studio. Because he wasn\u2019t aware of the rules, he broke them. He wasn\u2019t trying to make hit records. That never entered his mind. He just wanted to make interesting tracks that worked on the dancefloor.</p> <p>And, of course, he was the first person to play Loaded in a club. I think the reaction completely took him by surprise. It certainly took us by surprise! I remember Innes went to see him DJ at Subterania in west London. Afterwards, he called me in the early hours and said: \u201cBobby, it was insane. Weatherall played Loaded and the whole place went ballistic.\u201d He told me that Mick Jones (from the Clash) and Kevin Rowland (from Dexys Midnight Runners) had come up to him afterwards and shook his hand.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was a kindred spirit and true to himself. He changed my life, he really did</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Loaded just exploded on dance floors across the country. Looking back, it definitely caught something of the time. That was down to Andrew. All I can say is that the experience of standing in a club and seeing people go wild to it was something else. Kids would come up and hug you afterwards.</p> <p>Then it really took off and suddenly we were on <em>Top of the Pops</em>. It was wild for us, because I think we\u2019d been written off a bit, but not by Andrew Weatherall. He heard something in the songs. He was a rocker at heart and he initially connected with those songs on that level. Basically, he took a bluesy Primal Scream ballad and turned it into something ecstatic. The ecstatic blues.</p> <p>His remix of Come Together was another track that was gigantic in the clubs. It became one of those songs that DJs ended their sets with as the sun was coming up. Liam Gallagher still goes on to me about hearing it at a massive rave in Scotland; thousands of kids going mental to it.</p> <p>By autumn 1990, we had a little studio in Hackney near the Creation offices. For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/31/primal-scream-screamadelica-live\" title=\"\"><em>Screamadelica</em></a>, we gave him tracks and tracks of melodies and songs, loads of stuff that he put together somehow. His skill at arranging was off the scale. No one else would have thought of constructing tracks like he did, arranging our melodies and music into abstract pop songs. I have to mention Hugo Nicholson here, too, because I think maybe his best work was done with Hugo. They were a team. Andrew had the vision and Hugo Nicholson had the studio skills needed to realise his ideas. They just killed it every time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7459f642f09f92c76631032c11f744ab3e5fe83a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7459f642f09f92c76631032c11f744ab3e5fe83a/268_0_4958_2976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Weatherall in action at the Hare and Hounds, Birmingham, in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Weatherall in action at the Hare and Hounds, Birmingham, in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wayne Fox/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remember Andrew came on the road with us soon afterwards, when we did a short British tour. The Orb would go on first, then we\u2019d play a short set, and afterwards we\u2019d do a few Es, and get on the dance floor with the kids for Weatherall\u2019s set. Great days. He loved the madness, the chaos of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but he also saw the absurdity of it all, which is rare.

      "bodyText": "I first heard of Andrew Weatherall back in the summer of 1989, when he wrote about his favourite tracks of the time in the Boy\u2019s Own fanzine. To our surprise, he said that he loved all the ballads on our second album. No one cared about that record apart from diehard fans, but he really dug it. My memories are vague, when it comes to that summer, but I do recall a bunch of us driving around the countryside near Brighton for hours trying to find an acid house party where he was DJing. We eventually met up with him at about five in the morning in a field in Sussex. All of us off our heads on E. We just got on right away. I remember the NME asked him to review a Primal Scream gig and he came to see us play at Exeter University. He turned up in leather trousers with really long hair \u2013 he could have been in the band! (Weatherall wrote an enthusiastic review of the gig under the pen name, Audrey Witherspoon.) After that, we\u2019d go and see him whenever he was DJing in London. We\u2019d already become good mates, when someone suggested that he should mix I\u2019m Losing More Than I\u2019ll Ever Have. He said OK, but his remix was a bit low-key. He loved the song and maybe he thought we\u2019d be offended if he really went to town on it. It was Innes [Andrew Innes, Primal Scream\u2019s guitarist], who told him to do it again and \u201cjust fucking destroy it\u201d. That\u2019s how Loaded came into being, basically. We gave him free rein and he went for it. The thing about Andrew was that he was a non-musician - Loaded was only his second time in a recording studio. Because he wasn\u2019t aware of the rules, he broke them. He wasn\u2019t trying to make hit records. That never entered his mind. He just wanted to make interesting tracks that worked on the dancefloor. And, of course, he was the first person to play Loaded in a club. I think the reaction completely took him by surprise. It certainly took us by surprise! I remember Innes went to see him DJ at Subterania in west London. Afterwards, he called me in the early hours and said: \u201cBobby, it was insane. Weatherall played Loaded and the whole place went ballistic.\u201d He told me that Mick Jones (from the Clash) and Kevin Rowland (from Dexys Midnight Runners) had come up to him afterwards and shook his hand. Loaded just exploded on dance floors across the country. Looking back, it definitely caught something of the time. That was down to Andrew. All I can say is that the experience of standing in a club and seeing people go wild to it was something else. Kids would come up and hug you afterwards. Then it really took off and suddenly we were on Top of the Pops. It was wild for us, because I think we\u2019d been written off a bit, but not by Andrew Weatherall. He heard something in the songs. He was a rocker at heart and he initially connected with those songs on that level. Basically, he took a bluesy Primal Scream ballad and turned it into something ecstatic. The ecstatic blues. His remix of Come Together was another track that was gigantic in the clubs. It became one of those songs that DJs ended their sets with as the sun was coming up. Liam Gallagher still goes on to me about hearing it at a massive rave in Scotland; thousands of kids going mental to it. By autumn 1990, we had a little studio in Hackney near the Creation offices. For Screamadelica, we gave him tracks and tracks of melodies and songs, loads of stuff that he put together somehow. His skill at arranging was off the scale. No one else would have thought of constructing tracks like he did, arranging our melodies and music into abstract pop songs. I have to mention Hugo Nicholson here, too, because I think maybe his best work was done with Hugo. They were a team. Andrew had the vision and Hugo Nicholson had the studio skills needed to realise his ideas. They just killed it every time. I remember Andrew came on the road with us soon afterwards, when we did a short British tour. The Orb would go on first, then we\u2019d play a short set, and afterwards we\u2019d do a few Es, and get on the dance floor with the kids for Weatherall\u2019s set. Great days. He loved the madness, the chaos of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but he also saw the absurdity of it all, which is rare. I think he was an outsider artist in a way; he preferred being on the margins doing his own thing. He could be more free out there. Music was a portal for him to escape the straight life. He made music and he loved music \u2013 rockabilly, garage rock, reggae. He was into spreading the word. He was inclusive, such a generous guy. I think of him as a true bohemian; he made etchings, he wrote, he read a lot. Andrew always had a book on the go, maybe two. I remember he gave me his copy of Hunger by Knut Hamsun when I told him I hadn\u2019t read it. There was this other side to him that was deep, curious, well-read.

(The Guardian had it 59-52, a shutout.)</p> \n<p>Wilder, who earned the same guaranteed $25m purse for Saturday\u2019s fight as Fury with the potential for more based on the pay-per-view receipts, was gracious in the wake of his first defeat in 44 pro fights. \u201cThe best man won tonight \u2026 You just take it for what it is. I can make no excuses tonight. I had a lot of complications. But we\u2019ll come back stronger next time around,\u201d said Wilder, who headed directly to a local hospital afterward for stitches and precautionary observations and missed the post-fight press conference. \u201cThis is what big-time boxing is all about, the best must fight the best.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Alabama native, who captured the WBC\u2019s version of the long-fractured heavyweight championship with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/18/deontay-wilder-proves-hes-no-against-bermane-stiverne\">2015 win over Bermane Stiverne</a>, was attempting to make an 11th consecutive title defense and break a tie on the all-time list with Muhammad Ali, who made 10 during his second reign between 1974 and 1978. Only Joe Louis (25), Larry Holmes (20) and Tommy Burns (11) have made more.</p> \n<p>Instead the 31-year-old from Manchester, who descends from Traveller stock with all the fighting heritage that entails, has now earned the WBC strap after winning the WBA, WBO and IBF titles in 2015 when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/28/tyson-fury-shocks-wladimir-klitschko-world-heavyweight-title-champion\">ended Wladimir Klitschko\u2019s decade-long reign</a> in D\u00fcsseldorf.</p> \n<p>Fury never lost those belts in the ring, instead surrendering them into the heavyweight ether amid his 31-month layoff, where they have since been absorbed by Britain\u2019s Anthony Joshua. His improbable return to the summit of boxing\u2019s prestige division on Saturday night seemed unthinkable at rock bottom, as he ballooned to 400lbs and contemplated taking his own life.</p> \n<p>Now a summit meeting between Fury and Joshua to unite all four titles and crown an undisputed heavyweight champion for the first time since Lennox Lewis looms as perhaps the richest fight in boxing history. That is, if Wilder doesn\u2019t exercise his contracted option for an immediate rematch, which Fury\u2019s team said they would honor.</p> \n<p>\u201cI look forward to the next fight, the rematch if he wants it,\u201d Fury said.</p>",

He was the winner of all but one round on the three judges\u2019 scorecards at the time of the stoppage. (The Guardian had it 59-52, a shutout.) Wilder, who earned the same guaranteed $25m purse for Saturday\u2019s fight as Fury with the potential for more based on the pay-per-view receipts, was gracious in the wake of his first defeat in 44 pro fights. \u201cThe best man won tonight \u2026 You just take it for what it is. I can make no excuses tonight. I had a lot of complications. But we\u2019ll come back stronger next time around,\u201d said Wilder, who headed directly to a local hospital afterward for stitches and precautionary observations and missed the post-fight press conference. \u201cThis is what big-time boxing is all about, the best must fight the best.\u201d The Alabama native, who captured the WBC\u2019s version of the long-fractured heavyweight championship with a 2015 win over Bermane Stiverne, was attempting to make an 11th consecutive title defense and break a tie on the all-time list with Muhammad Ali, who made 10 during his second reign between 1974 and 1978. Only Joe Louis (25), Larry Holmes (20) and Tommy Burns (11) have made more. Instead the 31-year-old from Manchester, who descends from Traveller stock with all the fighting heritage that entails, has now earned the WBC strap after winning the WBA, WBO and IBF titles in 2015 when he ended Wladimir Klitschko\u2019s decade-long reign in D\u00fcsseldorf. Fury never lost those belts in the ring, instead surrendering them into the heavyweight ether amid his 31-month layoff, where they have since been absorbed by Britain\u2019s Anthony Joshua. His improbable return to the summit of boxing\u2019s prestige division on Saturday night seemed unthinkable at rock bottom, as he ballooned to 400lbs and contemplated taking his own life. Now a summit meeting between Fury and Joshua to unite all four titles and crown an undisputed heavyweight champion for the first time since Lennox Lewis looms as perhaps the richest fight in boxing history. That is, if Wilder doesn\u2019t exercise his contracted option for an immediate rematch, which Fury\u2019s team said they would honor. \u201cI look forward to the next fight, the rematch if he wants it,\u201d Fury said.",

      "bodyText": "Some big scores across Australian football, both in the W-League and the A-League. Both Melbourne Victory and Brisbane Roar put as much pressure on each other (and the Wanderers) as they could, hunting that final post-season playoff spot with twelve goals between them. In the A-league, Sydney FC did it late against the Mariners, with two academy graduates putting on a last ten-minute clinic. In the AFLW, two thumping performances from the Giants and the Kangaroos, while the Crows just hung on against a hard-fighting Cats, for whom 0-3 looks a stiff return based on performnances like that. That\u2019s all today from Sportwatch. Thanks for joining us! They may have been humbled in Asia midweek, but on home turf, they\u2019re untouchable. Sydney FC go 13 points clear at the top of the table, in a game in which the Mariners dominated minutes 10-80 but ended up 3-0 losers. Their youth team has been special this year, and it\u2019s two kids from the academy who light it up late: a goal and an assist for Marco Tilio; a goal and an assist for Harry van der Saag. Great signs for the future of the club - but it\u2019s another bitter swill to swallow for a very hard-working Mariners, who once again throw everything at it, but end up with a 13th loss of the season. A-League - Goal! Central Coast 0-3 Sydney (van der Saag) 90 + 1 min: Oh my. It\u2019s the kids combined. Tilio lays it off to van der Saag - and the young right back has gone on a slaloming run through the heart of the Mariners\u2019 defence and struck a thumping effort top bins! What a goal that was! A-League - Goal! Central Coast 0-2 Sydney (Tilio) 88 min: He\u2019s been on the pitch about 15 seconds - it\u2019s an A-League debut for Marco Tilio, and he\u2019s scored instantaneously! Fine work from fellow youngster Harry van der Saag down the right who picks out the teen in the middle of the box. He pivots, twists, and rolls a calm finish past Birighitti. Lovely goal! A-League - 85 min: Tommy Oar tries to lob one to the far post for Simon, but he over-eggs it. Stensness picks it up on the edge of the box and is encouraged to shoot, but elects not to. It\u2019s still the Mariners making the late running. This has \u201cheroic failure\u201d written all over it - and not for the first time in the Mariners\u2019 season. A-League - 79 min: The crowd comes to the bubble as this game begins to really open up. Some speedsters for both sides out there, and Sydney FC might be feeling their midweek exertions of travelling to Japan and back. We stretch end-to-end. A-League - 72 min: A ball strikes the arm of Wilkinson inside the box, but it is in fairness pressed close to his body (if those are even the rules these days, *tips hat to IFAB*). Mariners decide to go to the bench: The Great Elbow, Matt Simon is warming up - this is a match tailor made for his unique talents. A-League - 60 min: Okay, we\u2019re at the hour mark and that\u2019s as close as Sydney FC have come for a while. It\u2019s Luke Brattan pulling the strings, and former Mariner Trent Buhagiar almost gets a snap shot away against the club that launched him. And a freekick just outside the box for handball - Brattan eyes it. And there\u2019s the final whistle. An emphatic performance from the women in orange, with the US duo of Baisden and Pickett grabbing a brace each. That ends Canberra\u2019s season - and could prompt a fair off-season rethink you\u2019d imagine for the club that dominated the early years of the W-League. Roar face Melbourne City next week in their final regular season match. Could be a cracker. W-League - Goal! Brisbane 5-0 Canberra (Baisden) 90 + 2 min: Ach. This is a sad finish to Leena Khamis\u2019 playing career with United, and Heather Garriock\u2019s final game as coach. The Roar have every reason to chase down Victory\u2019s huge win earlier, as goal difference could yet play a factor in the final push for a finals spot: Victory, Wanderers and Roar will be the three clubs scrapping for two berths. A-League - 52 min: So, an angry half-time for the home side, with staff still remonstrating the decision to disallow what they considered a fair equaliser, with the skipper Kim deigned to have interferred with play from an offside position during Stensness\u2019 headed effort. They\u2019re back and looking the hungrier after the break. Can they fashion another opening though? W-League - Goal! Brisbane 4-0 Canberra (Connors) 84 min: And they are still pressing: it\u2019s a second goal in three minutes with Katrina Gorry pulling the strings for the women in orange. It was a cheeky finish - a flick from the outside of the right foot from the substitute; and why not? W-League - Goal! Brisbane 3-0 Canberra (Pickett) 82 min: And it\u2019s a brace for Pickett - this time with the noggin. They\u2019ve been besieging the goal second half, but Khamis has been a one-woman wall. Finally though the American breaks through. Can they chase the goal difference further from here? W-League - 70 min: And there\u2019s still 20 to run up in Brisbane, where the Roar are maintaining their 2-0 lead over Canberra. Khamis with a great save to deny the youngster India Paige-Riley. She\u2019s been lively today, the 18-year-old. A-League - half-time: Central Coast 0-1 Sydney FC Well, they\u2019ve huffed and puffed late on in that half, the Mariners, but it\u2019s a customary story for both these teams: one, toiling hard without a cutting edge, the other, making the most of the opportunities that come there way. One\u2019s lethal and top, the other is hard-working, but bottom. I should also add - they thought they were level, the Mariners; but they had a goal disallowed for a marginal offside call. It\u2019s certainly got Stajcic and some of his players riled. A tough one. So, there goes the Cats\u2019 season, on what was arguably their best performance. They threw everything at that, Geelong, and few would argue they didn\u2019t deserve to be a shot here today. Danielle Ponter finishes with four majors, and their season rolls on - the Crows get home in a tight one. 25 touches for Ebony Marinoff in another all-action showing from her. AFLW - final quarter: Geelong 6.2 (38) trail Adelaide 7.1 (43) 5 to play: The decibel-meter is at fever pitch around Kardinia Park, as the Cats look to pull off the miraculous. Oh no - Maddie McMahon has been called for a deliberate force behind, and Ponter is gifted a six-pointer! There was nobody within cooee, and having come so close, they\u2019ve been done at the last, the Cats. Their fans are howling with rage! A-League - 29 min: As we approach the half-hour mark a few signs that the Mariners are creeping back into this contest. They shifted toa more defensive structure pre-game, lining up in a 5-3-2, but they\u2019re showing a touch more ambition now; Clisby with a series of good balls into the box, but there\u2019s nobody to capitalise, alas. Plenty of attacking fire power on the bench though - we\u2019ll see more of that later as the game develops. AFLW - 3/4-time: Geelong 5.2 (32) trail Adelaide 6.1 (37) Hello. It\u2019s the Cats who win the quarter, kicking 2.2 and suddenly - we\u2019ve got a real pot-boiler on the hob here: we\u2019ve got a one-major final term to come! W-League - half-time: Brisbane 2-0 Canberra They\u2019re sitting pretty here, the Roar, after Pickett\u2019s thumping opener and then a second via the spot. They\u2019re only playing for pride the women in green, and Heather Garriock\u2019s final game in charge. Five Matildas on the pitch for Brisbane - it really is inconceivable that this squad of players might not be playing finals football, but that\u2019s the likely equation after Victory\u2019s thumping win. A-League - Goal! Central Coast Mariners 0-1 Sydney FC (Ninkovic) 11 min: Oh my. That\u2019s a stinker. Poor defending from the Mariners, who allow a bouncing ball inside the box to bobble into the path of Milos Ninkovic. Do you reckon he misses from three metres out? Does he $%^&amp;. Alen Stajcic must be tearing his hair out - a week\u2019s worth of tactical planning out the window inside a quarter of an hour. Now - we do have a game from the A-League: it\u2019s top v bottom in a very mismatched encounter. They do have a nasty habit of playing up against Sydney FC, though, the Mariners - you read it here first: what price an upset? Here\u2019s your lineups: And Sydney FC: That\u2019s some way to secure your finals\u2019 berth. \u201cA shellacking of the highest order\u201d was the official verdict from match commentator Steph Brantz - and that almost feels like an understatement. A strong response from the Victory after they suffered their own heavy loss to rivals City last weekend. They skip above Wanderers on the table into third spot - they could yet finish second depending how Sydney FC fare in the final round. AFLW - half-time: Geelong 3.0 (18) trail Adelaide 5.0 (30) It\u2019s a must-win for the Cats already and they\u2019re kicking straight - and only problem is so are the Crows. Free-flowing, high-scoring on a gorgeous day from the town near Lara. Can we have more of the same after the major break? W-League - Goal! Newcastle 0-7 Melbourne Victory (Ayres) 83 min: Finish the fight. I\u2019m throwing in the towel. Blow it up ref. Jets CEO Lawrie McKinna and A-League coach Karl Robinson are in the house in the Hunter, but this is not the result to inspire confidence across the club. No good. W-League - Goal! Brisbane 2-0 Canberra (Baisden, pen) 15 min: Oh my. This one\u2019s going the way of Jets v Victory in fast fashion; it\u2019s a handball in the box by Laura Hughes after fine work again from the US striker Rylee Baisden, and she steps up and tucks it past Shan Khamis with aplomb. They\u2019re chasing the goal difference here too, it seems, the Roar. And Heather Garriock\u2019s last game in charge at Canberra could end in an ugly fashion. W-League - Goal! Brisbane 1-0 Canberra (Pickett) 11 min: Oh my! More like Pickett outta ya net - that\u2019s a gorgeous strike from the American Carson Pickett. It was a fine break down the right and a cut back to the edge of the box. And the woman from Spartanburg South Carolina has put the laces right through that! A thumping effort, and that\u2019s the Roar in front. W-League - Goal! Newcastle 0-6 Melbourne Victory (og) 69 min: Ach. That\u2019s where this one\u2019s at. It\u2019s terrific work down the wing from Beard, and that\u2019s a tricky cross to deal with - but it\u2019s headed - not deflected - it\u2019s headed with power past her own keeper from Cassidy Davis. Yikes - that\u2019s some oggie. And we\u2019re underway now in Brisbane v Canberra! AFLW - 1/4-time: Geelong 2.0 (12) trail Adelaide 3.0 (18) Well, no behinds - but it\u2019s Geelong behind on the scoreboard after a five-goal opening quarter. Danielle Ponter with a double, with Chelsea Biddell the other. Danielle Higgins and Phoebe McWilliams with the majors for the Cats. 10 inside-50s to three for the Crows though, with the visitors enjoying a lot more front third penetrations. W-League - Goal! Newcastle 0-5 Melbourne Victory (Jenkins) 59 min: And it\u2019s a brace to Darien Jenkins. She rises highest to a cross and nods home from around the six-yard box. It\u2019s a fine finish, but they really just have to be challenging better in that area of the pitch, the Jets. A big half hour if they\u2019re to save face here. And here\u2019s something fresh off the powder in Minsk (not a drug reference, I promise) - don\u2019t complain I never bring you the good stuff about aerial skiing: And here\u2019s the write up from what some are calling \u201cthe greatest comeback in modern sports history\u201d. I\u2019d lean Tiger Woods, off the top of my recent memory, but he\u2019s sure got some hell of a story, the Gypsy King. And what a bruising fight this was: Okay - we\u2019re away in Geelong v Adelaide in the AFLW, and then coming up shortly in the W-League is that aforementioned Brisbane v Canberra clash. It\u2019s all on the line for their respective seasons. As long as it\u2019s not all too late due to this Victory result. W-League: Newcastle 0-4 Melbourne Victory - half-time It\u2019s not the final home game of the season Jets faithful would have been looking for, but they\u2019ve got 45 minutes to go. Yes, they\u2019re well out of finals contention this year, but they\u2019re not exactly bunnies. For Victory conversely, this result could see off the challenges of a Matildas-laden Brisbane Roar and the ever dangerous Canberra United, who all have aspirations for the final top-four spot - short of a Wanderers\u2019 final-game collapse though, you\u2019d have to say this result puts paid to that. Three unanswered goals in the final term, and that was more than enough for the Roos. That\u2019s a big win, and the percentage boost could prove crucial in the race to finish top of Conference A (mind you Brisbane and Gold Coast\u2019s draw yesterday wouldn\u2019t have hurt their chances there). Really impressive kicking - that one will send a shudder across the league. And some news from the pugilism - you have a new heavyweight world champion, folks: W-League - Goal! Newcastle - Melbourne Victory (Jenkins) 40 min: Ugh. \u201cDo you know what that sound is, Highness? Those are the Shrieking Eels.\u201d The spirits are sapping out of these Jets players like a leaking balloon - and you just know it\u2019s not your day when your opponents twice clatter the crossbar, and then still tuck it home. It seemed inevitable that would go in - Newcastle are in real trouble. Gema Simon needs to rally her troops, or this could be a rout. W-League - Goal! Newcastle 0-3 Melbourne Victory (Dowie) 33 min: Well, it ain\u2019t a party until it\u2019s a Dowie-party. The skipper goes joint top of the W-League golden boot charts alongside Sydney FC\u2019s Remy Siemsen, with her seventh of the campaign. It was a pretty direct ball in, but a brilliant lobbed finish, with Coelho little chance. AFLW - 3/4-time: Richmond 2.5 (17) v North Melbourne 9.3 (57) The good news for the Tigers is that they drew that quarter 2.1 a piece; the bad news is it would take something Herculean, and then some, to reel this one back in. They\u2019re not a million miles away statistically, but the Roos are just looking ruthless in the goalsquare. Kaitlyn Ashmore has three, two a piece to Abby Green and Emma Kearney, with Kate Gillespie-Jones and Jasmin Garner the rest. Tere tulemast! Good day to you, you lovers of sport, from wherever you\u2019re following this around the globe. Can you feel it? Can you feel the heat; the fire; the Berrrrrrn? As my good colleague Scott just pointed out, if you can bet on it, it\u2019s a sport - so if I\u2019m starved for action today apologies in advance if I pop in references to the Democratic primary race in Nevada. In the interim, W-League and AFLW will be the flavours de jour until a tasty Central Coast Mariners v Sydney battle. He had lost eleven from thirteen, she was on an eleven game from twelve winning streak: they were the original Odd Couple. Well, good folks of Sunday Sportwatch, my job here is done. As promised earlier, Richard Parkin is overcoming the pain of his bleeding stumps (the appendages formerly known as his fingers) to take you through to bed time. Or, unless you\u2019re in the Baltics, lunch. Take it away, Parko! W-League: GOAL! Newcastle 0-2 Melbourne Victory (Longo 7\u2019) Eesh. If I wasn\u2019t channeling Alan Hansen before, I sure am now. Teeeeeeerible defendin\u2019! The Jets are fairly well snoozing at the back, lead-footed, heavy first touches, not accounting for their opponents. Longo slices her way through following a Jets skill error and strikes truly to make it two for the Victory and two for her good self. W-League: GOAL! Newcastle 0-1 Melbourne Victory (Longo 3\u2019) We are up, up and away in the day\u2019s W-League clash between Newcastle and Melbourne Victory, and it\u2019s Victory who\u2019ve hit the ground running with an early goal. Terrible defending, really, from the Jets, allowing a corner through to the danger area of the box and Annalie Longo to nod home pretty much unchallenged. The Victory will be wanting a nice away kill here to shore up a top-four spot and this is a step in the right direction. AFLW: HT: Richmond 0.4 (4) v North Melbourne 7.2 (44) Well, if Richmond were hanging on at quarter-time they\u2019ve fairly well fallen off the cliff now. The second term might have been termed The North Melbourne Show: 5.2 to 0.1, plenty inside-50s to one. It\u2019s all starting in the middle and it flows from there. With a disposal count 119-66 in favour of the Kangas, Richmond just can\u2019t get their paws on the ball. And when they do, they\u2019re mobbed by a rabid tackling unit. Ashleigh Riddell (17 touches) is winning the ball for fun and Emma Kearney is dominating; up front they have options galore. If you were wondering why North are flag favourites, wonder no more. Supercars: Holden\u2019s van Gisbergen takes Adelaide pole Another Holden star has secured pole position at the Adelaide 500 with Shane van Gisbergen backing up Jamie Whincup\u2019s race one efforts at the Supercars\u2019 season-opening event. Van Gisbergen claimed the top-10 shootout from Ford star Scott McLaughlin at the South Australian capital\u2019s street circuit. Tickford Racing\u2019s Cameron Waters, in his Ford Mustang, rounded out the top-three for Sunday\u2019s 78-lap race. Seven-time champion Whincup couldn\u2019t replicate his Saturday feats when he secured an emotional victory, which he dedicated to everyone involved with Holden. But his Triple Eight teammate van Gisbergen ensured Red Bull Holden made it seven poles in a row after taking the last five of 2019. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been good to be on the front row (with Whincup),\u201d van Gisbergen said. \u201cBut an awesome race (ahead) with Scotty starting up front there so looking forward to it.\u201d But two-time defending series champion McLaughlin will fancy his chances of taking the race from second. The Shell V-Power star started from seventh in race one but quickly cruised through the field to finish second in his Mustang. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be at the front, we\u2019ve got track position, try and force their (Holden\u2019s) hand a little bit,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited for the race, just get to a good start and go around the outside or something.\u201d - with thanks to AAP You know, I doubted I had much at all in common with Tom Daley. Not so. I know exactly what he means. AFLW: QT: Richmond 0.3 (3) v North Melbourne 2.0 (12) They probably could have had one or two more, the Kangaroos, but Richmond weren\u2019t bereft of their own chances on goal. But footy - rather like, if you\u2019ll indulge me, life - is all about taking your chances, and North are doing that better at the moment. The stats say the Kangas are smashing this one: 67-32 disposals (43-14 uncontested) and 22-5 marks shows to what degree they\u2019re controlling the ball, but with only a 6-5 edge in inside-50s Richmond are not out of this yet. AFLW: Q1: 5 mins rem: Richmond 0.3 (3) v North Melbourne 2.0 (12) The Kangaroos are expected to go great things this season and it\u2019s easy to see why going off initial impressions. Two straight for the Kangas. Meanwhile, over in Las Vegas ... \u201cI think it was a fair decision and a good fight,\u201d says Sebastian Fundora, the super welterweight prospect who outpointed Australia\u2019s Daniel Lewis in the PPV opener. And Emanuel Navarrete has successfully defended his WBO super bantamweight title with an 11th-round stoppage of Jeo Tupas Santisima. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Bryan Graham is ringside for your reading pleasure. Not long now until Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury take to the ring. A couple of consolation goals to West Coast in the last quarter, including a huge roost to Imahra Cameron late in proceedings, but nothing can detract from a what was a terrific win for the Giants. They dominated from the outset, ran harder, tackled harder and simply wanted it more. But for Cameron\u2019s major at the death this would have been GWS\u2019s biggest victory. Nevermind, they go 2-1 for the season and quickly put to bed last week\u2019s disappointing loss to North Melbourne. Three goals to off-season signing Rebecca Privitelli is a big tick, and there were more good signs from Jacinda Barclay in her return after missing the 2019 campaign. Dana Hooker can hold her head high - she was West Coast\u2019s best, maybe even best on ground - and it\u2019s to be hoped she\u2019s OK after leaving the field late in the game following a knock to the throat. Not much to smile about from an Eagles perspective, but this is something. No, this really is something. AFLW: Q4: 12 mins rem: GWS Giants 5.4 (34) v West Coast 1.1 (7) The Eagles score a behind to finally trouble the scorer, then add another six points albeit in unconvincing fashion. Mikayla Bowen is the goal kicker, nearly shanking a snap that could, would have been touched had Jessica Dal Pos not stopped in anticipation of a free-kick going back to a prior contest. In the end, the ump pays advantage and the goal stands ... even if to muddy the waters even further, Dal Pos claims she in fact did get a fingernail onto the ball. Sound confusing? It is. Nevermind, it\u2019s 34-7 to the Giants. AFLW: 3QT: GWS Giants 5.4 (34) v West Coast 0.0 (0) They just can\u2019t take a trick, the Eagles. GWS are dominating this match, moving the ball at will and finding space at every turn on the wide expanses at Blacktown. They are simply working harder. Rebecca Privitelli is on fire, adding two majors in the third term to go with her goal in the second. What a superb off-season pick-up. When they do go forward, West Coast can do no more than go long to contests. The result, of course, is the ball just comes straight back out. And, my, are the Giants tackling ferociously. The only matter that\u2019s up in the air now is whether the Eagles will get on the scoreboard. It\u2019s a moot point. Geddit? Still on the cricket, just have to pop this in. The only thing I like better than a South African is a South African with a sense of humour. So Australia\u2019s men\u2019s cricketers head back to South Africa for the first time since Sandpapergate and the local media is sinking the boot in. Of course they are. Certain individuals had this coming after that gross error of judgment. But now for the punchline. It\u2019s not Australia who are coming in for rough treatment. It\u2019s South Africa after that limp, pathetic performance in the first T20. Lowest T20 score, heaviest defeat in that format of the game. Over to you, South African scribes. AFLW: HT: GWS Giants 3.2 (20) v West Coast 0.0 (0) It\u2019s all the Giants at Blacktown, with the Eagles scoreless, going at less than 40% in disposal efficiency and making skill error after skill error. In fairness, GWS\u2019s pressure is excellent so no wonder West Coast players are jumping at shadows. Majors to Cora Staunton and Jacinda Barclay gave the Giants the edge before a goal late in the half to Rebecca Privitelli, her first for the club, sent the hosts to the long break cock-a-hoop. Kudos to Alyce Parker, who with 12 touches to half-time is having a day out. Boxing: The undercard is under way in Vegas, meaning we are about two hours away from the big fight, the big rematch: Deontay Wilder v Tyson Fury. It\u2019s been dubbed the most important heavyweight title fight since the return meeting between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield in 1999. I watched that fight in Penrith pub, as it goes. I repeat of that fight\u2019s drama would be good, but I\u2019m sort of pinning my hopes on another Tyson v Douglas. Hello and welcome to this Sunday edition of Sportwatch. Yesterday\u2019s choc-a-bloc offering will take some topping - Richard Parkin\u2019s legion of disciples will be hoping against hope his \u201cbleeding stumps\u201d of fingers will have recovered in time for the later shift - but there is still plenty on to keep us interested and out of trouble. In addition to the blockbuster heavyweight rematch between Deontay Wilder v Tyson Fury in Las Vegas - covered in a separate liveblog - domestically there are three AFLW games, some A-League, some W-League and some other things that will no doubt sneak their way in. Delighted to have your company. Any musings, thoughts, compliments and/or reflections - save your complaints and suggestions for Parko - can be directed to me via Email or Twitter - @scott_heinrich.",

They had 21 shots to Chelsea\u2019s six but Mario G\u00f3mez\u2019s finishing was poor. </em><em>Cech was </em><em>inspired in goal for Chelsea and Bayern had a goal disallowed for offside</em><em> but Thomas M\u00fcller finally gave the</em><em>m the lead in the 83rd minute.</em></p> <p><strong>Lahm</strong> Thomas\u2019s goal was a huge relief. I didn\u2019t think we were going to let victory slip out of our hands. Then again we had lost a few matches during the season after we\u2019d been leading and playing better.</p> <p><strong>Ferreira </strong>After they scored maybe they felt: \u201cChelsea will have to take some risks and we might get a second goal.\u201d They had a chance to go 2-0 up.</p> <p><strong>Mikel</strong> John Terry was not on the pitch so Lamps was pushing everyone. Drogba, too. We were all pushing each other. Lamps came to me and said: \u201cJohn boy, we have to keep going. We can\u2019t lose here.\u201d We still had that belief.</p> <p><em>In the 88th minute Chelsea won their only corner. David Luiz ran up to contest it and</em><em> as he passed Bastian Schweinsteiger</em><em> he said: \u201cAnd now goal.\u201d Juan Mata swung it in and </em><em>Drogba scored with a bullet header.</em></p> <p><strong>Lahm</strong> It was a perfect corner and a perfect header. You\u2019d need about 50 attempts to swing a corner right in front of the goal like that and for the striker to head it that hard and with such precision. There\u2019s nothing you can do to prevent amazing efforts like that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7f20347d756ba78fe48d58d53eec5510b487676\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7f20347d756ba78fe48d58d53eec5510b487676/0_0_3850_2508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Didier Drogba heads home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Didier Drogba heads home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Ashton/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ferreira </strong>The header was unbelievable. On the bench we just exploded.</p> <p><strong>Mikel </strong>I thought: \u201cThat\u2019s it, we\u2019re definitely winning.\u201d</p> <p><em>It was 1-1 after normal time. Then, in the third minute of extra time Drogba fouled Rib\u00e9ry to concede a penalty.</em></p> <p><strong>Ferreira </strong>You do everything to help the team, even if you\u2019re a striker. But Drogba dropped so much he gave away a penalty against Barcelona in the semi-final and against Bayern he did it again. Fortunately for us they both missed.</p> <p><em>Barcelona\u2019s Lionel Messi hit the bar while Robben was foiled by Cech \u2013 after some gamesmanship from Mikel.</em></p> <p><strong>Mikel </strong>I went straight to Robben and I said: \u201cWatch, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re going to miss it.\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at me. We know each other from our days at Chelsea together. And I said to him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss it. Watch and see. You\u2019re definitely going to miss it.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything to me. He hit it and he missed. I was like: \u201cWow. I guessed right.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Lahm </strong>I wouldn\u2019t take that sort of intimidation. If a player says: \u201cAnd now goal,\u201d that\u2019s something positive. But \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss\u201d is below the belt; it contradicts the values of fair play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"655992c62f803a4920d7bfb56cfb0fcedff1ce8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/655992c62f803a4920d7bfb56cfb0fcedff1ce8b/0_156_4365_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philipp Lahm (left) battles for the ball with Ryan Bertrand (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philipp Lahm (left) battles for the ball with Ryan Bertrand (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ferreira: </strong>That\u2019s psychological. But Petr knew Robben. When the player knows a goalkeeper, knows which your best side is, you never know. If they score at that time we probably wouldn\u2019t make it.</p> <p><strong>Mikel </strong>In the week leading up to the game something was telling me: \u201cWe will win.\u201d We\u2019d had so many years where we\u2019d had disappointment. The semi-final against Barcelona in 2009 where everyone thought we were robbed at home and 2008 as well when we lost on penalties to United.</p> <p><strong>Ferreira </strong>I have this story about my housekeeper. She is Portuguese and I remember just before we went to Germany, she said: \u201cPaulo, I shouldn\u2019t say this but you guys are going to win.\u201d I was asking and asking why and finally she told me. And it was unbelievable. She said: \u201cWhen did Paulo become a professional? 18, almost turning 19. What is Paulo\u2019s shirt number? 19. When is the final? 19 May. I\u2019m not saying anything else.\u201d When M\u00fcller scored, I\u2019m thinking: \u201cShe told me this and now we concede, come on ...\u201d But then when Didier scores I said: \u201cOh. Wait a minute ...\u201d Then Robben misses and I felt: \u201cWe will win this final.\u201d</p> <p><em>It went to penalties. Di Matteo had almost brought Ferreira on for Mata.</em></p> <p><strong>Ferreira </strong>There were five minutes left and Mata was completely dead. I was supposed to play in midfield. In five minutes anything can happen. But I just remember looking at Robbie and saying: \u201cI\u2019m not a penalty taker, Mata is.\u201d We stopped and went back. We lost the semi-final to Liverpool in 2007 on penalties. We made a circle with Jos\u00e9 [Mourinho] and he was asking: \u201cWho\u2019s taking the first one?\u201d Then he looked at me and said: \u201cPaulo, you will be last \u2013 even Carlo Cudicini will be in front of you.\u201d But in the end Mata missed and I wanted to kill him at the end of the game. I was saying: \u201cI lost the chance to play a few minutes because I was thinking about you.\u201d</p> <p><em>Bayern were on top after Mata\u2019s miss. But then Cech denied Ivica </em><em>Olic</em><em> and Schweinsteiger.</em></p> <p><strong>Ferreira </strong>Petr had that need of having a night where he could save penalties. We\u2019d come to finals before and lost on penalties. He was fantastic.</p> <p><strong>Mikel </strong>The penalties were nerve-racking. When I saw one of my teammates going forward, some of them I watched and some I couldn\u2019t because I was so nervous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"745265009bdbee0b98409d1c2fc4e76728e8e0cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/745265009bdbee0b98409d1c2fc4e76728e8e0cd/12_20_4540_2725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea\u2019s Petr Cech saves the penalty of Ivica Olic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea\u2019s Petr Cech saves the penalty of Ivica Olic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Drogba stepped up to take the decisive kick and sent Manuel Neuer the wrong way.</em></p> <p><strong>Mikel </strong>Drogba was not on the field to take his penalty in 2008 against United as he\u2019d been sent off.

I\u2019d been on loan at Nottingham Forest and I had Billy Davies as my manager and he always used to scream: \u201cPlay the game and not the occasion.\u201d That was in my head. John Terry was suspended following his red card in Chelsea\u2019s semi\u2011final win over Barcelona. Ramires, Raul Meireles and Branislav Ivanovic were also out. Ferreira Gary Cahill and David Luiz had injuries and I was ready to play at centre-half in case either of them didn\u2019t make it but they did. I even did the warm-up with the starting XI. But as David Luiz said, it\u2019s about motivation, adrenaline. You go through any pain you might have. We knew Bayern would probably have more possession. But in these finals it is all about the details, about concentration. Lampard captained the side and Terry sat behind the bench. Ferreira Even I was quite active on the bench. I remember talking with Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa, trying to help him with his body position. He was up against Franck Rib\u00e9ry. You are not just sitting on the bench to watch the game. You want to help. Bayern bossed the game. They had 21 shots to Chelsea\u2019s six but Mario G\u00f3mez\u2019s finishing was poor. Cech was inspired in goal for Chelsea and Bayern had a goal disallowed for offside but Thomas M\u00fcller finally gave them the lead in the 83rd minute. Lahm Thomas\u2019s goal was a huge relief. I didn\u2019t think we were going to let victory slip out of our hands. Then again we had lost a few matches during the season after we\u2019d been leading and playing better. Ferreira After they scored maybe they felt: \u201cChelsea will have to take some risks and we might get a second goal.\u201d They had a chance to go 2-0 up. Mikel John Terry was not on the pitch so Lamps was pushing everyone. Drogba, too. We were all pushing each other. Lamps came to me and said: \u201cJohn boy, we have to keep going. We can\u2019t lose here.\u201d We still had that belief. In the 88th minute Chelsea won their only corner. David Luiz ran up to contest it and as he passed Bastian Schweinsteiger he said: \u201cAnd now goal.\u201d Juan Mata swung it in and Drogba scored with a bullet header. Lahm It was a perfect corner and a perfect header. You\u2019d need about 50 attempts to swing a corner right in front of the goal like that and for the striker to head it that hard and with such precision. There\u2019s nothing you can do to prevent amazing efforts like that. Ferreira The header was unbelievable. On the bench we just exploded. Mikel I thought: \u201cThat\u2019s it, we\u2019re definitely winning.\u201d It was 1-1 after normal time. Then, in the third minute of extra time Drogba fouled Rib\u00e9ry to concede a penalty. Ferreira You do everything to help the team, even if you\u2019re a striker. But Drogba dropped so much he gave away a penalty against Barcelona in the semi-final and against Bayern he did it again. Fortunately for us they both missed. Barcelona\u2019s Lionel Messi hit the bar while Robben was foiled by Cech \u2013 after some gamesmanship from Mikel. Mikel I went straight to Robben and I said: \u201cWatch, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re going to miss it.\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at me. We know each other from our days at Chelsea together. And I said to him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss it. Watch and see. You\u2019re definitely going to miss it.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything to me. He hit it and he missed. I was like: \u201cWow. I guessed right.\u201d Lahm I wouldn\u2019t take that sort of intimidation. If a player says: \u201cAnd now goal,\u201d that\u2019s something positive. But \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss\u201d is below the belt; it contradicts the values of fair play. Ferreira: That\u2019s psychological. But Petr knew Robben. When the player knows a goalkeeper, knows which your best side is, you never know. If they score at that time we probably wouldn\u2019t make it. Mikel In the week leading up to the game something was telling me: \u201cWe will win.\u201d We\u2019d had so many years where we\u2019d had disappointment. The semi-final against Barcelona in 2009 where everyone thought we were robbed at home and 2008 as well when we lost on penalties to United. Ferreira I have this story about my housekeeper. She is Portuguese and I remember just before we went to Germany, she said: \u201cPaulo, I shouldn\u2019t say this but you guys are going to win.\u201d I was asking and asking why and finally she told me. And it was unbelievable. She said: \u201cWhen did Paulo become a professional? 18, almost turning 19. What is Paulo\u2019s shirt number? 19. When is the final? 19 May. I\u2019m not saying anything else.\u201d When M\u00fcller scored, I\u2019m thinking: \u201cShe told me this and now we concede, come on ...\u201d But then when Didier scores I said: \u201cOh. Wait a minute ...\u201d Then Robben misses and I felt: \u201cWe will win this final.\u201d It went to penalties. Di Matteo had almost brought Ferreira on for Mata. Ferreira There were five minutes left and Mata was completely dead. I was supposed to play in midfield. In five minutes anything can happen. But I just remember looking at Robbie and saying: \u201cI\u2019m not a penalty taker, Mata is.\u201d We stopped and went back. We lost the semi-final to Liverpool in 2007 on penalties. We made a circle with Jos\u00e9 [Mourinho] and he was asking: \u201cWho\u2019s taking the first one?\u201d Then he looked at me and said: \u201cPaulo, you will be last \u2013 even Carlo Cudicini will be in front of you.\u201d But in the end Mata missed and I wanted to kill him at the end of the game. I was saying: \u201cI lost the chance to play a few minutes because I was thinking about you.\u201d Bayern were on top after Mata\u2019s miss. But then Cech denied Ivica Olic and Schweinsteiger. Ferreira Petr had that need of having a night where he could save penalties. We\u2019d come to finals before and lost on penalties. He was fantastic. Mikel The penalties were nerve-racking. When I saw one of my teammates going forward, some of them I watched and some I couldn\u2019t because I was so nervous. Drogba stepped up to take the decisive kick and sent Manuel Neuer the wrong way. Mikel Drogba was not on the field to take his penalty in 2008 against United as he\u2019d been sent off. Seeing Drogba go up to take the fifth penalty, I knew it was over. Ferreira Everyone knew. He was not just a top player but he was very focused. You see how many steps he took. Short steps. He was so confident. Mikel When Drogba scored that penalty, oh my God. I didn\u2019t even know where to run. I was just lost, over the moon. Everyone had written us off. We were like: \u201cWow. How did we do that?\u201d Lahm What that match left behind was a pretty intense feeling. I just knew that we weren\u2019t going to stay lying face down on the ground. Losing to Chelsea was bitter but it served a purpose: it made us into the team we became. Bayern won the Champions League the following season but 2012 belonged to Chelsea. Their victory ensured Tottenham would play in the Europa League despite finishing fourth in the Premier League. There were cigars in the dressing room and wild celebrations back at the hotel. Bertrand Cigars are associated with winning. So they were out in abundance. Did we know how to smoke them? Not at that stage. We were just choking on them. Mikel The after-party was something else. No one could sleep. I had to come out of my room because I couldn\u2019t sleep and there was the party going on, people throwing people into the pool. Roman Abramovich was there. There was a few drinks going on. Did anyone throw Roman in? No chance. Who is going to dare to do that? Ferreira Didier went to the top floor where the swimming pool was. We threw Gary Cahill fully dressed in the pool. Mikel A few players slept in their suits on the roof terrace. I don\u2019t know who they were but I think Drogba was among them because I saw him with his suit on in the morning. Terry gave mini replicas of the trophy to his teammates. Mikel John, in his position as the captain, had made the replicas. Also, Drogba made some rings for the players, NBA-style ones. We\u2019ve all got rings \u2013 2012 Champions League winner. That\u2019s something that you appreciate for ever. To be the first club in London to have won it, that was the biggest history ever.",

It\u2019s also \u2013 more juicily \u2013 about her experiences as an editor working with authors including Sarah Waters, Maya Angelou, Margaret Atwood and Sarah Dunant.</p> <p>For the historical lead-in, Goodings maintains a careful, stately tone, like the voiceover in a prestigious BBC period drama about ladies: <em>The House of Elliot</em>, but for books.

Putting women\u2019s lives, women\u2019s stories and women\u2019s words back into history requires work. <em>A Bite of the Apple</em> is about the women who did this work from the 1970s onwards, a time of huge activism around race, class and sex, when \u201cwomen wanted a voice, women wanted to understand their history, women wanted to see themselves on the page\u2026 women wanted their share\u201d.</p> <p>The book is informative about the realities of the publishing world: the small offices and narrow margins, keeping one\u2019s integrity while needing a hit to keep it all afloat. And is <em>A Bite of The Apple</em> one such hit? Well, it totally lacks the malice that makes a literary memoir truly great \u2013 the touch of poison that seasons the recipe. Except for a sociopathic priest (watch out for that brief but nasty episode) Goodings really doesn\u2019t have a bad word for anyone, and it\u2019s a tremendous shame. Occasionally a dash of grit enters, as when describing <em>Regeneration</em> author Pat Barker, who had early success with bold novels about northern, working-class women until \u201cshe left Virago to write books about war from men\u2019s point of view\u201d.</p> <p>The book snaps into wit and colour when she reflects on her experiences as a dedicated and worldly editor. She is great at acute, observant character snapshots: \u201cI think of Sarah [Dunant] like a little ferret \u2013 down she goes and then up she comes \u2013 grinning with the prize \u2013 the truth.\u201d The late, great Angela Carter \u201cwas a sociable soul with voracious curiosity\u2026 she was clever, witty and eccentric in her dress and manner which gave her a slightly distracted demeanour \u2013 but she was actually bull\u2019s-eye sharp with bracing, sometimes lacerating, observations\u201d.</p> <p>At the core of this book is a curiously Victorian message about the value of sincerity and of acting in good faith. Goodings\u2019s love of books is the seed from which her outer success has sprung, and when she writes from her real self \u2013 the voracious reader, not the dutiful historian \u2013 the book is moving and hugely inspiring: \u201cStories, histories, memoirs, rants, poems\u2026. were like fireworks, rockets lighting up possibilities, blowing up old, entrenched ideas; words were going to tear down and rebuild the world.\u201d</p> <p>Even her briefest comments about editing text and bringing a manuscript to publication zing with deep understanding. \u201cWriting \u2013 and therefore editing \u2013 is tough, close work,\u201d she says, \u201cbut helping an author as she forges words, ideas and characters into a shape and then watching as it alchemises into life: for me, that is a hard-won, deep pleasure\u2026 What is editing? It\u2019s sitting up at a table to read, paying close attention to every line and word, pencil in hand to mark the places where one is bored or confused or excited or engaged. It\u2019s being preternaturally alert to one\u2019s responses to the text.\u201d When she makes a meaningful suggestion to an author \u201cit\u2019s almost like hitting \u2018tilt\u2019 at the machines: you can see the author light up and the penny dropping all the way\u201d.</p> <p>As a cultural history, <em>A Bite of the Apple</em> is clear. As a reminder of female artists\u2019 ongoing fight for space and respect, it\u2019s necessary. As a riff on writers and writing, it\u2019s essential.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Bite of the Apple</em> by Lennie Goodings is published by Oxford University Press (\u00a316.99).

The book snaps into wit and colour when she reflects on her experiences as a dedicated and worldly editor. She is great at acute, observant character snapshots: \u201cI think of Sarah [Dunant] like a little ferret \u2013 down she goes and then up she comes \u2013 grinning with the prize \u2013 the truth.\u201d The late, great Angela Carter \u201cwas a sociable soul with voracious curiosity\u2026 she was clever, witty and eccentric in her dress and manner which gave her a slightly distracted demeanour \u2013 but she was actually bull\u2019s-eye sharp with bracing, sometimes lacerating, observations\u201d. At the core of this book is a curiously Victorian message about the value of sincerity and of acting in good faith. Goodings\u2019s love of books is the seed from which her outer success has sprung, and when she writes from her real self \u2013 the voracious reader, not the dutiful historian \u2013 the book is moving and hugely inspiring: \u201cStories, histories, memoirs, rants, poems\u2026. were like fireworks, rockets lighting up possibilities, blowing up old, entrenched ideas; words were going to tear down and rebuild the world.\u201d Even her briefest comments about editing text and bringing a manuscript to publication zing with deep understanding. \u201cWriting \u2013 and therefore editing \u2013 is tough, close work,\u201d she says, \u201cbut helping an author as she forges words, ideas and characters into a shape and then watching as it alchemises into life: for me, that is a hard-won, deep pleasure\u2026 What is editing? It\u2019s sitting up at a table to read, paying close attention to every line and word, pencil in hand to mark the places where one is bored or confused or excited or engaged. It\u2019s being preternaturally alert to one\u2019s responses to the text.\u201d When she makes a meaningful suggestion to an author \u201cit\u2019s almost like hitting \u2018tilt\u2019 at the machines: you can see the author light up and the penny dropping all the way\u201d. As a cultural history, A Bite of the Apple is clear. As a reminder of female artists\u2019 ongoing fight for space and respect, it\u2019s necessary. As a riff on writers and writing, it\u2019s essential. \u2022 A Bite of the Apple by Lennie Goodings is published by Oxford University Press (\u00a316.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

Competing with confinement dairies \u2013 \u201cconcentrated animal feeding operations\u201d as they are curdlingly known \u2013 was impossible. The huge farms were shipping organic milk from Texas into Wisconsin for a lower price than Goodman was getting paid. \u201cYou know, you can\u2019t compete with that,\u201d he says. As prices collapsed a planned sale fell through. He sold the land and then the cows. \u201cI guess for me, that may have been harder than actually selling land because here you tend to be pretty attached to your cattle.\u201d Each cow in his 50-strong herd had a name. Lara was his favorite. \u201cWhen I would come in, she would always just turn around and kind of look at me, looking for someone to scratch her head,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seemed like whenever she saw you, she just had to stop and look at you like she sort of was making that connection that you\u2019re OK.\u201d In Elkhorn, some 130 miles south of Wonewoc, Dave Kyle is hopeful he has found a solution. Kyle, a youthful, trim 60-year-old with hands that look like they could snap a girder, raises brown cows, not the black and white Holsteins that are the most popular breed of dairy cattle in the US. His 150-strong herd produces \u201cA2 milk\u201d that mostly lacks a form of \u03b2-casein protein called A1 that proponents argue is easier for people with milk intolerance to digest. He and his wife Laurie also run Perkup, a cosy cafe in Elkhorn, where you can get an A2 latte \u2013 but no nut milks. Unusually in a rapidly ageing industry Kyle also has an heir. Hayden Kyle, 26, works with his dad and aims to one day take over the farm - in an industry where the average age of a farmer is 58, that is a big advantage. Hayden Kyle wasn\u2019t interested in farming when he was younger. After college he worked at a department store for a year then told his dad: \u201cI think I want to farm.\u201d It\u2019s not a popular choice among his peers. \u201cThere were 250 kids in my high school class and maybe one other kid is farming,\u201d says Hayden Kyle. For those less fortunate, life can look bleak. \u201cI know of some farmers that have committed suicide,\u201d says Kyle. \u201cThey were third or fourth generation and now the farm ends with them and they feel that terrible burden of, you know, it was on my watch that this fell apart,\u201d he says. \u201cI could see where it gets very overwhelming.\u201d Farm Aid, the farmers\u2019 support group, started a crisis line during the farming crisis of the 1980s. Goodman says people at Farm Aid have told him the level of calls is now higher than back then. He says farmers should know that the forces ranged against them are beyond their control. \u201cYou can\u2019t just categorically say, well, it was my fault, I did something wrong, because you didn\u2019t. You just happen to get caught up in a system that\u2019s not working.\u201d \u2022 In the US, the suicide prevention lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Other international helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org",

      "body": "<p>Elena Rossi* was quoted \u00a32,400 by her plumber for repairs to her boiler. The bill was duly emailed and Rossi transferred the sum. Only when the plumber chased her for payment did she discover that the money had been paid to a fraudster. \u201cWe found out that the scammer had hacked the plumber\u2019s email account and was sending and intercepting emails from it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe invoice arrived when expected, for the exact amount, from the correct email address with the company logo on its letterhead and the correct breakdown for the work. We had no reason to suspect that there was anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Her bank, The Co-operative, refused to refund the stolen money and when Rossi complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service, it upheld the decision because she had authorised the payment and the bank had not acted negligently.</p> <p>Rossi\u2019s misfortune was that she was defrauded last March, two months before a voluntary code, the contingent reimbursement model, was introduced. The code requires participating banks to refund blameless victims of authorised push-payment (APP) fraud and The Co-operative became the ninth bank to sign up in December.</p> <p>The bank told the <em>Observer</em> Rossi\u2019s case was under review by the ombudsman, but since the code is not retrospective, it will be assessed according to the criteria in place last March, when refunds were only due if banks were found to have been negligent in investigating the fraud.</p> <p>More than \u00a3200m was stolen from customers through APP fraud in the first half of 2019 and the crime is soaring. Rossi\u2019s ordeal exposes the lottery of trying to claim a refund as success depends on when the fraud happened, the bank and what method the scammers used to deceive.</p> <p>Customers who bank with one of the 10 big players such as Monzo and Tesco who have yet to sign up to the code, remain unprotected. Even those with banks who have adopted it are not guaranteed their money back as the code excuses them from refunding victims who have been \u201ccareless\u201d. Since \u201ccarelessness\u201d is not defined, it can be interpreted as they wish.</p> <p>Victoria Ross lost \u00a325,000 after fraudsters sent her texts purporting to be from her bank flagging up suspicious activity on her Lloyds account and advising her to transfer her balance to a \u201csecure\u201d account in her name. \u201cThe texts were on my genuine Lloyds text message feed and I was asked to verify that the phone number was the same as the phone number on my Lloyds bank card which it was,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Lloyds told the <em>Observer</em> that Ross did not take sufficient steps to verify that the text message was genuine and ignored a fraud warning about spoofed numbers\u2019 \u201csafe\u201d accounts.</p> <p>Ross only recalls a generic fraud alert which the scammers told her was a default message sent before every transaction. .</p> <p>A report by campaign group Which? has concluded that banks are unfairly penalising customers who ignore automated fraud warnings. These are required by the code to be clear, impactful, timely and tailored to the specific scenario.</p> <p>The practice could result in a PPI-like scandal, according to Pradeep Oliver, partner at Cripps Pemberton Greenish. \u201cIf it can be proven that the banks are adopting a blanket procedure in which they are refusing to refund customers due to generalised and non-specific warnings, I would hope that the FCA would intervene sooner rather than later,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Scammers are so adept at \u201csocially engineering\u201d victims to engage their trust and instil panic they are commonly too flustered to think rationally, even when banks specifically flag up a suspicious transaction.</p> <p>Last month, business owner Emily Church* was groomed over nine hours of phone calls from criminals posing as officials from the Royal Courts of Justice and her bank, to believe she faced jail over irregular tax returns. Fraudsters gained her trust by spoofing the Royal Courts phone number, reeling off official-sounding case numbers and citing the dates of warning letters she had failed to respond to. She was told that she could settle out of court provided she signed a confidentiality agreement.</p> <p>\u201cThey impressed upon me that a custodial sentence would mean the possible loss of my home, inability to get a mortgage, not being able to see my children and losing my business and reputation,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She was duped into paying \u00a312,500 from her Lloyds and Santander accounts and misleading bank staff when they called her to question the transactions. \u201cI was frightened that if I didn\u2019t make something up then I wouldn\u2019t be able to make a payment, and would end up not seeing my boys grow up,\u201d she adds. The fraud was exposed when her partner, alarmed by her changed behaviour, prised the truth from her. Santander and Lloyds were unable to reclaim the stolen funds and told the <em>Observer </em>they would not refund her because she overrode automated and verbal warnings of a possible fraud.</p> <p>Church plans to refer her case to the Financial Ombudsman Service which recently upheld a complaint from a victim of a very similar scenario. It ordered the bank to refund the \u00a3100,000 stolen, despite the fact that the customer, like Church, had given a cover story to staff.</p> <p>Critics claim that regulations have failed to keep pace with evolving technology. The ombudsman was only given powers to investigate complaints about APP fraud a year ago. And not until the end of March will the UK\u2019s six largest banking groups finally be required to confirm that the name of the account a customer is paying into matches the name they have entered in the payee box. Currently, only the account number and sort code is matched, enabling fraudsters to convince victims that they are transferring money to a safe account in their name.</p> <p>A recent Treasury committee report concluded that this has led to thousands being defrauded since banks were first warned of the problem in 2016 and they should retrospectively reimburse them. The committee also recommends that first-time payments to a new account are delayed 24 hours to allow customers to reconsider and that the CRM code is made compulsory.</p> <p>Crucially, current rules do not allow banks to prevent a payment authorised by a customer, even if they suspect it\u2019s a scam, or to retrieve fraudulently transferred funds from a beneficiary account without a court order. They are also expected to complete a transaction within two hours under banking regulations.</p> <p>These rules cost Nick Hutchinson* the \u00a34,000 that left his account with The Co-operative 10 days after he informed the bank he\u2019d fallen victim to an APP scam and it refused a refund. It said that the sum consisted of several card transactions made by the fraudster before Hutchinson reported it and which it was powerless to prevent under card scheme rules, even though there was a 10-day delay before the money was claimed. After contact from the <em>Observer </em>it refunded \u00a33,750, as he only specifically authorised an initial \u00a3250 payment.</p> <p>Financial trading body UK Finance reckons urgent reform is needed to give banks more powers when a customer is taken in. \u201cA clearer and more effective legal and regulatory framework is needed to help address early indications of fraud and thereby help reduce harm to victims,\u201d it says.</p> <p><em>* Name has been changed</em></p>",

Rossi\u2019s ordeal exposes the lottery of trying to claim a refund as success depends on when the fraud happened, the bank and what method the scammers used to deceive. Customers who bank with one of the 10 big players such as Monzo and Tesco who have yet to sign up to the code, remain unprotected. Even those with banks who have adopted it are not guaranteed their money back as the code excuses them from refunding victims who have been \u201ccareless\u201d. Since \u201ccarelessness\u201d is not defined, it can be interpreted as they wish. Victoria Ross lost \u00a325,000 after fraudsters sent her texts purporting to be from her bank flagging up suspicious activity on her Lloyds account and advising her to transfer her balance to a \u201csecure\u201d account in her name. \u201cThe texts were on my genuine Lloyds text message feed and I was asked to verify that the phone number was the same as the phone number on my Lloyds bank card which it was,\u201d she says. Lloyds told the Observer that Ross did not take sufficient steps to verify that the text message was genuine and ignored a fraud warning about spoofed numbers\u2019 \u201csafe\u201d accounts. Ross only recalls a generic fraud alert which the scammers told her was a default message sent before every transaction. . A report by campaign group Which? has concluded that banks are unfairly penalising customers who ignore automated fraud warnings. These are required by the code to be clear, impactful, timely and tailored to the specific scenario. The practice could result in a PPI-like scandal, according to Pradeep Oliver, partner at Cripps Pemberton Greenish. \u201cIf it can be proven that the banks are adopting a blanket procedure in which they are refusing to refund customers due to generalised and non-specific warnings, I would hope that the FCA would intervene sooner rather than later,\u201d he says. Scammers are so adept at \u201csocially engineering\u201d victims to engage their trust and instil panic they are commonly too flustered to think rationally, even when banks specifically flag up a suspicious transaction. Last month, business owner Emily Church* was groomed over nine hours of phone calls from criminals posing as officials from the Royal Courts of Justice and her bank, to believe she faced jail over irregular tax returns. Fraudsters gained her trust by spoofing the Royal Courts phone number, reeling off official-sounding case numbers and citing the dates of warning letters she had failed to respond to. She was told that she could settle out of court provided she signed a confidentiality agreement. \u201cThey impressed upon me that a custodial sentence would mean the possible loss of my home, inability to get a mortgage, not being able to see my children and losing my business and reputation,\u201d she says. She was duped into paying \u00a312,500 from her Lloyds and Santander accounts and misleading bank staff when they called her to question the transactions. \u201cI was frightened that if I didn\u2019t make something up then I wouldn\u2019t be able to make a payment, and would end up not seeing my boys grow up,\u201d she adds. The fraud was exposed when her partner, alarmed by her changed behaviour, prised the truth from her. Santander and Lloyds were unable to reclaim the stolen funds and told the Observer they would not refund her because she overrode automated and verbal warnings of a possible fraud. Church plans to refer her case to the Financial Ombudsman Service which recently upheld a complaint from a victim of a very similar scenario. It ordered the bank to refund the \u00a3100,000 stolen, despite the fact that the customer, like Church, had given a cover story to staff. Critics claim that regulations have failed to keep pace with evolving technology. The ombudsman was only given powers to investigate complaints about APP fraud a year ago. And not until the end of March will the UK\u2019s six largest banking groups finally be required to confirm that the name of the account a customer is paying into matches the name they have entered in the payee box. Currently, only the account number and sort code is matched, enabling fraudsters to convince victims that they are transferring money to a safe account in their name. A recent Treasury committee report concluded that this has led to thousands being defrauded since banks were first warned of the problem in 2016 and they should retrospectively reimburse them. The committee also recommends that first-time payments to a new account are delayed 24 hours to allow customers to reconsider and that the CRM code is made compulsory. Crucially, current rules do not allow banks to prevent a payment authorised by a customer, even if they suspect it\u2019s a scam, or to retrieve fraudulently transferred funds from a beneficiary account without a court order. They are also expected to complete a transaction within two hours under banking regulations. These rules cost Nick Hutchinson* the \u00a34,000 that left his account with The Co-operative 10 days after he informed the bank he\u2019d fallen victim to an APP scam and it refused a refund. It said that the sum consisted of several card transactions made by the fraudster before Hutchinson reported it and which it was powerless to prevent under card scheme rules, even though there was a 10-day delay before the money was claimed. After contact from the Observer it refunded \u00a33,750, as he only specifically authorised an initial \u00a3250 payment. Financial trading body UK Finance reckons urgent reform is needed to give banks more powers when a customer is taken in. \u201cA clearer and more effective legal and regulatory framework is needed to help address early indications of fraud and thereby help reduce harm to victims,\u201d it says. * Name has been changed",

Tommie Smith and John Carlos made their Black Power salute at the Mexico Olympics in 1968, the year that Ashe won the first US Open. \u201cAlthough I did not always agree with everything these men had said and done,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI respected the way they had stood tall against the sky and had insisted on being heard on matters other than boxing or track and field.\u201d</p> <p>Since January, the entertainment industry\u2019s awards season has delivered a barrage of politically inspired protest from A-listers, be they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/18/dave-attacks-boris-johnson-in-brit-awards-performance-our-prime-ministers-a-real-racist\" title=\"\">Dave\u2019s takedown of Boris Johnson</a>, Oscar presenters trolling their own event or Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s personal crusade against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2020/feb/10/calves-and-cries-of-anguish-why-joaquin-phoenix-decried-the-dairy-industry\" title=\"\">big dairy</a>.

The Olympics have been playing their holier-than-thou, more-neutral-than-Switzerland shtick ever since Baron Pierre de Coubertin decided that training athletes for the modern pentathlon was the best way to stop the Prussians invading France. The IOC\u2019s breathtaking hypocrisy has been well-noted \u2013 the president backing this ban, Thomas Bach, is the same one who claimed that North and South Korea\u2019s joint 2032 bid was a contribution to world peace \u2013 but it\u2019s the sanctimony of its self-styled \u201cmission\u201d that really rankles.</p> <p>This is an organisation that wants to make very clear it is far too noble-minded to allow of the unfortunate \u201cdivisions\u201d in the real world. Smith\u2019s and Carlos\u2019s 68 protest came only a fortnight after hundreds of students were killed by the Mexican government in the very city that was hosting the Games. \u201cIf our Games were to be stopped every time the politicians violate the law of humanity,\u201d said Avery Brundage, the IOC president at the time, \u201cthere will never be any international contests.\u201d</p> <p>That magnanimity of spirit has not died: you can see it in the IOC\u2019s decision to stage its 2014 winter edition in a country that knows all about banning dissidents, as well as throwing them in jail \u2013 and far worse.</p> <p>But let\u2019s return to Ashe, a man who didn\u2019t have the luxury of pretending that sport existed in a fantasy world, where all-comers met on an equal footing of mutual respect and unity of purpose. He was born into a situation where simply picking up a racket, or walking on to a court, was political. As a young black man in the American south in the mid-20th century, the prevailing politics denied him the chance to compete with his peers and had him thrown off training courts.</p> <p>A recent biography by <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/arthur-ashe-9781439189054.html\" title=\"\">Raymond Arsenault</a> illuminates Ashe\u2019s own journey towards activism. His childhood coach and mentor, Dr Robert Walter Johnson, taught his protege to show restraint in all things and give no one an excuse to exclude him. Ashe gave his opponents the benefit of the doubt on all line calls and never protested an injustice. As a student athlete in California he quietly benched himself when a whites-only club refused to issue him with a tournament invitation.</p> <p>The year before the Mexico Olympics, in his first autobiography, <em>Advantage Ashe</em>, the 23-year-old claimed he was \u201cnot the crusader type\u201d. When it came to advancing the civil rights cause, he said: \u201cI do it my way \u2013 behaving.\u201d But as he lived, and as he learned, and as he encountered more of the world \u2013 in particular, apartheid South Africa \u2013 he found his own voice of protest, dignified and intelligent. He did not expect his fellow competitors to make the kind of personal stands he was prepared to \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t care\u201d \u2013 but he reserved his contempt for the tennis leadership who were \u201cterrified of taking a stand on political affairs, or on controversial questions of social justice\u201d.</p> <p>Another book, <em>A People\u2019s History of Tennis, (</em>Pluto Press, out in May), makes the case that, for all its conservative, establishment wrapping, there exists within tennis a narrative of radical acts. For instance, the sport was a quiet harbour for feminism, as the first that encouraged women\u2019s participation alongside men\u2019s. <em>A People\u2019s History \u2026</em> also points out that \u201cwhen Ashe was being cheered for winning the [Wimbledon] men\u2019s singles in 1975, Britain\u2019s number one player, Buster Mottram, was expressing political support for the openly racist National Front\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/tokyo-olympics-dance-by-japans-indigenous-people-dropped-from-opening-ceremony\">Tokyo Olympics: dance by Japan\u2019s indigenous people dropped from opening ceremony</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the final few months of his battle with Aids, Ashe was arrested protesting against the treatment of Haitian refugees under the presidency of George HW Bush \u2013 and setting an example he hoped others would follow. Protesting, he said, was liberating and cathartic.</p> <p>Ashe\u2019s friend Harry Edwards \u2013 a sociologist who founded the Olympic Project for Human Rights that was behind Smith\u2019s and Carlos\u2019s gloved salute \u2013 said last year that another wave of sporting dissent could be on its way. \u201cAt a certain point,\u201d he told the <em>LA Times</em>, \u201cthe cost becomes irrelevant because the cause is so critical. Injustice pushes the envelope to the point where that protest reaction becomes inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>The IOC has said it encourages athletes to share their political views this summer via traditional and social media; and there is some logic to its blanket ban. We wouldn\u2019t want to see a gold medallist giving a far-right salute, for instance. (The Olympics witnessed plenty of them in 1936, another banner year for its code of moral superiority.)</p> <p>The irony is that the element of transgression tends to make a protest statement stronger. Last September Smith and Carlos were finally inducted into the US Olympic Hall of Fame but their names were already etched in sporting legend. In cases such as theirs and Ashe it is the individuals whose courage and conviction we remember \u2013 not that of the organisations that tried to silence them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a memoir published a few months after Arthur Ashe\u2019s death the tennis champion reflected on one of the most famous demonstrations in sporting history. Tommie Smith and John Carlos made their Black Power salute at the Mexico Olympics in 1968, the year that Ashe won the first US Open. \u201cAlthough I did not always agree with everything these men had said and done,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI respected the way they had stood tall against the sky and had insisted on being heard on matters other than boxing or track and field.\u201d Since January, the entertainment industry\u2019s awards season has delivered a barrage of politically inspired protest from A-listers, be they Dave\u2019s takedown of Boris Johnson, Oscar presenters trolling their own event or Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s personal crusade against big dairy. At the same time the International Olympic Committee has issued guidelines banning all forms of protest at the Tokyo Games this summer, be they written signs or gestures such as kneeling during the US anthem. This is not a new rule. The Olympics have been playing their holier-than-thou, more-neutral-than-Switzerland shtick ever since Baron Pierre de Coubertin decided that training athletes for the modern pentathlon was the best way to stop the Prussians invading France. The IOC\u2019s breathtaking hypocrisy has been well-noted \u2013 the president backing this ban, Thomas Bach, is the same one who claimed that North and South Korea\u2019s joint 2032 bid was a contribution to world peace \u2013 but it\u2019s the sanctimony of its self-styled \u201cmission\u201d that really rankles. This is an organisation that wants to make very clear it is far too noble-minded to allow of the unfortunate \u201cdivisions\u201d in the real world. Smith\u2019s and Carlos\u2019s 68 protest came only a fortnight after hundreds of students were killed by the Mexican government in the very city that was hosting the Games. \u201cIf our Games were to be stopped every time the politicians violate the law of humanity,\u201d said Avery Brundage, the IOC president at the time, \u201cthere will never be any international contests.\u201d That magnanimity of spirit has not died: you can see it in the IOC\u2019s decision to stage its 2014 winter edition in a country that knows all about banning dissidents, as well as throwing them in jail \u2013 and far worse. But let\u2019s return to Ashe, a man who didn\u2019t have the luxury of pretending that sport existed in a fantasy world, where all-comers met on an equal footing of mutual respect and unity of purpose. He was born into a situation where simply picking up a racket, or walking on to a court, was political. As a young black man in the American south in the mid-20th century, the prevailing politics denied him the chance to compete with his peers and had him thrown off training courts. A recent biography by Raymond Arsenault illuminates Ashe\u2019s own journey towards activism. His childhood coach and mentor, Dr Robert Walter Johnson, taught his protege to show restraint in all things and give no one an excuse to exclude him. Ashe gave his opponents the benefit of the doubt on all line calls and never protested an injustice. As a student athlete in California he quietly benched himself when a whites-only club refused to issue him with a tournament invitation. The year before the Mexico Olympics, in his first autobiography, Advantage Ashe, the 23-year-old claimed he was \u201cnot the crusader type\u201d. When it came to advancing the civil rights cause, he said: \u201cI do it my way \u2013 behaving.\u201d But as he lived, and as he learned, and as he encountered more of the world \u2013 in particular, apartheid South Africa \u2013 he found his own voice of protest, dignified and intelligent. He did not expect his fellow competitors to make the kind of personal stands he was prepared to \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t care\u201d \u2013 but he reserved his contempt for the tennis leadership who were \u201cterrified of taking a stand on political affairs, or on controversial questions of social justice\u201d. Another book, A People\u2019s History of Tennis, (Pluto Press, out in May), makes the case that, for all its conservative, establishment wrapping, there exists within tennis a narrative of radical acts. For instance, the sport was a quiet harbour for feminism, as the first that encouraged women\u2019s participation alongside men\u2019s. A People\u2019s History \u2026 also points out that \u201cwhen Ashe was being cheered for winning the [Wimbledon] men\u2019s singles in 1975, Britain\u2019s number one player, Buster Mottram, was expressing political support for the openly racist National Front\u201d. In the final few months of his battle with Aids, Ashe was arrested protesting against the treatment of Haitian refugees under the presidency of George HW Bush \u2013 and setting an example he hoped others would follow. Protesting, he said, was liberating and cathartic. Ashe\u2019s friend Harry Edwards \u2013 a sociologist who founded the Olympic Project for Human Rights that was behind Smith\u2019s and Carlos\u2019s gloved salute \u2013 said last year that another wave of sporting dissent could be on its way. \u201cAt a certain point,\u201d he told the LA Times, \u201cthe cost becomes irrelevant because the cause is so critical. Injustice pushes the envelope to the point where that protest reaction becomes inevitable.\u201d The IOC has said it encourages athletes to share their political views this summer via traditional and social media; and there is some logic to its blanket ban. We wouldn\u2019t want to see a gold medallist giving a far-right salute, for instance. (The Olympics witnessed plenty of them in 1936, another banner year for its code of moral superiority.) The irony is that the element of transgression tends to make a protest statement stronger. Last September Smith and Carlos were finally inducted into the US Olympic Hall of Fame but their names were already etched in sporting legend. In cases such as theirs and Ashe it is the individuals whose courage and conviction we remember \u2013 not that of the organisations that tried to silence them.",

      "body": "<p>It is many unhappy returns to the Labour party, which has just celebrated its 120th birthday. In all that time, it has only managed to produce three leaders capable of winning a parliamentary majority. Two of those leaders are deceased. The other is Tony Blair, who is sometimes wished dead by unpleasant people on the left of the party he once led.</p> <p>Before him, the party lost four consecutive elections. Under him, the party won three in a row, two by landslides. Since him, the party has reverted to its losing ways, going down to another four defeats on the trot. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL BLAIR BLAIR BLAIR FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL. Were we talking about any field of endeavour other than Labour politics, were we talking about football management or medical research or space exploration or novel writing or filmmaking, Mr Blair would be hailed as a genius, the more so for being the sole winner amid so many losers. Yet he is disdained or denounced by much of the party to which he delivered so much electoral success. Even in the wake of a spectacularly crushing defeat, they would do anything but look to their only living winner for any inspiration and guidance about how Labour might one day return to power.</p> <p>In the most recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/17/labour-leadership-contest-last-three-contenders-face-off-in-tv-debate-live\" title=\"\">TV hustings </a>between the remaining contestants for the Labour leadership, the trio were asked to name the Labour leader of the past 50 years whom they most admired. I am guessing that the producers set the time limit to exclude Clement Attlee in the hope that this would stop the contenders from selecting the easy Labour crowd-pleaser. The Corbynite continuity candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey, picked Attlee regardless, not knowing or conveniently forgetting that the postwar Labour prime minister had a reciprocated hatred of the sectarian left, equipped Britain with nuclear weapons, fought wars and would loathe the politics of Jeremy Corbyn. Lisa Nandy swerved the choice of best leader by replying: \u201cI\u2019m hoping we\u2019re about to elect her\u201d, which was cheeky or vainglorious, according to taste. Sir Keir Starmer made the rather unfashionable pick of Harold Wilson \u201cbecause he got the party to unite behind him\u201d. The former DPP needs to brush up on his Labour history. There are things to be said in favour of Wilson, but his governments were not characterised by blissful harmony.</p> <p>None of the contenders selected Tony Blair, the only person to have won an election for Labour since 1974. And he ruefully remarks that he will not be publicly revealing which of the leadership contestants he is going to vote for lest it \u201cdamage\u201d their chances. When pollsters put a similar best leader question to Labour members, Mr Corbyn, the two-time election loser who smashed the party\u2019s parliamentary representation down to its lowest level since 1935, was the <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/01/21/five-more-things-we-discovered-about-labour-member\" title=\"\">activists\u2019 number one</a>. Tony Blair had the worst favourability rating, coming in below Jim Callaghan, who presided over the Winter of Discontent that ushered in 18 years of uninterrupted Tory government, below Michael Foot, who led Labour into the catastrophic \u201csuicide note\u201d election of 1983, and even below Ramsay MacDonald.</p> <p>Some of this lack of respect for Mr Blair can be attributed to specific acts and events. The Iraq war, though it lies 16 years in the past, still casts its shadow. His well-recorded fondness for collecting money after leaving Number 10 didn\u2019t enhance his post-prime ministerial reputation. He and his allies might have done more to defend their record when Ed Miliband foolishly thought he would prosper by attacking New Labour, a process of trashing the record of the last Labour government, which was then amplified by the Corbynites.</p> <p>Yet that does not fully explain the vehemence of the hostility towards Labour\u2019s only breathing ex-leader who secured power. It speaks to something deeper. Many on the British left have an eccentrically self-destructive relationship with the concept of success. All the leadership contenders would flinch at the suggestion that there is anything to learn from the party\u2019s sole election winner in going on for half a century. Yet we have Ms Long-Bailey saying that she would \u201clove\u201d to have loser Corbyn sharing his wisdom in her shadow cabinet and someone is putting it about that Mr Starmer might resurrect loser Miliband to a front-rank role, possibly even as shadow chancellor. Throughout its history, Labour has had this perverse compulsion to revere its failures and recriminate against its winners.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Thatcher's record was far from spotless. Yet Tories prefer to champion her achievements and forget the mistakes</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Note that this inversion is very particular to Labour. The Tories behave quite differently. Margaret Thatcher was her party\u2019s three-times winning leader of the 20th century. Her record was far from spotless. Yet Tories prefer to champion her achievements and forget the mistakes. Many Labour people do the exact opposite. They obsess over the flaws and compromises of their periods in power and obliterate all the positives. This happened to Attlee and Wilson, too.</p> <p>The most extreme exhibitions of this pathology are to be found on the hard left. Zarah Sultana, the Corbynite MP for Coventry South who introduced Ms Long-Bailey at her campaign launch, used her first speech in the Commons to denounce \u201c40 years of Thatcherism\u201d, in a breath dismissing the 13 years of Labour government between 1997 and 2010 as no different to the Tory governments that had preceded and succeeded it. The introduction of the minimum wage, the Human Rights Act, the use of tax and benefit changes to redistribute from the rich to the less affluent, the elimination of pensioner poverty, advances in equality on many fronts, massive investment in public services and the many other progressive achievements of the New Labour era, most implemented in the teeth of fierce Tory opposition, all this was, in Ms Sultana\u2019s considered opinion, indistinguishable from Thatcherism.</p> <p>A slightly more nuanced version of this attitude has been pervasive in the leadership contest. The contenders are habitually much readier to say what they didn\u2019t like about the New Labour years than they are to find things to celebrate about the party\u2019s longest stretch in power.</p> <p>Mr Blair is self-aware enough to know that \u201cmy advice\u201d is not <a href=\"https://institute.global/tony-blair/120-years-labour-party\" title=\"\">\u201cparticularly welcome to today\u2019s party</a>\u201d. Given the levels of abuse he typically receives when he dares to venture an opinion, he could be forgiven for keeping his counsel. Yet since the election he has made a couple of bracing interventions in the self-appointed role of the teller of blunt truths to his party. One reason he does so is because there is no one else prepared to do it. In a speech last week, he didn\u2019t hold back: \u201cOur latest defeat was entirely predictable and predicted. We went into an election with a leader with a minus-40 net approval rating, on political terrain chosen by our opponents, with a manifesto promising the earth but from a planet other than Earth, and a campaign which substituted a narcissistic belief in our righteousness for professionalism. So, here we are, back where we were before. And before that. And before that.\u201d This pungently accurate analysis has been utterly lacking from a leadership contest in which the candidates either don\u2019t grasp the scale of Labour\u2019s failure or do get it but don\u2019t think the membership can handle that much truth.</p> <p>He went on to warn the party that it isn\u2019t going to become competitive for power again if it merely performs a cosmetic makeover that dilutes the most repulsive aspects of Corbynism. \u201cIf Labour becomes more moderate and less extreme, of course it will do better. But not much.\u201d This we can probably take as a coded critique of Mr Starmer. The frontrunner has the quiet backing of many of the party\u2019s centrists and I guess he will receive the former prime minister\u2019s vote on a best-available or least-worst choice basis. But there is no great conviction among them that Mr Starmer really grasps what it will take to shift the party on to a trajectory that might return it to government.</p> <p>Is anyone listening to Mr Blair\u2019s advice that Labour requires \u201chead-to-toe renewal\u201d? Outside the party, he still has an audience. He is correct to contend that much of the public are \u201cwilling us to succeed\u201d at the challenge of becoming an opposition capable of being a \u201cstrong alternative\u201d to the Tories. Within his party, I am sure he knows those willing to listen to him are in the minority.</p> <p>It is a significant and illuminating aspect of Labour\u2019s tragedy that its only triple election winner has become the embodiment of the chasm between the party and the voters. When the public are asked to rate recent Labour leaders, they <a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DIAGNOSIS-OF-DEFEAT-LORD-ASHCROFT-POLLS-1.pdf\" title=\"\">don\u2019t put Jeremy Corbyn anywhere near the top o</a>f their hit parade. Funny that. The voters, not sharing the perverse left\u2019s preference for failure over success, place Tony Blair first.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is many unhappy returns to the Labour party, which has just celebrated its 120th birthday. In all that time, it has only managed to produce three leaders capable of winning a parliamentary majority. Two of those leaders are deceased. The other is Tony Blair, who is sometimes wished dead by unpleasant people on the left of the party he once led. Before him, the party lost four consecutive elections. Under him, the party won three in a row, two by landslides. Since him, the party has reverted to its losing ways, going down to another four defeats on the trot. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL BLAIR BLAIR BLAIR FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL. Were we talking about any field of endeavour other than Labour politics, were we talking about football management or medical research or space exploration or novel writing or filmmaking, Mr Blair would be hailed as a genius, the more so for being the sole winner amid so many losers. Yet he is disdained or denounced by much of the party to which he delivered so much electoral success. Even in the wake of a spectacularly crushing defeat, they would do anything but look to their only living winner for any inspiration and guidance about how Labour might one day return to power. In the most recent TV hustings between the remaining contestants for the Labour leadership, the trio were asked to name the Labour leader of the past 50 years whom they most admired. I am guessing that the producers set the time limit to exclude Clement Attlee in the hope that this would stop the contenders from selecting the easy Labour crowd-pleaser. The Corbynite continuity candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey, picked Attlee regardless, not knowing or conveniently forgetting that the postwar Labour prime minister had a reciprocated hatred of the sectarian left, equipped Britain with nuclear weapons, fought wars and would loathe the politics of Jeremy Corbyn. Lisa Nandy swerved the choice of best leader by replying: \u201cI\u2019m hoping we\u2019re about to elect her\u201d, which was cheeky or vainglorious, according to taste. Sir Keir Starmer made the rather unfashionable pick of Harold Wilson \u201cbecause he got the party to unite behind him\u201d. The former DPP needs to brush up on his Labour history. There are things to be said in favour of Wilson, but his governments were not characterised by blissful harmony. None of the contenders selected Tony Blair, the only person to have won an election for Labour since 1974. And he ruefully remarks that he will not be publicly revealing which of the leadership contestants he is going to vote for lest it \u201cdamage\u201d their chances. When pollsters put a similar best leader question to Labour members, Mr Corbyn, the two-time election loser who smashed the party\u2019s parliamentary representation down to its lowest level since 1935, was the activists\u2019 number one. Tony Blair had the worst favourability rating, coming in below Jim Callaghan, who presided over the Winter of Discontent that ushered in 18 years of uninterrupted Tory government, below Michael Foot, who led Labour into the catastrophic \u201csuicide note\u201d election of 1983, and even below Ramsay MacDonald. Some of this lack of respect for Mr Blair can be attributed to specific acts and events. The Iraq war, though it lies 16 years in the past, still casts its shadow. His well-recorded fondness for collecting money after leaving Number 10 didn\u2019t enhance his post-prime ministerial reputation. He and his allies might have done more to defend their record when Ed Miliband foolishly thought he would prosper by attacking New Labour, a process of trashing the record of the last Labour government, which was then amplified by the Corbynites. Yet that does not fully explain the vehemence of the hostility towards Labour\u2019s only breathing ex-leader who secured power. It speaks to something deeper. Many on the British left have an eccentrically self-destructive relationship with the concept of success. All the leadership contenders would flinch at the suggestion that there is anything to learn from the party\u2019s sole election winner in going on for half a century. Yet we have Ms Long-Bailey saying that she would \u201clove\u201d to have loser Corbyn sharing his wisdom in her shadow cabinet and someone is putting it about that Mr Starmer might resurrect loser Miliband to a front-rank role, possibly even as shadow chancellor. Throughout its history, Labour has had this perverse compulsion to revere its failures and recriminate against its winners. Note that this inversion is very particular to Labour. The Tories behave quite differently. Margaret Thatcher was her party\u2019s three-times winning leader of the 20th century. Her record was far from spotless. Yet Tories prefer to champion her achievements and forget the mistakes. Many Labour people do the exact opposite. They obsess over the flaws and compromises of their periods in power and obliterate all the positives. This happened to Attlee and Wilson, too. The most extreme exhibitions of this pathology are to be found on the hard left. Zarah Sultana, the Corbynite MP for Coventry South who introduced Ms Long-Bailey at her campaign launch, used her first speech in the Commons to denounce \u201c40 years of Thatcherism\u201d, in a breath dismissing the 13 years of Labour government between 1997 and 2010 as no different to the Tory governments that had preceded and succeeded it. The introduction of the minimum wage, the Human Rights Act, the use of tax and benefit changes to redistribute from the rich to the less affluent, the elimination of pensioner poverty, advances in equality on many fronts, massive investment in public services and the many other progressive achievements of the New Labour era, most implemented in the teeth of fierce Tory opposition, all this was, in Ms Sultana\u2019s considered opinion, indistinguishable from Thatcherism. A slightly more nuanced version of this attitude has been pervasive in the leadership contest. The contenders are habitually much readier to say what they didn\u2019t like about the New Labour years than they are to find things to celebrate about the party\u2019s longest stretch in power. Mr Blair is self-aware enough to know that \u201cmy advice\u201d is not \u201cparticularly welcome to today\u2019s party\u201d. Given the levels of abuse he typically receives when he dares to venture an opinion, he could be forgiven for keeping his counsel. Yet since the election he has made a couple of bracing interventions in the self-appointed role of the teller of blunt truths to his party. One reason he does so is because there is no one else prepared to do it. In a speech last week, he didn\u2019t hold back: \u201cOur latest defeat was entirely predictable and predicted. We went into an election with a leader with a minus-40 net approval rating, on political terrain chosen by our opponents, with a manifesto promising the earth but from a planet other than Earth, and a campaign which substituted a narcissistic belief in our righteousness for professionalism. So, here we are, back where we were before. And before that. And before that.\u201d This pungently accurate analysis has been utterly lacking from a leadership contest in which the candidates either don\u2019t grasp the scale of Labour\u2019s failure or do get it but don\u2019t think the membership can handle that much truth. He went on to warn the party that it isn\u2019t going to become competitive for power again if it merely performs a cosmetic makeover that dilutes the most repulsive aspects of Corbynism. \u201cIf Labour becomes more moderate and less extreme, of course it will do better. But not much.\u201d This we can probably take as a coded critique of Mr Starmer. The frontrunner has the quiet backing of many of the party\u2019s centrists and I guess he will receive the former prime minister\u2019s vote on a best-available or least-worst choice basis. But there is no great conviction among them that Mr Starmer really grasps what it will take to shift the party on to a trajectory that might return it to government. Is anyone listening to Mr Blair\u2019s advice that Labour requires \u201chead-to-toe renewal\u201d? Outside the party, he still has an audience. He is correct to contend that much of the public are \u201cwilling us to succeed\u201d at the challenge of becoming an opposition capable of being a \u201cstrong alternative\u201d to the Tories. Within his party, I am sure he knows those willing to listen to him are in the minority. It is a significant and illuminating aspect of Labour\u2019s tragedy that its only triple election winner has become the embodiment of the chasm between the party and the voters. When the public are asked to rate recent Labour leaders, they don\u2019t put Jeremy Corbyn anywhere near the top of their hit parade. Funny that. The voters, not sharing the perverse left\u2019s preference for failure over success, place Tony Blair first. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

      "body": "<p>We\u2019re going on a school trip!\u201d sung my five-year-old. \u201cTo the Apple Store!\u201d OK. Quite often, as a parent, I find myself struggling with the right thing to do or say, like when she asks, for example: \u201cRoxie told me the virus has arrived \u2013 is that true?\u201d Well yes, but\u2026 \u201cSo when do we die?\u201d This felt similarly swampy. Friends with older children tread fearfully through the traffic of technology and I am already aware of the lure for a kid of a hot small screen. So the idea that the company responsible for these screens would also be in charge of the febrile minds of a class of Year Ones for an entire winter morning sort of\u2026 threw me.</p> <p>In France, school trips to Apple Stores have been banned by the Ministry of Education, after claims they were exploiting children for commercial gain. They contravene, said education minister Paul Vannier, the \u201cprinciple of public service neutrality\u201d. I mean, yeah. That appears to be exactly what they\u2019re doing, but\u2026 my daughter really wanted to go on the bus with her little friends? I signed the form, and fretted gently on WhatsApp, then on Wednesday off she went and had a lovely time in her oversized high-vis vest.</p> <p>Then half term appeared dressed in black and I was still thinking about the uncomfortable rub between play and education and commerce, so I did what any tired, confused parent would do and booked an afternoon at <a href=\"https://kidzania.co.uk/\" title=\"\">KidZania</a>. This is an \u201ceducational theme park\u201d perched at the top of a shopping centre in west London; it is branded accordingly. Instead of rollercoasters, there is a mini Shell service station, and instead of waltzers there is an Al Jazeera TV studio. Children are invited to queue up to work, then paid in toy cash for their time. You enter through the British Airways check-in, emerging on to a miniature high street, with painted clouds where the sky should be. I had a flashback to a weekend in Las Vegas, stumbling jet-lagged through interconnected hotels, never knowing if night had come \u2013 similarly, in KidZania there are a hundred clocks, but each one tells a different time. We acclimatise ourselves to the forced dusk.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Young people are trained, not to find a job that fits their lives, but to create an identity around their work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adults aren\u2019t allowed into the offices or shops, so when my daughter left, first for work experience at the <em>Metro</em> newspaper, then later at a nursery, hospital and clothes shop, I had plenty of time to sit under the gaffer-taped palm trees and consider work itself. Busy-ness has become the most braggable pastime, with lack of sleep, supermarket wraps eaten at desks and tart conversations in hurried corridors displayed and elevated as signs of superiority.</p> <p>And that\u2019s for those lucky enough to be over 35, the last takers of the last secure jobs \u2013 we rolled in as the garage door came down. I\u2019m largely anti-ambition, leaning more towards a model of comfort \u2013 the minimum work for the maximum freedom \u2013 but of course, I write this from a spinning office chair of extreme privilege. For those in their 20s (and those soon to be, now parading around the cobbled streets of KidZania) work has become the thing with feathers, a creature that sings a wordless tune all day and all night.</p> <p>Young people are trained, not to find a job that fits their lives, but to create an identity around their work, work which they harvest themselves on their phones and perform in spaces they pay to use, entrepreneurs since GCSE maths. They are brands before they\u2019re barmitzvahed. \u201cOh sweetie,\u201d I think, as my daughter proudly presents me with the newspaper she\u2019s made and a sweaty fistful of KidZo cash. \u201cEven with the best nepotism in the world, it\u2019s likely this will be the most you\u2019ll get paid to work at a paper.\u201d Eight KidZos for approximately 30 words: not bad, in this economy.</p> <p>She marches on to the next assignment like a capitalist cadet and I follow behind in smiling distress. I\u2019m reminded of the importance of media studies, a subject rarely said without a snort. But if media studies was weaved into modern education, then instead of parents fearing the invasion of technology and advertising, children would be adept at navigating both with just the right level of cynicism. They would be taught to identify when they were being sold something and what they were themselves selling when it appeared they were getting something for free. It would be an armour.</p> <p>There is a lot going on at KidZania, and I don\u2019t just mean the tooting fire truck or the nightless day \u2013 there is the silent branding, the crushing contemporary undertow of money and the knowledge we will soon disembark on to the white marble balconies of a shopping mall. And there is the knowledge, too, that the children <em>love</em> it, the independence, the exchange of work for cash and the exchange of cash for a crappy little keyring, and the loss of that keyring somewhere between the lifts and the carpark. The rush, for the kids, was not un-rollercoaster-like. For the adults, the rush was brief and mainly comedown. When we finally stepped outside, it was definitely night.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going on a school trip!\u201d sung my five-year-old. \u201cTo the Apple Store!\u201d OK. Quite often, as a parent, I find myself struggling with the right thing to do or say, like when she asks, for example: \u201cRoxie told me the virus has arrived \u2013 is that true?\u201d Well yes, but\u2026 \u201cSo when do we die?\u201d This felt similarly swampy. Friends with older children tread fearfully through the traffic of technology and I am already aware of the lure for a kid of a hot small screen. So the idea that the company responsible for these screens would also be in charge of the febrile minds of a class of Year Ones for an entire winter morning sort of\u2026 threw me. In France, school trips to Apple Stores have been banned by the Ministry of Education, after claims they were exploiting children for commercial gain. They contravene, said education minister Paul Vannier, the \u201cprinciple of public service neutrality\u201d. I mean, yeah. That appears to be exactly what they\u2019re doing, but\u2026 my daughter really wanted to go on the bus with her little friends? I signed the form, and fretted gently on WhatsApp, then on Wednesday off she went and had a lovely time in her oversized high-vis vest. Then half term appeared dressed in black and I was still thinking about the uncomfortable rub between play and education and commerce, so I did what any tired, confused parent would do and booked an afternoon at KidZania. This is an \u201ceducational theme park\u201d perched at the top of a shopping centre in west London; it is branded accordingly. Instead of rollercoasters, there is a mini Shell service station, and instead of waltzers there is an Al Jazeera TV studio. Children are invited to queue up to work, then paid in toy cash for their time. You enter through the British Airways check-in, emerging on to a miniature high street, with painted clouds where the sky should be. I had a flashback to a weekend in Las Vegas, stumbling jet-lagged through interconnected hotels, never knowing if night had come \u2013 similarly, in KidZania there are a hundred clocks, but each one tells a different time. We acclimatise ourselves to the forced dusk. Adults aren\u2019t allowed into the offices or shops, so when my daughter left, first for work experience at the Metro newspaper, then later at a nursery, hospital and clothes shop, I had plenty of time to sit under the gaffer-taped palm trees and consider work itself. Busy-ness has become the most braggable pastime, with lack of sleep, supermarket wraps eaten at desks and tart conversations in hurried corridors displayed and elevated as signs of superiority. And that\u2019s for those lucky enough to be over 35, the last takers of the last secure jobs \u2013 we rolled in as the garage door came down. I\u2019m largely anti-ambition, leaning more towards a model of comfort \u2013 the minimum work for the maximum freedom \u2013 but of course, I write this from a spinning office chair of extreme privilege. For those in their 20s (and those soon to be, now parading around the cobbled streets of KidZania) work has become the thing with feathers, a creature that sings a wordless tune all day and all night. Young people are trained, not to find a job that fits their lives, but to create an identity around their work, work which they harvest themselves on their phones and perform in spaces they pay to use, entrepreneurs since GCSE maths. They are brands before they\u2019re barmitzvahed. \u201cOh sweetie,\u201d I think, as my daughter proudly presents me with the newspaper she\u2019s made and a sweaty fistful of KidZo cash. \u201cEven with the best nepotism in the world, it\u2019s likely this will be the most you\u2019ll get paid to work at a paper.\u201d Eight KidZos for approximately 30 words: not bad, in this economy. She marches on to the next assignment like a capitalist cadet and I follow behind in smiling distress. I\u2019m reminded of the importance of media studies, a subject rarely said without a snort. But if media studies was weaved into modern education, then instead of parents fearing the invasion of technology and advertising, children would be adept at navigating both with just the right level of cynicism. They would be taught to identify when they were being sold something and what they were themselves selling when it appeared they were getting something for free. It would be an armour. There is a lot going on at KidZania, and I don\u2019t just mean the tooting fire truck or the nightless day \u2013 there is the silent branding, the crushing contemporary undertow of money and the knowledge we will soon disembark on to the white marble balconies of a shopping mall. And there is the knowledge, too, that the children love it, the independence, the exchange of work for cash and the exchange of cash for a crappy little keyring, and the loss of that keyring somewhere between the lifts and the carpark. The rush, for the kids, was not un-rollercoaster-like. For the adults, the rush was brief and mainly comedown. When we finally stepped outside, it was definitely night.

      "body": "<p>Sharon Horgan doesn\u2019t especially enjoy watching herself on screen any more. She feels an awkwardness that, she thinks, comes from years of sitting in edit suites scrutinising take after take of television programmes she has created, co-written and starred in. Shows such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/garethmcleanblog/2009/may/15/television\" title=\"\">Pulling</a></em>, a black comedy about three female flatmates that first aired in 2006 and was her breakthrough. And <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/12/catastrophe-finale-review-the-end-of-a-gloriously-monstrous-era\" title=\"\">Catastrophe</a></em>, the Channel 4 series (rejected by the BBC) that she made with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rob-delaney\" title=\"\">Rob Delaney </a>about a one-night stand with long-term effects that ran for four seasons and has been broadcast in 133 countries and now means she has to have clocks in her London offices showing the time in New York and Los Angeles. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sharon-horgan\" title=\"\">Horgan</a>, who is 49 and has eviscerating self-awareness, also accepts that \u201cvanity\u201d might be a factor.</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t <em>love</em> seeing myself as an older person on screen,\u201d she says, with a snorty half-laugh that seems to punctuate her most radically honest statements. \u201cThere\u2019s always a weird transitional period where you go from being able to play a girl who doesn\u2019t know where her life is going to playing the mother of an 18-year-old. The adjustment for that just takes a little bit of time.\u201d</p> <p>Horgan is sitting in the boardroom of Merman, the production company she founded in 2014 with producer Clelia Mountford. It\u2019s a large, grown-up room with a view of the London Eye and a clutch of awards dotted around, but casually. She\u2019s wearing a black vest, wide-legged jeans and Adidas shelltoes, and looks unfussily chic. \u201cI generally like to pick up my clothes from the floor from the night before and wear them for as long as possible,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s fine when I\u2019m at home, but if I come in here three days in a row and I\u2019m wearing the same thing, people point it out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"97e5ae5ade407cc7e41d017d718885b6db0e5862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97e5ae5ade407cc7e41d017d718885b6db0e5862/185_0_5561_3338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene with Sharon Horgan and Kristin Scott Thomas in Military Wives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hitting the high notes: with Kristin Scott Thomas in Military Wives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aimee Spinks/Lionsgate UK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re here to talk about <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/06/military-wives-review-kristin-scott-thomas-helps-feelgood-britcom-sing\" title=\"\">Military Wives</a></em>, which she stars in with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kristin-scott-thomas\" title=\"\">Kristin Scott Thomas</a>, and in which she plays, as it happens, the mother of an 18-year-old. It\u2019s a dramatisation, by the<em> Full Monty</em> director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/aug/04/features.weekend\" title=\"\">Peter Catt</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/aug/04/features.weekend\" title=\"\">aneo</a>, of the true story of the women from a Royal Marines base in Devon who formed a choir while their partners were away in Afghanistan and wound up the Christmas No 1 in 2011.</p> <p>So, has Horgan seen it yet? \u201cI didn\u2019t watch it at the premiere,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut my PR lady said, \u2018You cannot go into interviews to talk about the film if you haven\u2019t seen it.\u2019 So I got them to send me a screener and I watched it on my laptop, which I\u2019m sure Peter absolutely abhorred.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve spent years doing things that were always called cult comedies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What did she think? \u201cKristin and I had the same experience when we read the initial script: it fucked both of us up,\u201d Horgan says. \u201cWe knew that if they were the right songs, if they were done in the right way, that this female friendship \u2013 the female version of a bromance \u2013 could be a really moving and sweet and funny and life-affirming film. So, yeah, when I watched it, I thought: \u2018It\u2019s all those things I thought it would be.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While <em>Military Wives </em>follows a familiar formula, you would have to have a black heart \u2013 something, admittedly, Horgan has been accused of \u2013 not to have to wipe away a small tear by the end. Horgan is the best thing about it, undercutting any hoariness with a curl of her lip or a withering aside. (She didn\u2019t officially work on the script, but with Scott Thomas she did \u201cinject a bit of us into it\u201d.) <em>Military Wives </em>probably won\u2019t do the full <em>Full Monty </em>in terms of impact, but there\u2019s a calendar-girls, potato-peel-pie-society market for it. \u201cDifferent films, but similar ingredients,\u201d says Horgan. \u201cIt just makes people feel good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c2728a2044e20badbb90adc05a6724d797d8ea3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c2728a2044e20badbb90adc05a6724d797d8ea3/0_1291_3840_4145/926.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Horgan in a black dress and russet  boots\" width=\"926\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I really want to write about what it is to be a woman of a certain age whose life is changing\u2019: Sharon Horgan wears skirt, top and boots all by Victoria Beckham; rings by Branch on the Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Military Wives </em>is a tonal departure for her; \u201cuplifting\u201d and \u201cfeel-good\u201d haven\u2019t exactly been in her wheelhouse. Horgan has summed up her work as being \u201cfunny and grim\u201d, but what makes her comedy rare is how much she makes you care about her characters, even when they are behaving abominably. The relationship between Rob and Sharon in <em>Catastrophe</em> feels real \u2013 screwed up but real. \u201cYou let me put my penis in your mouth, but you won\u2019t let me put my T-shirts in your drawer?\u201d Rob notes when they start living together. The interactions between the parents in her BBC2 comedy <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/07/motherland-review-weary-parents-rejoice-the-savage-school-gate-sitcom-is-back\" title=\"\">Motherland</a></em> are excruciating variations of ones you see at the school gates, especially if you are a bit middle-class. Horgan has an unerring ear and an unsparing eye.</p> <p>\u201cI watched the trailer for <em>Military Wives </em>with my 16-year-old daughter and she laughed all the way through it,\u201d says Horgan. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Fucking cow.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018No, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s just funny seeing you with this beautiful song running throughout and then cutting to you on a keyboard and then cutting to you with your head in your hands. It\u2019s just funny. You have to admit it\u2019s funny.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It <em>is</em> kind of funny, Horgan concedes. <em>Military Wives </em>is a step change to what she\u2019s done before, but she has her reasons for branching out. Merman exists because Horgan was fed up with coming up with ideas, writing them, and then taking them to someone else to make them. The company started slowly, but in the past five years it has become an industry powerhouse. Its productions are ubiquitous on TV channels and streaming services, and it is known especially for developing new female talent. These include shows that Horgan co-writes, but doesn\u2019t appear in, such as <em>Motherland</em>, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/06/divorce-hbo-review-sarah-jessica-parker-comeback\" title=\"\">Divorce </a></em>with Sarah Jessica Parker for HBO, but also Aisling Bea\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/02/this-way-up-why-aisling-beas-show-is-the-perfect-tonic-for-our-times\" title=\"\">This Way Up</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/26/frayed-review-aussie-black-comedy-is-like-a-nightmare-on-ramsay-street\" title=\"\">Frayed</a> </em>by Sarah Kendall and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/15/there-she-goes-bbc4-new-comedy-busts-motherhood-myths\" title=\"\">There She Goes</a></em>, which won a Bafta for Jessica Hynes. Merman has also moved into drama and films: its first feature, <em>Herself</em>, by Irish writer and actor Clare Dunne, premiered last month at the Sundance Film Festival and was bought by Amazon.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent so many years doing things that were always called cult comedies,\u201d explains Horgan. \u201cSo it\u2019s nice to do something that will have a bigger audience. And being cynical and business-minded, it helps your profile when I go into pitches here and in the US. If you\u2019re going in with a writer who is maybe less well known, who you\u2019re wanting people to take a chance on, people give a shit about that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cce5c7891cb97d10c509922dc9795d2ebb20bdff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce5c7891cb97d10c509922dc9795d2ebb20bdff/0_235_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney sitting on a rock, side by side, both staring straight ahead, in a scene from Catastrophe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the rocks: in Catastrophe with Rob Delaney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Horgan sounds conflicted. She notes that <em>Catastrophe</em>, as popular as it was, probably had \u201chalf the numbers\u201d of a comedy like <em>Derry Girls</em>. She\u2019s dabbled in big studio films before, but in supporting roles, notably the 2018 comedy <em>Game Night</em>, with Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, and knows that these parts come with much less control than she\u2019s used to. It appears that Horgan is nailing that hard-to-square feat of allying a rich, diverse creative life with commercial success, but she\u2019s unsure whether to focus her energies on acting or writing or producing or directing, or just to continue, like now, doing all of them.</p> <p>\u201cThe weird thing I fight in myself is going after a mainstream audience and also thinking that I\u2019m not entirely sure I know how to write for a mainstream audience,\u201d she says. \u201cThe sweet spot is to do that and to do it well. And to do it in a way that you\u2019re not compromising. But there\u2019s something very intoxicating about creating a show that has widespread appeal. You do want people to see your work.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>At any point,</strong></em> Horgan might be working on a mind-boggling 30 projects. It\u2019s hard not to trace this demented pace to the fact her career kicked off relatively late, in her mid-30s. She was born in east London, but moved to Ireland when she was four. The family settled in County Meath, north of Dublin, where they had a turkey farm. \u201cI wanted to be a performer, but it didn\u2019t feel possible,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it took so long. I mean, I had a lovely childhood and my parents were super-supportive, but if you\u2019re brought up in a tiny village and your parents are turkey farmers, it doesn\u2019t necessarily equate that you go into show business.\u201d</p> <p>Horgan went to art college in Dublin, hung out with bands, did some backing singing. \u201cAt one gig, this crazy Swiss producer came up to me at the end and was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna make you a star. So, I flew with him to Zurich and he spent the week doing publicity photos, introducing me to people and trying to find out what my talents were.\u201d Horgan laughs, \u201cSo, after that week, I was like, \u2018Oh well, this is what happens to me. People walk up to me and say, I\u2019m going to make you a star.\u2019 That handicapped me for years.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to take risks\u00a0\u2013 ignore the negative side of my brain and continue to push</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, Horgan moved to London and worked at the Jobcentre in Kilburn, north London, for six years in her 20s. She only quit, aged 27, when she was instructed to pick up human excrement from the pavement outside. She moved around squats with Irish friends, before eventually renting a room in co-operative housing with a teacher and a nurse.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I moved to London, I think I really was genuinely coming over not to make my fortune, but to be discovered,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I literally just got a job in the Jobcentre. I don\u2019t know who I thought was going to discover me there.\u201d</p> <p>Horgan ultimately poured the energy of this chaotic, feckless period into <em>Pulling</em>, the sitcom she wrote with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dennis-kelly\" title=\"\">Dennis Kelly</a>. She and Kelly had worked on sketches together in the 90s, won the BBC New Comedy Award in 2001, and began contributing material to <em>Monkey Dust</em>, Harry Thompson and Shaun Pye\u2019s subversive animated series for BBC Three. The late Thompson (instrumental in launching <em>Have I Got News For You</em> and developing the character <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/22/1\" title=\"\">Ali G</a>) had a sitcom title, <em>Pulling</em>, but no characters or plot, and suggested that Horgan and Kelly fill in the gaps.</p> <p><em>Pulling</em> wasn\u2019t exactly autobiographical, but some true stories found their way in: yes, Horgan once ate a takeaway she found in a phonebox. Around the time that <em>Pulling</em> was coming together, she met Jeremy Rainbird, who worked in advertising. Six months later she was pregnant, and not long after that they were married. They have two children, Sadhbh, 16, and Amer, 11. If some of this feels familiar, it might be because parts of it were the starting point for <em>Catastrophe</em>, which follows the characters Sharon and Rob from messy hook-up to messy, just different, life with children.</p> <p>We\u2019re evicted from the \u201cposh room\u201d we\u2019re in, which is needed for a meeting, so we scuttle across the landing to a writers\u2019 space. It\u2019s much smaller, there\u2019s no view of the London Eye, and there\u2019s a whiteboard on the wall and a sofa at one end. \u201cThere will be a bit of time where you run out of ideas and you just need to lie down,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98b1d68bca92aac807d893832ea8fa8226d3700c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98b1d68bca92aac807d893832ea8fa8226d3700c/438_700_3402_4842/703.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Horgan in a silver suit, perched on the back of a chair, looking down and away\" width=\"703\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When I write about what\u2019s going on in my life, I connect to it way more\u2019: Sharon Horgan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While writing <em>Pulling</em> and <em>Catastrophe</em>, she shared a single keyboard with Kelly and Delaney respectively; she and Kelly would share the typing, but with Delaney it was always Horgan. It\u2019s a draining way to work, but it has advantages: you receive immediate, brutal-if-necessary feedback, and there\u2019s the drive of trying to make the other person laugh.</p> <p>There are occasional rumours that <em>Catastrophe</em> will return in some form, perhaps as a one-off special, but that\u2019s not on Horgan\u2019s schedule. \u201cI\u2019d love to write with Rob again,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just fitted so well together. But we also spent five years writing something that was quite intense, and it\u2019s good to step away and do other things. So I\u2019m my own partner right now, and yeah, that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>Horgan considers<em><strong> </strong>Pulling<strong> </strong></em>and<em><strong> </strong>Catastrophe </em>as chapter one and two of a trilogy. What form the third installment will take is something she\u2019s wrestling with now. Both professionally and personally, 2019 was a tough year: <em>Catastrophe</em> ended, and so did her marriage to Rainbird. \u201cAfter <em>Catastrophe</em>, I knew I\u2019d have a period where I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m doing,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt was grand because I had so many other things, like <em>Motherland</em> and <em>This Way Up </em>and lots of Merman stuff, but I was also like, \u2018Shit, I don\u2019t have that thing. I don\u2019t have <em>that</em> idea.\u2019 And I was trying to not give myself a hard time about it, trying to just wait and see what came.\u201d</p> <p>On <em>Catastrophe</em>, Horgan and Delaney abided by one directive: make nothing up. It was designed to stop them slipping into clich\u00e9, and however gruelling it is to stick to, Horgan thinks it\u2019s worth it. \u201cI feel when I write about what\u2019s either going on in my life or has gone on in my life, I just connect to it way more, have more stuff to say,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also provides me with a little extra therapy, getting stuff down on the page.</p> <p>\u201cI really want to write about what it is to be a woman of a certain age whose life is changing,\u201d she goes on. \u201cAnd I want there to be a teenagers\u2019 element to it. But I don\u2019t want to write about my girls, because I think that\u2019s just not fair. Also, I don\u2019t want to start watching them the way I watch everyone else. You know, when you\u2019re in the moment, but also part of your brain is thinking, \u2018I must scribble that down later.\u2019 So I\u2019m trying to find a way round that, probably by giving the kids a different gender.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"601e9b1792d795783ae2d4c260d98bda6941fd94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/601e9b1792d795783ae2d4c260d98bda6941fd94/0_124_1841_1105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Pulling with the three women flatmates in a pub, laughing and drinking\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breakthrough show: 2009\u2019s Pulling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Silver River/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Horgan sounds like she is happiest when writing. \u201cIt\u2019s like the ultimate escape,\u201d she says. \u201cYou open your laptop and immediately you\u2019re somewhere else.\u201d But 2020 is already filling up. he\u2019s in the film adaptation of the hit musical <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/29/teen-drag-queen-musical-everybodys-talking-about-jamie-to-become-movie\" title=\"\">Every</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/29/teen-drag-queen-musical-everybodys-talking-about-jamie-to-become-movie\" title=\"\">body\u2019s Talking About Jamie</a></em>, and is about to start shooting a romantic comedy, the <em>Last Drop</em>, opposite Vince Vaughn. She\u2019s also in advanced discussions to direct her first feature, <em>The New World</em>, an adaptation of Chris Adrian and Eli Horowitz\u2019s sci-fi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/10/the-new-world-chris-adrian-eli-horowitz-review\" title=\"\">novel</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI just want some adventures,\u201d she explains. \u201cTo do stuff that\u2019s challenging. You can get into a bit of a rut in terms of what you write about and what your safe space is. So yeah, just take a few risks. It\u2019s weird, with the directing thing, I\u2019ve done it a few times, but every time I do it, I think I can\u2019t do it. So it\u2019s like ignoring the negative side of my brain and continuing to push it.</p> <p>\u201cBut then I also want to take my foot off the pedal a bit, so all that doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Horgan continues. Then there\u2019s that half-laugh again: \u201cI want to get my daughter\u2019s GCSEs out the way and come out the other side and have a happy, non-stressful home.\u201d</p> <p><em>Military Wives is released on 6 March</em></p> <p><em>Styling by Frederika Lovelle Pank; hair by Hamilton Stansfield at <a href=\"http://slreps.com\">slreps.com</a> using Philip B Haircare; makeup by Justine Jenkins using Delilah Cosmetics</em></p>",

Shows such as Pulling, a black comedy about three female flatmates that first aired in 2006 and was her breakthrough. And Catastrophe, the Channel 4 series (rejected by the BBC) that she made with Rob Delaney about a one-night stand with long-term effects that ran for four seasons and has been broadcast in 133 countries and now means she has to have clocks in her London offices showing the time in New York and Los Angeles. But Horgan, who is 49 and has eviscerating self-awareness, also accepts that \u201cvanity\u201d might be a factor. \u201cI just don\u2019t love seeing myself as an older person on screen,\u201d she says, with a snorty half-laugh that seems to punctuate her most radically honest statements. \u201cThere\u2019s always a weird transitional period where you go from being able to play a girl who doesn\u2019t know where her life is going to playing the mother of an 18-year-old. The adjustment for that just takes a little bit of time.\u201d Horgan is sitting in the boardroom of Merman, the production company she founded in 2014 with producer Clelia Mountford. It\u2019s a large, grown-up room with a view of the London Eye and a clutch of awards dotted around, but casually. She\u2019s wearing a black vest, wide-legged jeans and Adidas shelltoes, and looks unfussily chic. \u201cI generally like to pick up my clothes from the floor from the night before and wear them for as long as possible,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s fine when I\u2019m at home, but if I come in here three days in a row and I\u2019m wearing the same thing, people point it out.\u201d We\u2019re here to talk about Military Wives, which she stars in with Kristin Scott Thomas, and in which she plays, as it happens, the mother of an 18-year-old. It\u2019s a dramatisation, by the Full Monty director Peter Cattaneo, of the true story of the women from a Royal Marines base in Devon who formed a choir while their partners were away in Afghanistan and wound up the Christmas No 1 in 2011. So, has Horgan seen it yet? \u201cI didn\u2019t watch it at the premiere,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut my PR lady said, \u2018You cannot go into interviews to talk about the film if you haven\u2019t seen it.\u2019 So I got them to send me a screener and I watched it on my laptop, which I\u2019m sure Peter absolutely abhorred.\u201d What did she think? \u201cKristin and I had the same experience when we read the initial script: it fucked both of us up,\u201d Horgan says. \u201cWe knew that if they were the right songs, if they were done in the right way, that this female friendship \u2013 the female version of a bromance \u2013 could be a really moving and sweet and funny and life-affirming film. So, yeah, when I watched it, I thought: \u2018It\u2019s all those things I thought it would be.\u2019\u201d While Military Wives follows a familiar formula, you would have to have a black heart \u2013 something, admittedly, Horgan has been accused of \u2013 not to have to wipe away a small tear by the end. Horgan is the best thing about it, undercutting any hoariness with a curl of her lip or a withering aside. (She didn\u2019t officially work on the script, but with Scott Thomas she did \u201cinject a bit of us into it\u201d.) Military Wives probably won\u2019t do the full Full Monty in terms of impact, but there\u2019s a calendar-girls, potato-peel-pie-society market for it. \u201cDifferent films, but similar ingredients,\u201d says Horgan. \u201cIt just makes people feel good.\u201d Military Wives is a tonal departure for her; \u201cuplifting\u201d and \u201cfeel-good\u201d haven\u2019t exactly been in her wheelhouse. Horgan has summed up her work as being \u201cfunny and grim\u201d, but what makes her comedy rare is how much she makes you care about her characters, even when they are behaving abominably. The relationship between Rob and Sharon in Catastrophe feels real \u2013 screwed up but real. \u201cYou let me put my penis in your mouth, but you won\u2019t let me put my T-shirts in your drawer?\u201d Rob notes when they start living together. The interactions between the parents in her BBC2 comedy Motherland are excruciating variations of ones you see at the school gates, especially if you are a bit middle-class. Horgan has an unerring ear and an unsparing eye. \u201cI watched the trailer for Military Wives with my 16-year-old daughter and she laughed all the way through it,\u201d says Horgan. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Fucking cow.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018No, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s just funny seeing you with this beautiful song running throughout and then cutting to you on a keyboard and then cutting to you with your head in your hands. It\u2019s just funny. You have to admit it\u2019s funny.\u2019\u201d It is kind of funny, Horgan concedes. Military Wives is a step change to what she\u2019s done before, but she has her reasons for branching out. Merman exists because Horgan was fed up with coming up with ideas, writing them, and then taking them to someone else to make them. The company started slowly, but in the past five years it has become an industry powerhouse. Its productions are ubiquitous on TV channels and streaming services, and it is known especially for developing new female talent. These include shows that Horgan co-writes, but doesn\u2019t appear in, such as Motherland, and Divorce with Sarah Jessica Parker for HBO, but also Aisling Bea\u2019s This Way Up, Frayed by Sarah Kendall and There She Goes, which won a Bafta for Jessica Hynes. Merman has also moved into drama and films: its first feature, Herself, by Irish writer and actor Clare Dunne, premiered last month at the Sundance Film Festival and was bought by Amazon. \u201cI\u2019ve spent so many years doing things that were always called cult comedies,\u201d explains Horgan. \u201cSo it\u2019s nice to do something that will have a bigger audience. And being cynical and business-minded, it helps your profile when I go into pitches here and in the US. If you\u2019re going in with a writer who is maybe less well known, who you\u2019re wanting people to take a chance on, people give a shit about that.\u201d Horgan sounds conflicted. She notes that Catastrophe, as popular as it was, probably had \u201chalf the numbers\u201d of a comedy like Derry Girls. She\u2019s dabbled in big studio films before, but in supporting roles, notably the 2018 comedy Game Night, with Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, and knows that these parts come with much less control than she\u2019s used to. It appears that Horgan is nailing that hard-to-square feat of allying a rich, diverse creative life with commercial success, but she\u2019s unsure whether to focus her energies on acting or writing or producing or directing, or just to continue, like now, doing all of them. \u201cThe weird thing I fight in myself is going after a mainstream audience and also thinking that I\u2019m not entirely sure I know how to write for a mainstream audience,\u201d she says. \u201cThe sweet spot is to do that and to do it well. And to do it in a way that you\u2019re not compromising. But there\u2019s something very intoxicating about creating a show that has widespread appeal. You do want people to see your work.\u201d At any point, Horgan might be working on a mind-boggling 30 projects. It\u2019s hard not to trace this demented pace to the fact her career kicked off relatively late, in her mid-30s. She was born in east London, but moved to Ireland when she was four. The family settled in County Meath, north of Dublin, where they had a turkey farm. \u201cI wanted to be a performer, but it didn\u2019t feel possible,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it took so long. I mean, I had a lovely childhood and my parents were super-supportive, but if you\u2019re brought up in a tiny village and your parents are turkey farmers, it doesn\u2019t necessarily equate that you go into show business.\u201d Horgan went to art college in Dublin, hung out with bands, did some backing singing. \u201cAt one gig, this crazy Swiss producer came up to me at the end and was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna make you a star. So, I flew with him to Zurich and he spent the week doing publicity photos, introducing me to people and trying to find out what my talents were.\u201d Horgan laughs, \u201cSo, after that week, I was like, \u2018Oh well, this is what happens to me. People walk up to me and say, I\u2019m going to make you a star.\u2019 That handicapped me for years.\u201d Instead, Horgan moved to London and worked at the Jobcentre in Kilburn, north London, for six years in her 20s. She only quit, aged 27, when she was instructed to pick up human excrement from the pavement outside. She moved around squats with Irish friends, before eventually renting a room in co-operative housing with a teacher and a nurse. \u201cWhen I moved to London, I think I really was genuinely coming over not to make my fortune, but to be discovered,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I literally just got a job in the Jobcentre. I don\u2019t know who I thought was going to discover me there.\u201d Horgan ultimately poured the energy of this chaotic, feckless period into Pulling, the sitcom she wrote with Dennis Kelly. She and Kelly had worked on sketches together in the 90s, won the BBC New Comedy Award in 2001, and began contributing material to Monkey Dust, Harry Thompson and Shaun Pye\u2019s subversive animated series for BBC Three. The late Thompson (instrumental in launching Have I Got News For You and developing the character Ali G) had a sitcom title, Pulling, but no characters or plot, and suggested that Horgan and Kelly fill in the gaps. Pulling wasn\u2019t exactly autobiographical, but some true stories found their way in: yes, Horgan once ate a takeaway she found in a phonebox. Around the time that Pulling was coming together, she met Jeremy Rainbird, who worked in advertising. Six months later she was pregnant, and not long after that they were married. They have two children, Sadhbh, 16, and Amer, 11. If some of this feels familiar, it might be because parts of it were the starting point for Catastrophe, which follows the characters Sharon and Rob from messy hook-up to messy, just different, life with children. We\u2019re evicted from the \u201cposh room\u201d we\u2019re in, which is needed for a meeting, so we scuttle across the landing to a writers\u2019 space. It\u2019s much smaller, there\u2019s no view of the London Eye, and there\u2019s a whiteboard on the wall and a sofa at one end. \u201cThere will be a bit of time where you run out of ideas and you just need to lie down,\u201d she says. While writing Pulling and Catastrophe, she shared a single keyboard with Kelly and Delaney respectively; she and Kelly would share the typing, but with Delaney it was always Horgan. It\u2019s a draining way to work, but it has advantages: you receive immediate, brutal-if-necessary feedback, and there\u2019s the drive of trying to make the other person laugh. There are occasional rumours that Catastrophe will return in some form, perhaps as a one-off special, but that\u2019s not on Horgan\u2019s schedule. \u201cI\u2019d love to write with Rob again,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just fitted so well together. But we also spent five years writing something that was quite intense, and it\u2019s good to step away and do other things. So I\u2019m my own partner right now, and yeah, that\u2019s OK.\u201d Horgan considers Pulling and Catastrophe as chapter one and two of a trilogy. What form the third installment will take is something she\u2019s wrestling with now. Both professionally and personally, 2019 was a tough year: Catastrophe ended, and so did her marriage to Rainbird. \u201cAfter Catastrophe, I knew I\u2019d have a period where I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m doing,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt was grand because I had so many other things, like Motherland and This Way Up and lots of Merman stuff, but I was also like, \u2018Shit, I don\u2019t have that thing. I don\u2019t have that idea.\u2019 And I was trying to not give myself a hard time about it, trying to just wait and see what came.\u201d On Catastrophe, Horgan and Delaney abided by one directive: make nothing up. It was designed to stop them slipping into clich\u00e9, and however gruelling it is to stick to, Horgan thinks it\u2019s worth it. \u201cI feel when I write about what\u2019s either going on in my life or has gone on in my life, I just connect to it way more, have more stuff to say,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also provides me with a little extra therapy, getting stuff down on the page. \u201cI really want to write about what it is to be a woman of a certain age whose life is changing,\u201d she goes on. \u201cAnd I want there to be a teenagers\u2019 element to it. But I don\u2019t want to write about my girls, because I think that\u2019s just not fair. Also, I don\u2019t want to start watching them the way I watch everyone else. You know, when you\u2019re in the moment, but also part of your brain is thinking, \u2018I must scribble that down later.\u2019 So I\u2019m trying to find a way round that, probably by giving the kids a different gender.\u201d Horgan sounds like she is happiest when writing. \u201cIt\u2019s like the ultimate escape,\u201d she says. \u201cYou open your laptop and immediately you\u2019re somewhere else.\u201d But 2020 is already filling up. he\u2019s in the film adaptation of the hit musical Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie, and is about to start shooting a romantic comedy, the Last Drop, opposite Vince Vaughn. She\u2019s also in advanced discussions to direct her first feature, The New World, an adaptation of Chris Adrian and Eli Horowitz\u2019s sci-fi novel. \u201cI just want some adventures,\u201d she explains. \u201cTo do stuff that\u2019s challenging. You can get into a bit of a rut in terms of what you write about and what your safe space is. So yeah, just take a few risks. It\u2019s weird, with the directing thing, I\u2019ve done it a few times, but every time I do it, I think I can\u2019t do it. So it\u2019s like ignoring the negative side of my brain and continuing to push it. \u201cBut then I also want to take my foot off the pedal a bit, so all that doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Horgan continues. Then there\u2019s that half-laugh again: \u201cI want to get my daughter\u2019s GCSEs out the way and come out the other side and have a happy, non-stressful home.\u201d Military Wives is released on 6 March Styling by Frederika Lovelle Pank; hair by Hamilton Stansfield at slreps.com using Philip B Haircare; makeup by Justine Jenkins using Delilah Cosmetics",

Or at least its leaders have decided to commit suicide\u2026 by the end of the lifespans of most people currently alive, Europe will not be Europe and the peoples of Europe will have lost the only place in the world we had to call home.\u201d Apart from in the elegance of expression, that thought, and that sentence, would not have been out of place in the manifesto of the Hanau gunman Tobias Rathjen. In fact, it appears on the opening page of Douglas Murray\u2019s 2017 bestseller The Strange Death of Europe. The American writer Christopher Caldwell argued in his acclaimed Reflections on the Revolution in Europe that immigration to Europe has been akin to \u201ccolonisation\u201d. Another prominent American writer, Sam Harris, has claimed that \u201cthe people who speak most sensibly about the threat that Islam poses to Europe are actually fascists\u201d. Ideas that once were confined to the fringes are now routinely and unashamedly aired by mainstream commentators. We are constantly told that unless we normalise \u201cwhite racial self-identity\u201d and address the \u201ccultural anxiety\u201d that immigration creates by more tightly controlling immigration, then the far right will prosper. In reality, the opposite is true: the more we give credence to ideas that once belonged only to the fringe, the more that fringe will become legitimate. Migrants are now held responsible not just for the ills of society but even for their own murder. Rachida Dati, the centre-right candidate to be mayor of Paris, suggested that the blame for the Hanau killings lay with Merkel\u2019s too-liberal immigration policies. If the right\u2019s obsession with immigration has helped give new legitimacy to arguments of the far right, so has the left\u2019s blindness to the consequences of the politics of identity. Many on the left now embrace the idea that one\u2019s interests and values are defined primarily by one\u2019s ethnic or cultural or gender identity. The politics of identity is, however, at root the politics of the reactionary right. The original politics of identity was that of racial difference, the insistence that one\u2019s racial identity determines one\u2019s moral and social place in the world. Now, identitarians of the far right are seizing upon the opportunity provided by the left\u2019s adoption of identity politics to legitimise their once-toxic brand. Racism became rebranded as white identity politics. It\u2019s an expression of the pernicious befuddlement of today\u2019s politics that rightwing critics of identity politics are among the most vehement defenders of the idea of a European homeland to be protected against immigrant invaders, while leftwing critics of white identity are staunch defenders of every other form of identity politics. No one is responsible for an act of terror but the terrorists themselves. What the rest of us should not do, however, is provide legitimacy to their arguments or nurture their toxic beliefs. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "South Korea\u2019s president Moon Jae-in has placed the country on \u201cred alert\u201d after it reported its fifth death and more than 123 new coronavirus cases, taking the total number of infected to 556. As the nation struggled on Sunday to contain the deadly Covid-19 outbreak in the city of Daegu, the president described the coming days as \u201ca very important moment\u201d, the news agency Yonhap said. The government would bolster its fight against the virus by raising the alert level one notch to the highest of \u201cred\u201d, he told an emergency meeting of agencies in Seoul on Sunday. The president said the government and the local authorities should not hesitate to take \u201cunprecedented powerful\u201d measures to contain the viral disease without being limited by \u201cregulations\u201d. Of the 123 new cases, 75 are related to the Shincheonji church in the country\u2019s fourth-largest city of Daegu and a neighbouring hospital. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it has placed more than 9,000 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and thousands of worshippers have been screened for the virus. It came as a Japanese government minister apologised after a woman allowed to leave the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess on Wednesday tested positive for the infection on Saturday, raising more questions about the country\u2019s management of the outbreak. In South Korea, the government has tried to contain the outbreak by declaring Daegu and its adjacent county Cheongdo \u201cspecial care zones\u201d. But that did not stop the number of infections more than doubling in a single day on Saturday. So far South Korea had released 18 fully recovered novel coronavirus patients from hospitals, the KCDC said. The number of people being checked for the virus and under quarantine came to 6,039 on Sunday morning, the KCDC said. The country has tested 22,633 suspected cases; 16,038 tested negative. South Korea confirmed its first new coronavirus case from a Chinese woman from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, on 20 January. The country\u2019s 31st patient, a probable \u201csuper spreader\u201d, had attended the Shincheonji church\u2019s worship services. In a rare public message on Saturday night, the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, reassured people that the virus could be contained if the public cooperated with the government\u2019s instructions. On Sunday Daegu\u2019s mayor, Kwon Young-jin, advised locals to stay indoors and said: \u201cThe crisis level of Daegu and the North Gyeongsang province is grave.\u201d He asked all Shincheonji members with symptoms to come forward and be tested. \u201cHiding is not the answer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you hide, it could hurt your health, your family\u2019s health, and will not help in the early cessation of the situation.\u201d China\u2019s death toll from the virus rose to 2,442 on Sunday after the government said 97 more people had died, all but one in the epicentre of Hubei province. The national health commission also confirmed another 648 new cases. Most of the deaths and new infections were in Hubei\u2019s provincial capital, Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December. China\u2019s total infections reached 76,936, the commission said in its daily update. The coronavirus has spread to more than 25 countries and is causing mounting alarm due to outbreaks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. China\u2019s numbers of daily new infections are well down from the outbreak\u2019s early height. But China has sowed confusion about the data by repeatedly changing its counting methods. On Saturday the US state department raised its travel advisory to South Korea. US citizens were asked to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d when travelling to South Korea, where \u201csustained community spread\u201d has been reported. \u201cSustained community spread means that people in South Korea have been infected with the virus, but how or where they became infected is not known, and the spread is ongoing,\u201d the department said on its website. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued an \u201calert level 2\u201d travel notice, saying \u201colder adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel\u201d. Britain has also advised its nationals \u201cagainst all but essential travel to Daegu and Cheongdo\u201d, and Israel refused to allow non-Israelis to disembark from a plane that departed from South Korea on Saturday.",

      "bodyText": "The Chinese authorities are trying to usher the country back to work, a month after announcing the unprecedented quarantine of millions of people. But they face a difficult balancing act between containing the virus and supporting a faltering economy. Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, have been the focus of disease prevention efforts. over the last four weeks. As the death toll climbed to more than 2,000 worldwide, and infections to over 75,000, the vast majority of cases were still inside that quarantined zone. But the disease had spread far across the country before Hubei was sealed off, and some of the worst-affected places are the manufacturing and economic centres that power China\u2019s economy. Southern Guangdong province, just across from Hong Kong and home to international giants such as Apple supplier Foxconn, is the second-worst affected province after Hubei, with 1,339 cases of the coronavirus confirmed and five deaths. Eastern Zhejiang, near Shanghai, is the fourth most seriously hit, with 1,205 cases by , although only one death. It is also the base for companies including the hugely influential Alibaba, China\u2019s answer to Amazon and eBay. Those total numbers of infections are far above the 639 cases registered across all of China on 23 January, when Hubei was put on sudden lockdown. The situations are not directly comparable; coronavirus had been spreading almost unchecked in Wuhan for weeks before the quarantine, and overwhelmed hospitals appear to have sent patients home, only to spread the disease. Authorities in other areas started tracking cases much earlier and have better resources to isolate and treat those who fall sick, something reflected in a much lower death rate. The speed of the disease\u2019s spread is perhaps not surprising given Wuhan\u2019s position as a regional economic hub, with links to other key centres, and the fact that the coronavirus has proved contagious in the early days of infection when patients have few symptoms, making it hard to identify carriers as clusters spread. Yet China cannot afford for its factories to sit idle, or its restaurants and shops to stay empty indefinitely. Authorities were already worried about faltering growth after last year saw the slowest rate of expansion in almost three decades; GDP growth had not slid so low since 1990, when China was isolated in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre. An influential Chinese economist has already warned that the coronavirus crisis could slice a full percentage point off growth this year. So authorities are trying to balance two unfathomable risks \u2013 of either fuelling the coronavirus by pushing too much for normal routines, or paving the way for the collapse of their local economy by keeping everything on lockdown. Many small and medium companies in particular are already hovering on the brink, and a wave of bankruptcies is expected. Retail and hospitality companies expected bumper sales over the lunar new year, and even factories that closed for the holiday expected to reopen in early February. \u201cThis year our company isn\u2019t talking about the question of profit,\u201d Guangdong Meijie Group chief executive Luo Xiaohua told China Business News. \u201cOur main objective is just to survive.\u201d In Shenzhen, the border city that has come to rival Hong Kong, businesses have been told they can resume work immediately if they have virus control measures that include disinfecting, giving employees at least two masks a day, making temperature checks, and having their plans approved by local officials.

Getting employees back to their desk is a further problem for companies that are ready to re-open. Xiao, a migrant from Sichuan, said only about 20 of the factory\u2019s 50-strong workforce had returned from other parts of China. Overall, less than a third of the country\u2019s nearly 300 million migrant workers, who power everything from factories to courier networks and restaurants, have returned to the cities from holidays in their home towns and villages, the country\u2019s transport minister said last week. Some are worried about the virus, others unsure if their jobs will be open, but many are struggling to get transport with strict new restrictions meant to slow the spread of the disease. Train tickets have been limited so that passengers aren\u2019t carried in close proximity, and many bus services have been cancelled. To try to counteract this, the Zhejiang province has provided 100 million yuan (\u00a311m) of subsidies to help people return, new tax policies to support business, and has even hired cars, buses and trains to transport employees back to work. One worker from the tech hub of Hangzhou, in a county where there have been 169 confirmed cases, said transport was less of a problem in an economy focused on higher skilled labour \u2013 \u201cwe don\u2019t have as many migrant workers in Hangzhou\u201d \u2013 but government efforts to get people back were encouraging. In the decision to get back to work, officials may also be weighing the accelerating spread of the coronavirus elsewhere as cases appear across the Middle East, and numbers grow closer to home in neighbouring Asian nations. Many infectious disease experts now believe it is likely to become a pandemic, and even the World Health Organisation director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the window for containment is \u201cnarrowing\u2019. If quarantine and business shutdowns can\u2019t stop Covid-19 in the way it halted Sars in 2003, its heavy cost on local economies \u2013 and populations \u2013 look far less defensible, both in China and beyond. \u201cYes, we want to stop (the) spread, but must start caring a lot more (about the) plight of over 50 million people in Hubei,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University and Professor of Public Health at the Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Twitter. \u201cOngoing threat to physical and mental health in Hubei is unconscionable \u2013 (people are) trapped together and fearful.

I wondered about this as I walked around Bologna, a city where tourists are so relatively thin on the ground I was able to commune with an altarpiece by Giotto undisturbed by any other human being for a full 10 minutes and where the crowd surging out of its historic theatre, the Arena del Sole, looked so wonderfully old-school glamorous, that they might have come from a movie by Vittorio De Sica. But I was not in Bologna for sightseeing, nor even for tortellini in brodo. I was there to judge a new category \u2013 comics \u2013 for the BolognaRagazzi, the awards made every year ahead of the city\u2019s children\u2019s book fair, the biggest such gathering in the world. Does this sound like fun? Well, it was and it wasn\u2019t. In the overlit conference centre where the international jury met, the 180 books in the running were laid out on tables as far as the eye could see and for a moment I felt faint-hearted. But then I remembered how endlessly surprising the world of comics is, how beautiful and how intelligent. These graphic novels came from every country and covered every subject. At their best, we did not need to know the language in which they were written, so deftly did they tell their stories, and we gave the young adult award to The Short Elegy by Animo Chen, a Taiwanese artist. A special mention, though, must go to Kahe heli vahel by Joonas Sildre, an Estonian comic for teenagers that is \u2013 imagine it \u2013 a biography of that country\u2019s great national hero, the minimalist composer Arvo P\u00e4rt. Magic mushrooms I am not, alas, a descendant of Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, the Victorian botanist whose work on psychoactive fungi may have inspired the scene in Alice in Wonderland where, at the suggestion of a hookah-smoking caterpillar, our heroine eats a mushroom that makes her grow bigger and smaller. But as the daughter of a mycologist and something of a mycophile (translation: a complete weirdo) myself, I could hardly wait to see Mushrooms: The Art, Design and Future of Fungi, a new (free) exhibition at Somerset House in London. Sometimes weird and sometimes wonderful, it didn\u2019t disappoint. Here is Beatrix Potter\u2019s exquisite watercolour of a shabby parasol mushroom, collected by her in 1893; here, too, is Carsten H\u00f6ller\u2019s Mushroom Suitcase (2008), in which red-and-white-spotted fly agaric mushrooms sprout from some flashy hand luggage by Rimowa (no, me neither). Best of all, though, is the gift shop, which caters to every possible mycophilic need, from coffee to cushions to cocktails. I bought a pack of playing cards, each one decorated with a different species. The two jokers are the deadly poisonous death cap (Amanita phalloides), and the trumpet of the dead (Craterellus cornucopioides), which is edible and, at its best, comes with delicious top notes of black truffle. Ditch the fridge At the hairdresser, I read in an interiors magazine of an alarming new last-days-of-Rome trend: the wellness kitchen. The gist of it is that \u201cbulky cupboards\u201d and \u201cnoisy appliances\u201d are on their way out. A fridge? Don\u2019t be daft.

      "body": "<p>Sitting behind the wheel of Aston Martin\u2019s new luxury SUV in Wales last week, Prince Charles was marking his own anniversary with the carmaker.</p> <p>It is 50 years since the Queen gave him an Aston Martin Volante for his 21st birthday \u2013 a half-century in which fortunes for both the prince and the company have peaked and troughed .</p> <p>Many executives at the car manufacturer would be forgiven for wanting to be transported back five decades, considering the fraught times that it has gone through of late.</p> <p>Last month, a \u00a3500m rescue deal led by the Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll saved the company from collapse, as its huge debt pile threatened to cause it to go bust for the eighth time in its 107-year history.</p> <p>Under the deal, the car brand will from 2021 be used by the Formula One racing team that Stroll owns. Shareholders who have watched the latest round of difficulties for the company will be hoping that the new deal will finally resolve the problems that have been dogging the maker of James Bond\u2019s cars.</p> <p>This Thursday will see the announcement of full-year results for 2019, but investors have already been warned to expect bad news. Last month, the company issued its second profit warning in 12 months after flagging a \u201cvery disappointing\u201d year of falling sales and higher costs. It predicted adjusted profits of between \u00a3130m and \u00a3140m for 2019 \u2013 almost half the \u00a3247m it made the previous year and well below analyst forecasts of \u00a3196m. Aston Martin blames a decline in cars sold through dealers alongside higher marketing costs and a fall in its average selling price.</p> <p>The price of the company\u2019s shares has plummeted since they launched on the stock market in October 2018 at \u00a319. They now sit at just above \u00a34, prompting some analysts to describe Aston as the one of the biggest flops on the market in recent memory, at a time when there is a lot of competition for luxury cars. The value of the company at launch was \u00a34bn, but it had plummeted to \u00a31bn by the beginning of this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8caf5da0d6c498b6923d0cea1de7ef31d20e30b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8caf5da0d6c498b6923d0cea1de7ef31d20e30b8/0_396_4319_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Charles with his own Aston Martin Volante \u2013 a present from the Queen for his 21st birthday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Charles with his own Aston Martin Volante \u2013 a present from the Queen for his 21st birthday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Munns/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aston\u2019s chief executive, Andy Palmer, has said the company was forced to discount more heavily than intended to sell cars at the end of last year, and paid higher-volume bonuses to dealers in a big sales push in December.</p> <p>The company is now pinning its hopes on the new DBX sports utility vehicle, for which it has received 1,800 orders since its launch in late November. It hopes the \u00a3158,000 4x4 will widen its appeal to wealthy women \u2013 nearly all its current customers are men. Deliveries from Aston\u2019s new factory in St Athan will commence between April and June.</p> <p>The rescue deal led by Stroll includes an investment of \u00a3182m in return for 16.7% of the struggling carmaker, and includes an immediate \u00a355.5m capital injection.</p> <p>Stroll\u2019s consortium includes business partners from many of the fashion investments in which he made his fortune, together with Anthony Bamford, chairman of the digger maker JCB, who is also known for his political donations to Boris Johnson and the Leave campaign. Forbes estimates Stroll\u2019s net worth at $2.6bn.</p> <p>On Friday, Charles joined a reception to celebrate the factory, placing a winged badge on the front of a DBX that will be located in the reception area of the company\u2019s newest facility. Both staff and investors \u2013 and probably 007 too \u2013 will be earnestly hoping that this is ninth time lucky.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sitting behind the wheel of Aston Martin\u2019s new luxury SUV in Wales last week, Prince Charles was marking his own anniversary with the carmaker. It is 50 years since the Queen gave him an Aston Martin Volante for his 21st birthday \u2013 a half-century in which fortunes for both the prince and the company have peaked and troughed . Many executives at the car manufacturer would be forgiven for wanting to be transported back five decades, considering the fraught times that it has gone through of late. Last month, a \u00a3500m rescue deal led by the Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll saved the company from collapse, as its huge debt pile threatened to cause it to go bust for the eighth time in its 107-year history. Under the deal, the car brand will from 2021 be used by the Formula One racing team that Stroll owns. Shareholders who have watched the latest round of difficulties for the company will be hoping that the new deal will finally resolve the problems that have been dogging the maker of James Bond\u2019s cars. This Thursday will see the announcement of full-year results for 2019, but investors have already been warned to expect bad news. Last month, the company issued its second profit warning in 12 months after flagging a \u201cvery disappointing\u201d year of falling sales and higher costs. It predicted adjusted profits of between \u00a3130m and \u00a3140m for 2019 \u2013 almost half the \u00a3247m it made the previous year and well below analyst forecasts of \u00a3196m. Aston Martin blames a decline in cars sold through dealers alongside higher marketing costs and a fall in its average selling price. The price of the company\u2019s shares has plummeted since they launched on the stock market in October 2018 at \u00a319. They now sit at just above \u00a34, prompting some analysts to describe Aston as the one of the biggest flops on the market in recent memory, at a time when there is a lot of competition for luxury cars. The value of the company at launch was \u00a34bn, but it had plummeted to \u00a31bn by the beginning of this year. Aston\u2019s chief executive, Andy Palmer, has said the company was forced to discount more heavily than intended to sell cars at the end of last year, and paid higher-volume bonuses to dealers in a big sales push in December. The company is now pinning its hopes on the new DBX sports utility vehicle, for which it has received 1,800 orders since its launch in late November. It hopes the \u00a3158,000 4x4 will widen its appeal to wealthy women \u2013 nearly all its current customers are men. Deliveries from Aston\u2019s new factory in St Athan will commence between April and June. The rescue deal led by Stroll includes an investment of \u00a3182m in return for 16.7% of the struggling carmaker, and includes an immediate \u00a355.5m capital injection. Stroll\u2019s consortium includes business partners from many of the fashion investments in which he made his fortune, together with Anthony Bamford, chairman of the digger maker JCB, who is also known for his political donations to Boris Johnson and the Leave campaign. Forbes estimates Stroll\u2019s net worth at $2.6bn. On Friday, Charles joined a reception to celebrate the factory, placing a winged badge on the front of a DBX that will be located in the reception area of the company\u2019s newest facility. Both staff and investors \u2013 and probably 007 too \u2013 will be earnestly hoping that this is ninth time lucky.",

      "bodyText": "Arriving in Sauternes feels like landing in the middle of a French feel-good movie. You roll into the village, some 40km south of Bordeaux, along winding roads that run past meticulously tended vines bordered by low stone walls \u2013 and wish you were in an open-top car. You park by a 12th-century church with a towering spire. A statue of Joan of Arc out front is receiving a fresh lick of silver paint from what could be a pair of elderly stagehands, but turn out to be locals. Over the road, people are eating lunch on the sunny terrace of a restaurant called Auberge Les Vignes, and a passerby is eyeing bottles of wine in the window of Cave des Laur\u00e9ats next door. Next to the church, a four-square building with honey-coloured render and pale blue shutters informs you in vintage red lettering that you are in \u201cSauternes, capital of the best white wines in the world\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Brendon Kaluza-Graham was born in Spokane, Washington, to parents who were just 14 and 16. His life was split between his separated mother and father and both sets of grandparents, before he was killed, aged 25, by a single bullet to the back of the head. It was fired from a 9mm handgun, as he drove a car he had stolen away from the driveway where he had found it.</p> <p>The man responsible was one Gail Gerlach. As this book puts it, Gerlach was \u201can avowed Reaganite conservative\u201d, supporter of the right to bear arms and anti-abortion activist, who could not \u201cfathom how a society that prohibits prostitution, class A drugs, even driving without a seatbelt, can tolerate the killing of an unborn child\u201d. At his trial in 2014, Gerlach\u2019s acquittal on charges of manslaughter sparked no end of controversy, but this alleged legal and moral travesty formed only part of the story. What Gerlach surely symbolised most of all was the fissures that run through the politics of the American right, and the fact that its \u201cpro-life\u201d convictions barely conceal outrageous contradictions.</p> <p>In <em>Vexed</em>, <a href=\"https://www.jamesmumford.co.uk/\" title=\"\">James Mumford</a> explores such inconsistencies \u2013 which are also present on the left \u2013 and how awkwardly they sit in political cultures that have fostered ideological camps who cling to bundles of values and prejudices he calls \u201cpackage deals\u201d. An academic and writer at least partly rooted on the right (for a while, he worked for the Centre for Social Justice, the thinktank set up by Iain Duncan Smith), Mumford has a set of socially conservative sympathies to match, but other opinions \u2013 on, say, gun control and economic intervention to help people on low pay \u2013 that align him with the left. After recent years spent in both the US and Britain, he wonders why there seems to be comparatively little political space for people like him, and why he has to choose between two unsatisfactory options: on one hand, ultra-liberalism wedded to state interventionism; and on the other, social conservatism fused with free-market economics. The merest research, he points out, soon highlights how some of the most seemingly fundamental aspects of political identities are actually the product of historical accident: being \u201cpro-life\u201d, for example, was not something indelibly associated with one side of American politics until Richard Nixon\u2019s pursuit of Catholic voters decisively embedded it on the Republican right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d50914650e123db47120fa21383a19764a2c0726\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d50914650e123db47120fa21383a19764a2c0726/0_0_4000_2566/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pro-life demonstration in Washington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pro-life demonstration in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is one of those books apparently put together behind a desk, aimed squarely at the kind of airport lounge market synonymous with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/01/malcolm-gladwell-interview-talking-to-strangers-apolitical\" title=\"\">Malcolm Gladwell</a>, who receives an admiring mention. There is no really solid through-line running through its six chapters, and Mumford is prone to gaucheness: \u201cI want to be a public intellectual lauded for his acute insights,\u201d he says at one point, which is at least honest. He often seems to be railing against something that is not as ubiquitous as he thinks \u2013 not quite to the extent of raging at straw men, though he occasionally comes close. Not everybody on the left is as in thrall to ultra-liberalism as he repeatedly makes out: if they were, progressive parties across the west would be advocating legalised everything and open borders, which they conspicuously are not. Equally, in the UK, there is plenty of evidence that the political right is embracing some of the kind of leftish thinking he suggests is absent from its collective mind, as proved by Boris Johnson\u2019s embrace of state aid for ailing industries and an increased minimum wage.</p> <p>But when <em>Vexed</em> hits its stride, Mumford demonstrates an admirable ability to zero in on things too often missing from political conversations. His chapter on assisted dying moves from a description of how old people are increasingly seen as a burden, through the fetishisation of property, which means that selling a home to pay for care is often seen as a kind of offence against decency, and on to how those things might affect the self-perception of someone who wished to end their life prematurely, despite their apparent informed consent. After reading and rereading this part of the book, I think I remain convinced of the case for assisted dying, but I would not be able to collapse my thoughts into any kind of pat piece of commentary, let alone a tweet. This, I think, is what Mumford wants to achieve: as much as anything else, this book is a plea for nuance and ambivalence, in a world that often seems to be in danger of mislaying both.</p> <p>In the chapter headed Family Values, he calmly explodes the view that was the accepted wisdom at his old thinktank \u2013 that among the fundamental reasons for poverty is family breakdown, when the causal relationship self-evidently works the other way round. This is developed into something advocates of laissez-faire economics have missed: an argument that the rise of precarious work \u2013 as Mumford sees it, partly the consequence of huge corporate power, and the ability of firms to treat workers as they see fit \u2013 has so undermined people\u2019s ability to be dependable parents that the political right ought to look at its own role in the erosion of the family unit. In turn, he switches his focus back to the left, and focuses on the growing fashionableness of transhumanism: crudely put, the belief that technologies from computing to pharmaceuticals will soon enable us to go beyond the limitations of flesh and blood. If the cutting-edge left now rejects the idea of human \u201cmastery\u201d of the world and accepts the idea that nature should be treated with \u201creverence\u201d, he asks, why does this not apply to its view of our own brains and bodies?</p> <p>In the right company, a question like that would trigger a fierce debate, which the author would presumably delight in. <em>Vexed</em> is that kind of book: less interested in hard-and-fast answers than undermining supposedly concrete certainties. That may suggest that Mumford indulges in ethics as a kind of academic sport, but at the heart of what he writes is something much more serious than that. The key argument of his book is that failures of what Mumford calls \u201cmoral imagination\u201d do not just sully our political discourse. As the real-life parable of Brendon Kaluza-Graham and Gail Gerlach proves, they can also lead to tragedy.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Vexed: Ethics Beyond Political Tribes </em>by James Mumford is published by Bloomsbury Continuum (\u00a316.99).

At his trial in 2014, Gerlach\u2019s acquittal on charges of manslaughter sparked no end of controversy, but this alleged legal and moral travesty formed only part of the story. What Gerlach surely symbolised most of all was the fissures that run through the politics of the American right, and the fact that its \u201cpro-life\u201d convictions barely conceal outrageous contradictions. In Vexed, James Mumford explores such inconsistencies \u2013 which are also present on the left \u2013 and how awkwardly they sit in political cultures that have fostered ideological camps who cling to bundles of values and prejudices he calls \u201cpackage deals\u201d. An academic and writer at least partly rooted on the right (for a while, he worked for the Centre for Social Justice, the thinktank set up by Iain Duncan Smith), Mumford has a set of socially conservative sympathies to match, but other opinions \u2013 on, say, gun control and economic intervention to help people on low pay \u2013 that align him with the left. After recent years spent in both the US and Britain, he wonders why there seems to be comparatively little political space for people like him, and why he has to choose between two unsatisfactory options: on one hand, ultra-liberalism wedded to state interventionism; and on the other, social conservatism fused with free-market economics. The merest research, he points out, soon highlights how some of the most seemingly fundamental aspects of political identities are actually the product of historical accident: being \u201cpro-life\u201d, for example, was not something indelibly associated with one side of American politics until Richard Nixon\u2019s pursuit of Catholic voters decisively embedded it on the Republican right. This is one of those books apparently put together behind a desk, aimed squarely at the kind of airport lounge market synonymous with Malcolm Gladwell, who receives an admiring mention. There is no really solid through-line running through its six chapters, and Mumford is prone to gaucheness: \u201cI want to be a public intellectual lauded for his acute insights,\u201d he says at one point, which is at least honest. He often seems to be railing against something that is not as ubiquitous as he thinks \u2013 not quite to the extent of raging at straw men, though he occasionally comes close. Not everybody on the left is as in thrall to ultra-liberalism as he repeatedly makes out: if they were, progressive parties across the west would be advocating legalised everything and open borders, which they conspicuously are not. Equally, in the UK, there is plenty of evidence that the political right is embracing some of the kind of leftish thinking he suggests is absent from its collective mind, as proved by Boris Johnson\u2019s embrace of state aid for ailing industries and an increased minimum wage. But when Vexed hits its stride, Mumford demonstrates an admirable ability to zero in on things too often missing from political conversations. His chapter on assisted dying moves from a description of how old people are increasingly seen as a burden, through the fetishisation of property, which means that selling a home to pay for care is often seen as a kind of offence against decency, and on to how those things might affect the self-perception of someone who wished to end their life prematurely, despite their apparent informed consent. After reading and rereading this part of the book, I think I remain convinced of the case for assisted dying, but I would not be able to collapse my thoughts into any kind of pat piece of commentary, let alone a tweet. This, I think, is what Mumford wants to achieve: as much as anything else, this book is a plea for nuance and ambivalence, in a world that often seems to be in danger of mislaying both. In the chapter headed Family Values, he calmly explodes the view that was the accepted wisdom at his old thinktank \u2013 that among the fundamental reasons for poverty is family breakdown, when the causal relationship self-evidently works the other way round. This is developed into something advocates of laissez-faire economics have missed: an argument that the rise of precarious work \u2013 as Mumford sees it, partly the consequence of huge corporate power, and the ability of firms to treat workers as they see fit \u2013 has so undermined people\u2019s ability to be dependable parents that the political right ought to look at its own role in the erosion of the family unit. In turn, he switches his focus back to the left, and focuses on the growing fashionableness of transhumanism: crudely put, the belief that technologies from computing to pharmaceuticals will soon enable us to go beyond the limitations of flesh and blood. If the cutting-edge left now rejects the idea of human \u201cmastery\u201d of the world and accepts the idea that nature should be treated with \u201creverence\u201d, he asks, why does this not apply to its view of our own brains and bodies? In the right company, a question like that would trigger a fierce debate, which the author would presumably delight in. Vexed is that kind of book: less interested in hard-and-fast answers than undermining supposedly concrete certainties. That may suggest that Mumford indulges in ethics as a kind of academic sport, but at the heart of what he writes is something much more serious than that. The key argument of his book is that failures of what Mumford calls \u201cmoral imagination\u201d do not just sully our political discourse. As the real-life parable of Brendon Kaluza-Graham and Gail Gerlach proves, they can also lead to tragedy. \u2022 Vexed: Ethics Beyond Political Tribes by James Mumford is published by Bloomsbury Continuum (\u00a316.99).

It didn\u2019t get any better. The next two hours saw Bloomberg\u2019s five co-debaters tear into him again and again.</p> <p>His tenure as mayor was repeatedly brought into question. Bloomberg oversaw <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/bloomberg-misleads-on-stop-and-frisk/\">a huge increase in stop-and-frisk</a> policing, a practice that disproportionately targeted African Americans and Latinos, people who make up a key Democratic constituency. Allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at his Blooomberg financial information and news company were brought up, and Warren, in particular, criticized the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bloomberg-dismisses-past-comments-joke-nda-shows-plaintiff/story?id=69103408\">non-disclosure agreements the company struck</a> with former employees, preventing them from speaking publicly.</p> <p>Bloomberg is said to have prepared for the debate, but struggled to defend himself against aspects of his record that were ripe for attack.</p> <p>\u201cIn some instances [Bloomberg was] sort of halting, and stumbling to deliver a response to attacks that had been telegraphed, previewed on the stump by several of these candidates,\u201d said Mitchell McKinney, professor of political communication at the University of Missouri.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to now see the [debate] image of Michael Bloomberg, his performance and compare that to his ad messages that are just saturating airwaves of a very resolute decision maker, a strong leader and also presidential.\u201d</p> <p>McKinney went on: \u201cThe Michael Bloomberg we saw on Wednesday is very different from that designed and controlled image and message. The question then is will he be able to survive with his ad messages and then somehow stumble through.\u201d</p> <p>Given not every voter will have been watching the debate, which finished at 11pm on the east coast, it raises the question of how much Bloomberg\u2019s limp performance will matter.

In the hours after the debate, his campaign released its own, highly edited version of what happened in the debate, an alternate universe cut where Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90466731/bloomberg-video\">flummoxed his rivals</a> by pointing out none of them had started a business.</p> <p>That video was pushed out on Facebook on Thursday, a platform where Bloomberg has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/21/mike-bloomberg-facebook-ad-campaign\">already spent $45m on advertising</a> \u2013 dwarfing even Trump, who has made Facebook reach a cornerstone of his campaign. The pass-along effect could ultimately mean people are being handed Bloomberg\u2019s bilge rather than seeing him humiliated on stage.</p> <p>The make-or-break date for Bloomberg is Tuesday 3 March, when voters in 14 states go to the polls in a defining primary contest. Fail then, and the prospect of President Bloomberg becomes extremely unlikely.</p> <p>That apparently doesn\u2019t bother him; he has suggested he\u2019s in the race for the long haul. That isn\u2019t good news for former vice-president Joe Biden, former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar and fellow billionaire Tom Steyer, who make up a quintet of major candidates scrapping for the centrist lane of their party.</p> <p>Together, this group\u2019s supporters account for <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\">more than half of Democratic voters</a>, but Bloomberg\u2019s extravagant spending has pulled voters away from each of his rivals, leaving all five weakened and a long way from the lead.</p> <p>The beneficiary of this has been none other than than the socialist Bernie Sanders, with his diehard supporters helping him to a double-digit lead over the centrists.</p> <p>Ultimately, the impact of Bloomberg\u2019s flashy ads and hundreds of millions of dollars could be the election of the most progressive, resolutely anti-wealth candidate of them all.</p>",

Bloomberg didn\u2019t seem to realize that even if you\u2019re not speaking, the camera is on you.\u201d Bloomberg, who made his $64bn fortune through his eponymous financial services company, had glided through his presidential campaign largely unimpeded until Wednesday. While other leading candidates, including the current frontrunner Bernie Sanders, spent the summer and autumn of 2019 engaged in bruising debates and town halls, Bloomberg only entered the race in November, avoiding scrutiny and remaining above the fray. He dodged much of the legwork of campaigning too. Bloomberg shunned Iowa and New Hampshire, two states where a candidate traditionally must woo voters to have a shot at the presidency, instead splashing vast amounts of cash on TV ads and a gigantic social media campaign. Those highly polished commercials have been unavoidable for people across America for the past two months. In them, Bloomberg is shown alongside Barack Obama, still the most popular Democratic politician in the country, or criticizing Trump with a combination of humor and vitriol. Bloomberg has spent a fortune hiring some of the best political operatives in the country, and it shows. In a remarkably short space of time, Bloomberg has rocketed to third or even second place in national polls. He also leads in some key states, such as Florida and Oklahoma. Yet all that money can\u2019t protect Bloomberg from his controversial words and deeds during a long career in business and 12 years as New York\u2019s mayor. The debate, held in Las Vegas, proved that, as Bloomberg was immediately lambasted by Elizabeth Warren, the left-leaning Massachusetts senator. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about who we\u2019re running against \u2013 a billionaire who calls women \u2018fat broads\u2019 and \u2018horse-faced lesbians\u2019,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump. I\u2019m talking about Michael Bloomberg.\u201d For many of the watching 19.3 million people \u2013 a record for a Democratic primary debate \u2013 this was probably their first introduction to Bloomberg, and it wasn\u2019t a good start. It didn\u2019t get any better. The next two hours saw Bloomberg\u2019s five co-debaters tear into him again and again. His tenure as mayor was repeatedly brought into question. Bloomberg oversaw a huge increase in stop-and-frisk policing, a practice that disproportionately targeted African Americans and Latinos, people who make up a key Democratic constituency. Allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at his Blooomberg financial information and news company were brought up, and Warren, in particular, criticized the non-disclosure agreements the company struck with former employees, preventing them from speaking publicly. Bloomberg is said to have prepared for the debate, but struggled to defend himself against aspects of his record that were ripe for attack. \u201cIn some instances [Bloomberg was] sort of halting, and stumbling to deliver a response to attacks that had been telegraphed, previewed on the stump by several of these candidates,\u201d said Mitchell McKinney, professor of political communication at the University of Missouri. \u201cWe are going to now see the [debate] image of Michael Bloomberg, his performance and compare that to his ad messages that are just saturating airwaves of a very resolute decision maker, a strong leader and also presidential.\u201d McKinney went on: \u201cThe Michael Bloomberg we saw on Wednesday is very different from that designed and controlled image and message. The question then is will he be able to survive with his ad messages and then somehow stumble through.\u201d Given not every voter will have been watching the debate, which finished at 11pm on the east coast, it raises the question of how much Bloomberg\u2019s limp performance will matter. McKinney said the \u201cpass-along effect\u2019\u2019 is important, however \u2013 the way that key clips from the debate will be disseminated through news channels and social media. Bloomberg\u2019s slick team is already fighting that, however. In the hours after the debate, his campaign released its own, highly edited version of what happened in the debate, an alternate universe cut where Bloomberg flummoxed his rivals by pointing out none of them had started a business. That video was pushed out on Facebook on Thursday, a platform where Bloomberg has already spent $45m on advertising \u2013 dwarfing even Trump, who has made Facebook reach a cornerstone of his campaign. The pass-along effect could ultimately mean people are being handed Bloomberg\u2019s bilge rather than seeing him humiliated on stage. The make-or-break date for Bloomberg is Tuesday 3 March, when voters in 14 states go to the polls in a defining primary contest. Fail then, and the prospect of President Bloomberg becomes extremely unlikely. That apparently doesn\u2019t bother him; he has suggested he\u2019s in the race for the long haul. That isn\u2019t good news for former vice-president Joe Biden, former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar and fellow billionaire Tom Steyer, who make up a quintet of major candidates scrapping for the centrist lane of their party. Together, this group\u2019s supporters account for more than half of Democratic voters, but Bloomberg\u2019s extravagant spending has pulled voters away from each of his rivals, leaving all five weakened and a long way from the lead. The beneficiary of this has been none other than than the socialist Bernie Sanders, with his diehard supporters helping him to a double-digit lead over the centrists. Ultimately, the impact of Bloomberg\u2019s flashy ads and hundreds of millions of dollars could be the election of the most progressive, resolutely anti-wealth candidate of them all.",

If we could get down to St Ives for a hike and roast at the pub, that\u2019ll do nicely. Flesh and Blood airs on ITV at 9pm tomorrow for four nights running",

      "body": "<p>Neil Watson was eight or nine when his dad took him out to sea for the first time. Soon he was earning his first pocket money by washing fish boxes on the quay at Brixham in south Devon. Three years after he started crewing, he got his skipper\u2019s ticket and eventually he bought his own boat. For 30 years, he regularly spent seven days at sea followed by one night off, only stopping when his boat sank two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cI fished through good times and bad times. Fishing\u2019s like riding a wave \u2013 one minute you\u2019re up the top, and the next you\u2019re down in the trough,\u201d he said. Now Watson works at Brixham\u2019s fish market, one of the largest in England, where \u00a340m of fish was sold last year across the UK and Europe. A fisherman\u2019s life is brutal, he said, but he badly misses the camaraderie.</p> <p>Along the coast, in the picturesque Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey, Andrew Trevarton, a fisherman for 37 years, hasn\u2019t been out to sea for two weeks because of atrocious weather. Nevertheless, Trevarton is feeling cautiously optimistic about the future. \u201cYou have to be an optimist to go fishing in the first place,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In 2016, Trevarton and Watson voted for Brexit, along with the vast majority of UK fishermen. The image of rugged men in sea-slicked oilskins braving weather and waves to put food on the island nation\u2019s plates was a powerful emotional factor in the case for leaving the EU. After decades of battling over Brussels-set quotas, which allow European fleets to take a lion\u2019s share of fish from waters around the UK, the idea of taking back control was irresistible.</p> <p>Although the industry is a tiny part of the UK economy \u2013 worth less than 0.1% of the total in 2018 \u2013 it has become emblematic of a plucky, independent Britain, freed from the shackles of restrictions and regulations set by other people in other places, forging its own way in the world.</p> <p>Much, therefore, is riding on trade talks that are due to begin at the start of March. According to Nigel Farage, fishing will be the \u201cacid test\u201d of Brexit. Boris Johnson reinforced this view in a key speech on EU trade negotiations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/feb/03/no-need-for-free-trade-agreement-claims-boris-johnson-uk-eu-brexit-video\" title=\"\">earlier this month</a>. Any agreement must ensure that \u201cBritish fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats\u201d, said the prime minister, who <a href=\"https://www.brixhamchamber.co.uk/boris-johnsons-surprise-brixham-visit/?doing_wp_cron=1582184681.9543700218200683593750\" title=\"\">visited Brixham last summer</a> to meet fishermen and sample hake and chips on the quayside.</p> <p>The timetable is extremely tight, with the EU saying that an agreement on fishing must be reached by the end of July, and the talks will be tough. A fishing deal is a precondition to a wider trade agreement, the EU has said \u2013 and some European politicians and officials have suggested that Britain\u2019s access to the EU\u2019s lucrative financial services markets could depend on EU fleets being allowed to continue to fish in UK waters on the same basis as now.</p> <p>At the heart of the talks are issues of access and quotas. Under the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy (CFP), all member states have equal access to EU waters apart from the first 12 nautical miles from the coast. At the end of this year, the UK will become an independent coastal state, operating under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea rather than the CFP. As such, Britain will have control over an \u201cexclusive economic zone\u201d up to 200 nautical miles off its shores \u2013 some of the most bountiful seas in the world.</p> <p>Quotas are set for fish species in Brussels each year following scientific advice about the levels of stocks, and are allocated to member states on the basis of historic practice. Currently, EU boats are entitled to more than 60% of overall landings by weight from the seas around the UK, and for some species the proportion is greater. For example, the UK is allocated 9% of Channel cod, while the French get 84%. From next year, quota shares will be negotiated rather than decided in Brussels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"15e1ea52fdce9da3268a4f456ef90c11e8b3fd45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15e1ea52fdce9da3268a4f456ef90c11e8b3fd45/284_280_3454_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mevagissey harbour in Cornwall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mevagissey harbour in Cornwall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Expectations among British fishermen are high, but history has taught them to be wary. In Mevagissey, memories of what happened in the 1970s when Ted Heath was negotiating the UK\u2019s entry into the European common market are part of local folklore. \u201cWe were traded off, basically thrown to the wall, sacrificed for other sectors,\u201d said Trevarton.</p> <p>Rodney Ingram, 75, who fishes inshore from a 20ft boat after a working life on and off the sea, said: \u201cWe were sold down the line, used as a bargaining chip. We gave [the Europeans] everything they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Almost half a century later, they want redress. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping politicians will recognise the great injustice done to the industry back then.

But, they say, they want the cake divided up more fairly.</p> <p>Trevarton, who is chairman of the Mevagissey Fisherman\u2019s Association, listed their objectives: control over UK waters, a greater quota share, priority for UK vessels in inshore waters, and a management structure combining industry representatives and scientific experts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f90dd18e74c9370a01b4d213a5fe337564eb12c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f90dd18e74c9370a01b4d213a5fe337564eb12c0/0_52_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rod Ingram in front of his boat Petrel, in Mevagissey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rod Ingram in front of his boat Petrel, in Mevagissey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South West Handline Fisherman's Asociation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another point of contention is the EU\u2019s demand that any deal negotiated between March and July is permanent. Britain wants annual talks.</p> <p>\u201cAn annual agreement allows you to be active and nimble,\u201d said Jim Portus, of the South Western Fish Producers\u2019 Organisation. \u201cIt can reflect the movement and biology of fish, the needs and aspirations of fishermen, and bend and sway with fisheries science. The CFP had enormous fault lines running through it, but it was only amendable after 10 years.\u201d Norway had been negotiating annually with the EU for 40 years, he pointed out.</p> <p>Taking fish out of the sea is only part of the overall picture. About three-quarters of the seafood landed by UK fishermen is sold to EU countries \u2013 a trade reliant on being fast and frictionless. Brexit is likely to mean more customs delays and inspections \u2013 and if Britain restricts access to UK waters, the EU could impose tariffs on British exports. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French minister of Europe and foreign affairs, warned last week that if European boats were barred from UK waters, France would press for British trawlers to be prevented from selling their catches on the continent.</p> <p>Some British fishermen fear their militant French counterparts could simply take direct action to prevent fish landed in the UK being brought into French ports. Barrie Deas of the National Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Organisations (NFFO) said he fully expected blockades. \u201cFrench fishermen have done it for much less.

      "bodyText": "Neil Watson was eight or nine when his dad took him out to sea for the first time. Soon he was earning his first pocket money by washing fish boxes on the quay at Brixham in south Devon. Three years after he started crewing, he got his skipper\u2019s ticket and eventually he bought his own boat. For 30 years, he regularly spent seven days at sea followed by one night off, only stopping when his boat sank two years ago. \u201cI fished through good times and bad times. Fishing\u2019s like riding a wave \u2013 one minute you\u2019re up the top, and the next you\u2019re down in the trough,\u201d he said. Now Watson works at Brixham\u2019s fish market, one of the largest in England, where \u00a340m of fish was sold last year across the UK and Europe. A fisherman\u2019s life is brutal, he said, but he badly misses the camaraderie. Along the coast, in the picturesque Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey, Andrew Trevarton, a fisherman for 37 years, hasn\u2019t been out to sea for two weeks because of atrocious weather. Nevertheless, Trevarton is feeling cautiously optimistic about the future. \u201cYou have to be an optimist to go fishing in the first place,\u201d he said. In 2016, Trevarton and Watson voted for Brexit, along with the vast majority of UK fishermen. The image of rugged men in sea-slicked oilskins braving weather and waves to put food on the island nation\u2019s plates was a powerful emotional factor in the case for leaving the EU. After decades of battling over Brussels-set quotas, which allow European fleets to take a lion\u2019s share of fish from waters around the UK, the idea of taking back control was irresistible. Although the industry is a tiny part of the UK economy \u2013 worth less than 0.1% of the total in 2018 \u2013 it has become emblematic of a plucky, independent Britain, freed from the shackles of restrictions and regulations set by other people in other places, forging its own way in the world. Much, therefore, is riding on trade talks that are due to begin at the start of March. According to Nigel Farage, fishing will be the \u201cacid test\u201d of Brexit. Boris Johnson reinforced this view in a key speech on EU trade negotiations earlier this month. Any agreement must ensure that \u201cBritish fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats\u201d, said the prime minister, who visited Brixham last summer to meet fishermen and sample hake and chips on the quayside. The timetable is extremely tight, with the EU saying that an agreement on fishing must be reached by the end of July, and the talks will be tough. A fishing deal is a precondition to a wider trade agreement, the EU has said \u2013 and some European politicians and officials have suggested that Britain\u2019s access to the EU\u2019s lucrative financial services markets could depend on EU fleets being allowed to continue to fish in UK waters on the same basis as now. At the heart of the talks are issues of access and quotas. Under the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy (CFP), all member states have equal access to EU waters apart from the first 12 nautical miles from the coast. At the end of this year, the UK will become an independent coastal state, operating under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea rather than the CFP. As such, Britain will have control over an \u201cexclusive economic zone\u201d up to 200 nautical miles off its shores \u2013 some of the most bountiful seas in the world. Quotas are set for fish species in Brussels each year following scientific advice about the levels of stocks, and are allocated to member states on the basis of historic practice. Currently, EU boats are entitled to more than 60% of overall landings by weight from the seas around the UK, and for some species the proportion is greater. For example, the UK is allocated 9% of Channel cod, while the French get 84%. From next year, quota shares will be negotiated rather than decided in Brussels. Expectations among British fishermen are high, but history has taught them to be wary. In Mevagissey, memories of what happened in the 1970s when Ted Heath was negotiating the UK\u2019s entry into the European common market are part of local folklore. \u201cWe were traded off, basically thrown to the wall, sacrificed for other sectors,\u201d said Trevarton.

      "bodyText": "A repatriation flight carrying 32 Britons and Europeans from the coronavirus-infected cruise ship Diamond Princess landed in the UK on Saturday \u2013 amid growing fears for the welfare of some UK passengers left behind in Japan. David and Sally Abel \u2013 who were on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary and who have been diagnosed with coronavirus \u2013 have contracted pneumonia, it was revealed. Abel has acute pneumonia while his wife has a mild case of it. \u201cDad is very weak,\u201d said their son, Steve. The Abels were among four Britons on the Diamond Princess who tested positive for coronavirus and were not included on the flight that touched down at the Ministry of Defence base Boscombe Down in Wiltshire shortly after 11.30am on Saturday. The 32 passengers, who have already spent more than two weeks trapped on the ship off the coast of Japan, were then taken to Arrowe Park hospital, Wirral, for 14 days of quarantine. They have so far tested negative for Covid-19. Arrowe Park had previously been used to quarantine 83 British nationals for 14 days earlier this month after they were flown out of Wuhan in China, which has been at the centre of the outbreak. In the meantime the Abels\u2019 children said their parents had been left in a hospital room in Japan that had no shower or bathing facilities, and had only been provided with basic paper towels. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, they haven\u2019t had any treatments,\u201d said their son, Steve. \u201cThey have been told that if they test negative twice they can go \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t treat the pneumonia.\u201d The family, which has said it is willing to fly to Japan to bring the couple home, has criticised the Foreign Office response to their parents\u2019 plight, saying it has been \u201cnext to useless\u201d. The NHS said it had started testing people for coronavirus in their own homes in London. This would be expanded to other areas in the coming weeks, said Professor Keith Willett, NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus. \u201cHome-testing will be carried out by NHS staff, allowing people to stay home rather than having to travel, which is safer for you and your family and limits the spread of infection,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who is concerned they have signs and symptoms should continue to use NHS 111 as their first point of contact.\u201d",

Four people were killed during Storm Dennis.</p> <p>\u201cWe are simply not prepared for the flooding coming our way in future,\u201d said Prof Hannah Cloke, of Reading University. \u201cWe need to carry out a complete overhaul of our defences and be prepared to spend a lot more on them over a longer period of time.\u201d</p> <p>So far the government has committed to spending \u00a34bn over the next five years on improving flood defences. But both the amount and timescale were criticised for being insufficient last week.</p> <p>\u201cExtremely wet days during UK winters are currently up by around 15% compared with previous decades,\u201d said Dann Mitchell of Bristol University\u2019s Cabot Institute for the Environment. \u201cWetter future winters is a consistent projection with some predicting a 30% to 35% increase in rain by 2070. Our government and town planners need to invest significantly in UK flood defences.\u201d</p> <p>Last week George Eustice, the environment secretary, said he wanted to see more nature-based solutions, such as the construction of dams made of natural materials and the planting of trees in upper catchment areas. These would hold on to water and prevent it from pouring too quickly into rivers and estuaries.</p> <p>But this approach was dismissed as inadequate by Roger Falconer, professor of water management at Cardiff University. \u201cIt is like putting a small sticking plaster on a major open wound to control profuse bleeding.

      "bodyText": "More investment in flood defences and improved planning for future disasters are urgently needed, scientists have warned. They predict that the number of extreme wet days \u2013 which have already increased this century \u2013 will continue to rise in the coming decades and will bring even greater devastation than that experienced this month after Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis swept across the country. Ciara brought rain and wind gusts of up to 97mph, triggering more than 190 flood alerts. More than 500 properties were flooded and about 25,000 homes left without power. A week later Storm Dennis followed, which in some areas caused more than a month\u2019s rain to fall within 24 hours. Thousands of people had to be moved from their flooded homes, rivers \u2013 including the Wye in Hereford \u2013 rose to record levels, while the Environment Agency issued a record number of flood warnings and alerts, including more than 600 last weekend. Four people were killed during Storm Dennis. \u201cWe are simply not prepared for the flooding coming our way in future,\u201d said Prof Hannah Cloke, of Reading University. \u201cWe need to carry out a complete overhaul of our defences and be prepared to spend a lot more on them over a longer period of time.\u201d So far the government has committed to spending \u00a34bn over the next five years on improving flood defences. But both the amount and timescale were criticised for being insufficient last week. \u201cExtremely wet days during UK winters are currently up by around 15% compared with previous decades,\u201d said Dann Mitchell of Bristol University\u2019s Cabot Institute for the Environment. \u201cWetter future winters is a consistent projection with some predicting a 30% to 35% increase in rain by 2070. Our government and town planners need to invest significantly in UK flood defences.\u201d Last week George Eustice, the environment secretary, said he wanted to see more nature-based solutions, such as the construction of dams made of natural materials and the planting of trees in upper catchment areas. These would hold on to water and prevent it from pouring too quickly into rivers and estuaries. But this approach was dismissed as inadequate by Roger Falconer, professor of water management at Cardiff University. \u201cIt is like putting a small sticking plaster on a major open wound to control profuse bleeding. It would certainly be insufficient when dealing with the 30% increase in winter rainfall which the Met Office has predicted for some areas.\u201d Instead, Falconer called for the construction of a large number of flow-through or perforated dams above towns at high risk of flooding. \u201cSuch a dam fills during flooding in the upper parts of the river basin and is then emptied, under controlled conditions, after the flood,\u201d Falconer said. \u201cWe need many more of these.\u201d Engineers and hydrologists also pointed out to modifications made to river channels, flood plains, land cover and drainage, and these often have serious impacts on water flow and bedevil attempts to predict how rivers will react to downpours. For example, one recent study of the River Afan in Wales found 259 barriers had been erected along its course over the past 200 years, although only 33 had been officially recorded. Work on pinpointing barriers like these urgently needs to be carried out, scientists have said. \u201cBlame [for flooding] under these circumstances is misguided and unhelpful, and politicians should be very careful to ensure they understand the facts of flooding before seeking to champion any particular action,\u201d said Prof David Sear, of Southampton University. Bringing a halt to the construction of houses on flood plains has also emerged as a key issue. One in 10 new homes built in England since 2013 has been built on ground at high risk of flooding, official figures show. Prof Robert Wilby, of the University of Loughborough, told the Guardian that the government should review its housebuilding targets in view of the increased risks from floods. This was backed by Mohammad Heidarzadeh, head of coastal engineering at Brunel University. \u201cThe UK\u2019s flood defence systems were developed decades ago and are not fit to address the current climate situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the interval for major floods was 15 to 20 years in the past century, it has shortened to two to five years in the past decade. \u201cThe country needs further investment in its flood systems, but such investment should be within a holistic and integrated framework.\u201d",

Wilder goes down again, a clubbing left to the body from the challenger. Fury is picking him apart and you start to wonder when the referee will intervene. Fury lands a series of blows with Wilder trapped in a corner as the bell rings. This isn\u2019t going to last much longer.

Wilder tries to go over the top with a right hand but Fury sees it coming and easily moves out of the way. Fury doubles up the jab coming forward. The Gypsy King is starting to click here as Wilder\u2019s output has grown more frugal. And down goes Wilder in the last minute of the third round! A right hand to the temple has dropped Wilder for the first time in the decade and the crowd is going bananas! Wilder beats the count and Fury comes in for the finish ... and Wilder goes down again, only referee Kenny Bayless rules it a slip. There\u2019s the bell.

Chants of U-S-A! U-S-A! ring through the arena. Fury is coming forward now and Wilder is on the back foot but it\u2019s mostly a lot of feinting as each side probes for an opening. Another burst forward by Wilder as he tries to close the distance but Fury eludes the punches. Fury lands a right hand upstairs, drawing big cheers and Wilder clinches along the ropes. And Fury catches an off-balance Wilder flush as the bell rings, sending the champion reeling backwards into a neutral corner.

Wilder immediately comes forward and fires a pair of left jabs. He\u2019s circling to his left quickly and pumping the left to Fury\u2019s head. Now Wilder attacks the body, something he didn\u2019t do enough when they last met. Wilder already more active in the first minute than long stretches of the first meeting. Wilder springs forward with a combination but both shots miss. Now Fury, who hasn\u2019t done much, opens up with a combo that misses the target. And Fury bursts forward again with a flurry of four punches that sends the largely pro-Fury crowd into hysterics even if none of the shots landed clearly.

      "bodyText": "What a night in Las Vegas. We\u2019ll leave you with the full report of the fight, which you can read below: \u201cA big shout out to Deontay Wilder. He came here tonight and he manned up and he really did show the heart of a champion. I hit him with a clean right that dropped him and he got back up. He is a warrior. He will be back. He will be champion again. \u201cBut I will say, the king has returned to the top of the throne!\u201d The former champion is gracious in defeat: \u201cI\u2019m doing good. Things like this happen. The best man won tonight, but my corner threw in the towel and I was ready to go out on my shield. I had a lot of things going on heading into this fight. It is what it is, but I make no excuses tonight. I just wish my corner would have let me go out on my shield. I\u2019m a warrior. He had a great performance and we will be back stronger. \u201cEven the greatest have lost and came back, that is just part of it. You just take it for what it is. I can make no excuses tonight. I had a lot of complications. But we\u2019ll come back stronger next time around. This is what big-time boxing is all about, the best must fight the best. I appreciate all the fans that came out and supported the show, and I hope that everyone gets home safely.\u201d Fury thanks Jesus and various sponsors as he addresses the crowd and then launches into a version of Don McLean\u2019s American Pie - it\u2019s not too shabby a vocal performance for a man who has just won the heavyweight title. What next? Wilder has a rematch clause with Fury but he may not want to face the Briton again after the beating he just took. The obvious fight now is Anthony Joshua, but whether that happens is another question. Fury was just too good for his opponent tonight. He was not only too good technically but he was too powerful too. He out-thought and outfought Wilder, and the American could not find his balance to unleash that legendary power. Fury just put in one of the great performances by a British fighter abroad. The fight has been stopped as Wilder\u2019s corner throws in the towel in round seven. Say it out loud: Tyson Fury is the new WBC heavyweight champion of the world! Round 6 Another dominant round from Fury, who spends about half of it leaning on Wilder in a neutral corner and in-fighting beautifully. He\u2019s pounding away with hooks and uppercuts to the head and body. Wilder still bleeding from his left ear and in full retreat when he\u2019s not up against the ropes. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Wilder 9-10 Fury (Wilder 52-59 Fury) Fury is landing bombs. Wilder\u2019s legs are gone. He looks ready to fall early in the fifth. He can\u2019t defend himself. He lunges forward with a right hand that Fury swerves easily. Wilder goes down again, a clubbing left to the body from the challenger. Fury is picking him apart and you start to wonder when the referee will intervene. Fury lands a series of blows with Wilder trapped in a corner as the bell rings. This isn\u2019t going to last much longer. Fury has a point deducted by Bayless for hitting behind the head. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Wilder 9-9 Fury (Wilder 43-49 Fury) Round 4 Wilder is down early in the fourth but the referee rules it a slip, which it was. Wilder is looking for the right hand to the point of parody. Fury traps him against the ropes and opens up but Wilder clinches. Fury lands a big left. Wilder is bleeding from his left ear, which suggests a busted eardrum. He looks completely off. A very one-sided round for Fury and Wilder is in grave trouble. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Wilder 9-10 Fury (Wilder 35-40 Fury) Round 3 Fury lands a left followed by a left-right combo. Wilder tries to go over the top with a right hand but Fury sees it coming and easily moves out of the way. Fury doubles up the jab coming forward. The Gypsy King is starting to click here as Wilder\u2019s output has grown more frugal. And down goes Wilder in the last minute of the third round! A right hand to the temple has dropped Wilder for the first time in the decade and the crowd is going bananas! Wilder beats the count and Fury comes in for the finish ... and Wilder goes down again, only referee Kenny Bayless rules it a slip. There\u2019s the bell. What a round! Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Wilder 8-10 Fury (Wilder 26-30 Fury) Round 2 Wilder lands a lunging right hand early in the round but Fury takes it well. Chants of U-S-A! U-S-A! ring through the arena. Fury is coming forward now and Wilder is on the back foot but it\u2019s mostly a lot of feinting as each side probes for an opening. Another burst forward by Wilder as he tries to close the distance but Fury eludes the punches. Fury lands a right hand upstairs, drawing big cheers and Wilder clinches along the ropes. And Fury catches an off-balance Wilder flush as the bell rings, sending the champion reeling backwards into a neutral corner. Wilder looks slower and the weight gain might not be to his benefit. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Wilder 9-10 Fury (Wilder 9-10 Fury) Round 1 And we\u2019re off! Wilder immediately comes forward and fires a pair of left jabs. He\u2019s circling to his left quickly and pumping the left to Fury\u2019s head. Now Wilder attacks the body, something he didn\u2019t do enough when they last met. Wilder already more active in the first minute than long stretches of the first meeting. Wilder springs forward with a combination but both shots miss. Now Fury, who hasn\u2019t done much, opens up with a combo that misses the target. And Fury bursts forward again with a flurry of four punches that sends the largely pro-Fury crowd into hysterics even if none of the shots landed clearly. Wilder lands to the body but Fury lands a harder shot in return. A rip-roaring first round! Very close but I\u2019ll give it to the Gypsy King. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Wilder 9-10 Fury (Wilder 9-10 Fury) Now it\u2019s Deontay Wilder, dressed in an elaborate black gladiatorial armor and flanked by the rapper D Smoke as he performs Black Habits. Like Fury\u2019s, it\u2019s a long and drawn-out march from the tunnel to the ring. And finally the WBC heavyweight champion reaches the ring and climbs through the ropes. First it\u2019s Tyson Fury, the challenger. The Gypsy King makes his way to through the bowels of the MGM Grand Garden Arena as Gala\u2019s rave classic Freed From Desire plays at ear-splitting levels. He\u2019s wearing a crown and red robe befitting of royalty over black fighting robe. Now he climbs a parade float and emerges into the arena as Patsy Cline\u2019s Crazy plays. The crowd is eating it up. Jimmy Lennon Jr is in the ring and we\u2019re just about ready to go. Now it\u2019s time for the anthems: first Neil Diamond\u2019s Sweet Caroline, followed by God Save the Queen and The Star-Spangled Banner. And, finally, the fighters are moments away from making their entrances. A positively electric atmosphere at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, which is packed to the corners. Here\u2019s a look at how Wilder and Fury match up ahead of tonight\u2019s main event. The Gypsy King will enjoy two-inch advantages in height and reach in addition to coming in 42lbs heavier, though it\u2019s been debated whether the extra ballast will help or hurt him. Charles Martin has knocked out Gerald Washington with a vicious left hand down the middle in the sixth-round of their IBF heavyweight title eliminator. Martin, who briefly held the IBF title vacated by Fury with a 2016 win over Vyacheslav Glazkov (only to give it over to Anthony Joshua) delivered a crowd-pleasing ending to a dull affair against the 37-year-old Washington, who has been stopped in four of his last six outings. Next up: Wilder and Fury in their long-anticipated rematch for the WBC heavyweight championship. We\u2019re inching through the scheduled 12 rounds of a stinker of a co-main event between Charles Martin and Gerald Washington. Meanwhile, Critters 3 co-star Leonardo DiCaprio has just walked into the MGM Grand Garden Arena, joining the who\u2019s who at ringside including Michael J Fox, Steve Harvey, Magic Johnson, Gordon Ramsey and Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes. Veteran referee Kenny Bayless will be the third man in the ring for tonight\u2019s main event. The ringside judges are an American trio with heaps of experience in world championship fights: Dave Moretti (Nevada), Steve Weisfeld (New York) and the aforementioned Glenn Feldman (Connecticut). Fury, who has been very public on his intent to end the fight inside the distance, said he took no objection to all three arbiters being from the United States, saying: \u201cKenny Bayless is a top referee. He has refereed me before and he did a good job. I have no objections with the referees and judges, whoever they are they are, they will do a good job.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been no secret that I\u2019m looking for a knockout. That\u2019s why I hired (trainer SugarHill Steward) and went back to Kronk. He gets you to sit down on that big right hand, and that\u2019s the game plan.\u201d Emanuel Navarrete has successfully defended his WBO super bantamweight title with an 11th-round stoppage of Jeo Tupas Santisima. Navarrete, a high-volume pressure fighter who won the title in a major upset of Isaac Dogboe and backed it up in the immediate rematch, battered the overmatched Santisima in a one-sided affair until his corner finally threw in the towel. That leaves one more preliminary fight, a 12-round eliminator for the IBF heavyweight title between Charles Martin and Gerald Washington, before the main event. \u201cI think it was a fair decision and a good fight,\u201d says Sebastian Fundora, the super welterweight prospect who outpointed Australia\u2019s Daniel Lewis in tonight\u2019s PPV opener. \u201cThere were a lot of hard punches. I knew he would be tough. When they told me I was fighting an Olympian, I knew it would be a tough fight. He probably had more experience than me, but we prepared the right way and got the win.\u201d The 6ft 6in southpaw from the Coachella valley improved to 14-0-1 in 15 professional outings after the judges handed down scores of 97-93, 98-92 and 99-91, which felt a bit wider than how the close, competitive fight played out. \u201cI always want to use my height and my physical gifts, but it just depends on the fight. If the situation changes, we have to be ready to adapt,\u201d Fundora said. \u201cWhether we\u2019re fighting on the inside or the outside, I always want to be the busier fighter. The more punches you throw, the more you\u2019re going to land. It\u2019s the way I like to fight.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at the Fundora-Lewis cards. Let\u2019s hope Glenn Feldman, who turned in the 99-91 score and will return to ringside to judge Wilder-Fury in roughly an hour, fares better in the main event. Here\u2019s a look at the odds for tonight\u2019s fight at the MGM Grand sports book. At the moment Wilder is a -135 favorite (meaning a $135 bet would pay off $100), while Fury is a +115 underdog (meaning a $100 wager would return $115). Although the highly pro-Fury turnout at Friday\u2019s weigh-in suggest the Gypsy King will have the advantage in crowd support, the line shift indicates a majority of the action has been on Wilder. His price has shortened from -120 on Wednesday after opening at -110, while Fury\u2019s has drifted from even on Wednesday after starting at -110. Sebastian Fundora has won a unanimous decision over Australia\u2019s Daniel Lewis in the pay-per-view opener. The action in the 10-round super welterweight tilt was far closer and competitive than the official scores of 97-93, 98-92 and 99-91 would suggest. Perhaps not the best sign the absurd 99-91 card was handed down by Glenn Feldman, who is one of the three judges for the main event, but we\u2019re going to keep it positive tonight. Here\u2019s a look at tonight\u2019s order of play. The pay-per-view undercard is kicking off at the moment with California\u2019s Sebastian Fundora and Australia\u2019s Daniel Lewis in the first round of their a 10-round super welterweight bout. Sebastian Fundora v Daniel Lewis, 10 rounds, super welterweights Emanuel Navarrete v Jeo Tupas Santisima, 12 rounds, for Navarrete\u2019s WBO super bantamweight title Charles Martin v Gerald Washington, 12 rounds, IBF heavyweight title eliminator Deontay Wilder v Tyson Fury, rematch, 12 rounds, for Wilder\u2019s WBC heavyweight title And here\u2019s a look at the preliminaries that are in the books. They have included a major upset in the last hour as Brooklyn\u2019s Petros Ananyan (15-2-2, 7 KOs), who went off as an 18-1 underdog, outpointed Subriel Matias, the fancied super lightweight prospect from Puerto Rico, who had won all 15 of his professional fights by knockout. Rolando Romero TKO 2 Arturs Ahmetovs, eight rounds, lightweights Isaac Lowe UD 10 Alberto Guevara, 10 rounds, featherweights Vito Mielnicki Jr UD 10 Corey Champion, four rounds, super welterweights Gabriel Flores Jr UD 8 Matt Conway, eight rounds, lightweights Petros Ananyan UD 10 Subriel Matias, 10 rounds, super lightweights Javier Molina UD 8 Amir Imam, 10 rounds, super lightweights Hello and welcome to the Las Vegas strip for tonight\u2019s hotly anticipated rematch between Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury for the WBC heavyweight championship. We\u2019re ringside at the MGM Grand Garden Arena where a capacity crowd of 17,000 is expected for a delicious matchup between two undefeated giants with 71 professional wins between them, the two best fighters today in boxing\u2019s prestige division, that\u2019s been called the most important heavyweight title fight since the return meeting between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield in 1999. Tonight\u2019s main event is a rematch of their epic split draw 15 months ago in downtown Los Angeles, where the 6ft 9in Fury spent most of the night racking up points and using every trick in the book to negate Wilder\u2019s show-stopping right hand. The American finally broke through with a knockdown in the ninth round and an even heavier one in the 12th, which left Fury seemingly unconscious on the way down, but the Gypsy King somehow made it to his feet and to the final bell, where the ringside judges handed down the stalemate. Mexico\u2019s Alejandro Rochin scored it 115-111 to Wilder, Canada\u2019s Robert Tapper had it 114-112 for Fury and Phil Edwards of the United Kingdom called it even at 113-113. (The Guardian scored it 115-111 to Fury.) Fury\u2019s performance was all the more astonishing as it came on the heels of a very public bout with addiction and mental illness, when he surrendered all the belts he won from Wladimir Klitschko while swelling to nearly 400lb during a 31-month layoff. Both Wilder and Fury have won two fights apiece since their Staples Center classic, staying on course for tonight\u2019s blockbuster rematch even as Anthony Joshua, holder of the division\u2019s other three belts which in another lifetime belonged to Fury (and which he never lost in the ring), surrendered and regained in a pair of outings with Andy Ruiz Jr. It\u2019s just after 6pm in Las Vegas and the pay-per-view undercard is about to get started. The main event is expected to begin in roughly two and a half hours\u2019 time. Plenty to come between now and then. Bryan will be here shortly. Here\u2019s some essential pre-fight reading.",

A Green New Deal might be expensive but doing nothing about climate change will almost certainly cost far more.

Starters \u00a33.20-\u00a312.80, roast duck portion \u00a311.40, half \u00a314.40, mains \u00a39.30-\u00a320.50, wines from \u00a317.80, beers \u00a34.50</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s after dinner that we really notice it. London\u2019s Gerrard Street on a Saturday night is usually the restaurant equivalent of a mosh pit: a heaving crowd of hungry people, the scent of scorched wok in their nostrils, and the reflection of the bronzed and shiny roast ducks that crowd the windows of Chinatown\u2019s main drag in their eyeballs. Tonight, there was a pre-cinema rush, which we got caught up in. But now it\u2019s gone 9pm. The pedestrianised street is sparsely populated and through the picture windows, chairs and tables sit forlorn and empty. I\u2019ve never seen it like this before.</p> <p>After the Chinese New Year at the end of January, as news of the emerging coronavirus spread, \u201cbusiness just went down,\u201d says Jackie, duty manager of the Four Seasons at No 12, her hand making a swooping gesture like a plane crashing to ground. \u201cWe want the business back but we can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she says, with a sad shrug. \u201cPeople are scared.\u201d Because a nasty virus has broken out in a city 5,500 miles away from London, Britain\u2019s Chinese community is suffering. Because, y\u2019know, Chinese people. There are reports of abuse on the streets, of Asians being shunned on public transport. Across the Chinese restaurant sector, business is down. The mother of one Anglo-Chinese friend calls it \u201chealth-linked racial discrimination\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter what excuse you choose for your racism. It\u2019s still racism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"033efab278940c0f69cd1a3eb1cfacb1e08b4909\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/033efab278940c0f69cd1a3eb1cfacb1e08b4909/109_230_5261_3157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The skin is dark lacquered, the meat soft and sensuous\u2019: roast duck.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The skin is dark lacquered, the meat soft and sensuous\u2019: roast duck.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So this is a review with a simple message: go and support your local Chinese restaurant. Go show them that ethnicity is not a marker for disease. I didn\u2019t need to go to the branch of the <a href=\"http://www.fs-restaurants.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Four Seasons</a> at 12 Gerrard Street to write about it. I eat there alone about once a month, taking a yellow-clothed table in the corner of one of the plain dining rooms. It\u2019s often before going to record an episode of the <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01klvhq\" title=\"\">Kitchen Cabinet</a></em> for Radio 4, when having a good lunch is a grand idea: a plate of Cantonese roast meats of one sort or another, something green, a magazine to read. The food speaks directly to an intense, needy part of my appetite. I also like the brisk and efficient staff who greet me like a total stranger every time, despite the fact I\u2019ve been going for years. I\u2019ve mentioned it on this page and elsewhere before.</p> <p>So no, I really didn\u2019t need to go again. I know what they do and how well they do it. But this is an act of solidarity that also gets me roast duck. I was introduced to this Four Seasons by chef and writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/simon-hopkinson\" title=\"\">Simon Hopkinson</a>. He once told me the Chinese are the best at roasting ducks and that this is one of the best places for the best. I say this one, because it\u2019s a group, which started over on London\u2019s Queensway. There are now half a dozen, including one in Leicester and one literally next door, which specialises in hot pots. But I have my loyalties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e128fc2bb162cb61900ff3694dc883e10a12c128\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e128fc2bb162cb61900ff3694dc883e10a12c128/501_384_4739_2844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salt and pepper squid with rings of red chilli on a round white plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Big curls in a fine and lacy batter\u2019: salt and pepper squid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes I have the cubed belly pork. It has crackled skin like glass that shatters beneath the teeth, giving way to the soft layer of ivory-coloured fat underneath and then, below that, the meat. Tonight, though, we start with the char siu. It is not a worrying shade of traffic light red, as it sometimes can be, and nor is it dry, or too thinly sliced. It\u2019s just a deep, reddy brown, and in pleasing thumb-thick pieces and is eye-rollingly savoury. It comes on a heap of Chinese cabbage with the obligatory moat of dark, sweet-savoury liquor, which could be sipped neat as a restorative. Sometimes, when I am by myself and I\u2019m convinced nobody is looking, I do just that, lifting the bowl to my lips as if it were a teacup. My motto: \u201cNo spoonful left behind.\u201d</p> <p>And then the roast duck \u2013 the skin dark lacquered, most of the fat rendered, the meat soft and sensuous to the tongue as if braised. Crispy duck with pancakes is the boisterous crowd-pleaser, and has its place. Deep orange Peking duck, with its caramel-crunchy skin slicing rituals and its two services, is the fancy Bond Street version. Peking duck can be exhausting, like some high maintenance pretty friend who constantly needs to be told how beautiful they are.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"464d946538496001dbb76e1906776990ce5458b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/464d946538496001dbb76e1906776990ce5458b1/85_345_5124_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A thick round pot with morning glory, speckled with pieces of pork and chilli\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is illegal not to scrape up the chilli crusted around the bottom\u2019: morning glory and minced pork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This roast duck is the one I prefer: it doesn\u2019t need to be wrapped up in pancakes. It doesn\u2019t need hoisin or plum sauce or vegetables shredded within an inch of their life. It\u2019s self-contained and self-assured. Usually I get it bone in, because I like its tactile nature. Tonight, though, for ease of management with a sizable group, we have it boneless. Most of my party hasn\u2019t tried it this way before. I get to nod at them in a self-satisfied manner and mouth the words \u201cI know\u201d as they coo and mutter.</p> <p>Next the greens. For a long while it was the dry-fried green beans with minced pork and chilli. Then I discovered they did something similar with a big old tangle of morning glory. It comes in a thick pot, much like a classic mortar, which is so searingly hot they have to serve it inside a second container to spare the table. This means that when you\u2019re done with the vegetables, a ballast of minced pork and chilli has continued cooking and crusted around the bottom. It is illegal to not scrape this up. Beware: the metal spoon gets finger-burning hot from the bowl.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dd7515298df32cc7dd9191355d78317166692e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd7515298df32cc7dd9191355d78317166692e3/522_462_4585_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ginger lamb with chunks of red and green pepper on a round white plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In a dark, sticky, Peking sauce\u2019: ginger lamb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We have big curls of salt and pepper squid in a fine, lacy batter and, because I\u2019m feeling adventurous, lamb with ginger in a dark, sticky Peking sauce. We drink jasmine tea and a few Tsing Tao beers and run up a bill of \u00a3130 for four. There are wines, which I know from experience to be less than fabulous, but then why would you? We do not even investigate dessert. Just outside the door are waffle shops and Chinese patisseries.</p> <p>Until about 15 years ago, London\u2019s Chinatown was a sad place. You didn\u2019t go there to eat well. But the opening up of China has brought us the country\u2019s thrilling variety from Sichuan to Shanghai, from Hunan to Xinjiang and back again. It\u2019s happening all over. Walking from Birmingham New Street station recently, I was staggered to see that the once mainly Cantonese Chinatown has grown from a tiny cluster to a vast district apparently representing all the provinces. Britain\u2019s Chinese restaurant offering is more diverse and exciting than it\u2019s ever been. Please go and eat in one. Now.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Time to name check a few other Chinese favourites.

      "bodyText": "Four Seasons, 12 Gerrard Street, London W1D 5PR (020 7494 0870). Starters \u00a33.20-\u00a312.80, roast duck portion \u00a311.40, half \u00a314.40, mains \u00a39.30-\u00a320.50, wines from \u00a317.80, beers \u00a34.50 It\u2019s after dinner that we really notice it. London\u2019s Gerrard Street on a Saturday night is usually the restaurant equivalent of a mosh pit: a heaving crowd of hungry people, the scent of scorched wok in their nostrils, and the reflection of the bronzed and shiny roast ducks that crowd the windows of Chinatown\u2019s main drag in their eyeballs. Tonight, there was a pre-cinema rush, which we got caught up in. But now it\u2019s gone 9pm. The pedestrianised street is sparsely populated and through the picture windows, chairs and tables sit forlorn and empty. I\u2019ve never seen it like this before. After the Chinese New Year at the end of January, as news of the emerging coronavirus spread, \u201cbusiness just went down,\u201d says Jackie, duty manager of the Four Seasons at No 12, her hand making a swooping gesture like a plane crashing to ground. \u201cWe want the business back but we can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she says, with a sad shrug. \u201cPeople are scared.\u201d Because a nasty virus has broken out in a city 5,500 miles away from London, Britain\u2019s Chinese community is suffering. Because, y\u2019know, Chinese people. There are reports of abuse on the streets, of Asians being shunned on public transport. Across the Chinese restaurant sector, business is down. The mother of one Anglo-Chinese friend calls it \u201chealth-linked racial discrimination\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter what excuse you choose for your racism. It\u2019s still racism. So this is a review with a simple message: go and support your local Chinese restaurant. Go show them that ethnicity is not a marker for disease. I didn\u2019t need to go to the branch of the Four Seasons at 12 Gerrard Street to write about it. I eat there alone about once a month, taking a yellow-clothed table in the corner of one of the plain dining rooms. It\u2019s often before going to record an episode of the Kitchen Cabinet for Radio 4, when having a good lunch is a grand idea: a plate of Cantonese roast meats of one sort or another, something green, a magazine to read. The food speaks directly to an intense, needy part of my appetite. I also like the brisk and efficient staff who greet me like a total stranger every time, despite the fact I\u2019ve been going for years. I\u2019ve mentioned it on this page and elsewhere before. So no, I really didn\u2019t need to go again. I know what they do and how well they do it. But this is an act of solidarity that also gets me roast duck. I was introduced to this Four Seasons by chef and writer Simon Hopkinson. He once told me the Chinese are the best at roasting ducks and that this is one of the best places for the best. I say this one, because it\u2019s a group, which started over on London\u2019s Queensway. There are now half a dozen, including one in Leicester and one literally next door, which specialises in hot pots. But I have my loyalties. Sometimes I have the cubed belly pork. It has crackled skin like glass that shatters beneath the teeth, giving way to the soft layer of ivory-coloured fat underneath and then, below that, the meat. Tonight, though, we start with the char siu. It is not a worrying shade of traffic light red, as it sometimes can be, and nor is it dry, or too thinly sliced. It\u2019s just a deep, reddy brown, and in pleasing thumb-thick pieces and is eye-rollingly savoury. It comes on a heap of Chinese cabbage with the obligatory moat of dark, sweet-savoury liquor, which could be sipped neat as a restorative. Sometimes, when I am by myself and I\u2019m convinced nobody is looking, I do just that, lifting the bowl to my lips as if it were a teacup. My motto: \u201cNo spoonful left behind.\u201d And then the roast duck \u2013 the skin dark lacquered, most of the fat rendered, the meat soft and sensuous to the tongue as if braised. Crispy duck with pancakes is the boisterous crowd-pleaser, and has its place. Deep orange Peking duck, with its caramel-crunchy skin slicing rituals and its two services, is the fancy Bond Street version. Peking duck can be exhausting, like some high maintenance pretty friend who constantly needs to be told how beautiful they are. This roast duck is the one I prefer: it doesn\u2019t need to be wrapped up in pancakes. It doesn\u2019t need hoisin or plum sauce or vegetables shredded within an inch of their life. It\u2019s self-contained and self-assured. Usually I get it bone in, because I like its tactile nature. Tonight, though, for ease of management with a sizable group, we have it boneless. Most of my party hasn\u2019t tried it this way before. I get to nod at them in a self-satisfied manner and mouth the words \u201cI know\u201d as they coo and mutter. Next the greens. For a long while it was the dry-fried green beans with minced pork and chilli. Then I discovered they did something similar with a big old tangle of morning glory. It comes in a thick pot, much like a classic mortar, which is so searingly hot they have to serve it inside a second container to spare the table. This means that when you\u2019re done with the vegetables, a ballast of minced pork and chilli has continued cooking and crusted around the bottom. It is illegal to not scrape this up. Beware: the metal spoon gets finger-burning hot from the bowl. We have big curls of salt and pepper squid in a fine, lacy batter and, because I\u2019m feeling adventurous, lamb with ginger in a dark, sticky Peking sauce. We drink jasmine tea and a few Tsing Tao beers and run up a bill of \u00a3130 for four. There are wines, which I know from experience to be less than fabulous, but then why would you? We do not even investigate dessert. Just outside the door are waffle shops and Chinese patisseries. Until about 15 years ago, London\u2019s Chinatown was a sad place. You didn\u2019t go there to eat well. But the opening up of China has brought us the country\u2019s thrilling variety from Sichuan to Shanghai, from Hunan to Xinjiang and back again. It\u2019s happening all over. Walking from Birmingham New Street station recently, I was staggered to see that the once mainly Cantonese Chinatown has grown from a tiny cluster to a vast district apparently representing all the provinces. Britain\u2019s Chinese restaurant offering is more diverse and exciting than it\u2019s ever been. Please go and eat in one. Now. News bites Time to name check a few other Chinese favourites. In Blackpool there\u2019s the Wok Inn Seaside Noodle Bar, both for pan-Asian dishes and Cantonese classics (and it\u2019s mothership deeper into town, Mandarin). In Manchester go to Live Seafood, for crustacea from the tanks cooked all ways. In Edinburgh visit Chop Chop for seriously compelling dumplings. And elsewhere in London\u2019s Chinatown, try Baiwei for bare bones Sichuan or JinLi just around the corner for similar food in plusher surroundings. Dumpling\u2019s Legend is the place for Xiao Long Bao (or soupy dumplings), and just across Shaftesbury Avenue there\u2019s the ever-brilliant Y Ming. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it\u2019s a \u2018premium immersive restaurant experience\u2019 based on the characters from the DC Comics universe, including Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman et al. What this means in terms of the actual food is anybody\u2019s guess, but it will occupy an 18,000 square foot basement site on London\u2019s Brewer Street. Jamie Oliver continues to rebuild his restaurant interests, despite the closure of so many UK outlets last year when the Jamie\u2019s Italian group failed, resulting in mass redundancies. Chequer Lane will open in Dublin in April and will promote \u2018the best of Irish produce\u2019. Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street is accusing the EU of being in disarray over its plans for a post-Brexit trade deal, in the latest deterioration of relations ahead of crunch talks next month. Boris Johnson will also unveil his blueprint for a US trade deal next week, in a move designed to heap further pressure on Brussels. However, EU sources regard the hostile briefings as a bluff from the prime minister\u2019s team, saying that their pre-negotiation plans are on track. Both the government and the EU will unveil their negotiating mandates this week, before the two sides come together for talks at the start of March. However, figures on both sides are also worried about the early collapse of talks after a series of clashes before discussions have even begun. The conflict centres on the degree to which Brussels will demand that Britain sticks to EU rules as part of a deal. Johnson and his chief negotiator, David Frost, have said that they have no intention of doing so and are prepared for the disruption in trade that could follow. Government sources said that the UK would accuse the EU of depriving Britain of deals that it has already offered other countries outside the bloc. It will double down on its accusation that the EU has effectively withdrawn an offer to give the UK a Canada-style agreement, which would allow Britain to diverge from EU rules in the future. However, the EU insists that Britain\u2019s proximity and the size of its trade always meant that such an offer was dependent on its willingness to adopt \u201clevel playing field\u201d measures, designed to keep it aligned to some EU rules. Downing Street\u2019s negotiating proposals will be signed off by a committee of cabinet ministers on Tuesday and published on Thursday.

The movement is all circular, a great onward rush of love and passion that evolves into a trio when <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/matthew-ball\" title=\"\">Matthew Ball</a>\u2019s dashing \u201cconductor\u201d joins the dance, stretching, turning and leaping in slim, sensual lines.</p> <p>There is slightly too much going on in too small a space. Hildegard Bechtler\u2019s set, which conjures the lines of a cello, pinions the dancers into tight curves; it\u2019s deliberate but frustrating. A large chorus of supporting dancers takes many parts, sometimes coyly mimicking objects of furniture, sometimes sweeping around the principals. It sometimes works beautifully, as when they arch around Du Pr\u00e9 as the framing instruments in an orchestra (solo cello, Hetty Snell, in the pit, playing Elgar beautifully).</p> <p>But it\u2019s often distracting. The moments that work best are when the elaboration stops and the dancers have time to sketch a feeling \u2013 when Kristen McNally\u2019s mother swaddles her daughter in a cardigan, when Cuthbertson soars in ecstasy, and \u2013 most affectingly \u2013 when she begins to stagger and fall, unable to play, her movements becoming ugly, disjointed and finally still. Samb\u00e9 gently kisses her hand as he unfolds away from her; a moment of utter sorrow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b488997da302a2ace0315b23d01930e652b8d43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b488997da302a2ace0315b23d01930e652b8d43/0_0_4195_2478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francesca Hayward, William Bracewell, Marianela Nunez, Federico Bonelli, Yasmine Naghdi and Valentino Zucchetti in Dances at a Gathering.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"591\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francesca Hayward, William Bracewell, Marianela Nu\u00f1ez, Federico Bonelli, Yasmine Naghdi and Valentino Zucchetti in Dances at a Gathering.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The evening opened with more elusive emotions, in a revival of Jerome Robbins\u2019s <strong>Dances at a Gathering</strong>, a sequence of glorious dances to the solo piano pieces of Chopin (magnificently performed by Robert Clark), beautifully performed by the entire cast, with Marianela Nu\u00f1ez, Francesca Hayward and Yasmine Naghdi in particular finding just the right way to communicate its breezy mysteries.</p> <p>Over at the Peacock theatre, choreographer<a href=\"https://zoonation.co.uk/explore/kate-prince/\" title=\"\"> Kate Prince</a> is attempting something even more difficult than Marston. In <strong><a href=\"http://peacocktheatre.com/whats-on/message-in-a-bottle/\" title=\"\">Message in a Bottle</a></strong>, she has created a popular dance show about the tragedy of the refugee crisis, told through hip-hop dance and the songs of Sting.

      "bodyText": "Give a woman a stage and she will fill it with power and emotion. That\u2019s the message of a week that saw two major premieres of new dance pieces by women choreographers that both made their mark. Cathy Marston has waited long enough for her chance. She\u2019s been associated with the Royal Ballet for 25 years, but The Cellist is the first time she\u2019s been trusted to create for the main stage. It is a considerable piece, full of feeling and imagination, lingering in the mind long after the curtain has come down. In dramatising the life of Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 (1945-87), the gifted, charismatic cellist who made classical music sexy and vibrant for an entire generation before being struck down by multiple sclerosis at the age of 28, Marston decides to do something very difficult. She makes the central relationship of Du Pr\u00e9\u2019s life not that with her husband, the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, but with music itself \u2013 embodied in the form of her cello. Marcelino Samb\u00e9 is cast as \u201cthe instrument\u201d \u2013 no one is named in the cast sheet \u2013 who also \u201cnarrates\u201d the ballet as a kind of musical fantasy. When he first appears, placed between the knees of a young cellist (lively, lovely Emma Lucano), arm elegantly curved like the cello\u2019s neck, I thought it was all a bit music- and-movementy \u2013 a throwback to the kind of ballets that Hollywood films of the 1940s liked to imagine. But the conceit takes hold, thanks in part to Samb\u00e9\u2019s impassioned dancing, and to Marston\u2019s choreography, which bends, swerves and swirls as the adult cellist \u2013 danced by Lauren Cuthbertson \u2013 leans into the sound of the classical hits that Du Pr\u00e9 made her own, woven into an effective score by Philip Feeney. The movement is all circular, a great onward rush of love and passion that evolves into a trio when Matthew Ball\u2019s dashing \u201cconductor\u201d joins the dance, stretching, turning and leaping in slim, sensual lines. There is slightly too much going on in too small a space. Hildegard Bechtler\u2019s set, which conjures the lines of a cello, pinions the dancers into tight curves; it\u2019s deliberate but frustrating. A large chorus of supporting dancers takes many parts, sometimes coyly mimicking objects of furniture, sometimes sweeping around the principals. It sometimes works beautifully, as when they arch around Du Pr\u00e9 as the framing instruments in an orchestra (solo cello, Hetty Snell, in the pit, playing Elgar beautifully). But it\u2019s often distracting. The moments that work best are when the elaboration stops and the dancers have time to sketch a feeling \u2013 when Kristen McNally\u2019s mother swaddles her daughter in a cardigan, when Cuthbertson soars in ecstasy, and \u2013 most affectingly \u2013 when she begins to stagger and fall, unable to play, her movements becoming ugly, disjointed and finally still. Samb\u00e9 gently kisses her hand as he unfolds away from her; a moment of utter sorrow. The evening opened with more elusive emotions, in a revival of Jerome Robbins\u2019s Dances at a Gathering, a sequence of glorious dances to the solo piano pieces of Chopin (magnificently performed by Robert Clark), beautifully performed by the entire cast, with Marianela Nu\u00f1ez, Francesca Hayward and Yasmine Naghdi in particular finding just the right way to communicate its breezy mysteries. Over at the Peacock theatre, choreographer Kate Prince is attempting something even more difficult than Marston. In Message in a Bottle, she has created a popular dance show about the tragedy of the refugee crisis, told through hip-hop dance and the songs of Sting. It sounds improbable, and there were moments towards the beginning when I wondered if she could pull it off. There is a lot vigorous dancing in the cypher to establish a sense of community before a family are split apart by war, and the songs (rearranged by Hamilton\u2019s Alex Lacamoire and sometimes sung by guest vocalists) can feel dragged into the action. (Don\u2019t Stand Too Close to Me makes a particularly uneasy background to a scene in which women are threatened with sexual violence.) But gradually the piece finds its emotional punch, carving space for passages of expressive, almost abstract dance, as it also finds ways of charting the separate fates of two brothers and their sister to a narrative line created with the help of playwright Lolita Chakrabarti. It helps that they are danced with incredible skill and commitment by Natasha Gooden, Lukas McFarlane and Tommy Franz\u00e9n, whose weightless fluidity enables him to make even the smallest gesture speak volumes. But Prince is also clever at shaping her narrative in compelling ways. There\u2019s a brilliant scene of a raft wrecked on a pounding ocean, conjured by projections, with the orange life jackets of the dancers bobbing in the darkness; a rousing plea for freedom set in an internment camp (to the title song); duets of love and estrangement, and above all, a tentatively optimistic close when Sting\u2019s voice soars in They Dance Alone. It\u2019s quite an achievement to bring so complex a subject to the dance stage in this way.

Still, what a show it\u2019s been. It went daft for a while, mainly because of the plot contortions required to keep alive double agent Nicholas Brody, played by Damian Lewis. (If they hadn\u2019t finally hanged him from a giant crane, I was going to offer to kill him myself.) Then <em>Homeland</em> returned to complex, prescient, uncompromising form \u2013 a potent blend of foreign and domestic threats to US security, geopolitics, troll farms, and gut-punches of human betrayal. This series opened with a big question: when held in Russia and \u2013 once again! \u2013 deprived of her bipolar medication, had Carrie given away secrets? It wasn\u2019t long before Saul (Mandy Patinkin) was crashing through double doors and red tape, insisting that Carrie was needed for a mission in Kabul.</p> <p><em>Homeland</em> isn\u2019t a series that values romantic or family relationships. Carrie\u2019s love interests \u2013 Brody, Quinn and more \u2013 met such grisly fates she makes <em>Killing Eve</em>\u2019s Villanelle look like Bridget Jones. Carrie\u2019s daughter with Brody has been abandoned so often the local social services department should have its own miniseries. <em>Homeland</em>\u2019s core relationship is between Carrie and Saul \u2013 one of the all-time great platonic TV partnerships \u2013 which has turned mutual professional trust and respect into an intense emotional entity that sometimes derails into scratchy co-dependency.</p> <p>Within the series\u2019s highly dysfunctional \u201cfamily\u201d, there\u2019s also Carrie\u2019s surveillance \u201cbrother\u201d Max (Maury Sterling). This episode saw him escorted into dangerous desert territory by reluctant, scornful US troops, deriding him as \u201cCable Guy\u201d, until they learned that Max was on the ground for the Islamabad atrocity.

But this show isn\u2019t just about cutting and shutting. Valentine also introduces us to other non-police experts performing seemingly small procedures when confronted with a suspicious death. For instance: a man is found burned to death in a wood. Was it suicide or murder? What can the body reveal? What about the surrounding woodland, the earth? Any discarded clothing? How can teeny pieces of evidence be gathered and analysed to form a coherent case and discover what actually went on?</p> <p>Valentine is a charismatic presenter, and she\u2019s our guide through some grisly scenarios. In <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p081ylhn\" title=\"\">Mortem</a></strong>, the cases considered are fictional \u2013 composites of actual deaths \u2013 but the experts are real and the first three episodes are devoted to \u201cThe Burning Man\u201d (the burnt man would have been a more accurate title). The experts conduct clothing flammability tests, investigate the ground for pollen, use a trained dog to track down any scraps of petrol-covered material. Valentine herself, whose job title is actually senior anatomical pathology technologist, talks us through her autopsy instruments. She also describes the particular way she cuts a corpse\u2019s flesh to open the sternum and reveal the organs within. Be warned: sound effects give this extra realism.</p> <p>It might seem an odd set-up for a series, this mixture of fiction and fact, but it\u2019s done very well. The stories (two so far) reveal themselves slowly, over a few episodes, piece by piece. A little too slowly for my taste, initially, but once I\u2019d settled into <em>Mortem\u2019s</em> careful pace, I enjoyed the intimacy and detail. In the second case, which started last week, an old lady has been battered to death. Valentine explains that she needs to remove the brain from the head, for examination, and that the brain can\u2019t be replaced into its cavity once removed and dissected, \u201cbecause it might leak out through the ears\u201d(!). Instead, the brain is put into the main part of the body and a large piece of wadding is inserted into the head, so that once the postmortem is done and the skin is put back where it should be, the corpse looks like the person it once was.</p> <p>Does this sound gruesome? It isn\u2019t, or at least it\u2019s a lot less gruesome than many true crime series. And, of course, we\u2019re dealing with a mystery, and mysteries are what podcasts are made for. If I were a crime writer, I would subscribe to <em>Mortem </em>immediately: so many interesting details are revealed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"295b22326a9dd2ca1d20e25cb81d8ee58b77364a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/295b22326a9dd2ca1d20e25cb81d8ee58b77364a/154_466_5456_3274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Marhoefer, aka Long Haul Paul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Marhoefer, aka Long Haul Paul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Radiotopia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another odd-bod series started last week: Radiotopia\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/over-the-road\" title=\"\">Over the Road</a></strong>. This has gravel-voiced trucker \u201cLong Haul\u201d Paul Marhoefer discussing all aspects of being a truck driver in the States, and especially how his job is being changed by new tech and regulations. Whether you enjoy this eight-part podcast will depend on whether you enjoy Marhoefer\u2019s company. He certainly has an amazing \u201clate-night radio\u201d voice, and we\u2019re also treated to his music. But how interested are you in the detail of the monitoring of trucking? I\u2019m not quite decided about that as yet.</p> <p>And Fun Kids, that most ambitious of children\u2019s broadcasters, has an offbeat new drama. <strong><a href=\"https://www.funkidslive.com/podcast/the-space-programme/#\" title=\"\">The Space Programme</a> </strong>concerns Lune, a small Scottish island with only 300 or so inhabitants, chosen by a space-loving billionaire as the best spot for a space shuttle launch.

      "bodyText": "Mortem | BBC Sounds Over the Road | radiotopia.fm The Space Programme | funkidslive.com An intriguing new series on BBC Sounds, made by the always reliable Whistledown Productions, has a mortician, Carla Valentine, talk us through her job. But this show isn\u2019t just about cutting and shutting. Valentine also introduces us to other non-police experts performing seemingly small procedures when confronted with a suspicious death. For instance: a man is found burned to death in a wood. Was it suicide or murder? What can the body reveal? What about the surrounding woodland, the earth? Any discarded clothing? How can teeny pieces of evidence be gathered and analysed to form a coherent case and discover what actually went on? Valentine is a charismatic presenter, and she\u2019s our guide through some grisly scenarios. In Mortem, the cases considered are fictional \u2013 composites of actual deaths \u2013 but the experts are real and the first three episodes are devoted to \u201cThe Burning Man\u201d (the burnt man would have been a more accurate title). The experts conduct clothing flammability tests, investigate the ground for pollen, use a trained dog to track down any scraps of petrol-covered material. Valentine herself, whose job title is actually senior anatomical pathology technologist, talks us through her autopsy instruments. She also describes the particular way she cuts a corpse\u2019s flesh to open the sternum and reveal the organs within. Be warned: sound effects give this extra realism. It might seem an odd set-up for a series, this mixture of fiction and fact, but it\u2019s done very well. The stories (two so far) reveal themselves slowly, over a few episodes, piece by piece. A little too slowly for my taste, initially, but once I\u2019d settled into Mortem\u2019s careful pace, I enjoyed the intimacy and detail. In the second case, which started last week, an old lady has been battered to death. Valentine explains that she needs to remove the brain from the head, for examination, and that the brain can\u2019t be replaced into its cavity once removed and dissected, \u201cbecause it might leak out through the ears\u201d(!). Instead, the brain is put into the main part of the body and a large piece of wadding is inserted into the head, so that once the postmortem is done and the skin is put back where it should be, the corpse looks like the person it once was. Does this sound gruesome? It isn\u2019t, or at least it\u2019s a lot less gruesome than many true crime series. And, of course, we\u2019re dealing with a mystery, and mysteries are what podcasts are made for. If I were a crime writer, I would subscribe to Mortem immediately: so many interesting details are revealed. Another odd-bod series started last week: Radiotopia\u2019s Over the Road. This has gravel-voiced trucker \u201cLong Haul\u201d Paul Marhoefer discussing all aspects of being a truck driver in the States, and especially how his job is being changed by new tech and regulations. Whether you enjoy this eight-part podcast will depend on whether you enjoy Marhoefer\u2019s company. He certainly has an amazing \u201clate-night radio\u201d voice, and we\u2019re also treated to his music. But how interested are you in the detail of the monitoring of trucking? I\u2019m not quite decided about that as yet. And Fun Kids, that most ambitious of children\u2019s broadcasters, has an offbeat new drama. The Space Programme concerns Lune, a small Scottish island with only 300 or so inhabitants, chosen by a space-loving billionaire as the best spot for a space shuttle launch. A competition to be the world\u2019s first child astronaut is launched and friendships between young teenagers are formed and broken as the island community reacts in different ways to their quiet environment becoming the centre of space-fuelled attention. There are barely credible plot points and highly unlikely scenes (the basic premise is pretty unbelievable, let\u2019s face it), but that doesn\u2019t really matter. The characters are engaging, the show is well-paced and I found myself happily bingeing the lot in one go (each episode is only eight minutes long). I\u2019m enjoying podcasters\u2019 explorations of places that audio doesn\u2019t usually bother to visit. Three brilliantly read audiobooks Beastie Boys Book This 2018 book is not just a history of this most brilliant band, but a series of revelatory tales, mostly from Adam \u201cAd-Rock\u201d Horovitz and Michael \u201cMike D\u201d Diamond.

Jarvis Cocker narrates Ad-Rock\u2019s first visit to London, Amy Poehler a list of videos. In particular, John C Reilly\u2019s deadpan wit makes Mike D\u2019s writing come alive. I Partridge/Nomad Memoirs are usually the best forms of audiobook. There\u2019s something amazingly revealing about an author reading their own words, especially when those words concern themselves. Plus, if they\u2019re funny, you can\u2019t lose. Hilarious real-life audio memoirists include David Sedaris, Alexei Sayle and Louis Theroux.

If you miss Alan when you\u2019re done, try Diane Morgan\u2019s Cunk on Everything or Matt Berry\u2019s Toast on Toast. Heartburn I have an aversion to actorly readings of books (other than Simon Callow reading Peter Ackroyd\u2019s London, because he\u2019s out-of-this-world fruity). It\u2019s so hard for an actor to get the voice right, the tone and soul of the book as it\u2019s written. But Meryl Streep is hard to fault in her reading of Heartburn, the wonderful 1983 novel but really a memoir by Nora Ephron. An honourable mention for Hayley Atwell\u2019s interpretation of Jessie Burton\u2019s smash hit The Confession, which came out last year, and Br\u00cdd Brennan\u2019s brilliant reading of Anna Burns\u2019s Man Booker prize-winner Milkman.",

Crucially, this is the first time that Nevada has allowed early voting, a factor that will substantially increase participation in the primary, but also make calculating the results more complicated. </p> \n  <p>In 2016, 84,000 Democrats participated in the caucuses. About 75,000 participated in early voting before today. </p> \n  <p><em>Per the AP: </em></p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><strong> What results will Democrats release out of the caucus? </strong></p> \n   <p>There will be three sets of results:</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Tallies of the \u201cfirst alignment\u201d of caucus-goers; </li> \n    <li>The caucus-goers\u2019 \u201cfinal alignment\u201d; </li> \n    <li>The total number of delegates to county conventions won by candidates. </li> \n   </ul> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The first and final alignment results aren\u2019t new, but this is the first time the party has made them public. </p> \n   <p><strong>Could Nevada experience the same problems that occurred in Iowa?</strong></p> \n   <p>In Iowa, the inability of some caucus organizers to download the app on their phones, or to use it successfully, triggered a flood of calls to the party\u2019s hotline and dramatically slowed the process of reporting results. And a coding issue within the mobile app muddied the data that was sent in, creating discrepancies that halted the reporting of initial results for nearly 24 hours. </p> \n   <p>In Nevada, caucus organizers will not need to download anything, but they will be asked to work on an iPad and navigate a Google form designed to integrate early voters into the in-person caucus process and calculate results. The Google app and iPads are trusted commercial tech tools, but election experts have warned that deploying any technology late in the process, like Nevada did, increases the risk of problems. Paper records of the early vote will be available if needed. </p> \n   <p>Volunteers say that hands-on training with the iPads and the Google form wasn\u2019t even available until late Tuesday, giving little time for people, particularly those who are not tech-savvy, to practice. </p> \n   <p><strong>Could results be delayed? </strong></p> \n   <p>It\u2019s possible. Party officials have said they will be guided by accuracy over speed. Factors that include the integration of early votes into the process and potentially high turnout, could affect the tabulation and timing of results. Early voting is a complicated step that Iowa did not attempt, and there\u2019s been some uncertainty about how early voters would be included in later stages of the caucus process.</p> \n   <p>If everything goes smoothly with the iPads and the Google forms, this part of the process could go quickly. But if volunteers are left to rely on complex instructions and doing math by hand, it could slow everything down. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e519ff78f08e133247484b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-22T21:44:53.091Z\">9.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin has been attending a caucus at the University of Nevada, Reno, where Bernie Sanders will win every single delegate. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SamTLevin/status/1231333597870612480\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In the group I\u2019ve been following, it\u2019s official: all nine delegates from this precinct going to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BernieSanders</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MJoxm42sEn\">pic.twitter.com/MJoxm42sEn</a></p>\u2014 Sam Levin (@SamTLevin) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamTLevin/status/1231333597870612480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Down the hall, at another University of Nevada, Reno, caucus site, Amy Klobuchar has achieved viability, though she\u2019s still second to Sanders. <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SamTLevin/status/1231332414787444737\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In another precinct in University of Reno, Nevada, the two viable candidates are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BernieSanders</a> (69)<a href=\"https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@amyklobuchar</a> (41) <a href=\"https://t.co/1jU1cxni27\">pic.twitter.com/1jU1cxni27</a></p>\u2014 Sam Levin (@SamTLevin) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamTLevin/status/1231332414787444737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-22T22:58:16.415Z\">at 10.58pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e519f028f086a28115b0b36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-22T21:38:49.691Z\">9.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s another interesting data point on the debate over Medicare-for-all, from the Washington Post.

Here\u2019s where we\u2019re at: Bernie Sanders declared a resounding victory in the \u201cfirst in the west\u201d primary race. Just over a quarter of precincts have reported results. The Nevada Democrats are still tabulating the final results. Sanders is the projected winner and is by far the frontrunner so far. Joe Biden is currently in second place and Pete Buttigieg is third. Both campaigns have claimed second place. Full results could take a while to tabulate; party officials have to integrate caucus results with early votes. Nearly 75,000 Nevadans voted early, according to the Nevada Democrats. Sanders was boosted up by Latino supporters \u2013 who account for 1 in 5 voters in Nevada. The campaign invested big, and early in outreach \u2013 and it paid off. Healthcare was a big issue for Nevada voters; exit polls indicated that a majority were in favor of a single-payer system. Read our key takeaways here. Now 27% of precincts are reporting, but it hasn\u2019t much affected th percent of county delegates allocated to each candidate: Sanders - 47% Biden \u2013 23% Buttigieg \u2013 14% Warren \u2013 9% Steyer \u2013 4% Klobuchar \u2013 3% Tom Steyer, speaking to supporters in Las Vegas, remained hopeful about his chances of winning the primaries. In Nevada, with just under a quarter of precincts reporting, he has earned about 4% of county delegates. Elizabeth Warren is continuing to project confidence in her chances of getting the nomination. \u201cUnderstand this: I\u2019m not in this fight to talk about change. I am in this fight to make change,\u201d said the senator who is known for her detailed plans. Her campaign was re-energized after a strong debate performance this week. But with nearly 75,000 Nevadans voting early, before the debate, it\u2019s unclear whether her post-debate momentum had any impact in Nevada. In Seattle, she addressed a crowd of around 7,000. A supporter asked her who she\u2019d choose as a running mate if she were nominated. \u201cI would be presumptuous at this moment to talk about it, but what I can do is describe,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is, I want to partner in this fight. That\u2019s it.\u201d Now we have 23% of precincts reporting, but the ranking of candidates hasn\u2019t changed. Sanders \u2013 47% Biden \u2013 23% Buttigieg \u2013 13% Warren \u2013 9% Steyer \u2013 4% Klobuchar \u2013 3% Elizabeth Warren\u2019s message to Nevadans: \u201cThank you for keeping me in the fight.\u201d Warren, speaking to supporters in Seattle, congratulated Bernie Sanders on his victory in Nevada. \u201cThe race has been called. Bernie has won, congratulations Bernie,\u201d she said. But she added that since Wednesday night \u2013 the day of the debate \u2013 \u201cour support has been growing everywhere.\u201d As she did on debate night, and in the days after, Warren launched into a takedown of Mike Bloomberg. \u201cMichael Bloomberg is not the safest candidate, Michael Bloomberg is the riskiest candidate,\u201d she said. Bloomberg was competing in Nevada, choosing to focus instead on the Super Tuesday states, where Warren will have to claim big gains in order to stay in the race. After a long delay, more results are starting to come in. With 11.2% of precincts reporting, Sanders is still on top, but there has been some movement below. Here\u2019s where we are: Sanders \u2013 47% Biden \u2013 24% Buttigieg \u2013 14% Warren \u2013 9% Steyer \u2013 4% Klobuchar \u2013 3% Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign manager has put out a statement on Bernie Sanders\u2019 victory in Nevada. Bloomberg did not contest Nevada, but is staking his candidacy on Super Tuesday. The Nevada results reinforce the reality that this fragmented field is putting Bernie Sanders on pace to amass an insurmountable delegate lead. This is a candidate who just declared war on the so-called \u201cDemocratic Establishment.\u201d We are going to need Independents AND Republicans to defeat Trump \u2013 attacking your own party is no way to get started. As Mike says, if we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base \u2013 like Senator Sanders \u2013 it will be a fatal error. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s strong performance in last week\u2019s debate wasn\u2019t enough to vault her into a winning position in the Nevada caucuses. Her campaign manager, Roger Lau, is arguing on Twitter that her vote share surged between the early voters and those who showed up in person, however. Bernie Sanders\u2019s strength among Latino voters in Nevada could signal good things for his campaign come Super Tuesday, my colleague Lauren Gambino suggests. The two biggest prizes on 3 March, California and Texas, have significant Latino populations. Here is more on Bernie Sanders\u2019s victory, from my colleagues Maanvi Singh and Sam Levin, who have been reporting from Nevada this week: The Nevada caucuses come at a critical moment in the Democratic primary, a week before the South Carolina race and just before Super Tuesday, in March, when 14 states will vote. In a state that is nearly 30% Latino, 10% black and has a rapidly growing Asian American community, the Nevada results were a compelling sign of Sanders\u2019 strength in diverse states that more closely reflect the demographics of the Democratic party. Warren was pushing for a surge in Nevada after her widely celebrated performance at the debate days earlier in Las Vegas. Warren announced on Saturday she had raised $14m in the last 10 days, double the amount her campaign had set out as a goal ahead of the caucuses. Nevada\u2019s \u201cfirst-in-the-west\u201d caucuses were also a major test for the campaign of the former vice-president Biden, who was a frontrunner in polls last year but performed poorly in the first two state contests. Biden gave a triumphant speech in Vegas before the results were finalized, and his campaign manager said he appeared to be in second place. \u201cThe press is ready to declare people dead quickly. We\u2019re alive. We\u2019re coming back,\u201d Biden said to cheers. Sanders\u2019 remarks provide a strong contrast to those of Buttigieg and Biden. With his frontrunner status cemented, Sanders is focusing his remarks on Donald Trump and his core message of economic justice, with nary a reference to his Democratic rivals. Bernie Sanders declared victory in the Democratic caucuses in Nevada, while speaking at a rally in San Antonio, Texas on Saturday evening. \u201cWe won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, and according to three networks and the AP, we have now won the Nevada caucus,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019ve put together a multi-generational, multi-racial coalition, which is not only going to win in Nevada, it\u2019s going to sweep this country.\u201d Early voting in Texas, a Super Tuesday state is already underway. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win the Democratic primary in Texas,\u201d Sanders told his supporters. How can the networks and AP call the race for Sanders with only 4% of precincts reporting? Here is how the Associated Press describes its process for calling an election\u2019s results: The responsibility for calling races rests with experienced staff in each state. They are armed with on-the-ground knowledge that no other national news organization can match. Plus, they have information on demographics, absentee and other voting history and political issues that may affect the outcome of races they must call. On election night, they are assisted by experts in AP\u2019s Washington bureau. A \u201cdecision desk\u201d in Washington, headed by the Washington bureau chief, has the final signoff on all top-of-the-ticket calls. Most of the television networks rely on Edison Research for exit polls and election projections, which uses exit polling to help project results. Pete Buttigieg is now addressing his supporters, after a disappointing showing in Nevada \u2013 the first state with a diverse electorate. Buttigieg, who is currently in fourth place with 8.82% of the vote and 4% of precincts reporting, is attacking Sanders as supporting \u201can inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans\u201d. CNN just cut away from the speech, but according to prepared remarks provided by the campaign, Buttigieg will go on to accuse Sanders\u2019 campaign of having \u201cthe tenor of combat, division, and polarization, a vision where whoever wins the day, nothing will change the toxic tone of our politics\u201d. \u201cThat is the choice before us. We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory. We can either call people names online or we can call them into our movement. We can either tighten a narrow and hardcore base or open the tent to a new, broad, big-hearted American coalition.\u201d Sanders\u2019 projected win in Nevada means that he has won the popular vote in all three of the first three states. The Sanders campaign has declared victory in an email to supporters, writing: \u201cWe won the Nevada caucus, and we won BIG!\u201d Bernie Sanders is on track to win the Democratic caucuses in Nevada, the Associated Press has projected. With 3.91% of precincts reporting, Sanders had a lead of 54.14%. The expected result will cement Sanders\u2019 status as the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. Sanders also won the New Hampshire primary, and received the most popular support in Iowa, though Pete Buttigieg received the most delegates. Bernie Sanders is scheduled to appear at a rally in San Antonio at the top of the hour. We\u2019ll see if he has anything to say about his strong showing in Nevada so far... Both ABC News and NBC News are projecting that Bernie Sanders will win the Democratic primary in Nevada. Official results are trickling in very slowly, with anecdotal reports that some precinct leaders struggled to get through to the party\u2019s hotline by phone. Joe Biden: \u201cI ain\u2019t a socialist, I ain\u2019t a plutocrat, I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d Former vice-president Joe Biden is speaking to supporters in Las Vegas. \u201cYou all did it for me,\u201d Biden told supporters. \u201cWe\u2019re going on to South Carolina.\u201d In his remarks, Biden is especially focused on giving shoutouts to union members, and suggesting that these results represent a comeback. \u201cWe\u2019re coming back and we\u2019re going to win,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win in South Carolina, and then Super Tuesday.\u201d Results are still trickling in, but Biden\u2019s campaign manager is projecting a \u201cstrong second\u201d place finish. My colleague at the Guardian Australia, Naaman Zhou, has a great read on Australians who are volunteering in the US Democratic primary. \u201cHaving this accent and being Australian, I thought would be a big barrier, but it\u2019s a really nice conversation starter,\u201d one Aussie told him. \u201cThe issue on most people\u2019s minds is healthcare and coming from a country where \u2013 it is not perfect \u2013 but our healthcare system is just far and away better that what America has, makes it a very good comparison, and easy way into it.\u201d Donald Trump has weighed in on the Nevada caucuses, using his signature invective to go after both Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg. Speaking in Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar told supporters her campaign had \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d in Nevada. \u201cWe will floor the country,\u201d she said. With only 3% of precincts reporting, Klobuchar is in a distant sixth place, with just 1.6% of the vote. A Nevada Democratic Party spokesperson has told a reporter for NPR that results are still expected \u201cby the end of the day\u201d. NBC News\u2019s Steve Kornacki points out that these early results from the state party are not representative of the state, where the vast majority of caucus-goers are concentrated in Clark County. The Nevada Democratic party has finally begun releasing official results, and Bernie Sanders has an early lead. With 28 precincts reporting, Sanders had racked up 22 county delegates. Elizabeth Warren was in second place, with 14, followed by Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg with 13 apiece. The results of the Nevada caucuses are trickling in. Some delays to the results were expected, as this was the first year that Nevada allowed early voting, which complicated the calculations that precinct leaders are required to make. However, there have also been some reports of precinct leaders struggling to report their tallies to the state Democratic party by phone. One precinct leader in Henderson, Nevada got a busy signal for \u201cabout an hour\u201d as she attempted to phone in her results, the Washington Post reported. The state party has yet to release any official results. One source \u201cclose to the party\u201d told the Washington Post that the process was \u201crunning smoothly overall\u201d and that official results are expected soon. With 3% of precincts reporting, Senator Bernie Sanders has an early lead in the Nevada Democratic caucuses, with more than 50% of these first results. Former vice-president Joe Biden was a distant second, at about 18%, followed by Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Tom Steyer. Here is some more detail on how Democratic primary voters and caucus-goers view one of the key issues in the race: Medicare for All, based on NBC News entrance polls. Bloomberg\u2019s billions Meanwhile, Mike Bloomberg \u2013 who isn\u2019t on the ballot in Nevada, having entered the race late and opting to skip the early voting states, instead focusing on the more than a dozen states that will vote on Super Tuesday (3 March) \u2013 has been taking over Americans\u2019 Facebook feeds. In the first six weeks of 2020, more than 1.6bn of the 2.4bn presidential campaign ads shown to US Facebook users were from the Bloomberg campaign, a new analysis shows. Since launching his campaign in mid-November, the former New York mayor has spent nearly $45m on Facebook ads \u2013 more than all his opponents combined. Bloomberg\u2019s spending doesn\u2019t just dwarf that of other Democrats; Donald Trump\u2019s giant re-election effort on Facebook looks paltry in comparison. The Bloomberg campaign has run three times as many ads as Trump. Read more here. Official results are slowly trickling in. If you want to track every one, head on over to our live tracker. Trump rallies in Las Vegas The Democrats weren\u2019t the only ones trying to gather support in Nevada. Donald Trump arrived in Vegas on Thursday and held a rally on Friday afternoon. Trump has been counter-programming the early contests in the Democratic presidential primary by holding rallies in the same states that are voting. In New Hampshire, he held a rally to rattle Democrats on the eve of the vote, and he unleashed an army of surrogates on Iowa ahead of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. The Republican party has voted this year to cancel its Republican caucus, in order to clear the path for Trump\u2019s re-election. Caucuses disenfranchise many people, as my colleague Sam Levine reported ahead of the Iowa caucuses. Here\u2019s another voice against caucuses. How it went down at one caucus site in Reno ... There was a fair amount of confusion at the University of Nevada, Reno, about how the precincts incorporate early votes with the in-person ones. At the precinct I\u2019ve been watching, Sanders got an overwhelming number of votes, and everybody else tried to calculate if there was anything they could do to make their non-Sanders vote count. \u201cWe could all go to Yang!\u201d one of the Buttigieg supporters said, referring to Andrew Yang, who recently suspended his campaign. Ultimately, the Warren and Buttigieg fans couldn\u2019t find a way to come together and add their votes with the early ones to make anyone else viable. Sanders received all nine delegates. The Associated Press has put together some helpful information about how the results will be determined today. Crucially, this is the first time that Nevada has allowed early voting, a factor that will substantially increase participation in the primary, but also make calculating the results more complicated. In 2016, 84,000 Democrats participated in the caucuses. About 75,000 participated in early voting before today. Per the AP: What results will Democrats release out of the caucus? There will be three sets of results: Tallies of the \u201cfirst alignment\u201d of caucus-goers; The caucus-goers\u2019 \u201cfinal alignment\u201d; The total number of delegates to county conventions won by candidates. The first and final alignment results aren\u2019t new, but this is the first time the party has made them public. Could Nevada experience the same problems that occurred in Iowa? In Iowa, the inability of some caucus organizers to download the app on their phones, or to use it successfully, triggered a flood of calls to the party\u2019s hotline and dramatically slowed the process of reporting results. And a coding issue within the mobile app muddied the data that was sent in, creating discrepancies that halted the reporting of initial results for nearly 24 hours. In Nevada, caucus organizers will not need to download anything, but they will be asked to work on an iPad and navigate a Google form designed to integrate early voters into the in-person caucus process and calculate results. The Google app and iPads are trusted commercial tech tools, but election experts have warned that deploying any technology late in the process, like Nevada did, increases the risk of problems. Paper records of the early vote will be available if needed. Volunteers say that hands-on training with the iPads and the Google form wasn\u2019t even available until late Tuesday, giving little time for people, particularly those who are not tech-savvy, to practice. Could results be delayed? It\u2019s possible. Party officials have said they will be guided by accuracy over speed. Factors that include the integration of early votes into the process and potentially high turnout, could affect the tabulation and timing of results. Early voting is a complicated step that Iowa did not attempt, and there\u2019s been some uncertainty about how early voters would be included in later stages of the caucus process. If everything goes smoothly with the iPads and the Google forms, this part of the process could go quickly. But if volunteers are left to rely on complex instructions and doing math by hand, it could slow everything down. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin has been attending a caucus at the University of Nevada, Reno, where Bernie Sanders will win every single delegate. Down the hall, at another University of Nevada, Reno, caucus site, Amy Klobuchar has achieved viability, though she\u2019s still second to Sanders. Here\u2019s another interesting data point on the debate over Medicare-for-all, from the Washington Post. A strong majority of caucus-goers are apparently unattached to their current health care plans... One Culinary union member\u2019s views on Sanders ... Monica Smith, 54, who works for in-room dining at the Bellagio, was a precinct captain for Bernie Sanders. She\u2019s also a member of the Culinary Union, which didn\u2019t endorse a candidate but has criticized Sanders\u2019 health plan. \u201cThey\u2019re standing back, they\u2019re allowing the members to choose,\u201d she said. Regardless, \u201cwe\u2019re going Democrats for the White House,\u201d she added. Smith, who said she\u2019s talked to her friends, family and coworkers about Sanders, said it helps that her candidate has \u201cspent a lot of time here in Nevada.\u201d And his campaign has consistently reached out to the Latino community, she said. \u201cI believe that he\u2019s with me and with my Latino brothers and sisters.\u201d In Iowa, ties were decided by flipping a coin. In Nevada, they draw cards. After the Iowa meltdown, will the Nevada caucuses go smoothly? My colleague and tech reporter Kari Paul writes \u2026 Democratic party officials in Nevada have been scrambling to avoid the fate of Iowa, where technological and organizational failure left the first caucus in the 2020 presidential race without a clear winner. Nevada Democratic party officials had initially planned to rely on the same app. Democrats once again changed plans for how votes would be tracked in the caucuses on the day before voters cast their ballots. After announcing results would be relayed online via Google form last week, Democrats decided instead to instruct precinct leaders to call and text votes in to a dedicated hotline, the New York Times reported on Friday. The change was announced through a memo sent by Alana Mounce, the state party\u2019s executive director, to the presidential campaigns. \u201cThe hotline report will be the primary source of the precinct caucus results reported on Caucus Day,\u201d Mounce wrote. The email made no mention of the Google document forms initially slated to be used. Nevada, like Iowa, adopted new rules from the Democratic National Committee this year requiring states to report three sets of numbers from the caucuses: the initial vote number, the number of votes a candidate receives after \u201crealignment\u201d \u2013 when voters choose new candidates if their top choice fails to receive enough support \u2013 and the number of state delegates ultimately awarded to candidates. At one caucus site at the University of Nevada, Reno, Bernie Sanders will take every state delegate, my colleague Sam Levin reports. The scene from the Bellagio on the Las Vegas Strip Beneath the chandeliers at the ballroom in the Bellagio hotel on the Las Vegas strip, more than 100 caucus-goers were grouped on either side of the room. Many of them were in uniform; they stepped away from their work cleaners, valets and servers to caucus. Sanders had the strongest support here; with an enthusiastic group of 76 backing the Vermont senator. Chants of \u201cBernie, Bernie, Bernie,\u201d broke out once everyone realized Sanders would get the most delegates. The other big group here is for Biden, who had 45 supporters backing him. Biden will be allocated state 19 delegates, and Sanders 38. Many of the voters here are members of the Culinary Union, which criticized Sanders\u2019 healthcare plan. Although many of the voters here are members of the Culinary Union, which has criticized Sanders\u2019 healthcare plan, he\u2019s a top choice. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same corner,\u201d said Laura Gonzales Torres, 46, who works as a guest room attendant. \u201cEven if we support different candidates.\u201d Almost everyone here is a coworker. She chose for Sanders because \u201cmy 16 year old said, \u2018Mom make sure you vote for Bernie.\u2019\u201d Another data point on Culinary members, from veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston. The Nevada caucus has placed a huge amount of scrutiny on the Culinary Union, which represents about 60,000 casino workers in the state. One point of interest today will be whether the membership of the union shares the leadership\u2019s concerns about Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all proposal. At one Culinary-heavy caucus site, the Bellagio casino on the Las Vegas strip, it doesn\u2019t appear that way ... Of course, this is only one caucus site, but it\u2019s one of the most popular for the press today. The scene in Sparks and Reno At Sparks high school outside Reno, a group of Sanders supporters were the first to arrive hours before the caucus, encouraging voters to back the Vermont senator as they lined up. Essie Richard, a 73-year-old resident, was not swayed. \u201cI\u2019m Biden all the way. He was vice president for eight years. He has the experience,\u201d said Richard, adding that protecting social security and Medicare was the most important issue to her: \u201cI\u2019m barely surviving.\u201d Naomi Zamarripa, 18-year-old high school senior, also arrive early and said she was excited to cast her first vote for Sanders: \u201cI love his commitment. He\u2019s been around for so long, he keeps fighting and stays true to his beliefs.\u201d A few miles away at the University of Nevada, Reno, voters waited in a long line to get inside a lecture hall. Many Sanders and Warren supporters in line carried signs, some engaging in lively debates and trying to convince each other to change their minds at the last minute. Sam Difulvio, a 19-year-old student, said she was still torn between the two progressive candidates minutes before the process started. \u201cI\u2019m trying to hone in on their character and see who I like as a person. I want to hear what normal people have to say about the candidates.\u201d Cat Dow, 29, said she was excited that this was an election with two candidates she actually liked \u2014 Sanders and Warren. \u201cElizabeth\u2019s debate really shook me. I love her, she kicked ass, everything she said was so salient and so relevant and she was so tough.\u201d But Dow, who works in computer technology, said she was sticking with Sanders, adding, \u201cI want the national embarrassment out of office more than anything else.\u201d As the caucuses get underway, social media streams are starting to fill with \u201cfirst alignment\u201d results from individual caucus sites. But what about the actual, official results? Tom Perez, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, told reporters today that results will be released as soon as possible, but that the priority is, \u201cfirst and foremost, to get it right,\u201d according to the AP. One delaying factor may be the popularity of early voting. Perez said party officials have been working overtime to process those votes. Some more tidbits from the NBC entrance poll show Sanders\u2019 extraordinary support among younger voters. Perhaps surprisingly, however, it also shows that the democratic socialist is leading among self-described moderates or conservatives. Bernie Sanders has a strong lead among early voters, according to an NBC News \u201centrance poll\u201d. The poll shows Sanders\u2019 particular strength among Latino voters, where he polled majority support despite the broad field. Nevada is the most diverse state to participate in the primary process so far. Neither Iowa nor New Hampshire are particularly representative of the overall electorate, or the Democratic party base. The caucuses have begun across Nevada, the third state to participate in the Democratic presidential primary process \u2013 and the first in the west. My colleague Sam Levin is in Reno, where caucus-goers are happy to learn from Iowa\u2019s troubles... Angelica Romero, 54, is a first-time voter. \u201cI lived for many years without papers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I gained citizenship last year. It\u2019s a privilege that we have and so I feel we must participate.\u201d Going into her first caucus, \u201cI feel very important,\u201d she said with a chuckle. Romero is caucusing for Bernie Sanders today. \u201cI am convinced - 100% that we will win,\u201d she said. \u201cThe morals of Bernie are the same as those of my family and myself.\u201d She likes Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan and his proposal for free college education. \u201cI have two children in college, so that\u2019s important to me,\u201d she said. Romero, who works as a guest room attendant on the Las Vegas strip is also a member of the local Culinary Union, which has criticized Sanders\u2019 healthcare plan. \u201cI trust my union a lot and I am very grateful to my union,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I must put my hand on my heart and vote.\u201d Warren reports fundraising win Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday morning she had raised more than $14 million in the past ten days, double the goal the campaign had set ahead of the caucuses. Warren supporters are hoping for a big day in Nevada, after the Massachusetts senator put down her best debate performance of the election cycle on Wednesday evening. \u201cI\u2019ve watched all the debates,\u201d Consuelo Emerson, 57, told Maanvi Singh at an event in Las Vegas on Thursday morning. Emerson, a painter, showed up to the event with \u201cWarren\u2019s twin\u201d \u2013 a life-sized cardboard cutout that the senator signed before posing for a selfie with the duo. \u201cI feel very confident, and also I know she\u2019s going to be the best president,\u201d he said. Read more here. The issues driving Nevada caucus voters On Thursday, Sam Levin spoke to dozens of Democratic voters about the issues motivating their decisions. Across the state, voters agreed that making Trump a one-term president was a priority \u2013 and that the daily struggles of many Nevada residents looked very different from those of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. From Las Vegas in the south to Reno in the north, voters said that the race felt highly personal and urgent. They mentioned the suffering caused by Trump\u2019s deportation machine, the imminent threats of the climate crisis, the fights for labor protections and better jobs for low-wage workers, the protection of public lands and more. What to expect today Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s liveblog as voters in Nevada cast their vote in America\u2019s \u201cfirst-in-the-west\u201d and third contest of the 2020 election. My colleagues Maanvi Singh and Sam Levin are in Las Vegas and Reno speaking with voters as they head to the caucuses. Here\u2019s what they have to say about the day ahead ... Saturday\u2019s caucuses could be a make-or-break moment for several Democratic contenders and are the first in a state with a diverse electorate that more closely resembles the demographics of the US and the Democratic party. Nevada is nearly 30% Latino and 10% black and has a rapidly growing Asian American population. Polls have shown Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with a significant lead after he cemented his frontrunner status in Iowa and New Hampshire. The first two states, which are 90% white, also delivered strong results for former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg, but polling has shown the more moderate candidate struggling with black and Latino voters. The Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, the other midwestern candidate vying for moderates, has also polled poorly with voters of color and has recently faced tough questions about her record as a prosecutor. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren had disappointing results in the first two states, but a standout debate night in Las Vegas this week has re-energized her campaign. Joe Biden\u2019s poll numbers have continued to drop since his weak performance in the previous two contests, and another disappointing finish could jeopardize his bid for the presidency. The billionaire former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had an embarrassing first debate performance this week, is not on the ballot in Nevada due to his late entrance into the race. Unlike private votes in traditional primaries, the caucuses have voters gather in groups based on their top-choice candidates, giving them an opportunity to switch to a second choice if their first pick doesn\u2019t gather enough support to be considered \u201cviable\u201d in that precinct. It\u2019s also the first time the state has offered early voting opportunities, and nearly 75,000 residents have already cast their decision. A majority were first-time caucus-goers, according to Democratic party officials.",

Morten Harket\u2019s voice remains transcendent at times, bell-like with a crispness and clarity of expression that soars, while Mags Furuholmen on keyboards appears to be the orchestrator and time-keeper, conducting the band and the crowd with precision.

      "bodyText": "The Norwegian band a-ha first toured Australia in 1986, appearing to adoring teenage fans on Countdown. As with international acts such as ABBA and Madonna heralded by the show\u2019s host, Molly Meldrum, Australian music-lovers were quick on the uptake with the new, and a-ha performed some of their first concerts in Australia. Their debut album Hunting High and Low, released in 1985, was a smash hit globally and its first song, Take on Me, one of the defining and most loved songs of the 1980s. Notable for its cutting edge video at the time that mixed live action with animation, the clip has reached the rare status of scoring one billion views on YouTube. So it\u2019s with a heightened degree of anticipation that a-ha have returned to Australia to do their first gig in the country in over 30 years \u2013 despite releasing 10 albums and touring extensively overseas \u2013 with a 35th anniversary tour of their Hunting High and Low album. At the Day on the Green concert at Rochford Winery, Yarra Valley, the audience forgets that the first track on the album, the one to open the show, is Take on Me and as the opening bars blast, there\u2019s a scurry of screams, hormonal release and getting the phones out as the green lasered light \u2013 go! \u2013 reveals the band on stage. Rather than the usual anticipation of a massive hit \u2013 will it be an encore? \u2013 it\u2019s all too soon passed by after a frenzy of middle-aged bopping. There\u2019s always a risk with playing an album in track order but for a-ha it\u2019s riskier than most; most of their hit songs are over before the album is halfway through. As the band hits the stage, tracking time since the 80s, the audience is curious to see how they\u2019ve turned out. As with the Countdown clip, they are all in black leather jackets and jeans, though not so high-waisted. Morten Harket\u2019s voice remains transcendent at times, bell-like with a crispness and clarity of expression that soars, while Mags Furuholmen on keyboards appears to be the orchestrator and time-keeper, conducting the band and the crowd with precision. Guitarist P\u00e5l Waaktaar-Savoy seems to blend into the background. The sun may always shine on TV but tonight it\u2019s the bitter chill of a Scandinavian winter. The musicians are serious, not overplaying for the fun of an 80s revved-up crowd, and while the music is technically precise, the three on stage are as far removed as possible from each other on stage, hard to frame together in a photo. They rarely engage with each other, little islands adrift, and Morten in particular lacks the shy smile and the lingering looks from Countdown that got all those hearts pounding years ago. Now in a heavy hooded woollen jumper, brooding, at one point he runs off stage and returns with his glasses on; perhaps he simply can\u2019t see them. What lingers through the songs is a sense of melancholy. As Morten sings, \u201cHere I stand and face the rain. I know that nothing\u2019s gonna be the same again,\u201d songs become, decades later, no longer poppy and upbeat. The highlights are where the songs slow down, Hunting High and Low with acoustic guitar and moody lighting, the only point where Morten reaches out to engage with the crowd and encourage a sing-along. The support acts, in contrast, relish in the joy of performing their hits to a well-oiled crowd.

During a-ha\u2019s performance, Mags asks the crowd: \u201cHands up who remembers the 80s?\u201d and politely thanks them for inviting the band back. His question is answered on the bus returning to Melbourne, a tipsy gang of women singing their way home, their raucous and off-key rendition of Take On Me rolling up the seats like a Mexican Wave before collapsing into laughter.

There are, however, endless numbers of delusional candidates and campaigns who insist that they will sweep the later states, or take their delegates to the convention, or contest the legitimacy of the nomination process. This was the position of one Bernie Sanders four years ago, not to mention his die-hard fans. Today, after his resounding win in Nevada on Saturday, America\u2019s favorite socialist can look forward to trashing the arguments of the also-rans, just like the Clinton campaign trashed his protracted case of the race in 2016. Because there are no second prizes for Joe Biden, even if he pulls off a win in South Carolina, where the next primary takes place next Saturday. And there are no second prizes for Mike Bloomberg, even if he performs respectably on Super Tuesday, just three days later. And for Warren and Buttigieg, beating expectations is not the same as beating the opposition. Nevada is the breakthrough moment for Bernie, after squeaking out a win in New Hampshire, and squeaking out something like a tie in whatever happened in Iowa. You can easily dismiss Nevada\u2019s bizarre connection to reality in the tourist version of Las Vegas. You can happily downplay the small number of caucus voters, or the weirdness of the caucus process itself. But Nevada shares some similarities with two key neighboring states: California and Arizona. Unlike the early voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, California\u2019s Democrats are not obsessed with politics. They are what the consultants call low-information voters: they have day jobs, like the union workers in Las Vegas. But those union voters defied their bosses, at least among the Culinary Union, and voted heavily for Sanders at the caucus sites in the big hotel-casinos. So Sanders\u2019 poll lead in California \u2013 somewhere between 8 and 18 points in recent polls \u2013 looks big enough to give him a delegate advantage that nobody will overturn after early March. In Texas, the other big Super Tuesday state, Biden was leading as recently as a month ago, but recent polls suggest a narrow Sanders lead. Texas is unlikely to help the rest of the pack catch up to Bernie. This leads us to the first and last argument that Sanders faces, which is the single most important factor for Democratic voters in every poll in this cycle: who is best placed to beat Donald Trump? The remainder of this primary contest will revolve around a never-ending, unresolvable discussion about Bernie\u2019s prospects against Trumpian and Russian disinformation, targeted most obviously at the massive government spending he proposes.

The street was closed between Edward Street and Albert Street from 10am on Sunday, and motorists and pedestrians have been advised to avoid the area. Queensland police said the man had allegedly stabbed another man on Mary Street about 10am. Chief Supt Tony Fleming said the man approached a couple outside the hotel, and \u201cand it escalated from there\u201d. He said the victims said the man was behaving strangely, and pulled a knife out of a bag. The woman fled back to the hotel, but the man she was with was stabbed. Fleming said the pair were not from Australia, and didn\u2019t know the man. \u201c[The man and woman] were visitors to the city.\u201d When police arrived on the scene, he was shot when he allegedly ran at the officers, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Fleming said a 26-year-old man was taken to hospital but was discharged soon after with a broken nose, an injured lip and a cut to his back. A guest of the Westin hotel told AAP she heard several gunshots, but thought they were fireworks. \u201cI came outside and I saw someone lying on the ground and (police) were performing CPR,\u201d she said. The incident will be investigated by the ethical standards command in Queensland police on behalf of the Queensland coroner, with oversight from the Crime and Corruption Commission. Police will be relying on CCTV footage, they have identified the car of the man and they have said the motivation for the attack is not known, but he was known to the police. The man shot dead was born in 1995, and was born in Australia, but Fleming declined to provide more information until his family had been notified. Several crime scenes in the area have been established, and police have asked for anyone with information to come forward.",

      "bodyText": "January and February are usually the busiest time of year for longtime Torres Strait fisherman Boggo Billy. Ordinarily, just before dawn or dusk, he would navigate out in a dinghy from his home on Warraber, a 37-hectare island between the top of Cape York and the southern coast of Papua New Guinea, which is home to around 250 people. The reefs around the island teem with life: b\u00eache-de-mer (sea cucumbers), dugongs, crabs and tropical rock lobsters that are usually worth around $70 a kilogram from middlemen supplying fish markets in China. Billy\u2019s local knowledge, inherited from generations before him, means he knows when \u201cthe good tides\u201d will roll in and what they mean for the crustaceans, which leaves him perfectly poised to capitalise on the boom brought on by lunar new year. But this year the boom was a bust. Live crayfish prices plummeted after the outbreak of coronavirus in December. China cancelled many lunar new year celebrations and banned the import of live seafood. On the Torres Strait, rock lobsters are the region\u2019s second-most valuable fishery and a vital source of income for people in small island communities. Now, Billy says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to try and get many more crayfish to make $1,000\u201d. Rather than increasing the size of their catch, which could cause problems in the heavily regulated industry, most fishermen have chosen to stay ashore. \u201cMost of the fishermen have stopped going out now, because it seems like you can\u2019t make any money because of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. James Billy, another Warraber fisherman and a distant relation of Boggo Billy, sells his own catch plus fish he buys from other islanders to a Chinese buyer with a factory in Cairns. James Billy says prices for live crayfish have plummeted to $25 per kilogram, which means that after spending on fuel and equipment, it\u2019s difficult to turn a profit. As well as freediving in the shallower waters, James Billy also hookah dives. The method uses surface-supplied air to keep fishermen in deeper water for longer and is preferred by traditional fishers who hold traditional inhabitant business licenses. A day of hookah diving for lobster, James estimates, would mean a catch of 40kg to 50kg of crayfish and a profit of around $2,000 dollars in a strong market. For those who just freedive, the timing of the virus is especially bad because January and February are the months when the crayfish are most bountiful in shallow waters. \u201cThis is usually a time to load up and sell lots of crayfish,\u201d James Billy says. Boggo and James Billy both have day jobs which mean they can support their families despite the crash. But they say the huge loss of income from fisheries, and the uncertainty about when the market might return are a major cause of stress for the community. The situation isn\u2019t helped by the already inflated prices families have to pay for food on Warraber. \u201cWe\u2019re really worried. We\u2019ve got families to support, kids down mainland for school,\u201d Billy says. \u201cWe\u2019ll cross our fingers.\u201d Industry administrators and fishermen met to consider changes to the sea cucumber fishery as possible stop-gap measures, including lifting restrictions on other fisheries and allowable restrictions. James Billy says some fishermen on Warraber, and its sister island, Poruma, have already transitioned to catching lollyfish, a variety of sea cucumber that is abundant around both islands. He says it sells for about $10 per kilogram, a low price, but one that has still helped some locals to \u201ckeep their heads above water\u201d. But the fact sea cucumbers are easy to catch makes them particularly prone to overfishing. That means regulations can only be loosened to a point to help those who are struggling \u2013 a free-for-all isn\u2019t possible because it would jeopardise the long-term sustainability of different sea cucumber species. The latest shock to the local industry comes on the back of other hits as the impacts of global heating begin to be felt acutely in these waters. \u201cIn 2017, we had that [coral] bleaching. It affected not so much the price, but the crayfish. We, across the Torres Strait, we were all catching little crayfish,\u201d James Billy says. \u201cIt was warm water from the surface like six metres down.\u201d James Billy says there were also problems with the health of the crayfish, with many dying after being caught. The latest crash, Boggo Billy says, is frustrating, but he\u2019s got his fingers crossed that the market will be \u201cback on\u201d soon, so \u201ceverybody will be smiling again\u201d.",

Albanese agreed that Australia should introduce a cap on political donations at the federal level, arguing that such a measure is \u201ccommon sense\u201d because \u201cdemocracy shouldn\u2019t be for sale\u201d. \u201cMy state of New South Wales has a cap on expenditure and has real-time disclosure rules,\u201d he said. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened at the federal level.\u201d The 2019 election saw political donation records tumble, with $4.1m donated by philanthropist Isaac Wakil to the Liberal Party, second only to Mineralogy\u2019s $83m donation to the United Australia Party. The Mineralogy donation has sparked calls for caps on both donations and spending, as the UAP flooded airwaves with negative ads that Palmer said he had commissioned to polarise the electorate against Labor\u2019s Bill Shorten. On Sunday, Albanese said that people should be able to donate and \u201cparticipate in our democracy\u201d. \u201cBut what they shouldn\u2019t be able to do is to spend an obscene amount of money, which is what we saw in order to change a political [outcome],\u201d he said. Albanese agreed that caps would \u201cneed to apply to everyone\u201d, but noted that unions and businesses did not spend $83m \u2013 as Palmer\u2019s company Mineralogy did before the 2019 election \u2013 which he labelled an \u201cextraordinary abuse\u201d. \u201cBut what we need is transparency. So we need real-time donation reforms and disclosure.\u201d Albanese defended Labor\u2019s target of net zero emissions by 2050, arguing that failing to mitigate climate change would cause a 25% contraction in the global economy, worse than the Great Depression. He confirmed the target would apply to all sectors of the economy, including agriculture and transport, but noted that forestry and other measures could help achieve net zero despite emissions not being eliminated in all sectors.

He noted that when Labor adopted a target of a 45% reduction in 2015, it was a 15-year target. Asked if Labor was open to introducing a carbon price to achieve its 2050 target, Albanese said he did not believe it was necessary. \u201cWe will establish [our policy] well before the election, but we didn\u2019t go to the last election with a price on carbon. \u201cWhat we\u2019re open to is plans like the national energy guarantee,\u201d he said, explaining that Labor \u201cwould have supported\u201d the emissions reduction obligation in the electricity sector proposed by Malcolm Turnbull but dumped in the dying days of his prime ministership.

He concluded the volley: \u201cLast tweet this morning: a policy which opposes net zero by 2050 is a policy of 3 degrees plus global warming and an uninhabitable planet.\u201d Scott Morrison is currently torn between Liberal moderates calling for adoption of a net zero target on the one hand and Nationals and conservative Liberals who want taxpayer support for coal power stations on the other.

Albanese said he did not think a new coal-fired power station will be built in Australia, because \u201cthe market is determining\u201d that question while Morrison \u201cpretends that the world won\u2019t change\u201d. \u201cHe pretends, for example \u2026 his government is looking at a new coal-fired power station in Collinsville, but he knows that that is nonsense. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019ve had to give $4 million [for a feasibility study] to the proponents of that project.\u201d Albanese predicted Australia would still export coal in 2050, citing metallurgical coal, and said it could even still be exporting thermal coal. Albanese also accused the Coalition of a \u201cnuclear level of rorting\u201d through its $3bn congestion busting fund, which Labor has referred to the auditor-general. He said the government had committed funding for projects in the 2019 budget, then 83% of money went to target seats or those held by the Liberals and Nationals. Asked about the killing of Hannah Clarke and her three children by her estranged husband and the children\u2019s father, Rowan Baxter, Albanese said domestic violence must be called out and this incident was \u201ca terrible murder and a scourge on our society\u201d. Albanese renewed calls for a national summit on domestic violence, and criticised the government for plans to abolish the family court.",
