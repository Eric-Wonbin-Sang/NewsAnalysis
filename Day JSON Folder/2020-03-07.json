      "bodyText": "A nursing home in Washington state that is at the center of the US coronavirus outbreak on Saturday reported an increased death total for people associated with their facility and said it has only just now received enough kits to test all residents for the virus. During the Life Care Center\u2019s first official press conference since the outbreak began, Tim Killian, the public information liaison for the facility, said that since 19 February, 13 people associated with the center have been diagnosed with coronavirus and died. The center, which is located in Kirkland, Washington, on the outskirts of Seattle, is an acute care facility and typically sees three to seven deaths each month, he noted. Killian said there are still 63 residents at the center, and they are confined to their rooms. There were 120 residents just two weeks ago. As of Saturday, Washington state health officials reported 102 cases of the virus, with 16 deaths in the state. Killian also reported that 70 of their 180 employees have shown symptoms of coronavirus and are not coming in to work. He said at the conference that the facility had received only 45 kits for in-house testing, but in a statement later on Saturday the center said it had been given an additional batch and was in the process of testing all remaining residents. When asked why the facility did not ask for help sooner, Killian said they\u2019ve been asking the local and federal government for \u201chelp every five minutes of every day since this became apparent here within the facility\u201d. Washington state\u2019s health department said a request was made to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 28 February for resources to help with an epidemiological investigation, infection control support and communications. Since then, the department said, 18 CDC employees have arrived, and they along with Seattle &amp; King County Public Health have been providing technical assistance to the center\u2019s staff. The department said it has also provided the facility with an infection control expert, and there is a team of clinicians on site from the US health and human services department. Calling the virus \u201cvolatile\u201d and \u201cunpredictable\u201d, Killian said they\u2019ve seen patients who within an hour have gone from no symptoms to acute symptoms to having to be transferred to a hospital. \u201cWe have seen some results that have frankly concerned us with how quickly symptoms have shown, become acute and led to, even, death in some cases within our residents,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Beth England has had to be patient at Chelsea, having fought back from a loan spell at Liverpool, where she doubted she would make it, to be leading the line for the treble-chasing London team. Until now, she has been made to wait by Phil Neville.</p> <p>The \u201cEngland for England\u201d chants may have died down since the forward made her senior debut off the bench in the team\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/belgium-england-women-football-friendly-match-report\" title=\"\">3-3 draw with Belgium</a> last August, but the sparse use of the in-form player is sowing seeds of doubt about the manager\u2019s decision making. \u201cPhil picks the team,\u201d England said diplomatically before the Lionesses\u2019 defeat by the US in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/05/england-usa-shebelieves-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">SheBelieves Cup opener </a>on Thursday night, before she hinted that she did not expect to feature against the world champions. \u201cThat\u2019s as much as I can say on that. I\u2019ve done all I can,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously I\u2019m very aware I played a game a few days ago and again, it\u2019s just about what\u2019s best for the team at the time and who\u2019s fresh and in the best possible position to warrant that start.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/06/lauren-hemp-gives-lionesses-hope-with-feisty-performance-against-usa\">Lauren Hemp gives Lionesses hope with feisty display in loss to USA | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England scored the two goals against Arsenal last weekend that earned Chelsea their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/chelsea-women-arsenal-womens-league-cup-final\" title=\"\">first Continental League Cup title</a> and there was a clamouring for her inclusion in Neville\u2019s starting XI against the US. England is the joint top scorer, with Arsenal\u2019s Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema, in the Women\u2019s Super League and there is a dogged resilience and fight about the player who has been made to wait. She embodies the ruthlessness Neville (below) has said his squad is sorely missing. However, the manager defended his decision to stick with Manchester City\u2019s Ellen White up top, saying: \u201cI think it was a big ask tonight to start Beth in a game of this magnitude, especially when we were blooding other youngsters as well. Like I say, she will get plenty of opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Neville took risks. He gave Manchester City\u2019s winger Lauren Hemp, 19, a first senior start against the world champions and fielded Arsenal\u2019s 22-year-old Leah Williamson, who, like England, played the full 93 minutes of the League Cup final, in a less familiar right-back berth. He also pitted City\u2019s Georgia Stanway, 21, against the defensive midfielder Julie Ertz, whom Neville described as the only player he would take from the USA team if he could.</p> <p>In that context, the inclusion of the 25-year-old England, who is flying this season and quickly disposed of any concerns that her position would be in doubt with the arrival of Australian superstar Sam Kerr at Chelsea, seems far from \u201ca big ask\u201d.</p> <p>England has 14 league goals to White\u2019s six this term, with the latter having missed the start of the season through injury. White, winner of the bronze boot at the World Cup, is a fine physical and technically astute forward but she does not look back to her clinical best yet.</p> <p>As he prepared for Sunday\u2019s second SheBelieves Cup game against Japan in New Jersey, in which the manager says England will start, Neville was dismissive when asked why his players perform so well and slickly domestically but struggle internationally. \u201cYou cannot compare any game here with any game they play in the WSL,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s two steps higher in terms of the quality, the intensity, the crowd and the occasion.\u201d</p> <p>Yet England have not just struggled against top-level competition. The defeat to the US means the Lionesses have lost six in their last nine games. The statistic is worse if you dig deeper, with a scrappy late goal salvaging a win against Portugal and a laboured 3-2 victory in the snow against the part-time players of the Czech Republic included. Other teams that have suffered World Cup hangovers, such as France and the Netherlands, have still been able to progress while England have stood still at best.</p> <p>There are many reason why Neville should, despite the results, still be given time. The team is in transition and phasing out an old guard that have lifted the game to its present peak will be emotionally tough.

      "bodyText": "Beth England has had to be patient at Chelsea, having fought back from a loan spell at Liverpool, where she doubted she would make it, to be leading the line for the treble-chasing London team. Until now, she has been made to wait by Phil Neville. The \u201cEngland for England\u201d chants may have died down since the forward made her senior debut off the bench in the team\u2019s 3-3 draw with Belgium last August, but the sparse use of the in-form player is sowing seeds of doubt about the manager\u2019s decision making. \u201cPhil picks the team,\u201d England said diplomatically before the Lionesses\u2019 defeat by the US in their SheBelieves Cup opener on Thursday night, before she hinted that she did not expect to feature against the world champions. \u201cThat\u2019s as much as I can say on that. I\u2019ve done all I can,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously I\u2019m very aware I played a game a few days ago and again, it\u2019s just about what\u2019s best for the team at the time and who\u2019s fresh and in the best possible position to warrant that start.\u201d England scored the two goals against Arsenal last weekend that earned Chelsea their first Continental League Cup title and there was a clamouring for her inclusion in Neville\u2019s starting XI against the US. England is the joint top scorer, with Arsenal\u2019s Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema, in the Women\u2019s Super League and there is a dogged resilience and fight about the player who has been made to wait. She embodies the ruthlessness Neville (below) has said his squad is sorely missing. However, the manager defended his decision to stick with Manchester City\u2019s Ellen White up top, saying: \u201cI think it was a big ask tonight to start Beth in a game of this magnitude, especially when we were blooding other youngsters as well. Like I say, she will get plenty of opportunities.\u201d Neville took risks. He gave Manchester City\u2019s winger Lauren Hemp, 19, a first senior start against the world champions and fielded Arsenal\u2019s 22-year-old Leah Williamson, who, like England, played the full 93 minutes of the League Cup final, in a less familiar right-back berth. He also pitted City\u2019s Georgia Stanway, 21, against the defensive midfielder Julie Ertz, whom Neville described as the only player he would take from the USA team if he could. In that context, the inclusion of the 25-year-old England, who is flying this season and quickly disposed of any concerns that her position would be in doubt with the arrival of Australian superstar Sam Kerr at Chelsea, seems far from \u201ca big ask\u201d. England has 14 league goals to White\u2019s six this term, with the latter having missed the start of the season through injury. White, winner of the bronze boot at the World Cup, is a fine physical and technically astute forward but she does not look back to her clinical best yet. As he prepared for Sunday\u2019s second SheBelieves Cup game against Japan in New Jersey, in which the manager says England will start, Neville was dismissive when asked why his players perform so well and slickly domestically but struggle internationally. \u201cYou cannot compare any game here with any game they play in the WSL,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s two steps higher in terms of the quality, the intensity, the crowd and the occasion.\u201d Yet England have not just struggled against top-level competition. The defeat to the US means the Lionesses have lost six in their last nine games. The statistic is worse if you dig deeper, with a scrappy late goal salvaging a win against Portugal and a laboured 3-2 victory in the snow against the part-time players of the Czech Republic included. Other teams that have suffered World Cup hangovers, such as France and the Netherlands, have still been able to progress while England have stood still at best. There are many reason why Neville should, despite the results, still be given time. The team is in transition and phasing out an old guard that have lifted the game to its present peak will be emotionally tough. But there is an event baring down on the team that means there is a need for swifter progress; England have to be aiming to win their home Euros next year. However, the introduction of Toni Duggan, who has been doing well up front for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid but has struggled as a winger under Neville, in place of England, who has only one start in six appearances, against the US felt like a decision that defied logic and instead pointed to a manager who does not have the tactical nous to spearhead the delicate transition of the team. Lose to Japan or Spain and there will only be more questions to be asked.",

Ruth and Zac Jones, from Bristol, say they have had a brick thrown through their window and four vehicles set on fire, among a series of targeted attacks similar to those that preceded the death of Bijan Ebrahimi in 2013. The Joneses have logged more than 50 complaints with police over four years, but claim they are still targeted on their estate in the north of the city. Zac, 29, who has a rare skin condition that he says leads to him being bullied, says that neighbours make homemade signs falsely alleging he is a paedophile. Ebrahimi, 44, had reported death threats and racial abuse to police for seven years. He was murdered by Lee James, a neighbour, who wrongly claimed he was a paedophile. Days earlier, a mob had gathered outside Ebrahimi\u2019s council flat, chanting abuse, but police called to the scene arrested him instead as the mob cheered. A police officer and a community support officer were convicted of misconduct in a public office over their response. An independent review into Ebrahimi\u2019s death also concluded that Bristol city council and the Avon and Somerset police force were guilty of institutional racism in their dealings with him, the first judgment of its kind against a local authority. Now Zac and his mother Ruth, 57, who only has the use of one hand after a brain haemorrhage, believe they risk a similar fate. \u201cPolice have failed us \u2013 we will be the next Ebrahimi,\u201d Ruth told a BBC Inside Out West documentary, to be screened on Monday. One officer \u2013 since dismissed for sharing racist posts on Facebook \u2013 who was investigating the targeting of the Joneses believed that Ruth was the aggressor and not the victim, and had even smashed her own car windscreen. Police say they have been working with Ruth and Zac Jones, including putting them on a \u201cproblem solving plan\u201d.

The White House \u201cshould have been telling every hospital to be prepared to see these cases, knowing how to manage bed space in hospitals if this gets bad and preparing the public for the fact that we\u2019re going to be facing a pandemic rather than saying it\u2019s containable,\u201d Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security and an infectious-disease physician, told the Washington Post. \u201cThe idea of containment requires a lot of public health resources that can be better spent.\u201d The US capital, Washington DC, reported its first presumptive case on Saturday evening. In the Pacific north-west state of Washington, the main center of the outbreak and death toll so far in the United States, healthcare providers said medical supplies, including masks, are growing scarce, the Seattle Times reported. And in Washington DC, financial regulators made contingency plans for how to oversee financial markets as the coronavirus closes in on the capital. Officials said Friday that the first three cases of the pneumonia-like disease had been diagnosed in Montgomery county, Maryland, home to thousands of federal workers who commute to nearby Washington daily. Concerns about coronavirus led to the cancellation of major events, including South by Southwest, a tech, music and film conference that typically draws more than 400,000 people to Austin, Texas, in late March. Similarly, the forthcoming women\u2019s world hockey championships in Canada were canceled Saturday. In California, the San Francisco Symphony has cancelled performances at its symphony hall through 20 March. At least two universities on the west coast announced that they would temporarily hold classes online, rather than in person. The University of Washington, being at the center of the US spread so far, and Stanford University, in California, where the university announced that two undergraduate students were in self-isolation after possible exposure to coronavirus. At the University of California, Los Angeles, three students who were tested for Covid-19 have all tested negative, and the university is continuing to hold live classes on campus for the moment, the university\u2019s chancellor, Gene Block, said. Internationally there is disagreement among leading experts about whether the virus has reached pandemic status. California state authorities were working on Saturday evening with federal officials to bring the Grand Princess cruise ship to a non-commercial port and test the 3,500 people aboard. There was no immediate word on where the vessel will dock. Pence said at a meeting in Florida with cruise line executives that officials were still working on the plan. \u201cAll passengers and crew will be tested for the coronavirus and quarantined as necessary,\u201d he said. In Seattle, Washington, which has one of the largest populations of homeless people in the United States, local officials said they have designed a plan to help treat any members of the city\u2019s homeless population who might contract coronavirus.",

Gladbach struck back five minutes after the restart with a Lars Stindl tap-in but Dortmund hit back when Hakimi latched on to a Jadon Sancho through-ball, raced into the box and beat Yann Sommer.</p> <p>Earlier <strong>RB Leipzig</strong> played out a lacklustre 0-0 at <strong>Wolfsburg</strong> and have now dropped to third place following their second consecutive draw. Leipzig, who host Tottenham in the Champions League on Tuesday, hardly made an impact in the first half but tried their luck early in the second with shots from Yussuf Poulsen and Marcel Sabitzer. Wolfsburg hit back with two chances of their own, Max Arnold and Xaver Schlager both firing narrowly wide.</p> <p><strong>Bayer Leverkusen</strong> moved into the top four on 47 points with a dominant 4-0 victory over <strong>Eintracht Frankfurt</strong> featuring two goals from Paulinho.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lionel Messi kept his nerve from the penalty spot to give Barcelona a 1-0 win over Real Sociedad in La Liga to return his side to the top of the table. Bar\u00e7a\u2019s all-time top scorer calmly chipped the ball into the net in the 81st minute after the Sociedad defender Robin Le Normand had been penalised following a VAR review for hitting the ball with his arm as he contested a cross. The penalty was awarded at a time when Barcelona were struggling to cope with Sociedad\u2019s flowing counter-attacks, with the away side missing several chances to take the lead in a bold second-half display. Sociedad\u2019s frustration at conceding the penalty was heightened when their former player Antoine Griezmann appeared to push over the defender Nacho Monreal in the area but no foul was awarded. Barcelona looked to have scored a second goal deep in injury time when Jordi Alba slotted in a cross from the substitute Ansu Fati but another VAR review determined that the teenage forward had been narrowly offside when he received the ball from Messi. The victory took Barcelona back to the top of the standings on 58 points although Real Madrid, on 56, can restore their place at the league summit by beating Real Betis. Earlier in the day Atl\u00e9tico Madrid missed the chance to get back into the top four when they were held to an entertaining 2-2 draw with third-placed Sevilla following a frantic first half. Sevilla went ahead through Luuk de Jong but Atl\u00e9tico levelled with a penalty from \u00c1lvaro Morata after a VAR review determined that Diego Carlos had handled the ball. Atl\u00e9tico then took the lead with a heavily deflected shot from Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, only for Sevilla\u2019s Lucas Ocampos to level from the spot right before half-time, after another VAR review decided he had been fouled by Kieran Trippier. Diego Simeone\u2019s side went all out for a winner after the interval but were unable to get past the impressive keeper, Tomas Vaclik. The Japanese forward Takefusa Kubo scored as Mallorca defeated Eibar 2-1 for a first away win in the league this season. Kubo, on loan from Real Madrid, scored with a low shot from outside the area after Dani Rodr\u00edguez had opened the scoring for the visitors. Eibar\u2019s lone goal came from Pedro Bigas in injury time. In Germany Borussia Dortmund scored once in either half, through Thorgan Hazard and Achraf Hakimi, to edge past the hosts Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 2-1 and take over second place in the Bundesliga with their seventh win in their last eight league matches. Hazard gave the visitors the lead when he shook off three defenders, turned to create space and curled in with his left foot in the eighth minute. Gladbach struck back five minutes after the restart with a Lars Stindl tap-in but Dortmund hit back when Hakimi latched on to a Jadon Sancho through-ball, raced into the box and beat Yann Sommer. Earlier RB Leipzig played out a lacklustre 0-0 at Wolfsburg and have now dropped to third place following their second consecutive draw. Leipzig, who host Tottenham in the Champions League on Tuesday, hardly made an impact in the first half but tried their luck early in the second with shots from Yussuf Poulsen and Marcel Sabitzer. Wolfsburg hit back with two chances of their own, Max Arnold and Xaver Schlager both firing narrowly wide. Bayer Leverkusen moved into the top four on 47 points with a dominant 4-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt featuring two goals from Paulinho.",

Government thought that emergency business support would wait,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need it immediately, and it has to be in the budget next week.\u201d She suggested government introduce measures such as a three- to six-month business rate holiday and cut VAT to prompt demand.",

Prompting fresh questions over the prime minister\u2019s probity, the parliamentary commissioner for standards decided last week to pursue an official inquiry into Johnson amid unanswered questions over the identity of the donor who lent him a property on the island of Mustique over new year. It is the first time a serving prime minister has been investigated by the commissioner, who is responsible for regulating MPs\u2019 conduct and propriety. The development means that three high-level inquiries are under way into allegations surrounding Johnson\u2019s conduct, including his relationship with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. A source with intimate knowledge of the most recent inquiry, but who requested anonymity, said: \u201cThese are serious issues which need to be properly investigated.\u201d The decision was made by commissioner Kathryn Stone last Wednesday, after she requested information from both Johnson and David Ross, the former deputy chairman of Carphone Warehouse.

Today we saw it with Joe Gomez: he gets a push in the back and I guarantee if he flails his arms about and goes rolling on the floor, it\u2019s given. Because he tries to do the right thing, it\u2019s not given and Bournemouth get a goal from it. A similar thing with Chris Wood, who has tried to bring the ball down on his chest and turn in the box. The bloke came through the back of him, it\u2019s a definite penalty, nothing given. If he falls on the floor holding his face, he probably gets it. I think the game has got to be careful. You can\u2019t not get a decision because you\u2019re trying to play the game correctly. I can bore myself stupid about this!\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e63f9788f087df56e4c43a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-07T19:52:27.799Z\">7.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jose Mourinho\u2019s verdict is in, mainly on Ndombele by the sounds of it.</strong> \u201cThe quality and dynamic of Lucas and Lo Celso made a difference. I want to say, but I cannot say: we had something in the second half that we didn\u2019t in the first. Lucas had fatigue, Lo Celso had, Bergwijn had, Alli had, and they gave what you saw. Don\u2019t ask me much more than this. I was expecting players not tired to give more to the team. Somebody has to realise this is the Premier League ... I hope that next season he can be fantastic, because until now it is not enough. Skipp is a kid, he had a fantastic 120 minutes, I needed to protect Winks. He is in evolution and I would never want to criticise a kid like him.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e63f6c28f08c2df6d275399\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-07T19:37:39.535Z\">7.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Dele Alli speaks to Sky.</strong> \u201cThere was a lot of aggression [in the Spurs dressing room at half-time]. We knew we weren\u2019t good enough, though it\u2019s a difficult place to come. If you lose focus, they can punish you. It was a sticky changing room to be in! We probably should have won the game, we created enough to win. I knew it was going to be a physical battle, but I tried to help the team as much as I could. It\u2019s a great achievement [to reach 50 Premier League goals] but I\u2019d swap all 50 for the three points and the win.\u201d He also reveals - with a huge cheeky grin on his face - that he knew he\u2019d send Nick Pope the wrong way with the penalty ... because they practice together with England, and Alli usually puts the ball in the opposite corner. \u201cHe asked me why I switched sides!

      "bodyText": "Paul Wilson was at Turf Moor to witness this particular game of two halves. Here\u2019s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM ... and enjoy the rest of your sporting weekend. Nighty night! And now here\u2019s Sean Dyche\u2019s take on the refusal of the officials to give Burnley a penalty for the Sanchez-Wood incident. \u201cPeople are falling all over the place. Today we saw it with Joe Gomez: he gets a push in the back and I guarantee if he flails his arms about and goes rolling on the floor, it\u2019s given. Because he tries to do the right thing, it\u2019s not given and Bournemouth get a goal from it. A similar thing with Chris Wood, who has tried to bring the ball down on his chest and turn in the box. The bloke came through the back of him, it\u2019s a definite penalty, nothing given. If he falls on the floor holding his face, he probably gets it. I think the game has got to be careful. You can\u2019t not get a decision because you\u2019re trying to play the game correctly. I can bore myself stupid about this!\u201d Jose Mourinho\u2019s verdict is in, mainly on Ndombele by the sounds of it. \u201cThe quality and dynamic of Lucas and Lo Celso made a difference. I want to say, but I cannot say: we had something in the second half that we didn\u2019t in the first. Lucas had fatigue, Lo Celso had, Bergwijn had, Alli had, and they gave what you saw. Don\u2019t ask me much more than this. I was expecting players not tired to give more to the team. Somebody has to realise this is the Premier League ... I hope that next season he can be fantastic, because until now it is not enough. Skipp is a kid, he had a fantastic 120 minutes, I needed to protect Winks. He is in evolution and I would never want to criticise a kid like him.\u201d Dele Alli speaks to Sky. \u201cThere was a lot of aggression [in the Spurs dressing room at half-time]. We knew we weren\u2019t good enough, though it\u2019s a difficult place to come. If you lose focus, they can punish you. It was a sticky changing room to be in! We probably should have won the game, we created enough to win. I knew it was going to be a physical battle, but I tried to help the team as much as I could. It\u2019s a great achievement [to reach 50 Premier League goals] but I\u2019d swap all 50 for the three points and the win.\u201d He also reveals - with a huge cheeky grin on his face - that he knew he\u2019d send Nick Pope the wrong way with the penalty ... because they practice together with England, and Alli usually puts the ball in the opposite corner. \u201cHe asked me why I switched sides! I said I knew he thought I would go that way!\u201d Burnley end the day in tenth spot on 39 points. Tottenham are in eighth, two points ahead on 41. The race for Europe has a crowded field, with Burnley only six points shy of fourth-placed Chelsea, albeit having now played one more game. The corner\u2019s hit long. Wood chests down at the far post, but can\u2019t get a shot on target. And that\u2019s that! A draw that will please neither side in the push for Europe. But on balance the right result. Burnley were the better team in the first half, Spurs in the second. Though the hosts will point to Sanchez\u2019s shove on Wood, and the referee\u2019s refusal to award a penalty kick. 90 min +4: McNeil crosses from the left, forcing Alderweireld to chest behind for a corner. One last chance for the hosts! 90 min +3: Westwood is booked for kicking the ball away in frustration at the award of a garden-variety free kick in midfield. 90 min +2: McNeil makes to tear away down the left. Lo Celso pulls him back by the shorts, and goes into the book for his brazen cheek. 90 min +1: A free kick for Spurs out on the right. Lo Celso takes it, but not particularly well. 90 min: There will be four extra minutes for the two sides to find a precious winner. 89 min: Aaron Lennon, formerly of Spurs, comes on for Hendrick. 87 min: And it\u2019s no good. 86 min: Both teams are pushing hard for the winner, and this is great entertainment. Aurier makes good down the right and cuts back for Alli, whose first-time slapshot is deflected into the side netting. The first corner, from the right, is punched over the bar by Pope. The second will come from the left. 84 min: What a save by Lloris! Bardsley sends a long diagonal into the Spurs box from the right. A poor clearing header by Sanchez, who has been dismal today. McNeil tries the spectacular volley. The ball breaks to Vydra, who whips a shot towards the bottom right. Lloris parries, and Alderweireld clears. Time stood still when the ball was at Vydra\u2019s feet, though much good it did him. 82 min: Lo Celso has been excellent, as usual, since coming on. He nearly scores a spectacular goal, taking a touch to the right of the D and curling powerfully towards the top left. He\u2019s got Pope beaten, but the ball sails inches wide. Such a fine effort. 81 min: Moura drives at Burnley. He rolls a pass left towards Alli and Vertonghen; the former leaves it to the latter, whose first-time shot is blocked. Burnley go up the other end, Wood slapping a 20-yarder straight at Lloris, who looks fine after that earlier injury scare. 80 min: Moura shoots from distance. His effort is deflected wide left for a corner. The set piece is hacked clear, then the ball is returned by Tanganga, who sends a wild effort high into the stand behind the goal. 78 min: Yet another yellow card, as Bergwijn tugs back Hendrick. Spurs make their last change, replacing Lamela with Aurier. 77 min: Wood takes a crack from distance. It\u2019s straight at Lloris, who handles well, with Vydra closing in, hoping for another fumble. 76 min: Lo Celso swings in the free kick. Pope climbs highest to claim. It\u2019s good fun, this second half, with both teams going hard for the winner. 75 min: Hendrick is booked for a cynical check on Bergwijn, who was motoring down the left. A free kick in a dangerous position. Spurs load the box. 74 min: There was a defensive nick on that Alli shot. It should have been a Spurs corner, but they\u2019re not getting it. Alli\u2019s far from happy. 73 min: ... Lloris comes through a crowded box to punch clear. Spurs break at great speed through Bergwijn, Alli eventually flashing a diagonal shot wide left from a position on the right. 72 min: More space for Taylor out on the left. His cross is slapped out for a corner. From which ... 71 min: McNeil slips Vydra away down the inside right. He drops a shoulder to get inside Vertonghen, but as he cocks his leg back to shoot, is dispossessed by Dier\u2019s sliding tackle. A goal-saving challenge by Dier. 70 min: Alli drives at the Burnley back line. He slips a pass wide right for Moura, who fizzes in a low cross. Tarkowski flicks the ball clear just in time, with white shirts lurking. 69 min: Taylor, in a tight spot near the left-hand corner flag, digs out an excellent cross. Lloris claims, but hurts himself as he makes the save. A theatrical grimace. He might be worth keeping an eye on. 68 min: Rodriguez is replaced by Vydra, recently in the goals against Southampton and Bournemouth. 67 min: This is a completely different game now. Spurs are dominating possession, pushing Burnley back into their final third. Skipp and Ndombele will be feeling a little down right now. 65 min: Moura and Lamela attempt a one-two down the inside-right channel. Had Moura not fallen over, he\u2019d have gathered the return pass and would have been clear on goal. Lamela claims Moura was illegally bodychecked by Mee, but the referee isn\u2019t interested. 63 min: Bergwijn embarks on a power skitter down the left. He loses possession upon entering the box, but that\u2019s another example of Spurs moving up a gear since the equaliser. They\u2019ve been much more positive, on the front foot at last. 61 min: Spurs are making sorties into enemy territory now. Lo Celso is at the heart of much of it. Alli and Lamela appear rejuvenated too, exchanging crisp passes down the middle and nearly opening Burnley up. Much better from the visitors. 59 min: Taylor zips down the left. His excellent low cross is dummied by Wood, but there\u2019s nobody behind him to take a shot. Moura breaks upfield, and is tactically bowled over by Cork, who is the latest figure to go in the book. 58 min: A corner for Spurs out on the left. It\u2019s worked back out to Alderweireld, who welts a long-range effort over the bar. Pope had it covered. 57 min: As if to illustrate the point, Sanchez barges into the back of Wood again, as the striker makes his way down the left wing. This time it\u2019s a foul and a booking! The resulting free kick comes to nought. Then Tarkowski clips Alli at high speed and he\u2019s in the book as well. The home side, and their fans, are greatly irritated at the minute. 55 min: A Burnley throw from the right. It\u2019s flung into the box towards Wood, who is barged clumsily from behind by Sanchez. Anywhere else on the pitch, and that\u2019s a foul. Not in the area, it would seem. The referee waves play on, preposterously so. Burnley are rightly livid. 53 min: Burnley will be wondering how they\u2019re no longer ahead. The penalty came out of nowhere, and it was the only coherent move Spurs have put together since the opening minute. But the visitors now have the collective tail up. A palpable change of mood around Turf Moor. 51 min: Mee had no complaints with the penalty decision, by the way. A defeated shake of the head. But Taylor isn\u2019t so quiet with the referee now; he\u2019s booked for a late clip on Moura, who was skedaddling down the right wing. No Harry Kane, so it\u2019s Dele Alli who steps up to take. He cracks a fine penalty into the bottom left, and that\u2019s his 50th goal in the Premier League. Well, that didn\u2019t take Spurs long! 48 min: PENALTY TO SPURS! Here\u2019s a game-changer! Lo Celso slips a ball down the inside-right channel. Mee slides in to poke clear, but Lamela gets there just ahead. Mee\u2019s toe clips Lamela, who goes over, giving the referee one of the easier decisions. 47 min: Wood, chasing a long ball down the left, brushes Sanchez off with great ease. Wood crosses, Spurs clear after a fashion. Burnley get the second half started. Jose Mourinho has made two changes, hooking Skipp and Ndombele and sending on Moura and Lo Celso. Moura is the only substitute who has scored for Spurs this season. Half-time entertainment. This scoreline flatters Spurs. Jose Mourinho strides off purposefully, pen and notebook in hand. He\u2019ll have made a few observations, no doubt, and is likely to be raising them in the trenchant style. Burnley, especially Dwight McNeil, have been magnificent. 45 min +1: There will be two added minutes. During the first, McNeil crosses deep from the left. Rodriguez heads down for Bardsley, who attempts to send a spectacular bicycle kick into the top left. It\u2019s high and wide, though not by much. 44 min: Rodriguez whips a ball into the Spurs box from the left. It nearly finds its way to Wood, but Lloris claims just in time. Spurs really could do with hearing the half-time whistle. Mourinho has some thinking to do. 43 min: Alderweireld bundles Hendrick to the floor out on the right touchline. Westwood sends a long diagonal free kick towards Tarkowski at the far post. Tarkowski heads across; Wood can only bundle the ball wide left. The flag would surely have gone up for offside anyway. 41 min: Burnley by contrast are playing some lovely football. Taylor, McNeil and Rodriguez combine well down the left yet again. The move comes to nothing, but the ease with which they\u2019re knocking it around must worry Jose Mourinho. His team are being thoroughly outplayed. 39 min: Another lull. Spurs are so lethargic. 37 min: Bardsley goes down with a muscular problem, but is soon up and about again. Whether we\u2019ll see him in the second half is another issue. Meanwhile Burnley come again. McNeil loops long. Rodriguez heads down for Wood, who tees up Westwood. His shot from the edge of the box flies wide left. Burnley are getting plenty of shooting practice today. 36 min: Alli makes his way down the inside right and looks for Bergwijn or Alderweireld in the box. But the pass goes astray, Burnley clear, and then Alderweireld lets a simple pass clank between his ankles and out for a throw. More sarcasm in hooray form. Spurs have been extremely poor so far. 34 min: Some space for Vertonghen out on the left. As he runs with the ball, he holds his hands out in exasperation, as there are no options for him in the middle. He does extremely well to win a corner, but trudges off furious, nevertheless, gesticulating wildly. The set piece comes to nothing, which won\u2019t help his mood. 32 min: Burnley stroke it around in midfield. Spurs aren\u2019t busting a gut to close them down. The game falls a little flat as a result. 30 min: Spurs finally warm Pope\u2019s hands. Lamela drives down the middle of the park and from 20 yards unleashes a rising shot towards the top right. Pope is behind it all the way. Whether or not it was the right decision to shoot is moot; Vertonghen was tearing alongside him down the inside-left channel, and could have been slipped clear into the box. 28 min: Taylor is allowed to romp all the way down the left. His whipped cross takes a little deflection and nearly tricks Lloris at his near post, but the keeper reads the situation well to react and gather. 26 min: Alli dithers on the ball, allowing Bardsley to make off down the right flank. He slips the ball infield for Hendrick, who has a crack that\u2019s deflected into the path of Rodriguez, free in the box down the inside-right channel. The offside flag rescues Spurs. 25 min: Spurs look extremely nervous and uncertain. Skipp has time on the ball in the centre circle, but there\u2019s nobody ahead making a run, and eventually he\u2019s closed down. The ball breaks to Alderweireld, who shanks straight out of play to sarcastic cheers. 24 min: The first 30 seconds apart, Spurs have done absolutely nothing in attack. They\u2019ve barely spent any time in Burnley\u2019s half. 22 min: Tottenham are all over the shop here. A simple long punt nearly releases Wood, Dier hesitant under the high ball. Wood is eventually forced to turn tail but nearly tees up Rodriguez in the area. Spurs eventually hack clear, but if they keep on like this, Burnley will be adding to their lead sooner rather than later. 21 min: Alderweireld clumsily bundles Rodriguez to the ground, the best part of 30 yards from goal. McNeil goes direct for the top right, but Lloris is behind the free kick all the way and makes a save for the cameras. 19 min: Lamela is booked for an out-of-control slide on the highly effective McNeil. He complains, though you can tell his heart isn\u2019t really in the argument. A fair decision. 17 min: Cork drills a pass down the left for Wood, who is bowled over near the corner flag by Sanchez, but there\u2019s no free kick. In other rules-related news, there was a hint of handball in the build-up to the goal, the ball ricocheting off McNeil\u2019s left arm as he made two attempts to whip a cross past Sanchez. It wasn\u2019t flagged by VAR because it wasn\u2019t the assist, and it might not have been deemed handball in any case, with the player\u2019s arm by his side, and the players in close proximity to each other. 15 min: Burnley have won ten of the 12 Premier League games this season in which they\u2019ve scored first. History continues to deal Spurs blow after blow. It\u2019s fair to say this had been coming, and once again it\u2019s McNeil who instigates all the trouble. He beats Sanchez out on the left and crosses. Dier heads weakly clear. Rodriguez, 20 yards out down the inside-left channel, wallops a low shot straight at Lloris, who finds it too hot to handle. Wood, standing nearby, pokes the rebound into the bottom left. No more than Burnley deserve for an excellent start. 11 min: McNeil is causing all sorts of bother out on the left. This time his cross is half-cleared by Alderweireld, and ends up at the feet of Cork, who bobbles a shot straight at Lloris. 9 min: ... an almighty scramble in the Spurs box! It\u2019s a good old-fashioned stramash. A comic-book cloud with boots and fists poking out of it. No idea how Burnley don\u2019t force the ball over the line. But Spurs somehow hold out amid a melee that started with Westwood\u2019s deep corner, causing mayhem at the far post. Westwood\u2019s already scored directly from a corner at Liverpool and Southampton, and he nearly did so again. 8 min: Taylor and McNeil are having the run of this left flank. They combine again, the latter fizzing a cross along the byline, forcing Dier to poke out of play. And from the corner ... 6 min: McNeil rolls a pass down the touchline on the left to release Taylor, who has time to size up the scene. He crosses for Wood, but Alderweireld manages to half clear. Burnley recycle possession, McNeil whipping another cross in from the same flank. Dier chests down without much control. The ball breaks to Wood, who whistles a fierce drive inches over the bar from the edge of the box. That would have been some goal. 4 min: An early goal would have given Spurs some much-needed succour. In the ten games where both Harry Kane and Son Heung-min have been missing, they\u2019ve lost eight and drawn one. It doesn\u2019t augur well. 2 min: In fact the ball rolled an inch behind Lamela. Or Lamela over-ran it, whichever you prefer. Either way, Spurs really should be a goal up. Burnley were uncharacteristically opened up with great ease. And we\u2019re off! Spurs get the ball rolling. They\u2019ll be hoping to put an end to their four-game losing streak, and they should be ahead within 30 seconds! Lamela, Bergwijn and Alli make their presence felt down the right. The ball rolls across towards Lamela on the penalty spot, but somehow continues rolling under his foot when it was surely easier to score! The teams are out! Turf Moor erupts as the hosts, draped in their famous claret and blue, take to the field. Spurs sport their equally storied lilywhite. With both teams in their first-choice duds, this is an aesthetic delight. Here\u2019s hoping there\u2019s football to match. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! Jose Mourinho, channelling the great Art Blakey, bangs the same drum very loudly. \u201cThe feelings of the players are very important. We have an important game today, but we have another important game on Tuesday and we had two hours of football two days ago that pushed many of my players to run more thank 50 kilometres. We have to make decisions that are good for the team and the players. That is why Lucas and Lo Celso and Winks are not playing, because they are not in the best condition, and we hope they can be in the best condition on Tuesday. The players are ready to work and give everything; the point is to give them a good chance to play at a high level. I look to Leipzig today, they had Timo Werner on the bench, and are not in the situation like we are, they have six or seven attacking players. So for us it is more difficult than for others. I am not going to speak again because people are tired of listening to me.\u201d Sky have a pre-match word with Sean Dyche. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few blips but come out of that strong. It certainly would be a marker to go above a club like Spurs, but you\u2019ve got to earn the right. The whistle hasn\u2019t gone yet, so we\u2019ll see. We weren\u2019t a million miles off when we didn\u2019t win, but we had some big moments against Leicester, and a really good performance at Manchester United, and that inner belief grew. Our performances have been strong and consistent. We\u2019re going to have to raise our game today.\u201d The 3pm kick-offs have finished. Wins for Arsenal and Crystal Palace have pushed Burnley into the bottom half; they can move up to eighth with a win this evening. Spurs have been nudged down to eighth as a result of Sheffield United\u2019s victory; they\u2019ll leapfrog Wolves into fifth if they get the three points on offer tonight. Mind you, if they lose by four clear goals, no prizes for guessing who\u2019d leapfrog them on goal difference. Their old north London pals Arsenal. So plenty at stake at Turf Moor. Burnley make just one change to the XI selected last weekend at Newcastle. Chris Wood replaces Matej Vydra up front. Spurs make five changes to the team that crashed out of the FA Cup at home to Norwich. Hugo Lloris, Toby Alderweireld, Japhet Tanganga, Tanguy Ndombele and Erik Lamela replace Michel Vorm, Serge Aurier, Harry Winks, Giovani Lo Celso and Lucas Moura. Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Cork, Westwood, McNeil, Wood, Rodriguez. Subs: Brownhill, Brady, Hart, Pieters, Lennon, Vydra, Long. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Tanganga, Vertonghen, Skipp, Dier, Ndombele, Bergwijn, Alli, Lamela. Subs: Winks, Lo Celso, Sessegnon, Gazzaniga, Aurier, Lucas Moura, Fernandes. Referee: Jonathan Moss (County Durham). To think Burnley (last title 1960) were in a spot of relegation bother not so long ago. But we never should have doubted Sean Dyche\u2019s side. Four wins and two draws in their last six matches have seen the Clarets catapult up the table, and now they\u2019re bothering the European spots instead. It\u2019s been a fantastic run of form. By contrast, Tottenham Hotspur (last title 1961) are in a bit of a state. A three-game winning burst at the start of February, against Manchester City, Southampton and Aston Villa, slightly flattered Jose Mourinho\u2019s injury-hit side. Now they\u2019ve lost four games on the bounce, if we count the midweek penalty shoot-out loss to Norwich City in the cup, which we surely must. The team haven\u2019t looked at all confident going forward lately, unless you factor in Eric Dier\u2019s determined stand sortie the other night. European football next season is far from a pipe dream, but they\u2019ll need to arrest the slide, and quick. Should Burnley win this, they\u2019ll leapfrog Spurs in the race for Europe, and pressure really will be ratcheted up on Po\u2019 Mou. Alternatively, an away win would raise a few much-needed smiles in the Spurs camp, geeing up the troops ahead of the visit to Leipzig next week. Back-to-back wins would really change the mood music. Both teams will look to recent history for succour: Spurs lost here last season, but won at Turf Moor the two seasons before that. And they trounced Burnley 5-0 in N17 back in December. So this is delicately poised, and with both teams hoping for a statement victory, could be a cracker. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>For many decades the British royals have acted as one of the UK\u2019s most potent instruments of \u201csoft power\u201d in promoting close relations with the ruling families of the United Arab Emirates, other Gulf states and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.</p> <p>However, revelations of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/dubai-ruler-sheikh-mohammed-organised-kidnapping-of-his-children-uk-court-finds\" title=\"\">British family court judgments</a> in the case involving the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/dubai-rulers-wife-who-shattered-perception-of-a-perfect-couple\" title=\"\">estranged wife</a> Princess Haya of Jordan, their children and the abduction of two of the sheikh\u2019s daughters by a previous marriage pose problems. Not solely for the British royal family, but for the Foreign Office too, as a total estrangement between the British royals and those of the UAE could jeopardise a vital British interest.</p> <p>A mutual interest in breeding racehorses has made for a strong personal rapport between the Queen and the sheikh, who is vice-president and prime minister of the UAE. But the Queen, it was reported yesterday, will now avoid being photographed with him.</p> <p>In this case, the personal is highly political. Along with Saudi Arabia, the UAE is a valued customer for British arms exports and related defence contracts. Since the 1980s, the purchases of British arms by these two Gulf states have been the mainstay of Britain\u2019s arms industry. Without them, it is unlikely that BAE Systems could have maintained its production lines through the transition from the Tornado to the Eurofighter, for example, and Britain could have become more dependent on US-made equipment for its own armed forces.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the relationship with the Emirates is considered a key target for a new trade agreement post-Brexit \u2013 as evidenced by Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-call-with-crown-prince-of-abu-dhabi-uae-6-march-2020\" title=\"\">call last week</a> to the Abu Dhabi crown prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the de facto ruler of the UAE. In effect, the UK needs the UAE more than ever.</p> <p>It was not always thus. Before 1971, when the British formally withdrew their forces east of Suez, and the UAE, along with Britain\u2019s other semi-protectorates in the Gulf, Bahrain and Qatar, gained full independence, the rulers of these states were subsidised by the British. After independence and nationalisation of the energy industries of all the Arab states and Iran, these states became cash rich. This meant that the primary goal of the British banking sector was to ensure their petrodollars were deposited in London. They succeeded.</p> <p>Britain proved the preferred destination for Gulf investors, leading to Arab ownership of real estate and enterprises that benefited the British economy and gave their owners a growing influence in the UK. British exporters of consumer goods and infrastructure also gained lucrative contracts in the Gulf as these states developed their economies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The presence of so many British nationals and enterprises in the Emirates is both an asset and, potentially, a liability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From a skeleton presence before 1971, in subsequent years the number of British expatriates operating businesses in the UAE burgeoned to many hundreds, and Dubai in particular became a popular tourist destination. As the former UAE ambassador to London Easa Saleh al-Gurg reflected in his memoir: \u201cWe had to recognise that although the British presence was no more, the British themselves were still very much with us.\u201d</p> <p>The British relationship with the UAE has therefore become one of mutual dependence and the presence of so many British nationals and enterprises in the Emirates is both an asset and, potentially, a liability in time of crisis.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s relationship with Jordan, and the links established between the British royals and the Hashemites, are also close, but of a different order. Jordan is not rich and, given the size of the national debt and lack of employment opportunities for its youthful population, the government there has looked to the Gulf Arabs for handouts. Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and latterly the long-running conflict in Syria, Jordan has given shelter to millions of refugees, rendering it doubly reliant on foreign aid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92c92b3ae1b988560e4cd321d48dd566370e88f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92c92b3ae1b988560e4cd321d48dd566370e88f8/1_0_2559_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The missing princesses: sheikhas Shamsa and Latifa al-Maktoum.

His plan envisages Israeli annexation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/netanyahu-vows-annex-large-parts-occupied-west-bank-trump\" title=\"\">Jordan Valley</a> as well as other swathes of the West Bank captured by the Israelis from Jordan in 1967. If the Israelis go ahead unilaterally with such annexations, Jordan will suffer. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/police-to-review-inquiry-into-2000-disappearance-of-dubai-rulers-daughter\">Police to review inquiry into 2000 disappearance of Dubai ruler's daughter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given this, the Jordanians will look to the British to be more sympathetic to their concerns. Yet they, as the British, can ill afford a falling out with the UAE. The fact that a British court has now ruled in favour of Princess Haya in a case against Sheikh Mohammed, and she and her children have sought safety in the UK, adds a new complication to the British government\u2019s need to protect both its relations with the UAE and its interests in the stability of Jordan.</p> <p>As it happens, Israel is another of the countries with which Britain is planning to forge a new trading relationship post-Brexit. The prospects of keeping on the right side of the Israelis if they fall out with the Jordanians and with the UAE if its rulers cannot be persuaded to take the British court\u2019s judgment in their stride will not be easy. A further complication is that the FCO appears to have turned a blind eye to the abduction of one of Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s daughters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/kidnapping-case-what-happened-to-sheikh-mohammeds-daughters\" title=\"\">Sheikha Shamsa</a>, from the streets of Cambridge in 2000.</p> <p>In the coming days, the case will be made that upholding the rule of law in Britain is vital for Britain\u2019s reputation. Further, the FCO must be required to explain any cover up. But even if it does, making recompense will require the government to face some agonising choices. There\u2019s plenty more than royal friendship at stake.</p> <p>\u2022 Rosemary Hollis is a former Professor of Middle East policy studies at City University London</p>",

      "bodyText": "For many decades the British royals have acted as one of the UK\u2019s most potent instruments of \u201csoft power\u201d in promoting close relations with the ruling families of the United Arab Emirates, other Gulf states and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. However, revelations of the British family court judgments in the case involving the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, his estranged wife Princess Haya of Jordan, their children and the abduction of two of the sheikh\u2019s daughters by a previous marriage pose problems. Not solely for the British royal family, but for the Foreign Office too, as a total estrangement between the British royals and those of the UAE could jeopardise a vital British interest. A mutual interest in breeding racehorses has made for a strong personal rapport between the Queen and the sheikh, who is vice-president and prime minister of the UAE. But the Queen, it was reported yesterday, will now avoid being photographed with him. In this case, the personal is highly political. Along with Saudi Arabia, the UAE is a valued customer for British arms exports and related defence contracts. Since the 1980s, the purchases of British arms by these two Gulf states have been the mainstay of Britain\u2019s arms industry. Without them, it is unlikely that BAE Systems could have maintained its production lines through the transition from the Tornado to the Eurofighter, for example, and Britain could have become more dependent on US-made equipment for its own armed forces. What\u2019s more, the relationship with the Emirates is considered a key target for a new trade agreement post-Brexit \u2013 as evidenced by Boris Johnson\u2019s call last week to the Abu Dhabi crown prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the de facto ruler of the UAE. In effect, the UK needs the UAE more than ever. It was not always thus. Before 1971, when the British formally withdrew their forces east of Suez, and the UAE, along with Britain\u2019s other semi-protectorates in the Gulf, Bahrain and Qatar, gained full independence, the rulers of these states were subsidised by the British. After independence and nationalisation of the energy industries of all the Arab states and Iran, these states became cash rich. This meant that the primary goal of the British banking sector was to ensure their petrodollars were deposited in London. They succeeded. Britain proved the preferred destination for Gulf investors, leading to Arab ownership of real estate and enterprises that benefited the British economy and gave their owners a growing influence in the UK. British exporters of consumer goods and infrastructure also gained lucrative contracts in the Gulf as these states developed their economies. From a skeleton presence before 1971, in subsequent years the number of British expatriates operating businesses in the UAE burgeoned to many hundreds, and Dubai in particular became a popular tourist destination. As the former UAE ambassador to London Easa Saleh al-Gurg reflected in his memoir: \u201cWe had to recognise that although the British presence was no more, the British themselves were still very much with us.\u201d The British relationship with the UAE has therefore become one of mutual dependence and the presence of so many British nationals and enterprises in the Emirates is both an asset and, potentially, a liability in time of crisis. Britain\u2019s relationship with Jordan, and the links established between the British royals and the Hashemites, are also close, but of a different order. Jordan is not rich and, given the size of the national debt and lack of employment opportunities for its youthful population, the government there has looked to the Gulf Arabs for handouts. Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and latterly the long-running conflict in Syria, Jordan has given shelter to millions of refugees, rendering it doubly reliant on foreign aid. Latterly, Donald Trump has shown scant regard for the threats to stability in Jordan exacerbated by his so-called \u201cdeal of the century\u201d proposals for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His plan envisages Israeli annexation of the Jordan Valley as well as other swathes of the West Bank captured by the Israelis from Jordan in 1967. If the Israelis go ahead unilaterally with such annexations, Jordan will suffer. Given this, the Jordanians will look to the British to be more sympathetic to their concerns. Yet they, as the British, can ill afford a falling out with the UAE. The fact that a British court has now ruled in favour of Princess Haya in a case against Sheikh Mohammed, and she and her children have sought safety in the UK, adds a new complication to the British government\u2019s need to protect both its relations with the UAE and its interests in the stability of Jordan. As it happens, Israel is another of the countries with which Britain is planning to forge a new trading relationship post-Brexit. The prospects of keeping on the right side of the Israelis if they fall out with the Jordanians and with the UAE if its rulers cannot be persuaded to take the British court\u2019s judgment in their stride will not be easy. A further complication is that the FCO appears to have turned a blind eye to the abduction of one of Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s daughters, Sheikha Shamsa, from the streets of Cambridge in 2000. In the coming days, the case will be made that upholding the rule of law in Britain is vital for Britain\u2019s reputation. Further, the FCO must be required to explain any cover up. But even if it does, making recompense will require the government to face some agonising choices. There\u2019s plenty more than royal friendship at stake. \u2022 Rosemary Hollis is a former Professor of Middle East policy studies at City University London",

Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has never lost four games in a row before, let alone five, so he will have been pleased to see his side come back from a goal down and a shocking first-half performance to draw a line under the losing sequence, even if Burnley and their captain, Ben Mee, will be kicking themselves for letting their visitors back into the game.</p> <p>Mee was guilty of an uncontrolled tackle at the start of the second half that gifted Spurs a penalty and gave them a route back into a game that they never seemed likely to find for themselves. Burnley were so much on top in the first half they were probably not too worried about the number of chances they wasted, but the game changed when Spurs equalised and in the end a point apiece was a fair result. The home side missed their chance to overtake Spurs in the table and will have to console themselves with extending their unbeaten league run to seven matches.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/arsenal-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">Alexandre Lacazette breaks West Ham\u2019s resistance for fortunate Arsenal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to do in this league,\u201d said the Burnley manager, Sean Dyche. \u201cWe\u2019ve found a good level of consistency in the last few weeks. We were excellent in the first half but then we made a mistake and got punished.\u201d</p> <p>Mourinho claimed his half-time changes had made a crucial difference. \u201cIn the first half we didn\u2019t have a midfield,\u201d the Spurs manager said, before pointing the finger of blame at Tanguy Ndombele in particular. \u201cI know adapting to the Premier League is difficult but he has had enough time and a player of his potential has to give us more than he is giving us,\u201d he said. You could tell by the way Mourinho prefaced his remarks with \u201cI\u2019m not going to run away\u201d that some sort of bombshell was about to be dropped, but at \u00a354m Ndombele happens to be Spurs\u2019 record signing.</p> <p>Steven Bergwijn\u2019s direct running produced a chance in the opening minute for \u00c9rik Lamela, who overran the ball when it rolled free near the penalty spot just waiting to be struck. That proved to be a misleading indication of what was to come, however, for after Chris Wood had shot too high, Jay Rodriguez had hit the bar from a corner and Jack Cork had brought a save from Hugo Lloris at the other end Burnley took an early lead. A headed clearance from a Dwight McNeil cross invited a rasping volley from Rodriguez on the edge of the Spurs penalty area, Lloris saved but could not hold, and Wood scored one of his more routine goals by reaching the loose ball first.</p> <p>Eric Dier, playing centrally in a three-man backline, had to endure some uncomplimentary chants about his brother in the first half but was otherwise unruffled. The visitors\u2019 main problem was that Burnley were winning most of the midfield battles and using the ball more adventurously.

      "bodyText": "This is still not Tottenham as we know them, but at least the slump has been stopped. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has never lost four games in a row before, let alone five, so he will have been pleased to see his side come back from a goal down and a shocking first-half performance to draw a line under the losing sequence, even if Burnley and their captain, Ben Mee, will be kicking themselves for letting their visitors back into the game. Mee was guilty of an uncontrolled tackle at the start of the second half that gifted Spurs a penalty and gave them a route back into a game that they never seemed likely to find for themselves. Burnley were so much on top in the first half they were probably not too worried about the number of chances they wasted, but the game changed when Spurs equalised and in the end a point apiece was a fair result. The home side missed their chance to overtake Spurs in the table and will have to console themselves with extending their unbeaten league run to seven matches. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to do in this league,\u201d said the Burnley manager, Sean Dyche. \u201cWe\u2019ve found a good level of consistency in the last few weeks. We were excellent in the first half but then we made a mistake and got punished.\u201d Mourinho claimed his half-time changes had made a crucial difference. \u201cIn the first half we didn\u2019t have a midfield,\u201d the Spurs manager said, before pointing the finger of blame at Tanguy Ndombele in particular. \u201cI know adapting to the Premier League is difficult but he has had enough time and a player of his potential has to give us more than he is giving us,\u201d he said. You could tell by the way Mourinho prefaced his remarks with \u201cI\u2019m not going to run away\u201d that some sort of bombshell was about to be dropped, but at \u00a354m Ndombele happens to be Spurs\u2019 record signing. Steven Bergwijn\u2019s direct running produced a chance in the opening minute for \u00c9rik Lamela, who overran the ball when it rolled free near the penalty spot just waiting to be struck. That proved to be a misleading indication of what was to come, however, for after Chris Wood had shot too high, Jay Rodriguez had hit the bar from a corner and Jack Cork had brought a save from Hugo Lloris at the other end Burnley took an early lead. A headed clearance from a Dwight McNeil cross invited a rasping volley from Rodriguez on the edge of the Spurs penalty area, Lloris saved but could not hold, and Wood scored one of his more routine goals by reaching the loose ball first. Eric Dier, playing centrally in a three-man backline, had to endure some uncomplimentary chants about his brother in the first half but was otherwise unruffled. The visitors\u2019 main problem was that Burnley were winning most of the midfield battles and using the ball more adventurously. Lamela did break away from James Tarkowski to bring a comfortable save from Nick Pope after half an hour but it was just about the only attempt on goal Spurs had produced up to that point. Ashley Westwood volleyed wide as Burnley continued to press, before Wood went close to a second just before the interval. The tall striker was in position to meet Tarkowski\u2019s knockdown from a Westwood free-kick but was unable to keep his shot on target when the ball reached him in front of goal. With Phil Bardsley ending the half volleying too high with an optimistic attempt Spurs could only be grateful their hosts had failed to make their first-half superiority fully count. Mourinho sent on Lucas Moura and Giovani Lo Celso for the second half, which had barely got under way when Spurs found their luck had changed. A neat Lo Celso pass invited Lamela to break into the Burnley area, so perhaps that part of the equaliser was down to Mourinho\u2019s substitutions, though Mee\u2019s challenge was needlessly reckless, missing the ball and catching Lamela\u2019s foot. There were no Burnley complaints: it was a clear penalty, even if the actual contact could only have been in the area by an inch or two. Mee has a habit of leaping into tackles and looked as if he knew he had miscalculated as soon as Lamela went down. Dele Alli confidently sent Pope the wrong way from the spot and Tottenham perked up as if their afternoon had just started. Suddenly, it was Burnley being pushed back in their own half as Spurs passed and moved with a crispness that had been lacking in the first half. Alli and Moura combined to go close midway through the half before Burnley\u2019s first notable attacking threat since the break was snuffed out by man of the moment Eric Dier, who took the ball off Matej Vydra\u2019s toes as the substitute was about to shoot. Vydra was involved again in the closing minutes when Lloris kept him out from close range before Alli hit the side netting at the other end after a deflection.

Its membership has grown \u201c15-20%\u201d since the attacks and he manages a flurry of correspondence. Every time a white supremacist attacks Muslims anywhere in the world, people want to know what his community thinks.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I worry about is after the cameras have gone, the media have gone, and support services like Victim Support, ACC, MSD, when they pull back, what the result of that would be on people,\u201d he says, referring to the government agencies providing financial and emotional aid to the bereaved and survivors.</p> <p>Christchurch is a city still visibly healing from another dark day, a deadly earthquake that struck on 22 February 2011, killing 185 people and razing the central business district to the ground. The quake put pressure on local mental health services, which still groan under the weight of demand.</p> <p>Down by the grassy banks of the Avon River that flows through the city centre is a memorial for the earthquakes; smooth, inscribed stone that tourists stop to read. Nine years on, insurance claims for ruined homes remain fraught and schools are responding to earthquake-related trauma in students who were not even born when the 2011 shake happened.</p> <p>No decision has been made yet on an official memorial for the mosque attacks; some in the community worry they will be criticised for taking attention away from the long shadow of the earthquakes. They read comments on social media suggesting it is time the Muslim community stopped talking about Christchurch. Some don\u2019t want to make trouble, so they have.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been put in a difficult situation, because the minute there is publicity about the memorial thing, you know, some people started also writing comments or, \u2018Oh, look, that memorial for the Muslims is this big event, and now the earthquake is forgotten\u2019,\u201d Salama says. \u201cWe\u2019re being put in the spotlight again against our will. We\u2019re not the ones who asked for it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"66f1c81ee4abd08801928ab7258d8b532008a4d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66f1c81ee4abd08801928ab7258d8b532008a4d6/0_206_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outside the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outside the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lovell-Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But many, including Salama, are defiant too. \u201cYou know, he made us more faithful to our religion,\u201d she says of the gunman. \u201cHe made us more determined to not to be victimised and to keep going and to even spread the beauty of Islam everywhere.

There, 51 fledgling native trees are taking root, one for each of those who died, and are still clad in protective plastic. \u201cHumanity\u201d, reads a small plaque. \u201cWhen you sow a seed of kindness and empathy, it grows into 51 trees of hope and love.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

Lying beneath the bodies of other worshippers at Al Noor mosque in Christchurch last March as a gunman fired again and again, he prayed that Allah would send him back to Syria to die. There, war had been a way of life. Chaos became normal. But the violence in peaceful New Zealand came just seven months after the sleepy, leafy city had become his home. That something so barbaric could happen in his place of refuge was unbearable. \u201cAll of these 10 minutes [of the attack] I was praying, \u2018Please, I need to go to the war. I need to go to the jail in Syria to die. The rubbish there, it\u2019s better than this situation.\u2019\u201d In the week before the attack\u2019s first anniversary on 15 March, the Guardian visited Christchurch, where bereaved families and survivors of the shooting are bracing themselves for renewed interest as the global spotlight swings back to the city. Many in the Muslim community are dreading the attention while they still come to terms with new lives and realities, their bodies and prospects and families forever changed by the gunman\u2019s assault. \u201cTo be honest I felt mentally, after the mosque attack, better than now,\u201d al Zarzour says.

The outpouring of grief and love from the country\u2019s inhabitants \u2013 and exhortations to unity from the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who announced six days after the shooting that she would ban most semiautomatic weapons \u2013 thrust New Zealand onto the world stage. Almost a year on, the galvanising phrase \u201cthey are us\u201d uttered by Ardern in the wake of the attacks feels less certain; an inquiry due to conclude in April is seeking answers about whether state actors might have failed to prevent the attack, and the man accused of committing it \u2013 an Australian, charged with murder, attempted murder and terrorism \u2013 faces a lengthy and high-profile trial in June. Al Zarzour does not sleep regularly, often drifting off at 6am to wake from nightmares at half-hour intervals. The bullet wounds to his legs have caused chronic nerve pain. At first, he watched over and over the footage the gunman allegedly broadcast live on Facebook, trying to understand what had happened; a compulsion shared with other survivors of the attack. He tries not to watch the video any more. \u201cTo be honest, I take 600 milligrams of depression medicine every day to forget that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s triggering a lot of things\u2019 Eight kilometres away, in a quiet residential part of the city, Maysoon Salama wrestles with the new security gate at An Nur, the Muslim childcare centre she runs with her husband, Mohammad Alayan. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I can work it out tomorrow to open it for people,\u201d she says, only half-joking. Security is heightened now. Before the mosque attack, the centre was targeted for harassment and abuse \u2013 once, someone painted in blood on her car \u2013 but the police never took action, she says. Five children who attend the school lost parents in the attack, and a four-year-old pupil was shot and partially blinded by the gunman. Many other parents were injured and traumatised. Salama returned to work nursing her own grief. Her son, Atta Elayyan, 33, died in the attack, while her husband was badly injured. Elayyan, a brilliant app developer, sportsman, husband and father to Aya, aged two, was shot and killed in Al Noor.

Eleven months on, new carpet has been laid, and Feroze Ditta walks through the mosque\u2019s front doors and down its long hallway just as he did on 15 March last year. As he did that day, he takes a seat in the mosque\u2019s small office. Most of the friends who sat around the table with him a year ago are gone. They had talked about ordinary things. \u201cWe said, \u2018All right, see you next Friday,\u2019\u201d he recalls. Then the men shook hands and went in for prayers. \u201cWhen I first came back after that day it was hard,\u201d Ditta says of returning to the mosque months after the attacks. \u201cIt took me a lot of courage to get up and walk through those doors.\u201d He had been lucky and unlucky; two bullets cut through his calf, leaving Ditta \u2013 a contractor for a trucking company - out of work and facing a career change in his early 50s. But he had survived. To his surprise, upon his return he found himself thrust into a leadership role as the mosque\u2019s secretary, a busy job. Its membership has grown \u201c15-20%\u201d since the attacks and he manages a flurry of correspondence. Every time a white supremacist attacks Muslims anywhere in the world, people want to know what his community thinks. \u201cWhat I worry about is after the cameras have gone, the media have gone, and support services like Victim Support, ACC, MSD, when they pull back, what the result of that would be on people,\u201d he says, referring to the government agencies providing financial and emotional aid to the bereaved and survivors. Christchurch is a city still visibly healing from another dark day, a deadly earthquake that struck on 22 February 2011, killing 185 people and razing the central business district to the ground. The quake put pressure on local mental health services, which still groan under the weight of demand. Down by the grassy banks of the Avon River that flows through the city centre is a memorial for the earthquakes; smooth, inscribed stone that tourists stop to read. Nine years on, insurance claims for ruined homes remain fraught and schools are responding to earthquake-related trauma in students who were not even born when the 2011 shake happened. No decision has been made yet on an official memorial for the mosque attacks; some in the community worry they will be criticised for taking attention away from the long shadow of the earthquakes. They read comments on social media suggesting it is time the Muslim community stopped talking about Christchurch. Some don\u2019t want to make trouble, so they have. \u201cWe have been put in a difficult situation, because the minute there is publicity about the memorial thing, you know, some people started also writing comments or, \u2018Oh, look, that memorial for the Muslims is this big event, and now the earthquake is forgotten\u2019,\u201d Salama says. \u201cWe\u2019re being put in the spotlight again against our will. We\u2019re not the ones who asked for it.\u201d But many, including Salama, are defiant too. \u201cYou know, he made us more faithful to our religion,\u201d she says of the gunman. \u201cHe made us more determined to not to be victimised and to keep going and to even spread the beauty of Islam everywhere. If he wanted to finish us, he failed miserably. And a lot of good things have happened.\u201d On a hillside cloaked in mist at Pony Point, south-east of the city \u2013 overlooking glass-flat sea and small boats dotted across Cass Bay \u2013 an unofficial memorial is quietly growing. There, 51 fledgling native trees are taking root, one for each of those who died, and are still clad in protective plastic. \u201cHumanity\u201d, reads a small plaque. \u201cWhen you sow a seed of kindness and empathy, it grows into 51 trees of hope and love.\u201d",

Think on that \u2013 given the current inflation rate is around 1.8%, the government has borrowed $1.2bn dollars at an interest rate that is more than one percentage point below inflation. That is effectively borrowing $1.2bn for free. It highlights just how absurd is the economic debate in this country. The US economist Paul Krugman recently noted that \u201cfor a long period of time elites thought that debt was the greatest threat to the US economy. Now I think we\u2019ve largely come around to the correct view, which is that debt is just not a serious problem for the United States currently\u201d. Neither is it a problem for Australia, and yet our political debate remains stuck in a world where we still act like the government budget is equivalent to that of a household or company. A new paper by progressive think tank The Australia Institute, \u201cThe Budget Surplus Objective: An example of how economics is broken\u201d highlights the folly and cost of this fear of government debt. It\u2019s author, David Richardson, notes that given Australia\u2019s nominal GDP is expected to grow at around 4.5%, if government borrowing pays lower interest than that (as is currently the case) debt levels will fall over time. This is because the economy is growing much faster than is the interest on the debt. It means, to quote Larry Summers, the former chief economist of the World Bank, that \u201cpublic investment is essentially costless \u2013 the classic free lunch\u201d. Consider that back when the Howard government lost the 2007 election, the interest rate for a 10-year government bond was 6.03%; now it is 0.78%. Why on earth would we talk about debt in the same way as then? And given gross debt under Howard and Costello was 4.7% of GDP, compared with the current level of 27.7% of GDP, where is the evidence that higher debt means higher interest rates? Richardson notes that the argument put forward by the government (and many in the media) that \u201ca strong balance sheet provides the government with flexibility to respond to unanticipated events, such as financial crises or economic shocks\u201d is quite false. Such a belief suggests the government is like a company. But Australia cannot become insolvent like a company or bankrupt like an individual. Richardson argues \u201cgovernments do not fail if they cannot achieve sales; they have the power to raise taxes, which no private business can do, and the Australian government has the ability to print legal tender\u201d. The constraint on governments is that if they borrow too much or print too much money their currency will lose value and inflation will rise quickly and so too will the interest rate the government has to pay for its bonds. But inflation growth is now less than half what it was when the Howard government had no net debt and the interest rate is around a tenth of what it was then. Rate of return equals risk and right now the world sees Australian government bonds as essentially without risk. Investors don\u2019t give a damn about our level of government debt. This does not mean any government spending is justifiable, but it means we should not have any concerns about the size of the stimulus the government may undertake to counter the coronavirus. The question should always be about the effectiveness. With luck it will be as effective as the stimulus provided during the GFC. It also means we have absolutely no barrier to decarbonising our economy. The government should be embarking on the mother of all investments in renewable energy. We face a massive challenge, both in the short-term from the coronavirus and in the medium and long-term with climate change. We should use government debt \u2013 and our ability to borrow for essentially free \u2013 to tackle both. Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "A Queensland police superintendent has been suspended for allegedly photographing the confidential details of a domestic violence victim, Guardian Australia has learned. The senior detective is the second officer in Queensland known to be accused of using police computer systems to obtain details related to a domestic violence complainant. He is also one of the highest ranking officers to be caught up in an ongoing data misuse scandal, which the state\u2019s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, has said has \u201cbrought our organisation into disrepute\u201d. The man had been seconded to a role at the Crime and Corruption Commission Queensland last year. In early November, police and the CCC both released statements that said the 51-year-old detective superintendent had been stood down from operational duties, then suspended, amid an ongoing investigation into the unauthorised access of confidential information. The CCC immediately rescinded the man\u2019s secondment. The statements made no mention of the specific allegations. But Guardian Australia can reveal the officer was suspended for allegedly taking a photograph of a computer screen displaying the personal details of a domestic violence complainant. Police said they \u201cproactively\u201d released a statement two days after the CCC had done so, but would not address questions about why the statement did not mention the accusations related to the identity of a domestic violence complainant. At the time the officer was stood down, police were under extraordinary scrutiny in relation to their handling of a similar incident \u2013 senior constable Neil Punchard accessed the address of a domestic violence victim and disclosed the details to her former partner. Police initially treated Punchard\u2019s actions as an internal disciplinary matter. He was docked pay but not demoted or dismissed. After considerable public pressure, a campaign from the victim and advice from the CCC, police eventually laid charges against Punchard and he was convicted of computer hacking last year. Carroll remains under pressure to sack him. In November last year, the same week the detective superintendent was suspended, the CCC began hearings into Operation Impala, which was investigating public sector data misuse. The CCC eventually recommended tougher criminal sanctions for public officials who access confidential information unlawfully, after hearing evidence that agencies were often inconsistent in deciding whether to handle breaches as criminal complaints or internal discipline matters. On 18 November, when giving evidence at the inquiry, Carroll was asked whether criminal charges should be pursued in circumstances where a domestic violence victim\u2019s details were disclosed. \u201cYes, and that\u2019s a strong message that I have sent,\u201d she said. Several people with knowledge of the case have spoken to Guardian Australia out of concern at the time it has taken to investigate the case. Police said the investigation into the detective superintendent \u201cremains ongoing and as such, the QPS is unable to comment further at this time\u201d. It is understood he is on full pay while suspended.",

It\u2019s not a \u201creaction\u201d to stress, nor is it triggered by alcohol or drugs. It\u2019s an ongoing system of control, in which the abusive partner seeks to override their partner\u2019s autonomy and destroy their sense of self. The end game \u2013 whether the perpetrator knowingly sets out to achieve it \u2013 is to make their partner entirely subordinate; a \u201cwilling slave\u201d. To do this, they isolate, micro-manage, humiliate, degrade, surveil, gaslight and create an environment of confusion, contradiction and extreme threat. The feeling victims have, as the British survivor-advocate Min Grob tweeted the other day, is that the rug has been pulled from under your feet. \u201cYou become disoriented, hyper vigilant, confused and most likely sleep-deprived. You are walking on eggshells. Afraid you\u2019re going mad. Afraid to make them mad. Afraid. All the time. Sometimes not even knowing why you\u2019re in fear but the panic is there. Always.\u201d This abuse can also be incredibly hard for the victim to detect, because it happens slowly, bit by bit. It\u2019s the total mental dislocation of coercive control \u2013 which Amnesty International has classified as torture \u2013 that is the hardest thing to recover from.</p> <p>Coercive controllers may use extreme physical or sexual violence; or, as was reportedly the case with Rowan Baxter, no physical violence at all. For more than 40 years, women and children have been saying that except for extreme violence, the coercive control is the worst part. In fact, one of the most common refrains from victims of coercive control is \u201cI wish he\u2019d just hit me\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdc506214d9b38de54712bf8b30040a3af7ee9d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdc506214d9b38de54712bf8b30040a3af7ee9d3/0_68_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"woman cries at vigil for Hannah Clarke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman cries during the vigil for Hannah Clarke and her three children, Aaliyah, Laianah, and Trey, after they were set alight and killed in a deliberate car fire in Brisbane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Marshall/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>If domestic abuse cases almost always follow the same script, as you write in your book, why is it so hard to stop them?</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They stay because it may be even more dangerous to leave</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So many reasons, but in cases of coercive control, I think it boils down to this. Many women don\u2019t know they are experiencing abuse until they are already in situations that are incredibly dangerous \u2013 partly because coercive control is so poorly understood, but also because the perpetrator makes it invisible. By the time victims realise the danger they\u2019re in, many believe no system will ever be powerful enough to keep them safe. If they do report to police \u2013 if something reportable actually occurs \u2013 they are making a terrifying gamble. Will they get an officer who\u2019s sympathetic and proactive? Will reporting their partner make him more dangerous? What if child protection gets involved? What if he contests for custody? There are absolutely no guarantees that they (or their children) will be protected. Their suspicion that the system is not powerful enough to protect them is too often correct. The justice system is not only full of holes; too often it actively colludes with the perpetrator (especially the family law system). So they stay, even after they want to leave, and know it\u2019s dangerous. They stay because it may be even more dangerous to leave. Until the justice system properly assesses <em>and responds </em>to risk, and as long as women are made to be responsible for their own safety, we will continue to see an intractable domestic homicide rate.</p> <p><strong>How do some men come to feel so entitled to their power over women?</strong></p> <p>Thousands of years of patriarchy has laid pretty good groundwork for this \u2013 and it\u2019s not so long since a wife was considered her husband\u2019s property, and had no legal rights whatsoever. It was only in the 1980s that new laws against marital rape recognised that men didn\u2019t have the right to demand sex with their wives anytime they wanted; prior to that, consent was considered to have been given on the wedding day and never revoked. Today, we still live in a society that entrenches women\u2019s subordination at every level \u2013 from the home, to the boardroom, to our parliament. Even in the courtroom, as we see so often. As the Harvard psychiatrist Judith Herman writes: \u201cThe legal system is designed to protect men from the superior power of the state but not to protect women or children from the superior power of men.\u201d I\u2019m sure any survivor reading this will know exactly what she\u2019s talking about.</p> <p>Men don\u2019t abuse women because society tells them it\u2019s OK. Men abuse women because society tells them they are entitled to be in control. In fact, society says that if they are <em>not </em>in control, they won\u2019t succeed \u2013 they won\u2019t get the girl, they won\u2019t get the money, and they will be vulnerable to the violence and control of other men. It says that if they fail to assert themselves like \u201creal men\u201d, they will end up poor and alone.</p> <p>But we don\u2019t just see men being entitled to power over their partners; some women identify with this, too. That\u2019s because \u201chaving power over\u201d is valued within patriarchy \u2013 much more for men than it is for women \u2013 but nevertheless, it is regarded generally as a sign of strength to claim power over others. To add more complication, in many perpetrators who have had trauma or attachment disruption in their childhoods, you get another layer of entitlement: as one perpetrator told me \u201cI never had any control over anything as a child, and I vowed that I would never let that happen to me again. I would always be in control.\u201d</p> <p>Trauma-based entitlement is very common in people who are abusive \u2013 the notion that \u201cI had to go through so much, so fuck you, you just have to deal with whatever I do to you.\u201d When that entitlement is thwarted, there is this notion of being defied, of being humiliated \u2013 of being shamed. This is what has been called \u201chumiliated fury\u201d \u2013 when insecurity, toxic shame and entitlement combine. That is a very dangerous emotional state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0802d5f40f7e4604c442929d467f0913dae3cbf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0802d5f40f7e4604c442929d467f0913dae3cbf8/0_0_2073_3110/667.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyd and Suzanne Clarke, parents to Hannah Clarke\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lloyd and Suzanne Clarke, parents to Hannah Clarke, attend a vigil for Hannah and her three children at Bill Hewitt Reserve in Camp Hill on 23 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jono Searle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Do behaviour change programs for men work?</strong></p> <p>Opinions \u2013 and studies - on this are mixed. Here in Australia, group therapeutic programs generally run for a few months, once a week. A <a href=\"https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/a-study-of-the-impact-on-men-amp-their-partners-in-the-short-term\">recent study</a> by Monash University found that 65% of men report that they are \u201cviolence free\u201d or almost violence free two years after the program ended; that is a very encouraging result. There are a couple of residential therapeutic programs, like Breathing Space in Western Australia and Room4Change in Canberra, that I think are also really promising \u2013 they give men a place to live, so women and children don\u2019t have to leave, and they follow up intensive individual and group work with months of ongoing outreach support. Indigenous men\u2019s programs throughout the country are also some of the best I\u2019ve seen, in terms of reconnecting men to what is meaningful.</p> <p>But the model I keep coming back to is one that actually takes seriously the deep work that is required to shift men out of long-habituated behaviour. It\u2019s a Scottish program called the Caledonian model, and it runs for two years. It combines two approaches to offending that are typically at odds with each other \u2013 the psychopathology model, which looks at what drives a specific person to abuse, and the feminist model, which looks at how men are socialised under patriarchy, and how gender inequality underpins their abusive behaviour.</p> <p>To do this it gives abusers six months of one-on-one counselling to begin with, and puts them in touch with specialists who can deal with any other presenting issues: addiction, mental illness, childhood trauma, etc. After that they go into a group program with other men, where they confront issues around gendered expectations, socialisation, what actually constitutes abuse and so on. Then they go back into one-on-one counselling. Throughout that time, caseworkers are also working directly with their partners or ex-partners, and their children. It\u2019s a fantastic model.</p> <p><strong>How can you help a friend if you think they are being coercively controlled?</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The perpetrator wants their partner to be isolated \u2013 don\u2019t enable them. Stay in contact, if you can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When you first hear those red flags \u2013 isolation, micro-management, rule-setting, financial control \u2013 you need to respond carefully. Listen without judgement. Criticise their partner\u2019s behaviour, but don\u2019t condemn their partner \u2013 that may only make them defensive. Comment on the changes you\u2019ve notice in them personally, and why you\u2019re worried about it. Most importantly, don\u2019t give up. The perpetrator wants their partner to be isolated \u2013 don\u2019t enable them. Stay in contact, if you can. Remember always that your friend is the expert in their own experience, and they don\u2019t need you to take over. Let them know that if they are thinking of leaving, they should get in touch with a domestic violence caseworker, so they can develop a safety plan. Lastly, don\u2019t make your friendship conditional on your friend leaving \u2013 they may take months or years to leave, or they may never leave. Just let them know you will be there for them, no matter what.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78e0881e01826a957bb51a3ab86902b8c0de4b91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78e0881e01826a957bb51a3ab86902b8c0de4b91/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers sit at a vigil for Hannah Clarke and her three children\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>The federal government says it is open to new ideas for reducing violence.

Greens co-deputy Larissa Waters is calling for a trial of these women\u2019s police stations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/29/coercive-control-and-domestic-abuse-what-might-have-saved-hannah-clarke-and-her-children\">Coercive control and domestic abuse: what might have saved Hannah Clarke and her children?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second we should look very seriously at criminalising coercive control, as has been promised by the Queensland opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, and urged by New South Wales MP Anna Watson. Criminalising coercive control is not just about locking people up. It\u2019s about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/29/coercive-control-and-domestic-abuse-what-might-have-saved-hannah-clarke-and-her-children\">changing the paradigm on domestic abuse</a> and requiring police to investigate and report on the entire arc of a relationship, instead of isolated incidents. Globally speaking, Scotland is seen as the world leader, as all of the harms of domestic abuse are included under the one charge. </p> <p>Third, I\u2019m also a big advocate of localised strategies, like focused deterrence and justice reinvestment, that develop close and constant collaboration between the community sector \u2013 domestic abuse, substance abuse, homelessness and so on \u2013 and the justice system. These strategies break down silos between sector groups that often work at odds with each other, they close loopholes in the justice system, and they deliver a strong message to perpetrators that unless they accept the help that is on offer, and make the rational choice to stop their offending, they will feel the full force of the law.</p> <p>Last, fix the family law system. The Australian Law Reform Commission has delivered a set of reforms that will make children safe. Implement them.</p> <p><strong>What could we do today - right now - to urgently improve this situation and prevent more murders like this?</strong></p> <p>The good news is we know that change is possible.</p> <p>Here are some critical changes the federal parliament could introduce now. To begin with, straightaway announce enough secure funding for the women\u2019s refuge sector to ensure no woman or child is denied vital protection. Allocate proper funding for affordable and transitional housing so they can move into homes they can afford. Reverse funding cuts to community legal aid \u2013 we just saw $130,000 in funding removed from Victoria Legal Aid, which has cancelled the Court Network of volunteers who help family violence victims at the family law courts; community legal aid is already woefully underfunded. There is so much good work already being done \u2013 if the federal government truly cared about women and children\u2019s safety, they\u2019d stop making the women\u2019s sector beg and scrape for basic funding.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In Australia, if you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit <a href=\"https://www.1800respect.org.au/\">1800RESPECT.org.au</a>.

      "bodyText": "Investigative journalist Jess Hill interviewed dozens of abused women, domestic abuse sector workers, male perpetrators, children\u2019s advocates and system experts over five years in order to write her award-winning book, See What You Made Me Do. Here she answers some questions about issues arising from the murders in Brisbane of Hannah Clarke and her three children Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4 and Trey, 3. Hannah Clarke\u2019s family described her husband Rowan Baxter as controlling, coercive and obsessive. His abuse appears to have followed a familiar script known as coercive control. Can you explain this? Coercive control is a very particular kind of domestic abuse. It\u2019s not a \u201creaction\u201d to stress, nor is it triggered by alcohol or drugs.

First, the introduction of police stations for women, which are solely dedicated to policing family violence (and provide a one-stop shop for women and children, including therapeutic, legal and financial help), have been proven to reduce domestic homicide in countries across South America, and crucially, they get women reporting earlier. Greens co-deputy Larissa Waters is calling for a trial of these women\u2019s police stations. Second we should look very seriously at criminalising coercive control, as has been promised by the Queensland opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, and urged by New South Wales MP Anna Watson. Criminalising coercive control is not just about locking people up. It\u2019s about changing the paradigm on domestic abuse and requiring police to investigate and report on the entire arc of a relationship, instead of isolated incidents. Globally speaking, Scotland is seen as the world leader, as all of the harms of domestic abuse are included under the one charge. Third, I\u2019m also a big advocate of localised strategies, like focused deterrence and justice reinvestment, that develop close and constant collaboration between the community sector \u2013 domestic abuse, substance abuse, homelessness and so on \u2013 and the justice system. These strategies break down silos between sector groups that often work at odds with each other, they close loopholes in the justice system, and they deliver a strong message to perpetrators that unless they accept the help that is on offer, and make the rational choice to stop their offending, they will feel the full force of the law. Last, fix the family law system. The Australian Law Reform Commission has delivered a set of reforms that will make children safe. Implement them. What could we do today - right now - to urgently improve this situation and prevent more murders like this? The good news is we know that change is possible. Here are some critical changes the federal parliament could introduce now. To begin with, straightaway announce enough secure funding for the women\u2019s refuge sector to ensure no woman or child is denied vital protection. Allocate proper funding for affordable and transitional housing so they can move into homes they can afford. Reverse funding cuts to community legal aid \u2013 we just saw $130,000 in funding removed from Victoria Legal Aid, which has cancelled the Court Network of volunteers who help family violence victims at the family law courts; community legal aid is already woefully underfunded. There is so much good work already being done \u2013 if the federal government truly cared about women and children\u2019s safety, they\u2019d stop making the women\u2019s sector beg and scrape for basic funding. In Australia, if you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au. In the UK, visit the National Domestic Abuse Helpline website here or call 0808 2000 247. In the US visit the National Domestic Violence Hotline website here, or call 1-800-799-7233.",

Here\u2019s a summary of the news so far today: It was now \u201chighly likely\u201d the infection will spread in the UK in a \u201csignificant way\u201d, a No 10 spokesman has said. The number of coronavirus cases in Germany has hit 684 on Saturday morning, an increase of 45 overnight. Authorities in the US are preparing to test passengers on the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Grand Princess, after 21 people on board tested positive for the illness. Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of Italy\u2019s Democratic party (PD), which governs the country in coalition with the Five Star Movement (M5S), has tested positive for coronavirus. The pope will make Sunday blessings via a streaming service from inside the Vatican, instead of appearing in person in St Peter\u2019s Square, it was announced. British health officials say the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has risen from 164 to 206, an increase of 42 from Friday. NHS England has confirmed it will provide GP surgeries with personal protective equipment (PPE) to help them deal with the coronavirus outbreak Cases in both Italy and Iran have increased by more than 1,000 in 24 hours. The family of the 83-year-old man who died after testing positive for coronavirus have paid tribute to him in a statement released on Saturday afternoon. Here\u2019s the full story from the UK: More than 1,200 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy since Friday, the Civil Protection Agency said. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy has risen to 5,883 from 4,636 on Friday, according to official figures, a rise of 1,247. The death toll in the country rose to 233 from 197 on Friday. The head of the agency, Angelo Borrelli, said in a news conference that of those originally infected, 589 had fully recovered while 567 were being treated in intensive care. In total there are now 5,061 current cases (this figure doesn\u2019t include those who have died or those who have recovered.) The outbreak in Italy, which began over two weeks ago, is focused on a handful of hotspots in the north, but cases have now been confirmed in each of the country\u2019s 20 regions, with deaths recorded in eight of them. A second member of France\u2019s National Assembly has been taken to hospital after contracting coronavirus and five other lawmakers are being tested for the illness, the lower house\u2019s presidency said in a statement on Saturday. The Assembly did not name the two legislators who have caught the disease, but local media in the eastern region of Alsace have reported that the first of the two lawmakers is Jean-Luc Reitzer, who represents one of the departments most affected by the outbreak and is currently in intensive care, Reuters reports. The second lawmaker is a woman, according to the statement by the parliament. The Assembly said on Friday that a snack bar worker had also contracted the virus. Sessions in the lower house will be interrupted for two weeks from 9 March and 22 March due to municipal elections that are taking place across France, reducing activity and the number of people present in the building, the assembly said. France\u2019s health ministry said earlier that two more people had died from the coronavirus, bringing the total death toll to 11 people. France now has 716 confirmed cases of coronavirus, an increase of 103 compared with a day earlier. Italy\u2019s premier football league, Serie A, could be forced to suspend mid-season if a player tests positive for coronavirus, the Italian football federation (FIGC) said on Saturday. \u201cWe must be realistic,\u2019\u2019 Gabriele Gravina, president of the FIGC, said in an interview with Italian broadcaster Rai, \u201cWe need to take measures to protect athletes, and we cannot exclude the possibility to suspend the competition if a player tested positive.\u2019\u2019 On Wednesday, Italy ordered that all sporting events should be played behind closed doors until 3 April due to the outbreak. The \u201dderby of Italy\u201d between Inter Milan and Juventus football clubs is set to be played on Sunday, while the Rome marathon, due to take place on 29 March, has been cancelled due to the outbreak. \u201cThis is the message that we would never have wished to write but sadly, as a consequence of the ongoing health emergency and according to what is laid down in the cabinet decree of March 4, 2020, the Marathon on March 29 has been cancelled,\u201d said organisers. Italy is the European country most affected by the coronavirus with 3,916 infected and 197 dead. Iran\u2019s death toll climbed to 145 on Saturday after another 21 people were confirmed to have died, as infections in the country increased to nearly 6,000. Announcing the latest deaths from the virus, a health ministry official said in a televised briefing that the tally of confirmed infections had increased by more than 1,000 during the last 24 hours, totalling 5,823 by Saturday, Reuters reported. On Friday, the country\u2019s confirmed cases were reported to be 4,747. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, called in a tweet for world opposition to US sanctions, which he said were draining Iran\u2019s resources, needed in the fight against the outbreak. A second confirmed case of Covid-19 has been recorded in Cornwall. Steve Brown, Cornwall council\u2019s deputy director of public health, told PA Media: \u201cThe case is a resident directly linked to the initial diagnosis in Cornwall, who had also travelled to northern Italy. \u201cI\u2019d like to reassure people again that the risk to the general public remains low and Cornwall council is working with health colleagues to do everything we can to stop the virus spreading and ensure the people of Cornwall are protected. \u201cIf you have not been contacted by Public Health England as a close contact of the confirmed cases you do not need to take any action at this time.\u201d Public Health England is also contacting people who had close contact with a resident of Leicestershire, one of the latest confirmed cases of Covid-19. Fu-Meng Khaw, the centre director at Public Health England East Midlands, said: \u201cClose contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed case. \u201cThis tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.\u201d The Premier League handshake ban has kicked in today, with various players seen bumping fists or elbows instead, or even completely avoiding a physical greeting. Sam Jones in Madrid Police are preparing to lock down entire blocks of a neighbourhood in a small town in northern Spain after dozens of cases of the coronavirus were traced back to a funeral two weeks ago. Spain has so far confirmed 430 cases of the virus \u2013 60 of which originated among people who attended a funeral service in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, according to Spain\u2019s National Microbiology Centre. Thirty-nine of those 60 cases are in the neighbouring La Rioja region, according the local government, with most of them concentrated in the towns of Haro and Casalarreina. About another 25 cases are reported to have been confirmed in the Basque country. Although only six people in the region are being treated in hospital, the authorities said police would be \u201creinforcing home isolation controls\u201d in Haro and limiting access to the town\u2019s health centre. Greek Cypriot police fired pepper spray on Saturday after skirmishes broke out with protesters angry about a closed checkpoint on the ethnically-split island, according to witnesses. Authorities said the closure was a precaution against coronavirus, Reuters reports. Cyprus announced the temporary closure of four checkpoints on the divided island on 28 Feb, the first closure since border crossings were opened in 2003 after decades of estrangement. Witnesses said a group of people on the Turkish Cypriot side turned out in support of peace activists on the other side of the barricade calling for the checkpoint in the capital Nicosia to open. When open, it is used by hundreds of people every day. \u201cPeople were holding olive branches, and at some stage it appears someone started pushing,\u201d a witness at the gathering on the Turkish Cypriot side told Reuters. \u201cGreek Cypriot police pushed back and at that moment it appeared they used pepper spray.\u201d In a statement, Cyprus police said they made limited use of teargas to prevent demonstrators breaking a police cordon. Stones were also thrown at police, the statement said. The Italian Democratic party leader, Nicola Zingaretti, in a video about his own Covid-19 diagnosis My colleague Nicola Slawson has written a story about a letter that was sent to over 7,000 GP surgeries in England, informing them that NHS England will provide personal protective equipment to help staff deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Virologist Chris Smith, presenter of the BBC radio talk show The Naked Scientists, told the BBC in a Q&amp;A with members of the public that, at the moment, the level of circulation of coronavirus in the community in the UK was \u201cextremely low\u201d, and thus the risk of catching it currently \u201cremains extremely low\u201d. Smith said there was a very low chance of getting infected with coronavirus via items such as parcels. Asked whether the new coronavirus could mutate quickly into new, even more aggressive forms, meaning that patients would likely not enjoy immunity even after they had it, Smith said that, judging from currently available observations about the outbreak, Covid-19 was thankfully changing shape \u201conly very slowly\u201d. Toys for small children could be cleaned very effectively in the dishwasher, Smith advised. British health officials say the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has risen from 164 to 206, an increase of 42 from Friday. So far in Britain, two patients who had been confirmed as being infected with the virus have died, the health ministry and the Public Health England agency said. The Department of Health said more than 21,000 people had been tested for the virus. \u201cAs of 7am on 7 March 2020, 21,460 people have been tested in the UK, of which 21,254 were confirmed negative and 206 were confirmed as positive.\u201d Around 70 people were left trapped after a hotel used to quarantine people who have had recent contact with coronavirus patients collapsed in Quanzhou, eastern China, officials said. The Xinjia Hotel collapsed around 7.30pm local time (11.30am GMT) and around 23 people had been rescued by 9pm, according to a city government statement reported by AFP, with rescue efforts ongoing. The 80-room hotel was recently converted to a quarantine facility for people who had recent contact with coronavirus patients, the People\u2019s Daily state newspaper reported. Five more people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in Scotland, with a total of 16 now confirmed. Two new cases, confirmed on Saturday by the Scottish government, have been reported in Lanarkshire, with an increase of one case each in the Lothian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Grampian areas. The increase matches the jump seen in Scotland on Friday, the biggest in a single day since the first Scottish case was reported the previous Sunday. In total, 1,664 of the 1,680 tests in Scotland have come back negative. The England cricket team\u2019s head coach, Chris Silverwood, has said he is following the lead of Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp by referring questions over medical advice to experts. Seemingly, doctors have instructed the cricketers to keep their distance from members of the media in Sri Lanka as part of precautions against the coronavirus. There has been only one recorded case on the island to date, but the squad are taking a proactive approach, with all players and backroom staff provided with an \u201dimmunity pack\u201d for the Test tour, including hand sanitiser, sterilising wipes and nasal sprays, PA Media has reported. Handshakes have also been replaced by fist bumps. Post-match interviews on tour often take the form of pitch-side huddles but when Silverwood emerged to speak to two journalists after the opening day of the warm-up match in Katunayake, he did so while standing behind a blue table. The measure is designed to establish a buffer zone of around two metres. \u201cI\u2019m taking J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s lead here \u2013 I\u2019m not a doctor, so we do what we\u2019re told and follow the advice,\u201d he said, referring to the Klopp\u2019s comments earlier this week that journalists should ask experts about medical issues, not sportspeople. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same boat and we do our best to be as vigilant as possible,\u201d said Silverwood. David and Sally Abel, the British couple diagnosed with coronavirus onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, remain unable to return to the UK after their latest test came back positive. They were taken to a Japanese hospital from the cruise liner following a positive diagnosis of both the virus and pneumonia, after spending almost two weeks in quarantine in their cabin. In order to leave the hospital, both need three negative test results. Both had been tested twice previously \u2013 and the result had been negative \u2013 but during the most recent and final test, David Abel\u2019s response came back positive. David Abel, who has been filming a YouTube video diary of his experiences, said: Sally is now negative but is staying in Japan. Sally is now totally all clear, good to return to the UK. But she won\u2019t because I have had a positive. This is what happens. I have now got to go back to square one. I have another test on Monday. That is more than likely going to be negative. They have agreed to allow her to remain here so we can be company for one another. She won\u2019t get reinfected because we have got the same strain. Her immune system is now really well established. So it\u2019s the waiting game. The doctor, I think he was surprised. I think everyone else was expecting a negative. Confirmed cases in the Netherlands have risen by 60 to 188, health officials have said, after the country reported its first fatal case on Friday. The National Institute for Public Health said that most of the cases could be traced back to people who had recently travelled, mostly from northern Italy. In 29 cases, the path of infection was still being investigated. Elsewhere, in New South Wales, Australia, two more people have tested positive \u2013 bringing the day\u2019s number to eight and the state\u2019s total to 36 cases. The two new cases are a man in his 60s who recently returned from Italy and a second man in his 40s who is a known close contact of a previously confirmed case. In need of some light relief? Here\u2019s a montage of inventive new greetings designed to avoid the risk of passing coronavirus. And here\u2019s something a little longer, on the man caring for cats left alone in Wuhan. A former passenger of the Diamond Princess cruise ship who was infected with coronavirus has died, bringing the death toll from the ship to seven, Japanese public broadcaster NHK has said. The passenger, a man from outside Japan, died on Friday, according to Reuters. The US president, Donald Trump, remarks that he would prefer if passengers on the coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess cruise ship were not allowed to come on to US soil. France has reported another jump in coronavirus cases from 653 to 716, an increase of 63, according to the French health ministry. The spokesperson said that 11 people had now died in France because of the virus. The pope will make Sunday blessings via a streaming service from inside the Vatican, instead of appearing in person in St Peter\u2019s Square, in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The pope\u2019s general audiences are also to be streamed and no participants at papal morning masses are to be allowed until March 15, Reuters reports. The measures are being put in place to protect worshippers and the pope from infection. The pope has been suffering from a cold. As Greece steps up measures to contain an outbreak of coronavirus in the west of the country, there is growing concern over the stance of Greek Orthodox clerics, who have refused to postpone church services and suspend Christian rites. Although the Holy Synod, the church\u2019s ruling body, has endorsed many of the preventative measures, it has steadfastly rejected calls for practices such as holy communion to be halted. To the alarm of scientists, high-ranking bishops have invoked religious belief as a bulwark again Covid-19. In extraordinary exchanges on TV, clerics have argued that sacraments such as the holy eucharist should remain off-limits because they are God-given. \u201cWhoever believes that holy communion and the church are life has nothing to fear,\u201d the Bishop of Patras, Chrysostomos, told Open News. \u201cThere has been no case, anywhere, of a virus or any other illness being transmitted through holy communion.\u201d Prominent virologists in the country have also come out in support of the powerful religious institution. One well-known professor of infectious diseases said that while people aged 65 and over with underlying health issues would be better off avoiding church, she belonged to those who would still attend services, which in Greece are often held in crowded chapels. \u201cWhen you go to take holy communion, you don\u2019t take it out of habit but because it tis he body and blood of Christ,\u201d Eleni Giamarellou, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Athens, told local media. \u201cThose who want to take the sacraments should not fear that germs could be transmitted through holy communion.\u201d The stance has raised fears of further transmissions in a country where cases of coronavirus rose from eight on Monday to 46 today. In a statement, the Federation of Hospital Doctors\u2019 Unions slammed what it described as obscurantist views, suggesting that some professionals were putting religious beliefs before the strictures of profession. \u201cWe will be on the front line of defending scientific truth against metaphysical [theories] and every other kind of obscurantism,\u201d it said. Another leading epidemiologist has weighed in on the drop in cases in Hubei province, and what this might mean for the rest of the world. Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said it was a source of hope that China was currently seeing a substantial reduction in cases. \u201cHowever, there are still unanswered questions, for example about the total number of infections and even how protected previously recovered people are from new infections, before we can give confident descriptions on how to contain the disease,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see detailed, population-based (as opposed to clinic-based) serological investigations to be conducted. This would allow an individual\u2019s history of the disease, including inapparent (or asymptomatic) cases, to be evaluated. And this needs to be done in large areas where cases have been reported, in order to find out how many cases were missed by the surveillance programs.\u201d Hibberd added that such data could enable a more accurate analysis of the disease\u2019s severity following infection, \u201cin a similar way to how we are able to calculate this for Influenza\u201d. He warned governments around the globe to get the balance in their response to the outbreak, by adequately contributing to the world\u2019s attempts to delay the spread of coronavirus, while simultaneously \u201ckeeping their economies running as well as possible\u201d, instead of \u201cputting too much of their health care resources into Covid-19\u201d. A 26-year old woman returning from London has tested positive for coronavirus in Vietnam, after the country went 22 days with no new infections. The Vietnamese woman, the country\u2019s 17th case in total, has been quarantined and is undergoing treatment, the Vietnamese news outlet VN Express reported. Authorities said the patient had left Hanoi\u2019s Noi Bai airport on 15 February to visit family members living in London. Three days later, she travelled from London to Milan City, in the province of Lombardy, Italy, and returned to London on 20 February. On 25 February, the woman travelled from London to Paris to visit her sister. She contracted a cough on 29 February, but did not see a doctor. On 1 March, she reportedly felt body pain and fatigue, but it was unclear if she had a fever. The same day, she boarded a flight from London and landed in Hanoi on 2 March. As Vietnamese authorities held an emergency meeting about the case, and 17 doctors who had been in contact with the woman were being isolated, Public Health England said it could not comment on individual situations. Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of Italy\u2019s Democratic party (PD), which governs the country in coalition with the Five Star Movement (M5S), has tested positive for coronavirus. \u201cDoctors told me I have tested positive,\u2019\u2019 Zingaretti announced on Facebook. \u201cBut I\u2019m fine and I will stay home for the next few days. From here, I will continue to follow the work that needs to be done.\u201d Authorities in the US are preparing to test passengers on the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Grand Princess, after 21 people on board tested positive for the illness. Some 140 Britons are among those on board. US vice-president, Mike Pence, said on Friday that the Grand Princess, currently carrying more than 3,500 people, had been directed to a non-commercial port for testing, PA Media reports. So far 45 people on board the ship off the Californian coast have been tested, with 19 of those diagnosed with the virus being crew members. Lisa Egan, whose 90-year-old father is on board, called for the ship to be evacuated. \u201cKeeping people on board is going to be a death sentence for many,\u201d she told the Telegraph newspaper. Donald Trump appeared to suggest he wanted to see the ship remain off the coast to keep country\u2019s infection numbers down. An infectious disease specialist has warned against mass panic and stockpiling as Covid-19 infections continue to spread across the world. Abdu Sharkawy of the University of Toronto\u2019s Division of Infectious Disease wrote on Facebook that he was not scared of the virus, but feared the implications of people\u2019s egoism, which could result in a mass panic. What I am scared about is the loss of reason and wave of fear that has induced the masses of society into a spellbinding spiral of panic, stockpiling obscene quantities of anything that could fill a bomb shelter adequately in a post-apocalyptic world. I am scared of the N95 masks that are stolen from hospitals and urgent care clinics where they are actually needed for front line healthcare providers and instead are being donned in airports, malls, and coffee lounges, perpetuating even more fear and suspicion of others. I am scared that our hospitals will be overwhelmed with anyone who thinks they \u2018probably don\u2019t have it but may as well get checked out no matter what because you just never know...\u2019 and those with heart failure, emphysema, pneumonia and strokes will pay the price for overfilled ER waiting rooms with only so many doctors and nurses to assess. He added that he was scared about far reaching travel restrictions impacting communities harshly, and about \u201cepidemic fears\u201d limiting trade in multiple sectors. But mostly he was scared of the message children were told in this crisis. Instead of reason, rationality, openmindedness and altruism, we are telling them to panic, be fearful, suspicious, reactionary and self-interested. The fact is the virus itself will not likely do much harm when it arrives. But our own behaviors and \u2018fight for yourself above all else\u2019 attitude could prove disastrous. Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo Italy is considering setting up new quarantine red zones in northern regions amid increasing numbers of coronavirus cases, as the country grapples to contain Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of Covid-19 which had claimed 197 lives by Saturday. Authorities are also considering locking down the entire region of Lombardy. Rome has announced it is making \u20ac600m available to hire 20,000 new health professionals to cope with the emergency. The government is evaluating the possibility of prolonging the closure of schools until 3 April. Some 3,916 people are now infected, 620 more than Thursday, the emergency commissioner and civil protection chief Angelo Borrelli said on Friday. A cruise ship on the Nile in Egypt with more than 150 tourists and local crew was in quarantine on Saturday in the southern city of Luxor, after 12 people tested positive for coronavirus. A Taiwanese-American tourist who had previously been on the same ship tested positive when she returned to Taiwan. The World Health Organization informed Egyptian authorities, who tested everyone currently on the ship, AP reported. Health authorities in Egypt released a statement on Friday saying they had found a dozen Egyptian crew members on the ship had had contracted the fast-spreading virus, but did not show symptoms. The statement said they will be be put in isolation in a hospital on Egypt\u2019s north coast. The passengers, who include Americans, French and other nationalities, and crew will remain quarantined on the ship awaiting further test results. The coronavirus death toll in Iran has increased to 145, a rise of 21 over the past 24 hours, a health ministry official said. The number of people testing positive for the virus increased by more than 1,000 over the past 24 hours, reaching 5,823 on Saturday, Reuters reports. Malta\u2019s first case of coronavirus has been detected in a 12-year-old Italian girl who lives on the island, the health minister, Chris Fearne, said on Saturday. The girl tested positive for the illness early on Saturday and is receiving treatment in the infectious diseases unit of the state hospital, the minister said, adding she \u201cis doing well\u201d, Reuters reports. She returned on Tuesday from the northern Italian region of Trentino, passing through the capital Rome, with her parents and sister and reported symptoms on Friday. It was only on Thursday that the girl displayed symptoms associated with coronavirus. The whole family went into self-quarantine immediately, according to MaltaToday. Health authorities were alerted and immediately tested the girl, who resulted positive. Justin McCurry in Tokyo The number of coronavirus cases in South Korea exceeded 7,000 on Saturday, an increase of 448 from the previous day. More than half of the total are linked to a branch of a secretive religious sect in the south-eastern city of Daegu. The death toll in the country rose by two to 46, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The KCDC said it had confirmed 7,041 cases in South Korea, including a new cluster at an apartment complex in Daegu where some members of the sect live. Despite the significant increase in infections over the past 24 hours, Saturday\u2019s total was the third straight day of declines in the number of new cases in South Korea, the KCDC said. A report in Japan, meanwhile, warned that cancelling this summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics would slash the country\u2019s GDP by 1.4%. SMBC Nikko Securities, in Tokyo, projected that the Games would create demand worth 670bn yen (US$6.4bn), but added that cancellation due to the coronavirus outbreak would sap GDP by about 7.8tn yen. The firm said it believed the Games, which are due to open on 24 July, would have to be called off it the virus continued to spread through to July. While the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers insisted this week that they expected the Olympics to go ahead as scheduled, the coronavirus outbreak continues to disrupt preparations, with Greece\u2019s Olympic committee saying it will restrict the number of guests at next week\u2019s flame-lighting ceremony in Olympia. The Japan leg of the torch relay is scheduled to begin on 26 March in Fukushima, the scene of a nuclear meltdown nine years ago. The number of coronavirus cases in Germany has hit 684 on Saturday morning, an increase of 45 overnight since Friday evening, according to the Robert Koch Institute, the country\u2019s public health agency. Germany has now confirmed cases in 15 of its 16 states, while the biggest concentration is in the west and south of the country, with 346 in the state of North Rhine Westphalia and over 100 each in the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Germany\u2019s first cases were registered. A popular leisure centre in Glasgow has closed after a player at the rugby stadium, which is part of the complex, tested positive for coronavirus. It is understood the decision to close the Scotstoun Sports Campus was taken after a Scottish player due to compete in a women\u2019s Six Nations match at Scotstoun stadium against France on Saturday contracted Covid-19, PA Media reports. The match was subsequently cancelled and a spokeswoman for Glasgow Life \u2013 the agency which governs the city\u2019s leisure spaces \u2013 said \u201cappropriate measures\u201d were being taken. The player, who has not been named, is described as \u201cdoing well\u201d by James Robson, the chief medical officer of Scottish Rugby, and has been checked into a healthcare facility. Seven members of staff and players have self-isolated after taking medical advice. Scotland has so far had 11 confirmed cases of the illness, according to the Scottish government, with preparations continuing for a larger outbreak. Paul Hunter, a professor at the Norwich School of Medicine, at the University of East Anglia, said the drop in infections in Hubei was a good sign, echoing comments of senior WHO advisor Bruce Aylward. \u201cThe continuing drop in cases reported each day from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan is one of the few good news stories from the past week,\u201d he said. \u201cExcluding the days when clinical diagnosed cases and not only laboratory diagnosed cases were given as the daily totals, the epidemic in Hubei peaked on 5 February with 3,156 new cases. Since then there has been an almost steady decline in cases reported each day. Today\u2019s provisional figures show only 74 new cases from Hubei,\u201d Hunter added. China had demonstrated that the rigorous control measures put in place had been effective in delaying the spread of the infection globally, he said. \u201cUltimately, however, the infection did spread from China and is now spreading globally with several countries experiencing rapid increases in numbers. It looks like the UK is also at the start of a rapid growth in locally-acquired infections. However, the extra weeks that we have had to prepare, thanks to the control measures in Wuhan and Hubei generally, will make quite a difference to our ability to mitigate some of the more harmful effects of the epidemic,\u201d he said. All migrant workers in China are expected to return to work in early April, according to Chinese government officials, Se Young Lee, at Reuters, reports. 78 million rural workers who had travelled home for lunar new year have already returned to work, he says. As the number of confirmed cases in Spain rose to 401 on Monday, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, the outbreak has prompted Barcelona city council to postpone the Catalan capital\u2019s marathon, which was due to take place on 15 March. The event will now be staged on 25 October. Meanwhile, a prison worker at a facility in Aranjuez, 50km south of Madrid, has tested positive for the virus, and health authorities are investigating a cluster of cases that appear to be related to a funeral held in Vitoria, in the Basque country, two weeks ago. As many as 60 people who attended the funeral are reported to have picked up the virus. So far, eight people have died in total in Spain because of coronavirus. Children are just as likely to contract coronavirus as adults, according to a new Chinese study, countering the theory that kids are less susceptible to Covid-19. Research on community transmission of the virus showed a \u201csharply increasing proportion of infected children\u201d as the outbreak has progressed. Scientists analysed 365 patients in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen \u2013 including 74 clusters comprising 183 cases. Children aged under 15 made up just 2% of the cases before 24 January. But from 25 January to 5 February, the proportion of children went up to 13%. According to the researchers, the findings implied that children\u2019s risk of becoming infected could substantially rise with more exposure to the virus. Transmission of the virus within families was also a major factor, they said. A Briton stuck on the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California has told of her plight as 140 other British passengers brace for potential weeks of isolation. So far 21 people on the ship, with 3,500 people on board, have tested positive for coronavirus \u2013 just under half of all those who have been tested. The Grand Princess is being directed to a non-commercial port, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, said on Friday. Jackie Bissell, from Dartford, in Kent, told the Today programme that she had booked the cruise with a friend as part of her 70th birthday celebrations. She said that passengers had only been told on Thursday that there might be something wrong, as the ship\u2019s management implemented rigid procedures in the hope of limiting the outbreak. \u201cWe had a note popped through the door saying that this virus might be on the ship \u2013 they removed the salt, the pepper,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could touch absolutely nothing, if you wanted sugar in your tea or coffee they would come along and do it for you rather than you touching any of these items,\u201d she added. \u201cYou can just go out in the hall if someone taps the door. They put the food outside, drop your menus inside and that\u2019s about it.\u201d Bissell said she was \u201cvery comfortable\u201d and life on board \u201chas not been too bad\u201d so far. \u201cIt was a bit mishmash yesterday but today they\u2019ve got things a lot more organised,\u201d she said. Passengers relied on information from the news, she added. \u201cWe are waiting for the ship\u2019s captain \u2013 but I think he\u2019s as much in the dark as we are and he\u2019s said he\u2019s only giving us information as and when he gets it.\u201d Boris Johnson is due to chair a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra civil contingencies committee on Monday morning. It was now \u201chighly likely\u201d the infection will spread in a \u201csignificant way\u201d, a No 10 spokesman has said, according to PA Media. \u201cOfficials will therefore accelerate work on the delay phase of the government\u2019s plan,\u201d the spokesman added. Meanwhile, sports governing bodies and broadcasters have been called to a government meeting to discuss how to deal with the outbreak\u2019s possible impact on the sporting calendar. The meeting will cover various scenarios, such as holding events behind closed doors, should the virus continue to spread and gatherings of large numbers of people are banned. An Iranian MP has died from coronavirus, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Saturday, in an another sign the disease is spreading within state institutions. Iran is one of the countries outside China most affected by the epidemic. As of Friday, the country had reported 4,747 infections. The MP who died on Friday is Fatemeh Rahbar, a conservative lawmaker from Tehran, according to Tasnim. It did not say if she was included in the country\u2019s official toll of 124 deaths from the virus, given on Friday. On 2 March, Tasnim reported the death of Mohammad Mirmohammadi, a member of the Expediency Council, intended to resolve disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council, a governmental body that vets electoral candidates, among other duties. Iran\u2019s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, and another member of parliament, Mahmoud Sadeghi, have also said they have contracted the virus. Government ministers are expected to advise elderly people in the UK next week to visit relatives now before \u201csocial distancing\u201d policies are introduced. British pensioners could be warned to stay at home and will likely be told to avoid crowded areas, the Daily Telegraph reported. Bruce Aylward, the senior advisor to the head of the World Health Organization, has said the world should be encouraged by the decline in coronavirus cases in China\u2019s Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated. Countries hadn\u2019t yet learned the lesson that an effective response depends largely on speedily finding, isolating and testing suspected cases, however, he told the Today show. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find the cases very very quickly, get them isolated, find their close contacts, because those people are where the virus is, and if you get those isolated, quarantined, you\u2019re going to take the heat out of this outbreak,\u201d he said. Despite weeks of China making \u201cheroic\u201d efforts to contain the virus, countries were \u201cstill surprised when it hits their borders here and they still don\u2019t know how to isolate or find cases\u201d, Aylward said. As a church in Devon has been closed for a deep clean after a parishioner there became infected with coronavirus, Gina Radford, a vicar from south Devon and deputy chief medical officer for England until last year, told the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that churches across the country were trying to go about their normal business as much as possible, because of their \u201cvery important role\u201d in communities. Radford said during service, advice had been given about how to maintain appropriate hygiene as an individual, which also applied to priests administering communion. It was up to priests to decide whether they it would be necessary to \u201cwithdraw the common cup\u201d during communion, she said, so that everyone would not be drinking from the same chalice. Congregations had been reminded that they could decide to just take the wafer, \u201cthat is full communion\u201d, she added. \u201cWe do have to remember that churches are places of meeting and welcome and comfort, and at the moment [...] we are wanting to encourage people to have a balanced approach [to the outbreak] and to go about life as normal as they can for as long as they can.\u201d As millions of people wonder whether their travel plans and holidays will be affected by coronavirus over the coming weeks and months, my colleague Patrick Collinson has put together a useful advice guide about all things travel insurance, holiday deposits, flight bookings and more. My colleagues Peter Beaumont, Lorenzo Tondo and Kim Willsher have written an analysis on how human error helped spread the virus across the globe, and how avoiding small mistakes can mitigate the crisis. The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has agreed to declare a state of national public health emergency following the local transmission of coronavirus, according to Senator Bong Go, CNN Philippines reports. Here\u2019s what has happened in coronavirus news so far today: Twenty-one people tested positive for coronavirus onboard the Grand Princess cruise ship stranded off the California coast. Of these, 19 were crew members. The US confirmed its first East Coast deaths, as two people died in Florida. The number of cases worldwide has passed 100,000, as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d. Europe\u2019s infections doubled in the last three days, to 7,300 on Friday. China\u2019s exports have fallen sharply. China\u2019s exports plummeted in the first two months of this year on the back of a coronavirus epidemic that forced businesses to suspend operations, disrupting the world\u2019s supply chains. In Victoria, Australia a doctor has been confirmed as the eleventh case of the virus for the state. He treated 70 patients despite displaying flu-like symptoms shortly after travelling from America. The number of cases worldwide has passed 100,000, as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d. South Korea\u2019s diplomatic spat with Japan escalated, as the country suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan. South by South West was cancelled. The annual technology and culture festival said its March events would not go ahead amid fears it could help to spread the virus in Austin, in Texas. Two South Korean apartment buildings heavily occupied by members of a sect linked to most of the country\u2019s coronavirus cases have been quarantined after dozens of residents tested positive for the disease, an official said on Saturday. The country, which has the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases outside China, reported 174 new infections, taking its total to 6,767. Another two deaths were reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bringing the toll to 44. The apartment complex in Daegu \u2013 the country\u2019s fourth-largest city and epicentre of its outbreak \u2013 was placed under lockdown after 46 residents were confirmed to have the virus, mayor Kwon Young-jin said. More than 140 people live in the two buildings, including 94 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which is often accused of being a cult and is linked to most of South Korea\u2019s infections. The NBA is preparing its players for the eventuality that they may have to play in empty stadiums to no fans, sports journalist Shams Charania and the New York Times report. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday that the number of confirmed case of coronavirus in the country had jumped to four. \u201cThree positive cases of coronavirus have been registered in western Herat province of Afghanistan,\u201d Wahidullah Mayar, spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health told Reuters, adding that of the 36 cases tested in Kabul, 33 had come back negative. Herat borders neighbouring Iran, which is one of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus outside of China, with more than 4,000 cases and dozens of deaths. Mayar expressed concern about the vulnerability of Afghanistan\u2019s border with Iran. Millions of Afghans live and work in the neighbouring country and many are facing increasing political and economic pressure to return. Mayar said the cost of testing would be a strain on Afghanistan\u2019s resource-strapped health system in an economy damaged by years of conflict. Each test kit - which would test around 50 cases - cost around $1600 (or $32 per test), he said. One of 2,400 passengers on board the Grand Princess cruise ship stranded off the Californian coast is a retiree with stage-4 cancer. Kari Kolstoe, 60, from North Dakota told Reuters she and her husband, Paul, 61, had looked forward to the Grand Princess cruise to Hawaii as a brief, badly needed respite from the grind of medical intervention she has endured for the past 18 months. Now facing the prospect of a two-week quarantine far from their home in Grand Forks, she worries their getaway cruise will end up causing a fateful delay in her next round of chemotherapy, scheduled to begin early next week. \u201cIt\u2019s very unsettling,\u201d she said in a cellphone interview from the ship on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s still a worry that I\u2019m going to not get back.\u201d In South Korea, more than 60% of the total cases are linked to a secretive church at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak, health authorities said. Reuters report the death toll also rose to 46 from 44, Kwon Jun-wook, the Korea Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention\u2019s (KCDC) deputy director told a briefing on Saturday. South Korea\u2019s cases rose to 6,767 on Saturday, up by 174 from late Friday. The number of people infected with the contagious disease has spiked in South Korea since mid-February when a 61-year-old woman known as \u201cPatient 31\u201d tested positive after attending religious services at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southeastern city of Daegu. A new smaller cluster case reported on Saturday at an apartment complex in Daegu, where some members of the church live, KCDC said. \u201c63.5% of the total cases is related to the Shincheonji Church and its members, but there is a possibility that new cases increase as tests are still underway,\u201d said the deputy director. The number of infections in Europe has more than doubled in just three days, the New York Times reports, as confirmed cases reached over 7,300 on Friday. According to Johns Hopkins, here are the ten countries in Europe with the highest number of infections. Italy: 4,636 Germany: 670 France: 653 Spain: 401 Switzerland: 214 UK: 164 Netherlands: 128 Belgium: 109 Norway: 108 Sweden: 101 Just an update on the global coronavirus numbers today, from Johns Hopkins. Total cases are now at 102,188. Of those, 80,651 are in mainland China. Total deaths: 3,491. Of those, 2,959 were in Hubei province, Mainland China. The countries with the next highest numbers of confirmed cases are: South Korea: 6,767 Iran: 4,747 Italy: 4,636 Germany has the next highest number of confirmed cases, but there is a fair gap between its numbers and those in Italy: Germany: 670 We learned four valuable lessons from Ebola. They can help us fight the coronavirus, writes Chris Withington, who works in the humanitarian and emergency response unit of Care Australia. \u201cCoronavirus is a global crisis that is going to require a global solution. The lessons from Ebola are there for us to use \u2013 but will we?\u201d The United Arab Emirates reported 15 additional cases on Saturday of a new and fast-spreading virus, bringing the total number of infections in the country to 45. The Health Ministry said 13 of the new cases had recently arrived from abroad, and they include three Emirati citizens, two Saudis, two Ethiopians and two Iranians, as well as a person each from Thailand, China, Morocco and India. The statement gave no further details on where the travellers had come, when they had arrived to the UAE and which ports of entry they had come in from. The other two cases, an Emirati and an Egyptian, were diagnosed after being monitored in connection with a cycling tour in the country that was halted a week ago after two Italians were first confirmed as having the virus. The emirate of Dubai is home to the world\u2019s busiest airport for international travel. American jails are on high alert for coronavirus. Below are sone of the measures that are being taken, and some of the particular challenges faced by prisoners as they seek to protect themselves. There have been no reports of Covid-19 inside US jails or prisons. But more people are incarcerated per capita here than in any other country in the world and prisons have become hot spots in other nations touched by the outbreak, AP reports. Inmates share small cells with total strangers, use toilets just a few feet from their beds, and are herded into day rooms where they spend hours at a time together. Practicing even the most simple hygiene, such as washing hands, is not a given in such environments. Hand sanitizer is often treated as contraband because it contains alcohol. Inmates go in groups to court, where they wait together in cramped holding areas. Many are poor, meaning that when they\u2019re released they often must get on public buses or trains to get home. In New York City, the Department of Correction is cleaning and sanitizing cells, common spaces, showers and transport buses more regularly. Anyone sick at Rikers Island, the notorious New York City jail where Harvey Weinstein is being held, is screened and could be sent to an area hospital or the department\u2019s communicable disease unit. In Miami, any newly arrested person suspected of having the virus will be diverted to a hospital. The department has also secured space for a medical quarantine for any of the 3,900 inmates already in custody if it becomes necessary. Prison staff are being trained in many facilities on how to recognize symptoms and are being given supplies for protection, such as masks, gloves and eye protection. Throughout the country, criminal attorneys are meeting with clients via video conference and exercising caution over how they handle and exchange legal documents with inmates. Despite the lack of much good coronavirus news in our liveblog today, here are precisely nine reasons to be reassured when it comes to the status of the outbreak so far. As we are hit with minute-by-minute updates from around the world, experiencing the advance of Covid-19 in real time \u2013 news alerts, huge headlines, social media hysteria \u2013 there\u2019s a risk that we might lose some essential context. Yes, this virus is obviously a massive challenge: medical, political and \u2013 perhaps most strikingly at present \u2013 social and economic. But it is worth remembering the world has never had better tools to fight it, and that if we are infected, we are unlikely to die from it. Here, courtesy of a number of scientists but mainly Ignacio L\u00f3pez-Go\u00f1i, a professor of microbiology and virology at the University of Navarra in Spain, are what might hopefully prove a few reassuring facts about the new coronavirus: \u2018It isn\u2019t the Thunderdome, it isn\u2019t Mad Max\u2019 Australia\u2019s toilet paper tensions continued on Saturday, this time with hair pulling at a Sydney Woolworths. NSW police had to be called to a western Sydney supermarket on Saturday morning after a fight broke out among three women over toilet paper. On Saturday afternoon NSW police asked the women involved to come forward, and warned shoppers to behave themselves. \u201cWe just ask that people don\u2019t panic like this when they go out shopping,\u201d police said. \u201cThere is no need for it. It isn\u2019t the Thunderdome, it isn\u2019t Mad Max, we don\u2019t need to do that. Here\u2019s what has happened in coronavirus news so far today: The US has confirmed its first East Coast deaths, as two people died in Florida. The number of cases worldwide has passed 100,000, as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d. 21 people are infected on board the Grand Princess cruise ship, currently quarantined off the California coast. In Victoria, Australia a doctor has been confirmed as the eleventh case of the virus for the state. He treated 70 patients despite displaying flu-like symptoms shortly after travelling from America. The number of cases worldwide has passed 100,000, as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d. New Zealand has confirmed its fifth case, a 40-year-old woman who contracted the virus from her husband, who was the country\u2019s third case South Korea\u2019s diplomatic spat with Japan escalated, as the country suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan. The first case in Central America was confirmed. Costa Rica said a 49-year-old woman from the United States had been infected with the virus. South by South West was cancelled. The annual technology and culture festival said its March events would not go ahead amid fears it could help to spread the virus in Austin, in Texas. In Australia, just a quick summary of that presser with deputy chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly: The Australian government will be releasing 260,ooo masks from its stockpile The government is offering assistance to Indonesia as the Australian neighbour works to contain the spread of the virus there. It is looking \u201cincreasingly unlikely\u201d that Australia will be able to completely contain the virus over the long term The government is considering stockpiling some pharmaceuticals, including antibacterial and antiviral medicines With regard to the coronavirus-infected Melbourne doctor who treated 70 patients despite exhibiting flu-like symptoms, Kelly says: \u201cDon\u2019t soldier on... we expect our health care workforce particularly to take this onboard\u201d. Kelly also said that the government is looking into the potential correlation between high rates of coronavirus spread and winter conditions. Australia is entering its winter season, so the government will be watching that closely, he says. In Canberra, Australia deputy chief medical officer Kelly says over the longer term there is a \u201crange of possibilities that may take place. We may be able to take it under control but that\u2019s looking increasingly unlikely... it may become endemic, so something that comes back around each winter.\u201d We\u2019re still in Canberra, Australia for the moment, where deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly is giving a general update on the status of preparations for managing the spread of the virus. Kelly says Australia is offering support to Indonesia for testing and other control measures for the coronavirus outbreak. In Canberra, Australia, deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly says the government is considering stockpiling some antibiotics and antivirals to a stockpile, though none of either type of pharmaceutical have been proved to be effective against coronavirus. In Canberra, Australia we\u2019re hearing more from the Department of Health on the Melbourne doctor who treated 70 patients despite exhibiting flu-like symptoms. The general principle is, as it is in flu season, \u201cDon\u2019t soldier on...and we expect our health care workforce particularly to take this onboard,\u201d deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly says. In Australia, 260,000 masks are to be released from stockpile, authorities say. We\u2019ll have more updates shortly. China\u2019s exports plummeted in the first two months of this year on the back of a coronavirus epidemic that forced businesses to suspend operations, disrupting the world\u2019s supply chains. Exports fell 17.2 percent, the biggest drop since February 2019 during the trade war with the United States, and imports dropped 4 percent, according to official data released Saturday. China\u2019s trade surplus with the US - a key point of contention in the trade dispute between the two countries - plunged 40 percent in the first two months, from US$42 billion last year to US$25.4 billion. Chinese authorities said last month that January and February\u2019s data would be combined. This is in line with how some other indicators are released, to smooth over distortions from the Lunar New Year break. In an early sign of the economic impact to come, China\u2019s manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level on record in February, with non-manufacturing activity plummeting as well. Florida Health Department says in statement that two people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in the state, Associated Press reports. The deaths are the first on the East Coast, according to the New York Times. The Australian town of Cairns is deathly quiet in the wake of the coronavirus, Aaron Smith reports for the Guardian. The combined economic impacts of the coronavirus outbreak and the bushfires have kept visitors away from Australia and nowhere is this more acutely felt than north Queensland. The wet season from January has traditionally been a low season for the Queensland tourism industry in the far north, so the growing Chinese market has been a much-needed boost for a region in recent years. However, since Chinese New Year this year, Chinese tourist numbers have dried up because of cancelled inbound flights from China. It\u2019s been a tough blow for region already suffering a struggling market since last year\u2019s floods, the summer\u2019s bushfires and the international attention on coral bleaching. In Sydney, Australia this morning, a scuffle broke out at a Woolworths supermarket over \u2013 what else? \u2013 toilet paper. A video posted to social media shows three women involved in a short scuffle over a 24-pack of toilet paper in a Chullora store. Now, NSW police have issued a sharp warning and appealed for information regarding those involved. \u201cIt\u2019s not Mad Max, you don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d New South Wales police have said. Officers spoke to a 49-year-old woman who had reportedly been assaulted. She was uninjured. No arrests have been made and as inquiries continue comic police are appealing to identify the women involved. As inquiries continue police are appealing. Violence of this nature will not be tolerated and anyone involved in this behaviour may be committing an offence and find themselves before the court. In Australia, Sydney police are appealing for information surrounding an argument that broke out at a Woolworths over toilet paper. A spokesperson is speaking now, we\u2019ll be following live. The city of Bethlehem is under lockdown after the first Palestinian cases of the deadly coronavirus were discovered there and authorities announced a state of emergency. Palestinian Health Minister Mai al-Kaila said a total of 16 cases of coronavirus had been detected in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after nine new cases were discovered in Bethlehem, official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported Friday evening. The Palestinian government announced a month-long state of emergency late Thursday after the first seven cases were identified, while the Israeli defence ministry said it had imposed emergency measures on Bethlehem, with everybody \u201cforbidden from entering or leaving the city\u201d. It added that the lockdown had been imposed \u201cin coordination with the Palestinian Authority\u201d. The Church of the Nativity, built on the site Christians believe was the birthplace of Jesus, was closed on Thursday and along with other sites is expected to be shuttered for a month. The streets of Bethlehem and Ramallah, where the Palestinian government is based, were near-empty on Friday morning, with most shops closed, AFP journalists said. Israel controls all entrances to the West Bank from the Jewish state but the Palestinian government has limited autonomy in cities. The Palestinian health ministry said the cases had first been detected at a hotel in the Bethlehem area. Coronavirus confirmed in two attendees at US pro-Israel summit Influential US pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC said Friday that two people who attended its annual Washington conference alongside dozens of lawmakers had tested positive for coronavirus. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee said in an email to attendees, speakers and congressional offices that the pair had traveled from New York to go to the March 1-3 event. \u201cWe have confirmed that at least two Policy Conference attendees from New York have tested positive for the Coronavirus,\u201d AIPAC said in the message, posted to its Twitter account. The event attracted high-profile attendees including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Democratic former White House hopeful Mike Bloomberg. About 18,000 people had been expected to travel from across the US to attend the conference, which typically attracts around two-thirds of the members of Congress. Attendees swamped Capitol Hill in their hundreds during the event, as is the custom. \u201cIf you test positive for Coronavirus, we urge you to inform your local health authorities so they can properly coordinate the response to this situation with the appropriate health authorities,\u201d AIPAC said. Facebook said on Friday it is closing its London offices until Monday after a visiting employee from Singapore was diagnosed with coronavirus. \u201cAn employee based in our Singapore office who has been diagnosed with Covid-19 visited our London offices February 24-26, 2020,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWe are therefore closing our London offices until Monday for deep cleaning and employees are working from home until then.\u201d Facebook also advised employees based in the affected area of its Singapore office to work from home until March 13. It said it had immediately closed the area for deep cleaning. The Hong Kong government has warned the city\u2019s residents to consider deferring all non-essential travel outside of the territory. It had already placed a red alert - the second-highest warning in Hong Kong - on travelling to South Korea and the Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto regions of Italy, Reuters reports. However, the government said all travelers out of Hong Kong should now contemplate putting their plans on hold. Hong Kong has reported 106 cases of coronavirus and two deaths in the past six weeks, according to the city\u2019s health officials. Just three of the territory\u2019s 13 borders with mainland China remain open following the announcement of closures by Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam on February 3. COVID-19 is the name of the illness caused by the new coronavirus. \u201cAs the transmission of COVID-19 virus has been increasing around the world, they are advised to consider delaying all non-essential travel outside Hong Kong,\u201d the CHP said in a statement published on a government website on Friday. Mexican authorities on Friday said they have identified a sixth person infected with coronavirus, a 71 year-old man in the State of Mexico who recently traveled to northern Italy, Reuters reports. Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said the man, who suffers from hypertension, arrived in Mexico in \u201cgrave condition\u201d and is currently hospitalized in stable condition. Lopez-Gatell said two of the man\u2019s family members have been tested to check for the infection, with the results still awaited. In Australia, New South Wales Health confirmed six fresh cases of coronavirus on Saturday, taking the state\u2019s total to diagnosed cases to 34. NSW Health authorities are seeking to track down passengers on a Qatar Airways flight from Doha after a man in his 70s was among six new cases of the deadly virus diagnosed in the state. All of the new cases were close contacts or family members of previously confirmed cases except for a male who contracted the virus after visiting Italy. The man fell ill day the day after flying back to Sydney via Qatar before he was diagnosed this week. NSW Health said they were attempting to contact passengers on Qatar Airways flight QR908 which left Doha on March 1. \u201cScreening continues at Sydney International Airport,\u201d NSW Health said in a statement. \u201cAs at midnight 7 March, a total of 23,814 passengers have been assessed, and a total of 77 were sent for testing.\u201d Males in their 20s, 40s and 50s and two females in their 40s took the NSW total of confirmed coronavirus cases to 34 on Saturday with another 545 under investigation. We\u2019re just trying to confirm the number of infections for Turkmenistan. Radio Free Europe reported two days ago that \u201cMedical sources in Turkmenistan claim[ed] at least two Turkmen have tested positive for the coronavirus at a hospital near the capital, Ashgabat,\u201d but the Johns Hopkins database \u2013 which we use to confirm cases \u2013 does not yet show these. U.S. has raised its travel alert levels for Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan The U.S. State Department on Friday raised its alert level for travel to Azerbaijan, warning Americans to reconsider travel there due to a coronavirus outbreak and response measures implemented by the country\u2019s government. The State Department also raised its alert level for travel to Turkmenistan due to travel restrictions and quarantine procedures instituted in response to the virus. Neither country has reported many cases \u2013 Azerbaijan has six, according to Johns Hopkins \u2013 but both border Iran, which has been hard hit by the coronavirus. The U.S. State Department slapped a travel advisory warning on Iran last month, urging Americans not to travel there. India is bracing for a potential explosion of coronavirus cases as authorities rush to trace, test and quarantine contacts of 31 people confirmed to have the disease, the Associated Press reports. It is screening international travelers at 30 airports and has already tested more than 3,500 samples. The Indian army is preparing at least five large-scale quarantine centers. India has shut schools, stopped exporting key pharmaceutical ingredients and urged state governments to cancel public festivities for Holi, the Hindu springtime holiday in which people douse each other with colored water and paint. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s canceled travel plans to Brussels for an India-EU summit amid a rising caseload in Belgium, and tweeted that he would not attend any Holi festivities. Experts fear these precautions won\u2019t be enough for India\u2019s beleaguered, under-funded and under-staffed health system to stave off an epidemic. Facebook\u2019s director of product management has announced on Twitter that the company is banning ads selling medical face masks. In the US, CNN reports that the passengers on board the Grand Princess cruise ship currently quarantined off the California coast were not told of the number of infections on board before US Vice President Mike Pence announced it. The United Nations World Tourism Organisation says international tourist arrivals are expected to drop 3% due to to the new coronavirus. \u201cThis first assessment expects that Asia and the Pacific will be the worst affected region, with an anticipated fall in arrivals of 9.0 percent to 12.0 percent,\u201d the organisation said in a statement. The number of international tourist arrivals is expected to drop sharply this year, the UNWTO said Friday, reversing a previous forecast for a substantial increase. The United Nations\u2019 UNWTO said in a statement that arrivals were now projected to fall by 1.0-3.0 percent in 2020, instead of a previous forecast of growth of 3.0-4.0 percent. This will lead to an estimated loss of US$30-50 billion in international tourism receipts, the body said. If confirmed, this will be the first annual decline in the number of international tourist arrivals since 2009 when the global economic crisis hit the travel and tourism sector hard. In the US, Hawaii\u2019s KITV4 is reporting that the American state has confirmed its first case of coronavirus in one of the passengers on board the grand princess cruise ship. Local department of health officials say the man had no close contact with residents on the islands. The grand princess stopped at Nawiliwili, Honolulu, Lahaina, and Hilo during its voyage, KITV4 reports. Argentina has eight confirmed cases of coronavirus, all brought by people who had recently been in Europe, the Health Ministry said on Friday, adding uncertainty to an economy already slammed by recession, high inflation and unsustainable debt. \u201cArgentina continues in the containment stage, with eight confirmed cases with a history of travel to transmission areas,\u201d the Health Ministry said in a statement. The Argentine patients range between age 23 and 72, it said. The country is a major world food supplier struggling to pull out of recession and tame 50% inflation as the government hunkers down for what promise to be tough restructuring talks with bondholders. Fellow South American countries Colombia, Chile and Peru announced their first confirmed cases of coronavirus this week, and a number of cases have been confirmed in neighboring Brazil. In the US, Reuters reports that the United States is considering ways to discourage U.S. travellers from taking cruises, as part of a broader Trump administration effort to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to four officials familiar with the situation. The officials, who asked to remain anonymous, said no decision had been made. The discussions were taking place ahead of a meeting this weekend between Vice President Mike Pence, who is in charge of leading the U.S. response to the coronavirus, and the cruise industry. The cruise industry contributed nearly $53 billion to the U.S. economy in 2018 and generated more than 420,000 jobs, according to an analysis by the Cruise Lines International Association. During a press conference at the White House on Friday evening, Pence said elderly people should use \u201ccommon sense and caution\u201d when planning a trip on a cruise ship. \u201cCruise ships represent a unique challenge for health officials,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be working closely with some great American companies in the cruise line industry to enhance and strengthen the screening procedures.\u201d Shares in Royal Caribbean Cruises, Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings have fallen around 50% since January. Kuwait has suspended all flights to and from Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Bangladesh, Philippines, India, and Sri-Lanka for a week starting on Saturday, Kuwait\u2019s civil aviation directorate said in a tweet. Kuwait also banned entry of anyone who has been in the seven countries in the last two weeks except for Kuwaitis coming from the seven countries, who will be allowed entry but will have to submit to quarantine procedures, the civil aviation directorate added. About a quarter of China\u2019s new confirmed cases and almost all of those outside Wuhan originated outside the country on Friday, according to official data. Mainland China had 99 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Friday, the country\u2019s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Saturday, down from 143 cases a day earlier and marking the lowest number since Jan. 20, when the NHC started to publish nationwide figures. China also reported 28 deaths from those with the virus, all from Hubei province. Outside of central China\u2019s Hubei province, there were 25 new confirmed cases reported on March 6, of which 24 came from outside China. Most of these were in China\u2019s northwestern Gansu province, from quarantined passengers who entered the provincial capital of Lanzhou on commercial flights from Iran between March 2 and March 5. The capital Beijing reported four new cases on Friday, of which three came from Italy, according to a notice from the Beijing health commission posted on its official Weibo account on Saturday. There were also three cases in Shanghai that originated abroad, and one in Guangdong province on Friday, according to the National Health Commission. The total nationwide number of cases that originated outside China reached 60 as of the end of Friday. For the second day in a row, there were no new infections in Hubei outside of the provincial capital of Wuhan. Two federal health screeners at Los Angeles International Airport have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to an email sent to their colleagues today and seen by Reuters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees were conducting secondary screenings of passengers arriving from overseas, including from China, and have been directed to self-quarantine until March 17, the email said. \u201cAt this time, we cannot confirm where these two screeners were exposed,\u201d said the email, which was sent by a senior CDC official. \u201cLet us keep our colleagues in our thoughts during this period.\u201d South Korea on Saturday reported 174 additional coronavirus cases from late Friday, taking the national tally to 6,767, the Korea Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention said. The death toll remained unchanged at 44 from late Friday, the KCDC added. In the US, Donald Trump used a freewheeling press conference on Friday, intended to provide updates on the coronavirus, as an opportunity to attack Democrats, praise his own intelligence, lash out at CNN and spread false and misleading information about the status of the outbreak. Amazon is working to identify and prosecute coronavirus price gougers Amazon.com Inc said on Friday it is working with state attorneys general to identify and prosecute third-party sellers who are taking advantage of fears of the spreading coronavirus to engage in price-gouging on the Amazon website. In a letter to U.S. Senator Edward Markey, the company said it has removed more than 530,000 product offers over price-gouging concerns as well as \u201cmillions\u201d of products that make unsupported claims about their ability to fight coronavirus. Markey wrote Amazon earlier this week asking the company to stop third-party sellers from ramping up prices for items like Purell hand sanitizers as people seek to protect themselves from the coronavirus. Markey said he wrote the letter after finding that a pack of 24 2-ounce bottles of Purell, which should cost $10, was selling for $400 on the company\u2019s website. The number of cases in Japan grew to 1,112 on Friday, with 55 new infections reported from Yamaguchi prefecture in the southwest to Hokkaido in the north, according to the national broadcaster NHK. Thirteen of the new cases were people who visited a live music venue in Osaka or their family members, NHK said. The spread of the disease has raised doubts about whether Tokyo will be able to host the Olympics this summer, but the government has insisted the Games will go ahead as scheduled. The number of new cases of the virus fell to 505 in South Korea on Friday, from 760 the previous day, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said authorities had almost finished tests on more than 200,000 followers of a church in southeastern Daegu at the centre of the outbreak. The number of South Korean visitors to Japan fell nearly 26% last year to 5.6 million, the first drop since Japan\u2019s tsunami and nuclear disaster in 2011, Japanese tourism officials say. South Korea said on Friday it would suspend visas and visa waivers for Japan in response to Tokyo\u2019s own travel restrictions on Koreans, as fears over the spreading coronavirus rekindled a feud between the neighbours dating back to before World War Two. South Korea\u2019s curbs, which take effect on Monday, also include special entry procedures for non-Japanese foreigners arriving from Japan, Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young told a briefing. At present, Japanese can visit South Korea for 90 days without a visa. Seoul had earlier summoned the Japanese envoy to protest against Japan\u2019s decision to quarantine South Korean visitors for two weeks. Japan is among almost 100 countries to impose curbs on travellers from South Korea, which has suffered 44 deaths and 6,593 infections in the biggest outbreak outside China, where the virus emerged late last year. In case you missed this story, Victorian health authorities are trying to contact about 70 patients of a Melbourne doctor who has developed coronavirus after returning from the US. The doctor is the state\u2019s 11th case of the novel coronavirus and the state health minister, Jenny Mikakos, says he attended work and treated patients after her was symptomatic. \u201cI have to say I am flabbergasted that a doctor that has flulike symptoms has presented to work,\u201d Mikakos said. The doctor returned from the US on 29 February and saw approximately 70 patients last week between Monday 2 March and Friday 6 March at the Toorak Clinic on Malvern Road. The clinic has been since closed. Patients have been contacted by text message, phone or email and two patients the doctor treated in a Malvern nursing home have been isolated. All patients the doctor saw and all clinic staff have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days. The clinic\u2019s other patients have been asked to monitor their symptoms. Passengers on the flight with the doctor would be contacted, Mikakos said. Twenty-one people aboard a cruise ship that was barred from docking in San Francisco have tested positive for coronavirus, U.S. officials said on Friday, as half a dozen states reported their first cases of the fast-spreading respiratory disease. Vice President Mike Pence, who is running the White House\u2019s response to the outbreak, said at a news conference that 19 crew members and two passengers out of 46 people tested so far on the Grand Princess ship had the virus. He said the vessel with about 3,400 passengers and crew would be taken to a non-commercial port where everyone on board would be tested. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would rather have passengers remain on board the vessel, but that he would let others make the decision whether to let the passengers disembark. \u201cI\u2019d rather have them stay on, personally, but I fully understand if they want to take them off,\u201d Trump told reporters after touring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Welcome to today\u2019s coronavirus liveblog. As infections continue to spread around the world, authorities are racing to trace the contacts of confirmed cases. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: The number of cases worldwide has passed 100,000, as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d. Iran reported a sharp rise in cases and threatened to use force to stop people travelling between cities. Donald Trump signed a $8.3bn emergency spending bill to deal with the virus, despite insisting that it \u201cwill go away\u201d. In Victoria, Australia a doctor has been confirmed as the eleventh case of the virus for the state. He treated 70 patients despite displaying flu-like symptoms shortly after travelling from America. New Zealand has confirmed its fifth case, a 40-year-old woman who contracted the virus from her husband, who was the country\u2019s third case The UK confirmed its second fatality after tests performed on a man who died on Thursday came back positive. Medical staff and patients at the hospital where he died were placed in isolation amid family fears he was not isolated quickly enough. The first case in Central America was confirmed. Costa Rica said a 49-year-old woman from the United States had been infected with the virus. South by South West was cancelled. The annual technology and culture festival said its March events would not go ahead amid fears it could help to spread the virus in Austin, in Texas. A Scottish international rugby players tested positive. Scotland women\u2019s Six Nations rugby match against France was postponed after it was confirmed a Scottish player was a sufferer.

      "body": "<p>Born in London, Evie Wyld, 39, grew up in Australia and south London, where she lives now. Her debut novel, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/after-the-fire-a-still-small-voice-9780099535836.html\" title=\"\">After the Fire, </a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/after-the-fire-a-still-small-voice-9780099535836.html\" title=\"\">a Still Small Voice</a></em> (2009), won the John Llewellyn Rhys prize; her next, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/30/evie-wyld-birds-singing-review\" title=\"\">All the Birds, Singing</a></em><em>,</em> was published in 2013, the year she was named one of Granta\u2019s best young British novelists. Her new book, <em>The Bass Rock</em>, published later this month, tells the story of three interlinked women across several centuries and explores the ways that men seek to subjugate women and how women fight back. In the 1700s, Sarah is accused of being a witch; after the second world war, Ruth marries a widower and becomes a mother to his sons; and in the present day Viv is lost and mourning her father.</p> <p><strong>How did the book\u2019s structure come about?</strong><br>I had a newborn at the time I started writing it five years ago. I was writing when he was asleep. A couple of hours in the morning, an hour in the afternoon. I didn\u2019t really have time to sit down and think, you know, what am I working on?</p> <p>So I ended up writing lots of different time frames and probably about two other novels underneath this one. I wasn\u2019t even sure if it was all the same book. It was really when #MeToo happened that I saw I was writing about the same thing. The same problem, just a slightly different shape, I suppose.</p> <p><strong>Which of the women came to you first?</strong><br>Ruth\u2019s story in the 1950s, because she\u2019s based on my British [paternal] grandmother [Wyld\u2019s mother is Australian]. She shares a timeline with Ruth. She married very young, a widower with two little boys, and then became a housewife. She was really smart, and a very interesting woman in a lot of ways, but I also knew her as an alcoholic and a chain-smoker, and someone who hadn\u2019t really done anything with their brain and was just bored with life. Then when she died I inherited her photo albums and got these pictures of a woman who was very different from that. There were honeymoon pictures where she\u2019s all kind of sexy and involved in life and interested. I started going down this path, imagining who she was before she was the woman I came to know.</p> <p><strong>Where does </strong><strong>the rage and anger expressed in the book </strong><strong>come from?</strong><br>I think it\u2019s the same anger and rage that every woman has deep down, squashed down somewhere. It probably comes from it being ingrained into us that we\u2019re not supposed to be angry, or we aren\u2019t angry, we\u2019re \u201chysterical\u201d, \u201cdifficult\u201d. There are quite a few murders in the book and one of the things I was really interested in was how women historically are always told to ignore their sixth sense, the hairs going up on the back of their neck, that feeling of discomfort. Whether it\u2019s as a child when you have to cuddle the uncle, or just that feeling that the worst thing in the world would be to be impolite. So when somebody comes up to you on the tube and asks you what you\u2019re reading, and wants to butt into your life and you feel like if I say \u201cplease leave me alone\u201d, what\u2019s going to happen is this tirade of \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be friendly\u201d. All the feeling that you don\u2019t even register any more \u2013 every time somebody passes you on an empty street in the dark and you have this sort of countdown in your head and you\u2019re like, \u201cNope, it\u2019s all right, I don\u2019t need the keys in the fist.\u201d And the fact that that is just part of your life.</p> <p><strong>Have you experienced any of the horrendous things that occur in the book?</strong><br></p> <p>I\u2019ve had my drink spiked, which, thankfully, didn\u2019t end badly. It was at a publishing party in London. What happened was I woke up with some quite elderly man snogging my face, and then I kind of pottered off. Other than that, it was a total blank. I managed to get in a taxi \u2013 or got put into a taxi \u2013 and called my boyfriend, now husband, and he said that I was just completely incoherent, and I had to hand my phone over to the taxi driver.

      "bodyText": "Born in London, Evie Wyld, 39, grew up in Australia and south London, where she lives now. Her debut novel, After the Fire, a Still Small Voice (2009), won the John Llewellyn Rhys prize; her next, All the Birds, Singing, was published in 2013, the year she was named one of Granta\u2019s best young British novelists. Her new book, The Bass Rock, published later this month, tells the story of three interlinked women across several centuries and explores the ways that men seek to subjugate women and how women fight back. In the 1700s, Sarah is accused of being a witch; after the second world war, Ruth marries a widower and becomes a mother to his sons; and in the present day Viv is lost and mourning her father. How did the book\u2019s structure come about? I had a newborn at the time I started writing it five years ago. I was writing when he was asleep. A couple of hours in the morning, an hour in the afternoon. I didn\u2019t really have time to sit down and think, you know, what am I working on? So I ended up writing lots of different time frames and probably about two other novels underneath this one. I wasn\u2019t even sure if it was all the same book. It was really when #MeToo happened that I saw I was writing about the same thing. The same problem, just a slightly different shape, I suppose. Which of the women came to you first? Ruth\u2019s story in the 1950s, because she\u2019s based on my British [paternal] grandmother [Wyld\u2019s mother is Australian]. She shares a timeline with Ruth. She married very young, a widower with two little boys, and then became a housewife. She was really smart, and a very interesting woman in a lot of ways, but I also knew her as an alcoholic and a chain-smoker, and someone who hadn\u2019t really done anything with their brain and was just bored with life. Then when she died I inherited her photo albums and got these pictures of a woman who was very different from that. There were honeymoon pictures where she\u2019s all kind of sexy and involved in life and interested. I started going down this path, imagining who she was before she was the woman I came to know. Where does the rage and anger expressed in the book come from? I think it\u2019s the same anger and rage that every woman has deep down, squashed down somewhere. It probably comes from it being ingrained into us that we\u2019re not supposed to be angry, or we aren\u2019t angry, we\u2019re \u201chysterical\u201d, \u201cdifficult\u201d. There are quite a few murders in the book and one of the things I was really interested in was how women historically are always told to ignore their sixth sense, the hairs going up on the back of their neck, that feeling of discomfort. Whether it\u2019s as a child when you have to cuddle the uncle, or just that feeling that the worst thing in the world would be to be impolite. So when somebody comes up to you on the tube and asks you what you\u2019re reading, and wants to butt into your life and you feel like if I say \u201cplease leave me alone\u201d, what\u2019s going to happen is this tirade of \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be friendly\u201d. All the feeling that you don\u2019t even register any more \u2013 every time somebody passes you on an empty street in the dark and you have this sort of countdown in your head and you\u2019re like, \u201cNope, it\u2019s all right, I don\u2019t need the keys in the fist.\u201d And the fact that that is just part of your life. Have you experienced any of the horrendous things that occur in the book? I\u2019ve had my drink spiked, which, thankfully, didn\u2019t end badly. It was at a publishing party in London. What happened was I woke up with some quite elderly man snogging my face, and then I kind of pottered off. Other than that, it was a total blank. I managed to get in a taxi \u2013 or got put into a taxi \u2013 and called my boyfriend, now husband, and he said that I was just completely incoherent, and I had to hand my phone over to the taxi driver. [When I got home] I didn\u2019t recognise him. I\u2019d drunk three glasses of wine and I\u2019m quite a good drinker. The thing that amazed me was that, when I started talking to my female friends about it, a huge number of them had it happen to them, and far worse. But it just wasn\u2019t something they\u2019d talk about... it\u2019s the nature of the drug; it affects the chemicals in your brain, you feel guilt and dread for a long time afterwards, so you just want to forget about it. Simon Armitage recently said that his writing is a conversation with all the writers he reads and admires \u2013 who would that be for you? When I was a kid I read so much Stephen King, and there are parts of his work that I always feel like I\u2019m in conversation with \u2013 about what is frightening and why. That really interests me. I think his endings are always a bit of a letdown, because it\u2019s like... showing the monster. I think I\u2019m always interested in how to start off big and exciting and interesting and still have an ending that doesn\u2019t disappoint, but doesn\u2019t wrap things up neatly.

Between 1968 and 2004, Republican presidential nominees polled an average of just over 11% of the black vote \u2013 Trump only managed 8% in 2016.

Trump\u2019s disapproval rating among black voters is exceedingly high \u2013 just one in 10 has a favorable view of him, and only a dismal 4% support his policies all or some of the time. But dissatisfaction with Trump is not enough to improve the most important metric when it comes to black voters in the general election: turnout. Biden\u2019s Super Tuesday wins suggest he is best-positioned to accomplish it.</p> <p>In 2016, the black voter participation rate fell by seven points from 67% in 2012 to 60%, its lowest level in two decades. That reduced the black share of the electorate from nearly 13% in 2012 to less than 12% in 2016. And for an election that was essentially decided by 77,000 votes over three battleground states, higher black turnout might have resulted in a different electoral outcome where Hillary Clinton became the first female president.

      "bodyText": "Tottenham travel to Turf Moor hoping to halt a run of four consecutive defeats and Scott Murray has the latest. Premier League: Brighton kicked off a run of extremely tricky fixtures by holding Wolves at Molineux. Premier League: Billy Sharp scored the winner for Sheffield United, who are knocking loudly on the door of European qualification. Premier League: Profligacy in front of goal ultimately cost West Ham, who were unfortunate to leave the Emirates empty-handed. Premier League: Jordan Ayew\u2019s second goal in as many games separated the sides at Selhurst Park. Premier League: Allan Saint-Maximin scored the decisive goal for Newcastle against 10-man Southampton. Premier League: Liverpool survived an early scare before getting back to winning ways at Anfield. Liverpool\u2019s lunchtime win over Bournemouth left them 25 points clear at the summit of the table, while their beaten opponents remain in the drop zone. Sheffield United\u2019s win over Norwich leaves them just two points off fourth spot, while the Canaries are seven points from safety. Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth Arsenal 1-0 West Ham Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford Sheffield United 1-0 Norwich City Southampton 0-1 Newcastle Wolves 0-0 Brighton Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur (5.30pm) Leeds beat Huddersfield to go top of the table, as West Brom were held by Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium.

Premier League: In vain, I pretend nobody noticed I absentmindedly got my Sheffields mixed up in the result before last, while Newcastle leap-frog Southampton in the table thanks to a goal from Allan Saint-Maximin. Premier League: West Ham squandered enough chances to win several games and were undone by a late sucker-punch from Alexandre Lacazette. Premier League: Billy Sharp\u2019s third goal in four games was enough to consign Norwich City to another defeat. Premier League: It\u2019s a decent result at Molineux for Brighton, who draw with Wolves for the second time this season. Championship: Birmingham City get caught on the break as \u2013 get this \u2013 Puscas sets up Pele to give Reading a 3-1 lead at St Andrew\u2019s. Scottish Premiership: It\u2019s Celtic 5-0 St Mirren as Callum McGregor gets in on the goalscoring action with a penalty.

Scottish Premiership: Aberdeen have extended their lead against 10-man Hibs, while Callum Hendry has scored the only goal of the game to put St Johnstone one up against Livingston.

Scottish Premiership latest Aberdeen 3-1 Hibernian Celtic 4-0 St Mirren Hamilton 0-0 Kilmarnock Hearts 1-1 Motherwell St Johnstone 1-0 Livingston Championship: They may be down to 10 men, but that hasn\u2019t stopped QPR taking a 2-1 lead against Preston at Deepdale. Meanwhile at Griffin Park, Tarique Fosu has scored to give Brentford a 5-0 lead against Sheffield Wednesday. Championship latest Bristol City 1-1 Fulham (result) Barnsley 0-2 Cardiff City Birmingham City 1-2 Reading Brentford 5-0 Sheffield Wednesday Charlton Athletic 0-1 Middlesbrough Leeds United 2-0 Huddersfield Town Preston 1-2 QPR Stoke City 4-1 Hull City Swansea City 0-0 West Brom Wigan Athletic 0-0 Luton Town Premier League: Allan Saint-Maximin puts Newcastle in front against 10-man Southampton, who lost Moussa Djenepo to a first half red card. Premier League: West Ham have squandered one chance after another against Arsenal and have now fallen behind. After a ridiculously long VAR consultation, Alexandre Lacazette is judged to have been onside when he converted Mesut Ozil\u2019s delivery. Championship: It\u2019s almost certainly too little too late from Hull City, who have pulled a goal back against Stoke City, thanks to Leonardo Da Silva Lopes. Scottish Premiership: Leigh Griffiths completes his hat-trick as Celtic pile the pain on St Mirren in Glasgow. Championship: Brentford 4-0 Sheffield Wednesday - Josh Dasilva scores his second of the afternoon as Brentford riff, be-bop and scat all over Wednesday\u2019s pain at Griffin Park. Championship: QPR\u2019s Geoff Cameron picks up his second yellow card of the game and it\u2019s quickly followed by a red. It\u2019s Preston 1-1 QPR at Deepdale but the visitors are an American down. Championship: Cardiff City score two goals in as many minutes to leave Barnsley7 in all sorts of bother. Will Vaulks and Callum Paterson with the quick-fire double at Oakwell. Scottish Premiership: Having lost Steven Whittaker to a red card, Hibs have now surrendered their lead against Aberdeen and are behind. Christian Doidge had put Hibs ahead, but goals from Adam Jackson and Andrew Considine have left them with a mountain to climb. Championship: Grant Hall scores for QPR to make it all square in their match against Preston. It\u2019s 1-1 at Deepdale. We\u2019re into the final half hour of today\u2019s three o\u2019clock kick-offs. And one suspects Gary Lineker and his Match of the Day team are starting to get antsy. We\u2019ve had just two goals in the day\u2019s fixtures that kicked off since Liverpool beat Bournemouth 2-1 at Anfield in the lunchtime kick-off. Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth (result) Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford Sheffield United 1-0 Norwich City Southampton 0-0 Newcastle Wolves 0-0 Brighton Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur (5.30pm) Championship: Reading have come from behind to take the lead against Birmingham City, with Yakou Meite scoring their second in quick succession with a flick of his head. It\u2019s Birmingham City 1-2 Reading. Championship: American international Matt Miazga helps himself to a slice of goal pie at St Andrew\u2019s to restore parity for Reading against Birmingham City.

Championship: Patrick Bamford scores his first goal in eight games with a tap-in from a couple of yards out to put Leeds United 2-0 up against Huddersfield Town. At the Bet365 Stadium, Sam Clucas heads his second goal of the afternoon to give Stoke a 4-0 lead over beleaguered Hull City. Meanwhile in Spain: Ahead of their Champions League Round of 16 second leg match against Liverpool next week, Atletico Madrid are playing Sevilla in the Spanish capital. It\u2019s 2-2 at half-time at the Wanda Metropolitano. Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth (result) Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford Sheffield United 1-0 Norwich City Southampton 0-0 Newcastle Wolves 0-0 Brighton Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur (5.30pm) Bristol City 1-1 Fulham (result) Barnsley 0-0 Cardiff City Birmingham City 1-0 Reading Brentford 3-0 Sheffield Wednesday Charlton Athletic 0-1 Middlesbrough Leeds United 1-0 Huddersfield Town Preston 1-0 QPR Stoke City 3-0 Hull City Swansea City 0-0 West Brom Wigan Athletic 0-0 Luton Town Scottish Premiership half-times Aberdeen 0-1 Hibernian Celtic 2-0 St Mirren Hamilton 0-0 Kilmarnock Hearts 0-1 Motherwell St Johnstone 0-0 Livingston Scottish Premiership: Leigh Griffiths doubles his first half tally to make it Celtic 2-0 St Mirren. Meanwhile at Pittodrie, Hibs are one up against hosts Aberdeen thanks to Christian Doidge\u2019s strike in the 39th minute. Premier League: Matt Ritchie celebrates signing a contract extension yesterday by missing from the spot. It\u2019s a brilliant save from Alex McCarthy after Sofiane Boufal was correctly penalised for hand-ball. It remains (10-man) Southampton 0-0 Newcastle. Premier League: VAR intervention results in a penalty for Newcastle after a hand-ball. Championship: Brentford go 3-0 up against Sheffield Wednesday, with Bryan Mbeumo sprinting on to a weighted pass, cutting in from the right and firing into the corner. Premier League: Billy Sharp\u2019s rich vein of form continues as the Sheffield United striker slots home John Lundstram\u2019s cross. That\u2019s the evergreen Billy\u2019s third in four games. Premier League latest Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth (result) Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford Sheffield United 1-0 Norwich City Southampton 0-0 Newcastle Wolves 0-0 Brighton Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur (5.30pm) Premier League: Jordan Ayew scores from about 20 yards out after good hold-up play from Christian Benteke, who turns provider for his team-mate for the second game in a row. Premier League: The intervention of VAR results in Moussa Djenepo having a yellow card overturned and replaced with a red after a high challenge on Isaac Hayden. Scottish Premiership latest Leigh Griffiths has put Celtic ahead against St Mirren, getting on the end of a cross from Odsonne Eduord. Meanwhile in Edinburgh, Motherwell pile the misery on hapless Hearts, Chris Long capitalising on an error from defender Craig Halkett, who sold his goalkeeper short with a dreadful backpass. Aberdeen 0-0 Hibernian Celtic 1-0 St Mirren Hamilton 0-0 Kilmarnock Hearts 0-1 Motherwell St Johnstone 0-0 Livingston Championship latest Bristol City 1-1 Fulham (result) Barnsley 0-0 Cardiff City Birmingham City 1-0 Reading Brentford 2-0 Sheffield Wednesday Charlton Athletic 0-1 Middlesbrough Leeds United 1-0 Huddersfield Town Preston 1-0 QPR Stoke City 3-0 Hull City Swansea City 0-0 West Brom Wigan Athletic 0-0 Luton Town Championship: Stoke City are going goal crazy! Sam Clucas gives them a three-goal lead at the Bet365 Stadium. Elsewhere, Daniel Johnson has scored the opening goal for Preston in their match against QPR at Deepdale. At The Valley, Middlesbrough lead Charlton 1-0 courtesy of Paddy McNair\u2019s strike. At Griffin Park, Brentford lead Sheffield Wednesday 2-0 after Emiliano Marcondes fired home in the 18th minute. We\u2019re still waiting for our first goal in the Premier League\u2019s three o\u2019clock kick-offs, but they\u2019re flying in in the Championship. Championship: Stoke City double their lead against Hull City, who are perilously close to the relegation zone who are without a win in their past 10 league games, having taken just two points from 30 available. Tyrese Campbell scores from the spot to put them 2-0 up. Championship: Stoke City take the lead against Hull City, with Nick Powell getting on the end of a cross to head past George Long at the back post. Championship: Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Cameron Dawson flaps at a high ball, which drops for Brentford\u2019s Josh Dasilva. The Bees lead 1-0 at Griffin Park. Premier League: Having been under the cosh early doors in their game against Southampton, Newcastle are denied by an outstanding triple-save from Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. Championship: Scott Hogan lifts the ball over Reading goalkeeper Rafael to put Birmingham City a goal ahead at St Andrew\u2019s. Championship: Leeds United take an early lead against Huddersfield Town at Elland Road, Luke Ayling volleying home at the back post after three minutes. Premier League: Jarrod Bowen hits the post with a long range effort for West Ham in the early stages of their match against Arsenal at the Emirates. Not long now: Pre-match handshakes are not taking place in grounds around the country as players and match officials go through the last of the pre-match formalities ahead of our three o\u2019clock kick-offs. Intriguingly, there were no short of post-match handshakes and embraces in the game between Liverpool and Bournemouth. It\u2019s almost as if Premier League officials just wanted to be seen to be doing something about the coronavirus and didn\u2019t really think their new healthcare policy through. Premier League: \u201cThere was joy in the eruption that greeted the final whistle at Anfield but also unmistakable relief,\u201d writes Andy Hunter. Championship: Nakhi Wells and Tom Cairney got the goals as the points were shared at Ashton Gate. Premier League: It wasn\u2019t the most convincing of victories, but Liverpool won\u2019t care. They\u2019re unbeaten in 55 at Anfield and now lead the Premier League by 25 points. Arsenal v West Ham: Arsenal make three changes, while West Ham field an unchanged side from the one that beat Southampton last week. Wolves v Brighton: Adama Traore is injured, but makes the bench. Leander Dendoncker replaces him. Graham Potter keeps faith with the same team that lost against Crystal Palace last week. Southampton v Newcastle: Danny Ings comes back into the Southampton side, with Michael Obafemi dropping to the bench. Chris Smallbone and Stuart Armstrong are both out injured. For Newcastle, Alain Saint-Maximin returns to the starting line-up after missing out against Burnley last weekend, while Joelinton is among the substitutes. Sheffield United v Norwich City: Sander Berge is out of Sheffield United\u2019s starting line-up and is replaced by John Lundstram. Norwich City are unchanged from the side that beat Leicester City last weekend. Crystal Palace v Watford: Crystal Palace are unchanged from their win over Newcastle. Watford make one enforced switch, with Roberto Pereyra coming in for Gerard Deulofeu, whose season is over. Championship: With the game approaching its knockings, it\u2019s 1-1 between Bristol City and Fulham at Ashton Gate. Nahki Wells put the home side ahead in the 70th minute, but Tom Cairney has just equalised for Fulham. There\u2019s five minutes left in that one.

If the evidence of Liverpool\u2019s match against Bournemouth is anything to go by, handshakes have been outlawed, but spitting on the pitch, goal celebrations, players covering their hands with their mouths while talking to each other and managers screaming with spittle-flecked rage at fourth officials is still OK. Premier League: It remains Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth at Anfield, but Liverpool are not having it all their own way. Ryan Fraser thought he\u2019d equalised for Bournemouth after lobbing Adrian and was waiting for the ball to drop into the gaping goal, only for James Milner to sprint back and make a spectacular goal-line clearance. Scott Murray has the latest ... Barney Ronay wrote column about Eric Dier\u2019s post-match saunter into the West Stand at White Hart Lane on Wednesday night, in which he expressed concern about levels of incoherent anger on the internet. It should go without saying that it has been greeted by levels of incoherent anger on the internet, although many readers seem largely in agreement. Read on ... Meanwhile in Scotland As good as home and hosed in the Scottish title race due to Rangers\u2019 post winter break slump, Celtic entertain St Mirren as they continue their hunt for nine in a row. At the bottom of the table, Hearts entertain third-placed Motherwell and are in desperate need of a win. Two points above them and high on the hog after their midweek win over Rangers at Ibrox, Hamilton Hamilton entertain Kilmarnock. Rangers travel to Ross County for tomorrow\u2019s lunchtime kick-off. Championship fixtures The Championship weekend got off to rather a surreal start with Millwall\u2019s surprise hammering Nottingham Forest at the City Ground last night. Just ahead of Forest in third place, Fulham are playing Bristol City in the day\u2019s early fixture and it\u2019s currently scoreless at the break at Ashton Gate. Elsewhere, league leaders West Brom travel to Swansea City, while second placed Leeds United entertain Huddersfield Town in a Yorkshire derby. Further down the table, close friends and rival managers Less Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate will be in opposing technical areas when Charlton entertain fellow strugglers Middlesbrough in a kind of Leeds Last Time They Were In Europe derby. Premier League fixtures As we\u2019ve mentioned already, Liverpool are entertaining Bournemouth in the day\u2019s lunchtime kick-off and got off to a poor start, going behind to a Callum Wilson goal in the ninth minute that somehow survived a VAR check despite a blatant foul by the goalscorer on Joe Gomez in the build-up. It\u2019s going better for the hosts now, thanks to goals from Mo Salah and Sadio Mane. Liverpool now lead by the odd goal of three. Elsewhere, Brighton face a daunting trip to Wolves as they begin a run of fixtures that pits them against four of the top six, Arsenal and relegation rivals Norwich City in their next six games. Their fellow strugglers West Ham continue their fight against relegation with a trip to Arsenal, while Newcastle, who look far from safe, travel to the south coast for a visit to Southampton in one of the day\u2019s other eye-catching fixtures. The weekend\u2019s Premier League action kicked off at Anfield, where Liverpool are hoping to put a run of three defeats in four games (across three different competitions) behind them as they entertain relegation-threatened Bournemouth. They\u2019ve come from behind to lead their visitors 2-1 at half-time. Away from Merseyside, we\u2019ve got five three o\u2019clock kick-offs to stay across in the top flight and we\u2019ll also be keeping tabs on goings-on in the Championship and beyond. Stay tuned for team news, build-up, goal alerts and any other major talking points on what promises to be another intriguing afternoon of football action.",

The reformed <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/pussycat-dolls-spark-outrage-amongst-21646794\" title=\"\">Pussycat Dolls</a> have been criticised for their \u201craunchy\u201d dance routines (\u201clittle better than a strip act\u201d). Elsewhere, rapper Lizzo complained about the social media platform TikTok <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/05/lizzo-tiktok-body-shaming-censorship-social-media\" title=\"\">censoring images</a> of her in a bathing suit. TikTok says it objected to images of \u201csexual gratification\u201d (Lizzo in her underwear), while she insists it was sizeism.</p> <p>Recently, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/awards/jennifer-lopez-super-bowl-shakira-sexy-halftime-show-critics-video-1203497513/\" title=\"\">Jennifer Lopez</a> was triple-slammed for a Super Bowl pole-dancing performance \u2013 obviously relating to her role in the film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/07/hustlers-review-j-lo-strippers-candace-wu\" title=\"\">Hustlers</a></em> \u2013 first, for being overtly sexual; second, for being overtly sexual as a 50-year-old (no, Jenny, no!); third, for making similarly aged women feel bad about their bodies. Not to forget Madonna \u2013 who always attracts turbo-strength ageism-cum-misogyny for her \u201cover-sexy/too young\u201d stage costumes, as though she should consider performing in hair rollers and a housecoat.</p> <p>What is it about successful female artists doing their thing, on stage or on social media, that drives certain sectors of society crazy? And why is the sexism so often merged with ageism or sizeism, as if that makes the abuse they\u2019re meting out extra special and justified?</p> <p>Admittedly, one of the Pussycat Dolls\u2019 performances was on breakfast television \u2013 but can\u2019t people switch off, or over, without first activating the righteous-offence alarm? \u201cOfficer, women are wriggling suggestively on my TV screen, and the remote control is at least 3ft away on the kitchen table. Send help!\u201d There\u2019s always a choice. People are invited to enjoy what musicians are doing, listen to the songs, buy tickets, watch videos, but they\u2019re also entitled to look away and say: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p> <p>Of course there are many more examples (and levels) of sexism in the music industry, and all the artists I\u2019ve mentioned bring much more than visuals. However, it\u2019s interesting how berating women for being eye-catching and entertaining has almost become part of the pop-cultural consumer experience. It\u2019s noteworthy how frequently we hear a variation of \u201cPut it away, love!\u201d aimed at accomplished female stars. When, by definition, they should not be putting <em>anything</em> away, because, if they\u2019re not expressing themselves fully, what exactly is the point?</p> <p>Ultimately, objecting to an artist \u201cbringing the visuals\u201d is as nonsensical as objecting to other artists not bringing them enough \u2013 as in, how come Neil Young still gets to shamble on stage in jeans that look as though he\u2019s been wearing them since 1979?</p> <p>I\u2019m being facetious now, but the core point remains. The UK rights organisation <a href=\"https://www.prsformusic.com/\" title=\"\">PRS for Music</a> has just announced that, while there are still three times as many male songwriters, and it\u2019s still tougher for women to make a living, numbers of female songwriters are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/06/number-of-female-uk-songwriters-jumps-by-60\" title=\"\">up by 60%</a>. A cause for celebration? Sure, but not if sexism (age-related/size-related/anything-related) continues to lurk in the wings, even for huge stars.</p> <h2>Clinton was a sexual fraud and saying sorry won\u2019t help <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3f9d19737d8f6207b9ee522e8ad1e0c34f274cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3f9d19737d8f6207b9ee522e8ad1e0c34f274cb/299_0_3999_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton says his affair with Monica Lewinsky was to relieve stress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton says his affair with Monica Lewinsky was to relieve stress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Bureau/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Do some men still think of women as little more than sexual spittoons?</p> <p>The former US president Bill Clinton states in <em>Hillary</em> (a new <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/series/hillary-793891ec-5bb7-4200-ba93-e3629532d670?cmp=12386&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=SEM&amp;utm_campaign=CM_SEM_Hillary%20Documentary&amp;utm_term=hillary%20documentary&amp;msclkid=b8c34db740611d9f0a0b13d53227396d&amp;gclid=CPHg2-SahugCFQyBhQodff0FpA&amp;gclsrc=ds\" title=\"\">Hulu documentary</a> series about his wife and former presidential candidate) that his affair with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/monica-lewinsky\" title=\"\">Monica Lewinsky</a> (which led to his impeachment) was something he did to relieve his stress and anxiety. Oh charming, Bill, thanks for letting Monica know.</p> <p>In fairness, Clinton also says he feels regret and guilt about how it defined Lewinsky\u2019s life. Nevertheless, his comments are grotesque and bizarre, as is the fact he\u2019s happy to make them.</p> <p>The cliche is that men exchange love in return for sex, while women exchange sex for love, but, in reality, women are just as capable of adopting a more casual attitude to sex, of viewing it as recreational or a sport.</p> <p>None of this offends or terrifies women (sorry to disappoint some men). What angers women (well, anyone) is lack of honesty, respect and information \u2013 someone not being entirely straight with them about the kind of sex they\u2019re having. This is what makes women feel like a masturbation aid, rather than an actual human being. This is how people end up feeling used and duped \u2013 not just exploited and humiliated sexually, but also emotionally.</p> <p>It amounts to sexual fraud.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes it seems the sexist/ageist/sizeist female Venn diagram of popular music will always be with us. The reformed Pussycat Dolls have been criticised for their \u201craunchy\u201d dance routines (\u201clittle better than a strip act\u201d). Elsewhere, rapper Lizzo complained about the social media platform TikTok censoring images of her in a bathing suit. TikTok says it objected to images of \u201csexual gratification\u201d (Lizzo in her underwear), while she insists it was sizeism. Recently, Jennifer Lopez was triple-slammed for a Super Bowl pole-dancing performance \u2013 obviously relating to her role in the film Hustlers \u2013 first, for being overtly sexual; second, for being overtly sexual as a 50-year-old (no, Jenny, no!); third, for making similarly aged women feel bad about their bodies. Not to forget Madonna \u2013 who always attracts turbo-strength ageism-cum-misogyny for her \u201cover-sexy/too young\u201d stage costumes, as though she should consider performing in hair rollers and a housecoat. What is it about successful female artists doing their thing, on stage or on social media, that drives certain sectors of society crazy? And why is the sexism so often merged with ageism or sizeism, as if that makes the abuse they\u2019re meting out extra special and justified? Admittedly, one of the Pussycat Dolls\u2019 performances was on breakfast television \u2013 but can\u2019t people switch off, or over, without first activating the righteous-offence alarm? \u201cOfficer, women are wriggling suggestively on my TV screen, and the remote control is at least 3ft away on the kitchen table. Send help!\u201d There\u2019s always a choice. People are invited to enjoy what musicians are doing, listen to the songs, buy tickets, watch videos, but they\u2019re also entitled to look away and say: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d Of course there are many more examples (and levels) of sexism in the music industry, and all the artists I\u2019ve mentioned bring much more than visuals. However, it\u2019s interesting how berating women for being eye-catching and entertaining has almost become part of the pop-cultural consumer experience. It\u2019s noteworthy how frequently we hear a variation of \u201cPut it away, love!\u201d aimed at accomplished female stars. When, by definition, they should not be putting anything away, because, if they\u2019re not expressing themselves fully, what exactly is the point? Ultimately, objecting to an artist \u201cbringing the visuals\u201d is as nonsensical as objecting to other artists not bringing them enough \u2013 as in, how come Neil Young still gets to shamble on stage in jeans that look as though he\u2019s been wearing them since 1979? I\u2019m being facetious now, but the core point remains. The UK rights organisation PRS for Music has just announced that, while there are still three times as many male songwriters, and it\u2019s still tougher for women to make a living, numbers of female songwriters are up by 60%. A cause for celebration? Sure, but not if sexism (age-related/size-related/anything-related) continues to lurk in the wings, even for huge stars. Clinton was a sexual fraud and saying sorry won\u2019t help Do some men still think of women as little more than sexual spittoons? The former US president Bill Clinton states in Hillary (a new Hulu documentary series about his wife and former presidential candidate) that his affair with Monica Lewinsky (which led to his impeachment) was something he did to relieve his stress and anxiety. Oh charming, Bill, thanks for letting Monica know. In fairness, Clinton also says he feels regret and guilt about how it defined Lewinsky\u2019s life. Nevertheless, his comments are grotesque and bizarre, as is the fact he\u2019s happy to make them. The cliche is that men exchange love in return for sex, while women exchange sex for love, but, in reality, women are just as capable of adopting a more casual attitude to sex, of viewing it as recreational or a sport. None of this offends or terrifies women (sorry to disappoint some men). What angers women (well, anyone) is lack of honesty, respect and information \u2013 someone not being entirely straight with them about the kind of sex they\u2019re having. This is what makes women feel like a masturbation aid, rather than an actual human being. This is how people end up feeling used and duped \u2013 not just exploited and humiliated sexually, but also emotionally. It amounts to sexual fraud. Lewinsky, a young intern at the time, had sex with Clinton because she was in love with him \u2013 if he had made it clear that she was mere stress relief, would she have bothered? The answer to that question is irrelevant. It only matters that Clinton didn\u2019t give Lewinsky the chance to make an informed decision. Lewinsky was and is a human being, not the carnal equivalent of a round of golf for a high-status alpha. Clinton is right about one thing \u2013 she did deserve better. For us Brits, caffeine isn\u2019t a lifestyle choice, it\u2019s a fix According to new research from Mintel, Britons will be spending more than \u00a34bn on grabbing a coffee this year. Sales are up \u00a31bn since 2015, and people are now getting their caffeine fix not just from coffee shops, but also in McDonald\u2019s, or cafes in supermarkets or stores. Tea, while lagging behind coffee, is also enjoying a resurgence, with, tellingly, the most popular choice being builder\u2019s tea \u2013 which, of course, is very strong English breakfast tea, no other definitions accepted, or even considered. I say \u201ctellingly\u201d, because you have to smile at how such developments are presented as fluctuations and surges in lifestyle choices. As if British people still harbour wistful delusions about emulating the cast of Friends, hanging out in groovy friendship groups, yakking about their lives, in ersatz versions of Central Perk; incidentally, the most unrealistic coffee shop of all time because that big squishy seating area was always mysteriously free. Does this convivial, enriching coffee shop reverie hold any truth for the UK, or is it just a fantasy of coffee and tea purveyors? To my mind, the high levels of coffee consumption, as well as the popularity of builder\u2019s tea, point to one thing and one thing only \u2013 British people are absolutely exhausted. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "Shortly before kick-off the man on the public address system assumed a grave tone and urged everyone to telephone the NHS 111 service should they develop coronavirus symptoms. Throw in the earlier sight of a couple laden down with giant packs of toilet rolls staggering past the ground and it appeared a hint of panic was swirling in the South Yorkshire air. If so, it has not reached a Sheffield United dressing room in which a majority of players simply do not do nerves and there is most definitely no fear of scaling unexpected heights. Norwich asked Chris Wilder\u2019s team some searchingly intelligent questions but thanks to Billy Sharp\u2019s winning goal and stellar performances from, among others, John Lundstram and Dean Henderson, these Blades simply shrugged off Daniel Farke\u2019s smart, if ultimately forlorn, tactical button pressing. It left Wilder\u2019s players set fair for European qualification, keeping an attractive, risk-taking, recently resurgent Norwich side stuck at the bottom and in peril of becoming stranded as they arguably confront a failure to speculate to accumulate last summer. \u201cI can\u2019t ask much more from these players,\u201d said Farke. \u201cThese guys gave everything today. Our performance was decent but it\u2019s a setback.\u201d He and Wilder have been on very different trajectories since winning promotion last spring and money is foremost among the assorted reasons why. While Sheffield United\u2019s manager dropped his record \u00a322m signing Sander Berge to the bench, Norwich\u2019s collective starting XI cost less than \u00a320m. To place such sums in context, Wilder has still spent an awful lot less than most Premier League counterparts but, unlike many peers, he has somehow kept his squad remarkably fresh. Not for the first time this season his entire 25-man squad was passed fit on Saturday and although luck plays a part, Wilder is clearly doing something right in the training and sports science spheres. Happily medical science has repaired the shattered knee which, for a time, threatened to end Tim Krul\u2019s career. After a lengthy stint in the shadows at Newcastle and Brighton, Norwich\u2019s goalkeeper is back to his best, swiftly emphasising the point by expertly tipping Oli McBurnie\u2019s powerful close-range header over the bar. Although Norwich enjoyed prolonged periods of pleasing possession and Teemu Pukki\u2019s volley struck the post, Wilder\u2019s back largely three restricted them to half chances, with Jack O\u2019Connell even finding time to advance from centre-half and see his goal-bound shot deflected narrowly wide. The stage was set for the 34-year-old Sharp to demonstrate precisely why he is keeping both the \u00a310m Lys Mousset and David McGoldrick on the bench by meeting the consistently excellent Lundstram\u2019s fabulously weighted, subtly curving cross with the most acrobatic of flying headers. This time Krul had no riposte, Norwich were behind and Sharp had registered his third goal in four games. Farke reorganised his side at the interval, withdrawing the talented but tired Todd Cantwell \u2013 partly at fault for the goal \u2013 and shifting to a daring midfield diamond. With substitute Josip Drmic joining Pukki in attack, the now more direct visitors improved significantly and Sheffield United\u2019s Manchester United loanee Henderson earned his corn with wonderful close-range saves from Mario Vrancic and then Drmic during a late bout of goalmouth bagatelle. \u201cNorwich had nothing to lose, they\u2019re a brave side, I\u2019ve got a lot of respect for Dan [Farke] and they made it difficult,\u201d said Wilder. \u201cBut Dean is one of the best goalkeepers around and we keep rolling on.\u201d",

And on the radio, in examples of what might be considered \u201cdouble blind casting\u201d, Joseph has also taken on two other famous roles from classic literature. In 2015 he played the Russian aristocrat Pierre Bezukhov in the epic BBC Radio 4 adaptation of <em>War and Peace,</em> and then last year he was Marcel <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2019/35/marcel-prousts-in-search-of-lost-time\" title=\"\">Proust\u2019s fictional </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2019/35/marcel-prousts-in-search-of-lost-time\" title=\"\">Frenchman, Charles Swann</a>. No fuss was made about either. It seems that when black actors are simply heard, but not seen, in white roles, the level of pushback from traditionalists who object to meddling with historical accuracy is muted.</p> <p>Joseph argues that redefining these major \u201cwhite roles\u201d is quite valid. When black actor James Howson was cast as Heathcliff in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/10/wuthering-heights-film-review\" title=\"\">Wuthering Heights </a></em>by a director in 2011, Joseph defended director Andrea Arnold\u2019s decision.</p> <p>Efforts by some to dismiss her decision \u201cas a bit of modern, multicultural nonsense\u201d were wrong, he wrote. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/11/wuthering-heights-black-actors\" title=\"\">Instead, Joseph claimed</a>, it \u201cshines a spotlight on an age-old phenomenon: the habitual colour blindness that our film and television industry suffers so much from.

In the drama, as in the novel, it is wealthy black people who enjoy privilege and power, while a white underclass, the \u201cnoughts\u201d, are disrespected and undervalued. The first episode, on Thursday evening, attracted 2.5 million viewers and challenged comfortable assumptions about how far British society has escaped racist thinking.</p> <p>The time is ripe for such a challenge to embedded attitudes, Joseph thinks: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s zeitgeist, because this issue is always there, but we\u2019re particularly living in a time where the volume has been turned up on all that.\u201d</p> <p>Now 55, Joseph was born to St Lucian parents in north-west London.

Not only is the word \u201cblanca\u201d used as a racist insult, but all the catering and cleaning staff at social events are white, with names that often seem difficult for the black ruling class to pronounce.</p> <p>In this imagined society, African colonisation of Europe has established black people as the ruling class. It is just the kind of provocative entertainment Joseph might have had in mind when he wrote: \u201cDrama must give us a view not just of what was, but of what could be. And when we say that all that black people were, or ever could be to us are \u2018problems\u2019 or \u2018issues\u2019, or buzz words like \u2018knife/gun crime\u2019, we take our broad and beautiful richness and diminish it to stunted cliche and narrow world view.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 March 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to \u201cthe National Theatre\u2019s 2000 production of Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House\u201d.

When veteran Guardian critic Michael Billington retired last year he chose this production, set in Africa by director Greg Doran, as one of his 10 career highlights. Joseph, Billington judged, had shown \u201cBrutus to be a man of quixotic temper swathed in self-regard\u201d. The actor, who lived in France for eight years and has also worked as a chef, is now a patron of Shakespeare Schools Foundation, a charity that aims to give young children confidence through access to Shakespeare and acting. In 2015 Joseph took the orthodox canon of costume drama by the scruff of the neck when he discovered a forgotten black historical character and brought him back to life. Born on a slave ship in the early 18th century, Charles Ignatius Sancho was a musician, composer, author and actor who in 1774 had become the first black Briton to vote. Joseph took his one-man show, Sancho: An Act of Remembrance, to Wilton\u2019s Music Hall and the British Library, and he has also written a book about him. \u201cThe black presence in our British history has sometimes wilfully, sometimes neglectfully, been whitewashed out of our national tale,\u201d Joseph has explained. The world of Noughts &amp; Crosses deliberately inverts all these historic prejudices. Not only is the word \u201cblanca\u201d used as a racist insult, but all the catering and cleaning staff at social events are white, with names that often seem difficult for the black ruling class to pronounce. In this imagined society, African colonisation of Europe has established black people as the ruling class. It is just the kind of provocative entertainment Joseph might have had in mind when he wrote: \u201cDrama must give us a view not just of what was, but of what could be. And when we say that all that black people were, or ever could be to us are \u2018problems\u2019 or \u2018issues\u2019, or buzz words like \u2018knife/gun crime\u2019, we take our broad and beautiful richness and diminish it to stunted cliche and narrow world view.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 March 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to \u201cthe National Theatre\u2019s 2000 production of Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House\u201d. That production was by Shared Experience at the New Ambassadors Theatre.",

      "body": "<p>Cosmo Jarvis has deflated slightly since he finished work on Calm With Horses. Director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/20/meet-the-new-directors-who-lit-up-the-film-festivals\" title=\"\">Nick Rowland</a> adapted the film from a short story by County Mayo writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/07/young-skins-review-debut-colin-barrett\" title=\"\">Colin Barrett</a>, and when it toured the festival circuit, many critics labelled it an extraordinary debut for the film-maker and a breakout performance for Jarvis, who plays Arm, a former boxer turned gangland enforcer, with heartbreaking complexity.</p> <p>Arm works at the behest of nasty small\u2011town crooks on the west coast of Ireland. In private, they refer to him as \u201cthe halfwit\u201d, and on screen, he is a hulking presence, looming tall and wide over the men unfortunate enough to cross his path. Jarvis had to bulk up to play him. \u201cLuckily they just wanted it to look like he was once in shape,\u201d he says. He ate a lot, drank milkshakes and lifted weights to get the presence he needed. Arm is as naive as he is vicious, and a slow-moving, lumbering menace, while Jarvis is febrile and fidgety, vibrating with a quicker energy. You suspect he would rather not sit still if he could help it.</p> <p>This is apt, considering the shape of his career. Now 30, he started out making no-budget films with his mates when he was a teenager in Devon, while also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/11/cosmo-jarvis-interview\" title=\"\">plying his trade as a musician</a>, putting his folk-ish songs on MySpace and releasing five albums. Eventually, he put the music on hold to focus on acting. In 2016, he appeared in William Oldroyd\u2019s masterful <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/30/lady-macbeth-review-florence-pugh-william-oldroyd\" title=\"\">Lady Macbeth</a></em> alongside Florence Pugh, playing Sebastian, the brooding workman with whom Pugh\u2019s Katherine has a macabre and doomed affair.</p> <p>But 2020 looks set to be his year with four films on their way \u2013 <em>Calm With Horses</em>, <em>Funny Face</em>, <em>Nocturnal</em> and <em>The Evening Hour</em>, and it seems like a good time to be him. \u201cSeems like it,\u201d he agrees, cautiously. \u201cIt is a lot of stuff coming out at the same time, and also before, there just wasn\u2019t much [that was] notable, really, that I was involved with.\u201d He is candid, but speaks with a degree of caution, careful to get his meaning across as he intends to. \u201cNot that I think it wasn\u2019t notable, but it wasn\u2019t <em>noted</em>, per se. Also, I was probably a bit old when I got going.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb514e637dac855b4e37c01234b3ec57425a994b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb514e637dac855b4e37c01234b3ec57425a994b/0_0_5514_3676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmo Jarvis, left, with Barry Keoghan in Nick Rowland\u2019s film Calm With Horses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As bloody as it is beautiful\u2019: Cosmo Jarvis, left, with Barry Keoghan in Nick Rowland\u2019s film Calm With Horses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capital Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He considers that he got going in 2012, when he made a film with his brother and his friends called <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2145540/\" title=\"\">The Naughty Room</a></em>, about a 20-year-old who has been locked in the family bathroom since childhood by his abusive mother. That got him some attention. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really know how one got into acting properly, because I was never connected, and I quit school really early.\u201d He met his first agent through the film. \u201cI thought, I might as well just start knocking,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a slow burn from there. Years of nothing, and then eventually getting a few little jobs, TV jobs, and keep on chipping away.\u201d</p> <p>Jarvis was born in the US, in New Jersey, to an Armenian-American mother and an English father. They moved to Plymouth when he was a baby, and eventually, he says, \u201cworked up the train tracks\u201d, landing in and around Totnes. \u201cMe and my brother had a lot of independence as youngsters. Not like, you know, the bashing up old ladies kind, but just\u2026\u201d He fades out. He is still very close to his younger brother (\u201cthough he hates it when I call him younger\u201d), who also works in film, in the art department.</p> <p>Around seven years ago, when auditions became more frequent, Jarvis moved to London. \u201cI had no ties left to [Totnes] really, because I kind of abandoned music.\u201d He lived in guardianship properties for years. \u201cI was in an old hospital in Leyton for two years. I had a whole wing to myself, for \u00a3200 a month.\u201d He now lives in east London, but says it\u2019s \u201cstill cheap as fuck. Safe, because you never know how work\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve never smashed someone through a coffee table. I used to box at school. Got suspended for it a couple of times</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In <em>Calm With Horses</em>, he plays an Irishman amid an almost entirely Irish cast, including Barry Keoghan (<em>Dunkirk</em> and <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em>), who plays Arm\u2019s best friend and handler Dympna. Jarvis stayed in accent from the second he arrived in the country. \u201cWe were staying in places with local populations who didn\u2019t really give a shit about the film. You\u2019d just be down the pub, and you\u2019d chat with anybody, so all of the resources that I needed were there.\u201d He pulled it off so convincingly that Niamh Algar, who plays his ex-girlfriend Ursula, was surprised to get a voice message from him in his own English accent. \u201cIt was the only way I knew how to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cWith film, you come in, you blow everything you\u2019ve got, and it\u2019s a short amount of time. You\u2019re getting a good wage to do a creative craft, so you might as well just go all the way out.\u201d</p> <p>The film is as bloody as it is beautiful. Was the violence of it in any way familiar to him? \u201cI mean, not at that level,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never smashed someone through a coffee table. I used to box at school. Got suspended for it a couple of times.\u201d He was suspended for other stuff as well, he says, but that\u2019s not why he left school early. \u201cOh no. I just wasn\u2019t learning anything, and at the time I was working as a musician, so I chose to start working then, on the road, then trying to tour with my band.\u201d</p> <p>Despite some success - his 2011 single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dysG12QCdTA\" title=\"\">Gay Pirates</a> was a cult hit, and has more than 2m views on YouTube \u2013 he says he has finished with music for now. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to try and get any sort of credibility as an actor, I don\u2019t want to have a foot dipping in anything else. It was quite good to leave all that behind, because I think music sort of... nearly killed me.\u201d Did it really? \u201cSort of, sort of,\u201d he smiles. He doesn\u2019t want to sound bitter, he says. \u201cIt was just a young man\u2019s game.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b03e153943c227ca14b17d3d9c838960c50229b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b03e153943c227ca14b17d3d9c838960c50229b7/538_0_2117_1271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarvis with Florence Pugh in Lady Macbeth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarvis with Florence Pugh in Lady Macbeth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it comes to making his way in the acting world, Jarvis seems too candid to be much of a schmoozer. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of the time, it is to do with networking and knowing people and presentation and all of that,\u201d he says. Is he any good at it? He smiles. \u201cNot really, no. I still get baffled by the smoke and mirrors stuff, but I totally understand why it\u2019s there, and I\u2019m not going to try and go against any grain, because there\u2019s no point. I\u2019m 30 now.\u201d</p> <p>He spent his 30th birthday last October in New York, shooting <em><a href=\"https://www.berlinale.de/en/programme/programme/detail.html?film_id=202006951\" title=\"\">Funny Face</a></em>, a creepy modern fairytale about gentrification which has just played at the Berlin film festival. \u201cI think I was just [filming], and probably telling somebody about how I didn\u2019t want to celebrate my birthday because I\u2019ll be dead in 10 years,\u201d he says, drily. He takes me aback. Don\u2019t say that, I say. \u201cOh, you know,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cType one diabetes catches up with you.\u201d Jarvis is making light of his condition, but he admits that having it does make him think about his own mortality. \u201cIt screws with my philosophy, because I\u2019m pretty much a hater of technology and everything that it involves, but then I rely on it to some extent to survive. I fully accept that if it wasn\u2019t for technology, diabetics and anybody with any ailment would be the first people to be dead. Then it comes down to the point of trying to argue: where is the line to differentiate between technology in the name of excess and technology in the name of accommodating basic human needs?\u201d He seems to enjoy a meaty philosophical chat, particularly when it comes to the subject of technology. He has no social media, and only recently got a smartphone, because his agent told him he had to have one for work.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbrj1wDl3iM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xbrj1wDl3iM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbrj1wDl3iM\">Watch the Calm With Horse trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>His agent also told him that he was not allowed to \u201cartist myself to death\u201d, as he puts it. So while he\u2019s starring in a number of buzzy independent films \u2013 it\u2019s hard to look at the lineup for a film festival without seeing him attached to at least one entry \u2013 he\u2019s also appearing in <em><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/ridley-scotts-raised-by-wolves-moving-tnt-hbo-max-1250940\" title=\"\">Raised By Wolves,</a></em> HBO\u2019s new sci-fi show, executive-produced by Ridley Scott, about which he can tell me absolutely nothing. He seems content to not sit still. \u201cThere will probably come a time where I have to get a house or pay for a kid,\u201d he reasons, \u201cbut at the minute, I\u2019m really happy with what I\u2019ve done, so far.\u201d</p> <p><em>Calm With Horses is in cinemas on Friday</em></p>",

Now 30, he started out making no-budget films with his mates when he was a teenager in Devon, while also plying his trade as a musician, putting his folk-ish songs on MySpace and releasing five albums. Eventually, he put the music on hold to focus on acting. In 2016, he appeared in William Oldroyd\u2019s masterful Lady Macbeth alongside Florence Pugh, playing Sebastian, the brooding workman with whom Pugh\u2019s Katherine has a macabre and doomed affair. But 2020 looks set to be his year with four films on their way \u2013 Calm With Horses, Funny Face, Nocturnal and The Evening Hour, and it seems like a good time to be him. \u201cSeems like it,\u201d he agrees, cautiously. \u201cIt is a lot of stuff coming out at the same time, and also before, there just wasn\u2019t much [that was] notable, really, that I was involved with.\u201d He is candid, but speaks with a degree of caution, careful to get his meaning across as he intends to. \u201cNot that I think it wasn\u2019t notable, but it wasn\u2019t noted, per se. Also, I was probably a bit old when I got going.\u201d He considers that he got going in 2012, when he made a film with his brother and his friends called The Naughty Room, about a 20-year-old who has been locked in the family bathroom since childhood by his abusive mother. That got him some attention. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really know how one got into acting properly, because I was never connected, and I quit school really early.\u201d He met his first agent through the film. \u201cI thought, I might as well just start knocking,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a slow burn from there. Years of nothing, and then eventually getting a few little jobs, TV jobs, and keep on chipping away.\u201d Jarvis was born in the US, in New Jersey, to an Armenian-American mother and an English father. They moved to Plymouth when he was a baby, and eventually, he says, \u201cworked up the train tracks\u201d, landing in and around Totnes. \u201cMe and my brother had a lot of independence as youngsters. Not like, you know, the bashing up old ladies kind, but just\u2026\u201d He fades out. He is still very close to his younger brother (\u201cthough he hates it when I call him younger\u201d), who also works in film, in the art department. Around seven years ago, when auditions became more frequent, Jarvis moved to London. \u201cI had no ties left to [Totnes] really, because I kind of abandoned music.\u201d He lived in guardianship properties for years. \u201cI was in an old hospital in Leyton for two years. I had a whole wing to myself, for \u00a3200 a month.\u201d He now lives in east London, but says it\u2019s \u201cstill cheap as fuck. Safe, because you never know how work\u2019s going to be.\u201d In Calm With Horses, he plays an Irishman amid an almost entirely Irish cast, including Barry Keoghan (Dunkirk and The Killing of a Sacred Deer), who plays Arm\u2019s best friend and handler Dympna. Jarvis stayed in accent from the second he arrived in the country. \u201cWe were staying in places with local populations who didn\u2019t really give a shit about the film. You\u2019d just be down the pub, and you\u2019d chat with anybody, so all of the resources that I needed were there.\u201d He pulled it off so convincingly that Niamh Algar, who plays his ex-girlfriend Ursula, was surprised to get a voice message from him in his own English accent. \u201cIt was the only way I knew how to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cWith film, you come in, you blow everything you\u2019ve got, and it\u2019s a short amount of time. You\u2019re getting a good wage to do a creative craft, so you might as well just go all the way out.\u201d The film is as bloody as it is beautiful. Was the violence of it in any way familiar to him? \u201cI mean, not at that level,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never smashed someone through a coffee table. I used to box at school. Got suspended for it a couple of times.\u201d He was suspended for other stuff as well, he says, but that\u2019s not why he left school early. \u201cOh no. I just wasn\u2019t learning anything, and at the time I was working as a musician, so I chose to start working then, on the road, then trying to tour with my band.\u201d Despite some success - his 2011 single Gay Pirates was a cult hit, and has more than 2m views on YouTube \u2013 he says he has finished with music for now. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to try and get any sort of credibility as an actor, I don\u2019t want to have a foot dipping in anything else. It was quite good to leave all that behind, because I think music sort of... nearly killed me.\u201d Did it really? \u201cSort of, sort of,\u201d he smiles. He doesn\u2019t want to sound bitter, he says. \u201cIt was just a young man\u2019s game.\u201d When it comes to making his way in the acting world, Jarvis seems too candid to be much of a schmoozer. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of the time, it is to do with networking and knowing people and presentation and all of that,\u201d he says. Is he any good at it? He smiles. \u201cNot really, no. I still get baffled by the smoke and mirrors stuff, but I totally understand why it\u2019s there, and I\u2019m not going to try and go against any grain, because there\u2019s no point. I\u2019m 30 now.\u201d He spent his 30th birthday last October in New York, shooting Funny Face, a creepy modern fairytale about gentrification which has just played at the Berlin film festival. \u201cI think I was just [filming], and probably telling somebody about how I didn\u2019t want to celebrate my birthday because I\u2019ll be dead in 10 years,\u201d he says, drily. He takes me aback. Don\u2019t say that, I say. \u201cOh, you know,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cType one diabetes catches up with you.\u201d Jarvis is making light of his condition, but he admits that having it does make him think about his own mortality. \u201cIt screws with my philosophy, because I\u2019m pretty much a hater of technology and everything that it involves, but then I rely on it to some extent to survive. I fully accept that if it wasn\u2019t for technology, diabetics and anybody with any ailment would be the first people to be dead. Then it comes down to the point of trying to argue: where is the line to differentiate between technology in the name of excess and technology in the name of accommodating basic human needs?\u201d He seems to enjoy a meaty philosophical chat, particularly when it comes to the subject of technology. He has no social media, and only recently got a smartphone, because his agent told him he had to have one for work. His agent also told him that he was not allowed to \u201cartist myself to death\u201d, as he puts it. So while he\u2019s starring in a number of buzzy independent films \u2013 it\u2019s hard to look at the lineup for a film festival without seeing him attached to at least one entry \u2013 he\u2019s also appearing in Raised By Wolves, HBO\u2019s new sci-fi show, executive-produced by Ridley Scott, about which he can tell me absolutely nothing. He seems content to not sit still. \u201cThere will probably come a time where I have to get a house or pay for a kid,\u201d he reasons, \u201cbut at the minute, I\u2019m really happy with what I\u2019ve done, so far.\u201d Calm With Horses is in cinemas on Friday",

Back in the 1960s some town planners and local politicians decide to build a vast and ambitious new settlement that will later be described as \u201cutopian\u201d.

It was essentially a new town within the boundary of the capital, in an area the size of that part of central London that is enclosed by the Circle line, but so cut off by the broad river and inadequate railways that it might as well have been in another county.

It has commissioned, for example, two previous outstanding projects from Pitman Tozer in inner London. It is a less encouraging sign that last year it removed two architects from a housing project, and handed responsibility for the detailed design to a contractor. The danger is that, overcome by the scale and complexity of the endeavour, the project slides towards the not-bad but not-special solutions of competent property developers. I hope not, as both Peabody and Thamesmead can do better than that.",

Spain has so far confirmed 430 cases of the virus \u2013 60 of which originated among people who attended a funeral service in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, according to Spain\u2019s National Microbiology Centre. Thirty-nine of those 60 cases are in the neighbouring La Rioja region, according the local government, with most of them concentrated in the towns of Haro and Casalarreina. About another 25 cases are reported to have been confirmed in the Basque country. At a press conference on Saturday, the regional health minister and the central government\u2019s representative in La Rioja said the situation called for \u201cexceptional measures and robust action\u201d to halt the spread of the virus. Although only six people in the region are being treated in hospital, the authorities said police would be \u201creinforcing home isolation controls\u201d in Haro and limiting access to the town\u2019s health centre. In a statement, the regional health department said officers from the national police force and the Guardia Civil were being deployed to \u201cguarantee the correct observance of home isolation\u201d. It also called for the cancellation of events in enclosed spaces and urged people to stay at home and contact the authorities if they believed they had picked up the virus. \u201cFollowing the principle of precaution that the department is obliged to abide by, we need to take exceptional measures designed to stop the transmission of the illness between citizens who are not following the advice of the health authorities,\u201d said the regional health minister, Sara Alba. \u201cWe are talking to the national health ministry about the situation in Haro and together we\u2019ve agreed the measures we have taken up to now and are prepared for future scenarios,\u201d she said. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, described the outbreak in La Rioja as \u201ca worrying situation\u201d that required \u201cdrastic\u201d but necessary measures. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about quarantining whole blocks in a small neighbourhood,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cThe situation is ongoing and we don\u2019t know where they are with the measures at the moment.\u201d On Saturday, it was announced that a prison worker at a facility in Aranjuez, 30 miles (50km) south of Madrid, also tested positive for the virus.

This was done in part to calm volatile financial markets. It emerged later that Fed officials had also grown concerned over defaults and bankruptcies among companies already hit hard by delays to vital supplies and consumers staying away.</p> <p>This week the European Central Bank (ECB) meets to calibrate its own response to the crisis. Its options are to match the sense of urgency on display in Washington, or to take of the Bank of England\u2019s measured approach and tell the 19-member eurozone that a wait-and-see approach would be better.</p> <p>Carney said it was not clear whether it was time to spring into full action. But with rates at 0.75%, there is little room for the Bank to help the economy by cutting them.</p> <p>The constraints on the ECB are even tighter. Last September, it cut the rate it offers to private banks further into negative territory, which means lenders are better off lending to domestic businesses than parking their money in the ECB\u2019s vaults.</p> <p>That leaves finance ministries to do most of the heavy lifting. Indeed, the UK could copy the Italian government if the epidemic worsens.</p> <p>Last week, Rome said it would introduce tax credits for companies that reported a 25% drop in revenues, as well as tax cuts and extra cash for the health system, at a cost of \u20ac3.6bn (\u00a33.1bn) or 0.2% of GDP. These funds were in addition to \u20ac900m worth of measures already unveiled for the worst-hit regions.</p> <p>Boris Johnson is expected to hold further meetings with Carney to hammer out a reassuring plan that can be published this week, possibly around the time of the budget on Wednesday. Bank of England officials are also talking to G20 members and the International Monetary Fund over a global response to the outbreak. The IMF and World Bank have put zero-interest loans of $10bn (\u00a37.7bn) and $12bn aside for developing countries with coronavirus cases, and an extra $40bn of emergency funds for nations that run out of dollars to buy health equipment.</p> <p>The head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, said last week she wanted to see a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/04/imf-coronavirus-means-2020-growth-will-be-lower-than-2019\" title=\"\">global solution</a> to head off a pandemic. At the moment plans are being put together by individual countries, so there is much to be done if there is to be a coordinated bolstering of confidence.</p>",

This was done in part to calm volatile financial markets. It emerged later that Fed officials had also grown concerned over defaults and bankruptcies among companies already hit hard by delays to vital supplies and consumers staying away. This week the European Central Bank (ECB) meets to calibrate its own response to the crisis. Its options are to match the sense of urgency on display in Washington, or to take of the Bank of England\u2019s measured approach and tell the 19-member eurozone that a wait-and-see approach would be better. Carney said it was not clear whether it was time to spring into full action. But with rates at 0.75%, there is little room for the Bank to help the economy by cutting them. The constraints on the ECB are even tighter. Last September, it cut the rate it offers to private banks further into negative territory, which means lenders are better off lending to domestic businesses than parking their money in the ECB\u2019s vaults. That leaves finance ministries to do most of the heavy lifting. Indeed, the UK could copy the Italian government if the epidemic worsens. Last week, Rome said it would introduce tax credits for companies that reported a 25% drop in revenues, as well as tax cuts and extra cash for the health system, at a cost of \u20ac3.6bn (\u00a33.1bn) or 0.2% of GDP. These funds were in addition to \u20ac900m worth of measures already unveiled for the worst-hit regions. Boris Johnson is expected to hold further meetings with Carney to hammer out a reassuring plan that can be published this week, possibly around the time of the budget on Wednesday. Bank of England officials are also talking to G20 members and the International Monetary Fund over a global response to the outbreak. The IMF and World Bank have put zero-interest loans of $10bn (\u00a37.7bn) and $12bn aside for developing countries with coronavirus cases, and an extra $40bn of emergency funds for nations that run out of dollars to buy health equipment. The head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, said last week she wanted to see a global solution to head off a pandemic. At the moment plans are being put together by individual countries, so there is much to be done if there is to be a coordinated bolstering of confidence.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s right up there with meal pills, jetpacks, robot butlers and colonies on Mars. Since at least 1962, when the TV cartoon characters George, Jane, Elroy and Judy Jetson first took to the skies, flying cars have been a staple of speculative visions of the future. Designs for dozens of small, affordable, personal flying machines were unveiled in the latter half of the 20th century. Few became airborne and none took commercial flight.</p> <p>Now, however, a form of flying car is set to escape the clutches of eccentrics and the confines of science fiction. A handful of well-funded startups, some backed by major aviation and car companies, have carried out test flights of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Piloted air taxi and shuttle services are expected before 2025. Uber says it expects to be operating aircraft without pilots by around 2030.</p> <p>Heavy hitters including Toyota, Hyundai and Boeing are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/24/flying-cars-boeing-lifts-off-in-race-to-revolutionise-travel\" title=\"\">giving eVTOLs what looks like unstoppable momentum</a> and this raises some important questions. Where will eVTOLs fly? Can operators persuade us their aircraft are safe and quiet enough to fly regularly over our homes and schools? And will they be just a premium service for the rich or a means of mass transportation with the potential to transform the way we live in positive ways?</p> <p>One thing that is clear is that ground-based transport infrastructures are creaking at the seams. Annually, drivers in London <a href=\"https://static.poder360.com.br/2019/02/INRIX_2018_Global_Traffic_Scorecard_Report__final_.pdf\" title=\"\">waste an average of </a><a href=\"https://static.poder360.com.br/2019/02/INRIX_2018_Global_Traffic_Scorecard_Report__final_.pdf\" title=\"\">nine-and-a-half days</a> \u2013 227 hours \u2013 stuck in traffic.

Vertical Aerospace\u2019s third prototype, which it plans to fly later this year, will have a range of 100 miles to target quicker intercity journeys such as Manchester to Leeds, or London to Milton Keynes. US-based <a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/\" title=\"\">Joby Aviation</a> is planning a range of 150 miles, while German company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/21/electric-flying-car-lilium-google-uber-vtol-jet-taxi\" title=\"\">Lilium</a>, with its range of 200 miles between charges, says it could reduce journey times between London and Bristol to half an hour.</p> <p>Others are going straight for what they see as lucrative, congested routes across cities.

Remo Gerber, Lilium\u2019s chief commercial officer, claims his company\u2019s aircraft is \u201cseven to eight times quieter\u201d than a helicopter of comparable size.

Will people fly in something without a pilot?</p> <footer> <cite>Graham Warwick</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Industry leaders also know they will struggle if only the wealthy can afford to fly. Volocopter says that for a journey from central London to Heathrow, it would expect to charge \u00a3100-200. Both Lilium and Vertical Aerospace say starting prices will be similar to first-class rail. Uber says it expects initial prices per mile to compare with its Uber Black executive service, but then close to match UberX prices within two years. On that basis, a 20-mile trip from central London to Heathrow airport including an Uber Air flight would cost around \u00a388 in 2023, falling to \u00a330-35 around 2025. Eric Allison, head of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jan/11/uber-partner-bell-reveals-design-for-flying-taxi-nexus-ces-vegas\" title=\"\">Uber Elevate</a>, says such low prices will be possible thanks to the low maintenance costs of distributed electric propulsion, the ability to incorporate flights into journeys that include Uber cars through its existing platform and pilotless flights. \u201cOur simulations suggest we can drive utilisation and fill seats through our ground network,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Whether Allison is being realistic, optimistic or just engaging in public relations is hard to know. \u201cThis is going to start as a premium service for businesspeople, says <em>Aviation Week</em>\u2019s Warwick. \u201cBut the industry will need to get prices down to reasonable levels quickly before it becomes seen as something only the rich can afford.\u201d</p> <p>One way to do that is to fly without pilots, monitoring aircraft from control centres on the ground. \u201cTo really bring costs down and make this an affordable form of transport for the masses, you have to get the pilot out,\u201d says Warwick. \u201cThe question is, will people fly in something without a pilot? Nobody really knows the answer to that.\u201d</p> <p>Uber expects passengers to be ready to go pilot-free in about a decade. \u201cWe don\u2019t think autonomy is practical from a regulatory and potentially a technology standpoint by 2023,\u201d says Allison. \u201cBut we see self-piloted aircraft with remote monitoring as an inevitable direction, which will make the economics even better and come, we think, end-2020s or 2030.\u201d</p> <p>Some thrill-seeking passengers won\u2019t have to wait that long. In fact, dozens have already flown pilotless in trials carried out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/08/worlds-first-passenger-drone-testing-ehang-nevada\" title=\"\">the Chinese company E</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/08/worlds-first-passenger-drone-testing-ehang-nevada\" title=\"\">Hang</a>, mostly in China but also in the Netherlands, Austria and Qatar. The New Zealand government has agreed to trials of passenger-carrying eVTOLs in the Canterbury region by US company <a href=\"https://wisk.aero\" title=\"\">Wisk</a>, subject to aircraft certification.</p> <p>In a statement, Megan Woods, New Zealand\u2019s minister for research, science and innovation, highlighted \u201cWisk\u2019s vision of a greener, emission-free way for Kiwis and visitors to New Zealand to get around\u201d. Lilium\u2019s Gerber also sees eVTOLs as environmentally friendly. \u201cWe will have a similar end-to-end carbon footprint as electric cars, but we don\u2019t need millions of tonnes of concrete and steel to build connections between places.\u201d</p> <p>That may be true, but eVTOLs\u2019 thirst for power and need to operate frequently to recoup costs means they will work their batteries harder than cars. Batteries are likely to need replacing after a year to 18 months and making lithium ion batteries emits a lot of CO<sub>2</sub>. </p> <p>Some manufacturers do believe the technology can bring positive changes to our lifestyles, however. \u201cIf people can travel much more quickly, we can unlock a lot of potential in medium-size cities that today are seen as secondary,\u201d says Gerber. \u201cIt has the potential to relieve the pressure on the biggest cities and provide opportunities for people to live and work in new ways.\u201d</p> <p>Such visions of transformative decentralisation would require mass production of vehicles, huge infrastructure building and widespread adoption, all of which are, at best, a long way off. It does, however, seem likely that eVTOL flying taxi and shuttles will begin operating in the next few years. Less certain is whether the planned public acceptance campaigns will succeed and whether the industry can scale up and reduce prices as rapidly as it needs to to avoid eVTOLs being labelled as a billionaire\u2019s plaything.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a lot of hype, but I think the hype is in the timeframe, not in the technology,\u201d says Warwick, who has been covering the sector for <em>Aviation Week</em> for close to a decade. \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain we will see initial commercial services with a relatively small number of vehicles some time between 2023 and 2025. But as for the long-term vision of mass transportation, I think it will be some time after 2035 before we get to any sort of scale.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Flying taxis: early risers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"398455efb0fef52998f3edd2775d17944f2560d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/398455efb0fef52998f3edd2775d17944f2560d0/0_90_2974_1784/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volocopter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.volocopter.com/en/product/\" title=\"\">Volocopter VoloCity</a> </strong><br><strong>Vehicle type:</strong> 18-rotor multicopter <br><strong>Capacity</strong><strong>:</strong> Pilot + one passenger + hand luggage <br><strong>Range</strong><strong>:</strong> 22 miles (35km) <br><strong>Speed</strong><strong>:</strong> 68mph (110km/h) <br><strong>Launch:</strong> 2022-2023 <br><strong>Who</strong><strong>:</strong> Based in Bruchsal, Germany, co-founded by the former skateboarding star Alex Zosel and backed by the Chinese car company Geely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ba278778cc6d3590f8fa9c6935e814f9bed103c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ba278778cc6d3590f8fa9c6935e814f9bed103c/0_285_4700_2821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EHang 184\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.ehang.com/ehangaav\" title=\"\">E</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.ehang.com/ehangaav\" title=\"\">Hang 216</a> </strong><br><strong>Vehicle type:</strong> Multicopter with 16 propellers <br><strong>Capacity:</strong> Two passengers, no pilot <br><strong>Range:</strong> 22 miles (35km) <br><strong>Speed:</strong> 81mph (130km/h)<br><strong>Launch:</strong> Unknown <br><strong>Who:</strong> Startup based in Guangzhou, China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44a055f372c336046bf3f7f77491f67d5a5a8eb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44a055f372c336046bf3f7f77491f67d5a5a8eb9/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lilium Jet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://lilium.com/the-jet\" title=\"\">Lilium Jet</a> </strong><br><strong>Vehicle type:</strong> Vectored thrust, with 36 jet engines <br><strong>Capacity:</strong> Pilot + four passengers <br><strong>Range:</strong> 186 miles (300km) <br><strong>Speed:</strong> 186mph (300km/h)<br><strong>Launch:</strong> 2025 <br><strong>Who:</strong> Munich-based startup with investors including Chinese internet giant Tencent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ad746146507e8c911bc80e86f32a5b83f792cf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ad746146507e8c911bc80e86f32a5b83f792cf6/0_171_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joby S4\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/\" title=\"\">Joby S4</a> </strong><br><strong>Vehicle type:</strong> Vectored thrust with six tilting propellers <br><strong>Capacity:</strong> Pilot + four passengers <br><strong>Range:</strong> 150 miles (240km) <br><strong>Speed:</strong> 200mph (322km/h)<br><strong>Launch:</strong> 2023 <br><strong>Who:</strong> California-based startup founded in 2009, backed by major investors including Toyota and Intel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e5244409f1d51044f281906d9dd3814f9df53cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e5244409f1d51044f281906d9dd3814f9df53cb/0_428_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"Wisk Cora\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://wisk.aero/cora/\" title=\"\">Wisk Cora</a> </strong><br><strong>Vehicle type:</strong> Hybrid with fixed wings and 12 rotors <br><strong>Capacity:</strong> Two passengers, no pilot <br><strong>Range:</strong> 25 miles (40km) <br><strong>Speed:</strong> 100mph (160km/h) <br><strong>Launch:</strong> Unknown <br><strong>Who:</strong> Joint venture between Silicon Valley startup <a href=\"https://kittyhawk.aero\" title=\"\">Kitty Hawk</a> and Boeing, backed by Google\u2019s Larry Page.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"198674ec8d6de782ce00baa7d8b102c8765f81a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/198674ec8d6de782ce00baa7d8b102c8765f81a3/0_550_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seraph\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"http://vertical-aerospace.com\" title=\"\">Vertical Aerospace Seraph</a> </strong><br><strong>Vehicle type:</strong> Multicopter with 12 propellers <br><strong>Capacity:</strong> Pilot + two passengers <br><strong>Range:</strong> Unknown <br><strong>Speed:</strong> 50mph (80km/h) <br><strong>Launch:</strong> The company plans to unveil a prototype hybrid with fixed wings and rotors, and space for a pilot and four passengers later this year.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s right up there with meal pills, jetpacks, robot butlers and colonies on Mars. Since at least 1962, when the TV cartoon characters George, Jane, Elroy and Judy Jetson first took to the skies, flying cars have been a staple of speculative visions of the future. Designs for dozens of small, affordable, personal flying machines were unveiled in the latter half of the 20th century. Few became airborne and none took commercial flight. Now, however, a form of flying car is set to escape the clutches of eccentrics and the confines of science fiction. A handful of well-funded startups, some backed by major aviation and car companies, have carried out test flights of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Piloted air taxi and shuttle services are expected before 2025. Uber says it expects to be operating aircraft without pilots by around 2030. Heavy hitters including Toyota, Hyundai and Boeing are giving eVTOLs what looks like unstoppable momentum and this raises some important questions. Where will eVTOLs fly? Can operators persuade us their aircraft are safe and quiet enough to fly regularly over our homes and schools? And will they be just a premium service for the rich or a means of mass transportation with the potential to transform the way we live in positive ways? One thing that is clear is that ground-based transport infrastructures are creaking at the seams. Annually, drivers in London waste an average of nine-and-a-half days \u2013 227 hours \u2013 stuck in traffic. Workers in Los Angeles and Sydney spend the equivalent of seven working weeks commuting a year. Industry enthusiasts don\u2019t think eVTOLs will have a major impact on congestion within a few years, but they do believe they can play a role in the longer term. \u201cGround infrastructure simply cannot keep up with increasing urbanisation and the congestion it is causing,\u201d says Michael Cervenka, chief executive officer at Vertical Aerospace, a Bristol-based startup. \u201cWe will start small and it is not a magic bullet, but we see an opportunity for eVTOLs to be part of the solution to pent-up global demand.\u201d Some companies believe that rapidly persuading city dwellers to feel relaxed about seeing aircraft regularly zipping above their heads may be a leap too far. Vertical Aerospace\u2019s third prototype, which it plans to fly later this year, will have a range of 100 miles to target quicker intercity journeys such as Manchester to Leeds, or London to Milton Keynes. US-based Joby Aviation is planning a range of 150 miles, while German company Lilium, with its range of 200 miles between charges, says it could reduce journey times between London and Bristol to half an hour. Others are going straight for what they see as lucrative, congested routes across cities. Uber has announced plans for Uber Air eVTOL services in Dallas, Los Angeles and Melbourne by 2023. In January, it announced a deal with Korean carmaker Hyundai, which plans to mass produce eVTOLs for the Uber Air network. German company Volocopter, which carried out a first manned urban test flight for its two-seater eVTOL in Singapore in October, is also planning for short city hops. There are three broad classes of vehicle: wingless \u201cmulticopters\u201d, which are best suited for shorter journeys and rely on rotors for both vertical and horizontal movement; \u201clift and cruise\u201d eVTOLs, which use rotors to hover and wings for more efficient cruising; and more complex \u201cvectored thrust\u201d systems that have wings and fans or propellers and can swivel their thrust generators. One thing the rivals agree on is that services will run between take-off and landing pads, or \u201cvertiports\u201d, not passengers\u2019 initial setting-off points and final destinations. \u201cNobody is talking about point to point,\u201d says Graham Warwick, executive editor for technology at Aviation Week. \u201cThey don\u2019t think they will ever be quiet enough to fly into people\u2019s backyards.\u201d Flying taxi companies are all too aware that at present most people do not differentiate between eVTOLs and helicopters and so they are tainted by noisy association. \u201cThe main reason we don\u2019t see helicopters flying around cities all the time is that people don\u2019t want to be exposed to the noise they make,\u201d says Volocopter\u2019s Fabien Nestmann.

In fact, dozens have already flown pilotless in trials carried out by the Chinese company EHang, mostly in China but also in the Netherlands, Austria and Qatar. The New Zealand government has agreed to trials of passenger-carrying eVTOLs in the Canterbury region by US company Wisk, subject to aircraft certification. In a statement, Megan Woods, New Zealand\u2019s minister for research, science and innovation, highlighted \u201cWisk\u2019s vision of a greener, emission-free way for Kiwis and visitors to New Zealand to get around\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget on Wednesday was supposed to be a landmark event that set the stage for five years of extraordinary Conservative government spending to upgrade Britain\u2019s infrastructure and \u201clevel up\u201d economic activity between London the regions. The chancellor was expected to talk about both aims along with plans to cut taxes for low-income workers, a boost to skills training and how the government plans to meet carbon-reduction objectives before the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in November. However, before he talks about any of these things, Sunak will now have to address the most pressing issue confronting the government \u2013 how to limit the spread and impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Here is what to expect in what is being billed as one of the most hurriedly rewritten budgets of recent times. Coronavirus outbreak There will be extra cash for the health service to fund test centres at hospitals and to purchase testing kits. Cash for GP surgeries, which are expected to come under intense pressure as the virus spreads, will also be set aside. Attempts to attract back retired and semi-retired doctors and nurses to help cope with the anticipated epidemic have so far failed, according to some reports from health trusts. Sunak is expected to help stem the tide by easing the restrictions on pension tax relief. It is hoped this will reverse the exodus of doctors in recent years as they hit their tax-free limits. Many have quit after exceeding their limit and being asked to make large repayments. Concerns that small businesses will be badly hit by a spike in sickness rates and the need for many staff to self-isolate has spurred the Treasury to bolt together a multimillion-pound protection fund. Employers with up to 100 employees will be able to make claims on the fund to recover some of the costs to their businesses from the virus outbreak, Sunak will say. The chancellor is concerned that smaller firms will find it more difficult coping with staff absences than large companies.

An increase in the cap from 3% to 3.5% of GDP would give him a further \u00a310bn to \u00a312bn headroom in the years ahead. Sunak, though, is expected to say that more than \u00a3100bn in extra spending to boost the economy and tackle the climate emergency will be delayed until after the budget. The Treasury may have hundreds more staff than it did just two years ago to put in place new policies. However, most of them have found themselves up to their eyes in Brexit planning and, in more recent weeks, deciding how to cope with the coronavirus. A plan to improve transport connectivity and work towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, due to be published alongside the budget, will now be delayed for several weeks. Plans to kickstart the government\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda look like being delayed even further, most likely to the autumn budget. National insurance threshold/national minimum wage The chancellor will be keen to say he is improving the incomes of low-paid workers. A rise in the national insurance threshold and a faster increase in minimum wage will be billed as offering support. It is understood that planning for a rise in the national insurance threshold from \u00a38,632 to \u00a39,500 from the start of the 2020-21 tax year was well advanced when Sunak took over at the Treasury following Sajid Javid\u2019s shock resignation in the second week of February. This change will give an average family with two earners a tax cut of about \u00a3192 a year. Last September, Javid declared the Conservatives were now the \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d of Britain, as he announced plans to extend the main minimum wage rate to all workers aged 21 and over and raise it to two-thirds of median earnings by April 2024. Sunak is expected to make a similar pledge, though maybe to push back the target date from 2024. Entrepreneurs\u2019 relief/fuel duty/tax reform There is a head of steam behind demands to abolish entrepreneurs\u2019 relief, saving an estimated \u00a32.6bn, or at least reform it. With only an estimated 5,200 people benefiting last year and speculation that they all number among the super-rich, the tax break could be chopped or limited to smaller businesses. Plans to reform pension tax relief are expected to be considered by a wide-ranging review of the government\u2019s support for retirement saving. More than \u00a340bn is lost to the exchequer from subsidising pension savings, with the bulk going to higher-rate taxpayers. Accountants report wealthy individuals adding to their pensions before the budget in case limits are put on the tax-free benefits. Property taxes are also in the chancellor\u2019s sights. Council tax could be reviewed, along with stamp duty, the main tax on property transactions, which has become a limiting factor on sales of homes at the top of the market. Boris Johnson hinted that fuel tax could rise, or fall, before the general election. Sunak, under pressure to maintain tax receipts as the decline in petrol and diesel vehicles is increasing, is expected to signal a rise, but implement it in a year or two. Climate emergency Sunak, who is keen to implement the manifesto promises the Conservative party made last year, will say he plans to invest in nature, with a \u00a3640m \u201cnature for climate\u201d fund to plant 75,000 acres of trees a year by the end of the parliament, as well as restoring peatland. He should also outline how the government will spend \u00a36.3bn committed for energy efficiency, plus \u00a31bn for vehicle charging points and \u00a3800m to limit emissions through initiatives to capture carbon and store it.

      "body": "<p>When Barack Obama was US president, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/magazine/02FOB-onlanguage-t.html\" title=\"\">useful motto</a>: \u201cNever let a serious crisis go to waste: it\u2019s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.\u201d The Chinese authorities have clearly taken this to heart \u2013 as evidenced by the unprecedented scale of their geographical lockdowns and quarantining, restrictions on movement, industrial slowdowns and heightened surveillance.</p> <p>At this distance, it\u2019s impossible to judge how effective these measures really are. But all the experienced China-watchers of my acquaintance tell me that one should never underestimate the gap between realities on the ground and the story as told from Beijing. An instructive illustration of this is provided by a <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n05/wang-xiuying/the-word-from-wuhan\" title=\"\">fascinating dispatch</a> from Wuhan in the <em>London Review of Books</em><em>.</em> It\u2019s by Wang Xiuying (who describes herself as \u201ca pessimist who\u2019s trying hard to stay positive in self-quarantine\u201d). She tells of a good deal of local chaos and serious tensions between the provincial authorities and the big cheeses in Beijing. She also describes great local heroism (particularly among health workers) and self-sacrifice. All of which sounds more plausible to me.</p> <p>One thing that does appear to be happening in China, however, is deployment of the state\u2019s surveillance capabilities. At the heart of the project is the ubiquity of smartphones. According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html\" title=\"\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html\" title=\"\">New York Times</a></em>, citizens are now being required to install an app on their phones that dictates whether they should be quarantined or allowed into subways, malls and other public spaces.

      "bodyText": "When Barack Obama was US president, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had a useful motto: \u201cNever let a serious crisis go to waste: it\u2019s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.\u201d The Chinese authorities have clearly taken this to heart \u2013 as evidenced by the unprecedented scale of their geographical lockdowns and quarantining, restrictions on movement, industrial slowdowns and heightened surveillance. At this distance, it\u2019s impossible to judge how effective these measures really are. But all the experienced China-watchers of my acquaintance tell me that one should never underestimate the gap between realities on the ground and the story as told from Beijing. An instructive illustration of this is provided by a fascinating dispatch from Wuhan in the London Review of Books. It\u2019s by Wang Xiuying (who describes herself as \u201ca pessimist who\u2019s trying hard to stay positive in self-quarantine\u201d). She tells of a good deal of local chaos and serious tensions between the provincial authorities and the big cheeses in Beijing. She also describes great local heroism (particularly among health workers) and self-sacrifice. All of which sounds more plausible to me. One thing that does appear to be happening in China, however, is deployment of the state\u2019s surveillance capabilities. At the heart of the project is the ubiquity of smartphones. According to the New York Times, citizens are now being required to install an app on their phones that dictates whether they should be quarantined or allowed into subways, malls and other public spaces. People sign up for the \u201cAlipay health code\u201d and are assigned a colour code \u2013 green, yellow or red \u2013 that indicates their health status. A green code enables its holder to move about unrestricted. Someone with a yellow code may be asked to stay at home for seven days. Red means a two-week quarantine. The system is already in use in 200 cities and is being rolled out nationwide. The NYT report has an interesting video showing a subway guard checking every passenger\u2019s colour code as they go past the gate.

Writing in the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, the legal scholar John Palfrey describes how this system has been used to track \u201ccode red\u201d travellers through subway and railway networks back to their family homes in Wuhan, where police tape is put over their front doors and neighbours are asked to call a hotline if they see anyone leave the premises. Meanwhile, back in the UK, we\u2019re in a \u201cphoney war\u201d phase as we wait for infection to spread. But already there are useful lessons to be learned.

Hilary Mantel: Meghan, you\u2019re in safe hands When Hilary Mantel gave her now infamous London Review of Books lecture, Royal Bodies, at the British Museum in 2013, she dissected the spectacle of the royal family, particularly its women. Having dared to offer an opinion on the public presentation of the Duchess of Cambridge, and a supportive one at that, the novelist found herself at the centre of what must have been an entirely unexpected storm, with added irony, given that the lecture ended with a call for us to \u201cback off and not be brutes\u201d. So it was inevitable that, when doing the promotional rounds for The Mirror and the Light, she would be asked about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Dutifully, and wonderfully, she has answered, despite being burned in the past. \u201cI think that Meghan was too good to be true,\u201d she told Harper\u2019s Bazaar. \u201cShe was a smiling face in a dull institution, she cheered the nation up no end, or at least men and women of goodwill. I do think abominable racism has been involved.\u201d She told the BBC: \u201cI hesitate to call her a victim but I think there has been an element of racism in the invective against her.\u201d Sometimes, amid the endless chatter, it is simply refreshing to have an articulate adult in the room. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

Meanwhile, US authorities are preparing to deal with a cruise ship carrying British passengers off the Californian coast, after 21 people on board tested positive for coronavirus. Mike Pence, the US vice-president, said on Friday that the Grand Princess, with more than 3,500 people on board \u2013 including 140 Britons \u2013 had been directed to a non-commercial port for testing. The public has been told to prepare itself in case \u201csocial distancing\u201d policies are needed to help contain the spread of the virus. However the UK remains in the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase of tracing coronavirus cases to prevent it spreading in the community, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer has said. Jennie Harries told the BBC on Saturday that a decision about the next phase of delaying the spread of the virus would depend on how fast the number of cases rose. The government\u2019s battle plan says of the \u201cdelay\u201d phase: \u201cAction that would be considered could include population-distancing strategies (such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings) to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, while ensuring the country\u2019s ability to continue to run as normally as possible.\u201d On Friday, it was confirmed that a man in his early 80s had become the second person to die in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus. The man, who had underlying health conditions, died on Thursday while being treated at Milton Keynes University hospital. The previous evening, another patient, reported to be a woman in her 70s, became the first person in the UK to die after being diagnosed with Covid-19 while at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading. NHS England has confirmed it will provide GP surgeries with personal protective equipment (PPE) to help them deal with the coronavirus outbreak. In a letter sent to all 7,000 English GP surgeries on Thursday, NHS England made clear it is giving every surgery a full supply of PPE gear, which will help keep staff who come into contact with suspected coronavirus cases safe and help to minimise the spread of the virus. The move follows complaints by GPs and the British Medical Association that practices are ill-equipped to deal with the outbreak. On Friday, GP surgeries were told by NHS England to start conducting as many remote consultations as possible, replacing patient visits with phone, video, online or text contact. More than 20 GP practices have been forced to close temporarily over concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Boris Johnson will chair a Cobra civil contingencies committee on Monday as officials prepare to accelerate work on the delay phase of the government\u2019s plan. Sports governing bodies and broadcasters have also been called to a government meeting on Monday to discuss how to handle the possible impact of the outbreak on the sporting calendar.",

But almost four decades later, the propensity for MPs to drink too much, and the way the Westminster culture encourages them to do so, is still causing concern. Last week the British Medical Journal published results of a survey of MPs, conducted in late 2016 but not revealed until now, which found that binge drinking \u2013 having more than six units in one session \u2013 was more common among those who make the laws of the land than the general public. One of those behind the survey was Tory MP Dan Poulter, a GP, teetotaller and part-time NHS psychiatrist.

This is the sum of all the grief.\u201d</p> <p>The film focuses on 18 cases chosen because they were deemed representative of the thousands killed. \u201cThe selection was often based on letters or quotations, something that someone said that reached out from the pages and struck us as extraordinarily eloquent in a time of grief,\u201d said Lavery.</p> <p>The film blends cinematic depictions of Northern Irish landscapes with archive news footage \u2013 some of it extremely graphic \u2013 as well as press clippings and a score performed by the Ulster Orchestra.</p> <p>The final credits roll for several minutes because they include every name in the book plus those killed since 1999, ending with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/15/lyra-mckee-remembered-by-sara-canning\">Lyra McKee, the writer shot dead</a> during a riot in Derry last year.</p> <p>\u201cWe made a commitment to list everyone \u2013 to leave a moment of profound reflection at the end,\u201d said Lavery.</p> <p>The two directors hope the film will be shown in conflict and post-conflict zones around the world. \u201cWe have been struck by the silence that follows screenings,\u201d said Hewitt. \u201cPeople reflect on the human cost.\u201d</p> <p>The film, which was broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland last month, comes at a sensitive time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/23/families-troubles-victims-vexatious-northern-ireland\">Families of the Troubles\u2019 victims are not \u2018vexatious\u2019.

He lay in a hospital bed, a bullet in his head, apparently conscious but unable to move or speak, until he died in 1995, aged 55. Every day of those 22 years he was visited by his wife, May.</p> <p>The originator of Lost Lives was the late Seamus Kelters, an Irish News reporter who started documenting the dead of north Belfast and ended up part of a team of journalists and academics: David McKittrick, Brian Feeney, Chris Thornton and David McVea, which produced an exhaustive, singular work.</p> <p>\u201cWe kept it as impartial as we could,\u201d said McKittrick, the former Ireland correspondent of the Independent. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the authority to say which killing was murder and which was not.\u201d Before publication he had braced for political backlash but none came. \u201cNobody said the book shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone seemed to recognise the book\u2019s value, including shoplifters.

Except the list grew, widened, deepened. Eventually it covered all of Northern Ireland, all the killings, and told the stories of all the dead. It became Lost Lives, a 1,600-page book just shy of a million words. Published in 1999, it documented more than 3,700 deaths spanning the entire Troubles. It is a unique publication \u2013 nothing comparable exists for any other conflict. On Saturday, BBC Two will screen the UK-wide television premiere of the book\u2019s transformation into film: a 90-minute feature with narrations by Liam Neeson, Br\u00edd Brennan, Kenneth Branagh, Stephen Rea and other actors. Its co-directors, Dermot Lavery and Michael Hewitt, describe the film as a requiem for the Troubles and an injunction to not repeat the past. \u201cThe book and the film are a reminder of the scale and intensity of the conflict,\u201d said Lavery. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we remind ourselves of just how bad it was. This is the sum of all the grief.\u201d The film focuses on 18 cases chosen because they were deemed representative of the thousands killed. \u201cThe selection was often based on letters or quotations, something that someone said that reached out from the pages and struck us as extraordinarily eloquent in a time of grief,\u201d said Lavery. The film blends cinematic depictions of Northern Irish landscapes with archive news footage \u2013 some of it extremely graphic \u2013 as well as press clippings and a score performed by the Ulster Orchestra. The final credits roll for several minutes because they include every name in the book plus those killed since 1999, ending with Lyra McKee, the writer shot dead during a riot in Derry last year. \u201cWe made a commitment to list everyone \u2013 to leave a moment of profound reflection at the end,\u201d said Lavery. The two directors hope the film will be shown in conflict and post-conflict zones around the world. \u201cWe have been struck by the silence that follows screenings,\u201d said Hewitt. \u201cPeople reflect on the human cost.\u201d The film, which was broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland last month, comes at a sensitive time. Sinn F\u00e9in triumphed in Ireland\u2019s general election but still faces questions over its links with the IRA. Brexit has raised questions about Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional status, rattling loyalists and emboldening republicans. In Northern Ireland, so-called \u201clegacy issues\u201d \u2013 unresolved killings from the Troubles \u2013 continue to polarise public opinion and haunt politics. This week, a Belfast coroner\u2019s court heard final oral evidence into the army\u2019s shooting dead of 10 people in Ballymurphy in 1971. Next week, Dennis Hutchings, a 78-year-old former soldier, goes on trial over a 1974 killing, a prosecution that has angered many in the Conservative party. Those behind Lost Lives, both book and film, withheld condemnation and focused on the humanity of those killed and the anguish of those left behind. The film includes the story of nine-year-old Patrick Rooney, killed in his home by a Royal Ulster Constabulary bullet during a riot in August 1969. The book also tells the story of Jim Seymour, an RUC constable shot in 1973. He lay in a hospital bed, a bullet in his head, apparently conscious but unable to move or speak, until he died in 1995, aged 55. Every day of those 22 years he was visited by his wife, May. The originator of Lost Lives was the late Seamus Kelters, an Irish News reporter who started documenting the dead of north Belfast and ended up part of a team of journalists and academics: David McKittrick, Brian Feeney, Chris Thornton and David McVea, which produced an exhaustive, singular work. \u201cWe kept it as impartial as we could,\u201d said McKittrick, the former Ireland correspondent of the Independent. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the authority to say which killing was murder and which was not.\u201d Before publication he had braced for political backlash but none came. \u201cNobody said the book shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d Everyone seemed to recognise the book\u2019s value, including shoplifters. Lost Lives was reportedly the most stolen book in Belfast.",

      "body": "<p>I am running along the river, earbuds in, lungs burning, heart racing. No birdsong, thank you very much. Only curated noise and introspection. Then I see her. A woman walking towards me, her dog a little way ahead. We smile, briefly, and as we cross one another she pauses for a moment. I do, too, my eyes caught. The way it dangles from her shoulder, the double gold chain glinting in the sunlight. It is exactly like the one I have at home and yet\u2026 so not. Reflexively she flicks her bag back and it grazes her hip. I slow to a walk to get a better look. This version is newer and smaller. So much smaller than mine. It is shinier, too, infinitely covetable. Undeniably superior in every way. It speaks of lightness, of newfound freedom, of being out in the morning sunshine with few possessions (I calculate there\u2019s no room in there for more than an iPhone and keys) except, of course, <em>the</em> possession itself. In comparison, my older and bigger version is grounded at home, bloated, out of time, a lumbering dinosaur. Old bag.</p> <p>How could I have got it so wrong? I speed up again, start to run in sync with my shuffle, but the moment has gone. The dark pull of material desire has intruded again. I try to switch off, but it is difficult not to notice. A tote here. A micro bag there. A crossbody bag everywhere. Handbag envy. Often it is admiration, sometimes, if I\u2019m honest, there is pity. Michael Kors, Kurt Geiger. Really? But how swiftly admiration turns to envy when there is flawless gold hardware involved. Can I really be this shallow? Do I even need to ask? Lusting after something like this makes you a fool. An unfeminist fool.</p> <p>Last week in a toy shop with my eight-year-old daughter I saw a \u201cMy First Handbag for two-year-olds and up\u201d. The packaging proclaimed, \u201cLittle ones will love taking this pretty pink handbag on a shopping trip and pretending to be just like Mum! Take a peek in the mirror and chat on the phone. Playing pretend will boost your child\u2019s imagination and encourage them to talk and learn new words.\u201d Like: \u201cMummy, buy me a Gucci!\u201d But obsession is never this simple. I suspect my interest in handbags was more a small act of rebellion than social conditioning, a reaction against my mother\u2019s infinitely sensible handbag choices: natural leather, functional, unembellished. Her modest choice of accessory was far more successful in fuelling my false need than any marketing campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"70c4ba49359628339e4c417f98c1162611239828\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70c4ba49359628339e4c417f98c1162611239828/0_0_3713_3553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bag with a message: an \u2018anti-slavery reticule\u2019 produced in 1825 by the Female Society for Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"957\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bag with a message: an \u2018anti-slavery reticule\u2019 produced in 1825 by the Female Society for Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christine Smith/Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it took until my 50th birthday to really follow through and invest in the Only One.

It has to be for the price I paid. My husband is still appalled; it will always be a purchase that baffles him. He likes to remind me that my bag cost more than his beloved bike (surely the Gucci of bikes, with a custom-steel Italian Dedacciai frame, he tells me) that gets him to work each day \u2013 as if this is a clear win in the battle for most functional possession.</p> <p>I explain, slowly and patiently, that mine is not just a thing of beauty, but a practical form of transportation, too, for my possessions; my way of navigating the world and getting what matters most to me from A to B.</p> <p>You see, to truly appreciate a handbag, you have to look beyond its surface, challenging though this can be, to what\u2019s inside and how that shapes and defines you.</p> <p>It is reassuring to see that the argument I hone for my husband is now the focus of a V&amp;A exhibition next month. <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/bags?gclid=CjwKCAiA7t3yBRADEiwA4GFlIyEEYTqyAFo3Bw76ewcJ8pY7Wc7bSY-t5a--sUW2tr-ur4iRpMRRcxoCeYIQAvD_BwE\" title=\"\">Bags: Inside Out</a>, from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Asprey to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/12/sarah-jessica-parker-what-would-carrie-bradshaw-be-like-in-2019\" title=\"\">Carrie Bradshaw</a>\u2019s Fendi, will look at what we have chosen to carry with us down the centuries. \u201cWe normally see bags when they\u2019re closed, but I want to see the insides,\u201d says exhibition curator <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/l/lucia-savi-biography/\" title=\"\">Dr Lucia Savi</a>. While much attention is paid to the exterior \u2013 its design, status and, inevitably, its price tag, less scrutiny is paid to this rich and complex internal life and the tension between the two. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you leave home that you decide what is important to you \u2013 those things you choose to carry with you define you,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b59547a2947920ccafeb2694d087bb21dc9b2e6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b59547a2947920ccafeb2694d087bb21dc9b2e6b/268_885_2479_2525/982.jpg\" alt=\"Royal approval: Burse for the Great Seal of England, 1558-1603.\" width=\"982\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Royal approval: Burse for the Great Seal of England, 1558-1603.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria and Albert Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When a woman stepped out in the 1740s, her private belongings would have included a watch, a snuff box, money, jewellery and perhaps some food, according to Savi. These are what she chose to take from her domestic sphere into the world thanks to detachable pockets that were tied around the waist, accessible through openings in the seams of petticoats.</p> <p>By 1863, she may have included scissors, a purse, a thimble, a miniature notebook and a magnifying glass. These she would have worn in the form of a chatelaine: a series of small purses that were suspended from the waist and highly visible. \u201cIt was symbolic of status,\u201d says Savi. \u201cAlong with that there were reports of pickpockets who would cut the ribbons and steal them. It\u2019s the first signs we see of the attention paid to women carrying belongings.\u201d</p> <p>What many women carry in their bags some three centuries later is remarkably unchanged. One friend lists the contents of her bag at this moment as: \u201cA book, cosmetics, phone, keys, reading glasses, spare contact lenses and eye drops, \u2018emergency\u2019 vegan kit (banana, vitamin supplements and, sometimes, a small vial of soya milk), paracetamol, umbrella, purse, stamps, bank and membership cards, miniature sewing kit and/or lingerie tape, spare tights/socks, perfume.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe content is so crucial,\u201d says Savi. \u201cAs bank notes came in, handbags had to be compatible, at least bigger than a \u00a35 note.\u201d Now we carry cards, it is the phone that dictates design. \u201cNo one will create a bag that doesn\u2019t fit the largest phone on the market.\u201d Hard currency has shaped bags more than any other single possession, epitomised in 2018 by the appearance of the micro bag. There was no more potent symbol of a cashless society than the shrinking bag, although Savi is unconvinced by this connection. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing new. The frog purse, dating back to the 1600s and intricately made in silk and glass beads, is the same size as your hand. It\u2019s really the micro bag of today.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c3712164705d0293cca30f65bda209c998b47d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c3712164705d0293cca30f65bda209c998b47d4/108_230_893_1136/786.jpg\" alt=\"Making waves: Stella McCartney x Parley for the Oceans, 2018.\" width=\"786\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Making waves: Stella McCartney x Parley for the Oceans, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria and Albert Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More surprising, she says, is how the most ordinary of bags can communicate something about us. \u201cIt\u2019s a blank canvas that can tell us all sorts of things: your status, your beliefs.\u201d One of her favourite pieces on show is an \u201canti-slavery reticule\u201d produced in 1825 by the <a href=\"https://blog.bham.ac.uk/legalherstory/2018/03/15/elizabeth-heyrick-and-the-birmingham-ladies-society-for-the-relief-of-negro-slaves/\" title=\"\">Female Society for Birmingham</a>. It is white silk with an image of a black woman breastfeeding while still a slave \u2013 displayed on a bag it was a powerful and very public way for a woman to convey her political beliefs at that time. \u201cThat tells you so much; how women were proclaiming their beliefs and it carries on with examples like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/16/anya-hindmarch-fashion-plastic-bag-bottletop-tote\" title=\"\">Anya Hindmarch</a>\u2019s I Am Not A Plastic Bag.\u201d</p> <p>Savi is keen that the exhibition embraces bags in all their glory, not just the female handbag. Which is why Churchill\u2019s despatch box is on show, as well as other bags used by men. Baggage began with men, says Savi, and was mainly for the train. \u201cLouis Vuitton started with luxury travel, transferring their leather-making skills from horses to trains and then aeroplanes. Herm\u00e8s started with saddlery and they still use those techniques in their stitching.\u201d</p> <p>Now we\u2019re going full circle. According to Mintel, a quarter of men aged 16-24 buy manbags. But even if the manbag achieves parity, it is difficult to imagine it will be quite as iconic, as rich in metaphor, as its female equivalent. Will the tension between public and private space, that Savi explores, ever apply to men in quite the same way?</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/fashion-and-psychoanalysis-9780857721280/\" title=\"\">Dr Alison Bancroft</a>, fashion theorist and author of <em>Fashion and Psychoanalysis</em>, says: \u201cThe very fact that we have to prefix it with \u2018man\u2019 means it\u2019s not the same. It is something different.\u201d She tells me how a male friend of hers recently asked for a paracetamol and when she told him it was in her handbag, he wouldn\u2019t look inside. \u201cInstead he brought the whole bag to me. The handbag is about a degree of intimacy not everyone feels comfortable with.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbf10d52486e1d8f0f19660b93c4ed71549d3610\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf10d52486e1d8f0f19660b93c4ed71549d3610/574_247_2015_3753/537.jpg\" alt=\"To the point: Tracey Emin for Longchamp, 2004.\" width=\"537\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To the point: Tracey Emin for Longchamp, 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Auton/Victoria and Albert Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A handbag can establish boundaries and respect, but the flip side is less savoury. Bancroft recalls seeing the aftermath of a mugging in her local park and the remnants of an emptied handbag on the path. \u201cThat\u2019s when you see it as a real violation, an act of violence against a person.\u201d</p> <p>I think back to the fleeting, primal panic, when my brain calibrates an absence, a lack of weight in what I\u2019m carrying \u2013 I have left my handbag somewhere. In those moments I feel unmoored, as if I have lost part of myself. As Bancroft says: \u201cHow many times have you heard a woman say, \u2018It is part of me. My life is in there?\u2019\u201d Maybe that is too much power to invest in a single object. Wouldn\u2019t we feel freer relying on pockets, or just carrying less? But then Savi tells me about another highlight in the exhibition \u2013 a beautiful, battered Louis Vuitton trunk from the 1900s that belonged to Emilie Busbey Grigsby, an American socialite. Her trunk was a symbol of freedom, covered in travel labels of the places she, and it, had spent a lifetime visiting.</p> <p>A bag can be whatever you want it to be. It can offer the promise of a sleek, well-ordered better version of yourself, a superior mini-you or, like Emilie, a wonderful souvenir of your travels. As my friend, who never knowingly underpacks, says: \u201cA bag isn\u2019t a burden but rather a ticket to ride.\u201d</p> <p><em>Bags: Inside Out, sponsored by Mulberry, is at the V&amp;A, 25 April</em><em>-31 January</em><em>.

There was no more potent symbol of a cashless society than the shrinking bag, although Savi is unconvinced by this connection. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing new. The frog purse, dating back to the 1600s and intricately made in silk and glass beads, is the same size as your hand. It\u2019s really the micro bag of today.\u201d More surprising, she says, is how the most ordinary of bags can communicate something about us. \u201cIt\u2019s a blank canvas that can tell us all sorts of things: your status, your beliefs.\u201d One of her favourite pieces on show is an \u201canti-slavery reticule\u201d produced in 1825 by the Female Society for Birmingham. It is white silk with an image of a black woman breastfeeding while still a slave \u2013 displayed on a bag it was a powerful and very public way for a woman to convey her political beliefs at that time. \u201cThat tells you so much; how women were proclaiming their beliefs and it carries on with examples like Anya Hindmarch\u2019s I Am Not A Plastic Bag.\u201d Savi is keen that the exhibition embraces bags in all their glory, not just the female handbag. Which is why Churchill\u2019s despatch box is on show, as well as other bags used by men. Baggage began with men, says Savi, and was mainly for the train. \u201cLouis Vuitton started with luxury travel, transferring their leather-making skills from horses to trains and then aeroplanes. Herm\u00e8s started with saddlery and they still use those techniques in their stitching.\u201d Now we\u2019re going full circle. According to Mintel, a quarter of men aged 16-24 buy manbags. But even if the manbag achieves parity, it is difficult to imagine it will be quite as iconic, as rich in metaphor, as its female equivalent. Will the tension between public and private space, that Savi explores, ever apply to men in quite the same way? As Dr Alison Bancroft, fashion theorist and author of Fashion and Psychoanalysis, says: \u201cThe very fact that we have to prefix it with \u2018man\u2019 means it\u2019s not the same. It is something different.\u201d She tells me how a male friend of hers recently asked for a paracetamol and when she told him it was in her handbag, he wouldn\u2019t look inside. \u201cInstead he brought the whole bag to me. The handbag is about a degree of intimacy not everyone feels comfortable with.\u201d A handbag can establish boundaries and respect, but the flip side is less savoury. Bancroft recalls seeing the aftermath of a mugging in her local park and the remnants of an emptied handbag on the path. \u201cThat\u2019s when you see it as a real violation, an act of violence against a person.\u201d I think back to the fleeting, primal panic, when my brain calibrates an absence, a lack of weight in what I\u2019m carrying \u2013 I have left my handbag somewhere. In those moments I feel unmoored, as if I have lost part of myself. As Bancroft says: \u201cHow many times have you heard a woman say, \u2018It is part of me. My life is in there?\u2019\u201d Maybe that is too much power to invest in a single object. Wouldn\u2019t we feel freer relying on pockets, or just carrying less? But then Savi tells me about another highlight in the exhibition \u2013 a beautiful, battered Louis Vuitton trunk from the 1900s that belonged to Emilie Busbey Grigsby, an American socialite. Her trunk was a symbol of freedom, covered in travel labels of the places she, and it, had spent a lifetime visiting. A bag can be whatever you want it to be. It can offer the promise of a sleek, well-ordered better version of yourself, a superior mini-you or, like Emilie, a wonderful souvenir of your travels. As my friend, who never knowingly underpacks, says: \u201cA bag isn\u2019t a burden but rather a ticket to ride.\u201d Bags: Inside Out, sponsored by Mulberry, is at the V&amp;A, 25 April-31 January.

      "body": "<p>The latest Pixar animation, <em>Onward</em> is heartfelt, slickly executed and potently effective as both a rousing adventure and a tear-jerker. But compared to the very best of Pixar\u2019s output, this can\u2019t help but feel like second tier stuff.

We started really well, and threatened on the counter attack. We defended really well, the two goals came from us having possession and that transition Liverpool are so good at. They punished us twice today, but I can\u2019t fault the lads. We\u2019ve made a mistake, but they still had to punish us. That\u2019s the quality they possess. They were ruthless. I don\u2019t think we did a lot wrong in the match. I felt we could score at any time in the game. Losing Steve Cook was a big moment. I don\u2019t want to be positive after games we don\u2019t win, but the last six games for us have been a big improvement. We\u2019ve won two, but our performances have been better, and that encourages us for the last nine games.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e63b1f18f085f0b8d943f97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-07T14:45:10.040Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jurgen Klopp speaks! </strong>\u201cIt was a very good performance after a very difficult start. From my point of view, the first goal was a 100 percent foul. Nothing else. But it shows the problem with VAR as well, because the referee didn\u2019t see it. Mike Dean was next to me, saying have a look, have a look, and VAR said it was not clear and obvious, I don\u2019t know how that is possible. We wanted to fight back before the game, but then we really had to fight back, and put them under pressure. We did a lot of good stuff, played a lot of good football. We had to concentrate 100 percent, and we deserved the three points in the end. [The home record] is nice, it is special, but not normal, and the game today is a good example. We had to fight hard, we are not geniuses, but we can really fight!\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e63b0668f085f0b8d943f93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-07T14:35:54.899Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Liverpool have broken their own long-standing record today. </strong>By winning their 22nd league match at Anfield in a row, they beat the mark set by the legendary Bill Shankly\u2019s team in 1972.

Again today, we weren\u2019t at our best, but many teams would have crumbled after a couple of poor results. But we kept going and stayed calm, and with the boys up front, we always have a chance.

Smiles all round at the oddity. Let\u2019s balance out the fun with some pre-match misery, courtesy of Ian Copestake: \u201cDespite defending Lovren far better than Lovren actually can himself, Juergen has not included him on the bench.

Mind you, this time last week, it felt like the Reds were leading a procession, four wins from their first English championship since 1990. But one no-show against Watford later, plus a KO in the cup, and the mood-o-meter has switched from Party to Pensive. If they fail to beat Bournemouth this lunchtime, it won\u2019t exactly be crisis time ... not yet ... but a few nerve-ends will start to jangle, twitch and yip, you can be darn sure of that.</p> <p><strong>As Liverpool have just found out, a lot can change in a couple of matches. </strong>But then spin it another way: if they see off relegation-haunted Bournemouth today, as they surely should, then pull off a recovery in the Champions League against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, the entire picture will suddenly look a hell of a lot brighter. It doesn\u2019t take much for the dial to shift either way. And what better opponent to shake off the post-break blues against than Bournemouth? Liverpool have won their last five games against Eddie Howe\u2019s side to the aggregate tune of <em>17-0</em>. They quite literally couldn\u2019t Cherry-pick a better fixture in which to bounce back.</p> <p><strong>And yet Bournemouth won\u2019t be without hope. </strong>They haven\u2019t won in three, but came mighty close to beating Chelsea last weekend. They\u2019ve also claimed a couple of big scalps this season: Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Manchester United at home. And they earned a 2-2 draw at Anfield back in April 2017, the same season they turned Klopp\u2019s side over at Dean Court, coming from behind for a famous smash-and-grab 4-3 victory. It\u2019s not totally been a one-sided relationship. Plus the fact Anfield may get a little nervous if things don\u2019t go to plan for the home heroes in the early exchanges.</p> <p><strong>This could be the match that steadies the champions-elect after a brief, uncharacteristic wobble.</strong> Or it could go some way to saving Bournemouth\u2019s Premier League skin, while planting more seeds of doubt in Liverpool\u2019s collective mind, with big away games at Everton and Manchester City coming up. Plenty riding on this, then, and it\u2019s going to be fun finding out how it all comes down. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-06T16:48:40.600Z\">at 4.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Andy Hunter was at Anfield to witness Liverpool fight their way back into form. Here\u2019s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM! Eddie Howe\u2019s verdict. \u201cWe gave it a go. We started really well, and threatened on the counter attack. We defended really well, the two goals came from us having possession and that transition Liverpool are so good at. They punished us twice today, but I can\u2019t fault the lads. We\u2019ve made a mistake, but they still had to punish us. That\u2019s the quality they possess. They were ruthless. I don\u2019t think we did a lot wrong in the match. I felt we could score at any time in the game. Losing Steve Cook was a big moment. I don\u2019t want to be positive after games we don\u2019t win, but the last six games for us have been a big improvement. We\u2019ve won two, but our performances have been better, and that encourages us for the last nine games.\u201d Jurgen Klopp speaks! \u201cIt was a very good performance after a very difficult start. From my point of view, the first goal was a 100 percent foul. Nothing else. But it shows the problem with VAR as well, because the referee didn\u2019t see it. Mike Dean was next to me, saying have a look, have a look, and VAR said it was not clear and obvious, I don\u2019t know how that is possible. We wanted to fight back before the game, but then we really had to fight back, and put them under pressure. We did a lot of good stuff, played a lot of good football. We had to concentrate 100 percent, and we deserved the three points in the end. [The home record] is nice, it is special, but not normal, and the game today is a good example. We had to fight hard, we are not geniuses, but we can really fight!\u201d Liverpool have broken their own long-standing record today. By winning their 22nd league match at Anfield in a row, they beat the mark set by the legendary Bill Shankly\u2019s team in 1972. Third on the list: Manchester City (2011-12) and Newcastle United (1906-07). \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing place to play football,\u201d adds Milner. \u201cThere have been unbelievable teams here over the years, so to be up there with those is special. But we want to keep producing performances, hopefully winning trophies and create history for this club.\u201d James Milner, who made sure of Liverpool\u2019s victory with an outstanding goal-line clearance, speaks to BT Sport. \u201cAny Premier League game is hard to win. It\u2019s a boring thing to say, but it\u2019s true. Especially when you\u2019ve had a couple of performances when we weren\u2019t at our level. Again today, we weren\u2019t at our best, but many teams would have crumbled after a couple of poor results. But we kept going and stayed calm, and with the boys up front, we always have a chance. You can\u2019t question the boys\u2019 heart and desire.\u201d Mohamed Salah adds: \u201cToday we showed our personality, we had to react, we did well. We need to keep going for the next three games, and the rest of the season.\u201d Liverpool are now 25 points clear at the top, though second-placed Manchester City have two games in hand. They just need nine points from their last nine games for their first title in 30 years. Jurgen Klopp punches the air in front of the Kop, a study more of relief than celebration. Liverpool were far from their best today ... though they still scored twice, hit the post, and will feel aggrieved at the nature of Bournemouth\u2019s opener. Not a bad way to under-perform. One down, three to go. Bournemouth remain in the relegation zone. 90 min +4: Mane and Milner take an age over a free kick out on the left. Clock management in full effect. The Kop finally feels brave enough to break into song: \u201cWe\u2019re going to win the league.\u201d 90 min +3: Origi tears off down the left. He\u2019s got Salah in the middle, but can\u2019t force the ball past Stacey, who was tracking back well. Liverpool look like getting over the line, but they\u2019ve made a meal of this. 90 min +2: Wilson is booked for a late clatter on Milner. Then a second change for Liverpool, as Origi replaces Firmino, who is still yet to score at Anfield this season. He\u2019ll not get a better chance than the one he spurned a minute ago. 90 min +1: And up the other end, Bournemouth breathe again! Lallana and Salah combine down the right, teeing up Firmino in the centre. He has to make Ramsdale work at the very least, but leans back and hoicks deep into the Kop. What a finish to this game! 90 min: Milner upends Stacey out on the right, and this is a free kick in a very dangerous position. Milner heads clear, but Cook dinks a pass down the inside left, and Ake is clear! He rolls infield for Wilson, who should poke home, but stands on the ball. Then the flag goes up for offside. What an escape for Liverpool! 89 min: Lewis Cook sprays a pass down the right. Solanke hopes to latch onto it, but Adrian is out quickly to blast into the stand. 88 min: Billing\u2019s back! But he doesn\u2019t look comfortable at all as he trots around the middle of the park in a very ginger fashion. 87 min: Van Dijk lashes a long pass down the left. Mane nearly gets past Stacey, but legs tangle and he goes over. No free kick, and no penalty either, Mane making sure he falls inside the box. Ramsdale gathers, and we play on. 86 min: Billing loiters on the touchline in the hope his injury repairs itself in short order. 85 min: Billing gets up and limps off. It doesn\u2019t look as though he\u2019s able to continue, so Bournemouth will play the rest of the game with ten men. 84 min: Solanke whacks his own man Billing, pressing his knee into the defender\u2019s lower back. Billing looks in some pain. He writhes around, punching the turf in agony. As he receives treatment, Oxlade-Chamberlain makes way for Lallana. 82 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain has a whack from 25 yards. It\u2019s always heading well wide left. 80 min: Lerma is replaced by walking Tic-Tac advertisement Dan Gosling. The former Everton midfielder gets the sort of reception you\u2019d imagine. 78 min: Correction: Ake forces out for another wasted corner. 77 min: Suddenly Gomez slips a pass down the right. Salah cuts into the area and tries to thread another into the bottom right. Ramsdale tips round the post for a corner. Liverpool make a mess of the set piece, but Salah strips a dallying Fraser on the right and feeds Milner, who fires across the face of goal. With Mane and Firmino lurking, Ake forces out for another corner. 76 min: Liverpool stroke it around the middle, but don\u2019t go anywhere in particular. 74 min: Mane latches onto a loose ball, 25 yards out on the left. He hits it first time, curling the ball towards the top right. It\u2019s beaten Ramsdale all ends up ... but the ball crashes off the post and away. That would have been an absolute pearler. What an effort! 72 min: Firmino has been quiet, but suddenly he sparks into life, dinking the ball down the inside right for Salah. The ball breaks back to him, and he flashes a fierce cross-cum-shot through the six-yard box. Mane, at the far post, can\u2019t react in time to prod home. To be fair, the ball was travelling some, and it would have been a hell of a finish if he\u2019d managed to connect. 70 min: Bournemouth are causing Liverpool some problems, though. Fraser tries to get on the end of a left-wing cross, but can\u2019t keep the ball in play. A taller player might have asked a question there. The crowd groan in anxious fashion. 69 min: Salah tries to bring down a high ball with his shoulder, and uses his arm instead. A free kick out on the right. It\u2019s floated in. There are five Bournemouth players offside, but the flag doesn\u2019t go up. Ake and Solanke bustle around and force a corner. Liverpool are furious ... but finally the flag goes up. What a nonsense. 68 min: Stanislas is replaced by former Liverpool striker Dominic Solanke, who receives a warm round of applause as he reacquaints himself with his old stomping ground. 66 min: This one\u2019s better. Alexander-Arnold takes from the right. He fires long, and at the far post Van Dijk rises to bomb a header towards the bottom left. Ramsdale claims it well, though. 65 min: There used to be a Liverpool fanzine called Another Wasted Corner. Well, that. 63 min: A free kick for Liverpool out on the left. Milner floats it in. Van Dijk goes up, but Ramsdale is able to punch clear. \u201cI\u2019m sure I speak for my fellow LFC supporters when I say I\u2019m not enjoying our early 2010s tribute act this afternoon. Squeaky bum time indeed,\u201d writes Sir Alex Ferguson tribute act Tony Barr. 62 min: Liverpool are not playing well. Stanislas crosses from the left. Ake is preparing to crash a header goalwards, but Adrian does just enough to punch clear. Diego Simeone will be watching this game with his feet up and a cigar on. 61 min: A long pass down the middle. Fraser beats the Liverpool back line, and reaches the ball ahead of the out-rushing Adrian. He loops over the keeper. The ball\u2019s heading into the net ... but Milner brilliantly races back and acrobatically hooks off the line and away! What a clearance! Bournemouth so close to hauling themselves level. 59 min: Salah sashays in from the right and dinks the ball into the Bournemouth box to ... nobody. Ramsdale claims with a yawn. The crowd burst into song, in an attempt to light a fire under their team. 58 min: Van Dijk, usually so poised in distribution, wallops a long ball straight out for a goal kick, miles from any red shirt. The tension at Anfield is palpable. Next goal wins? 56 min: Some nervy head tennis in the midfield. Both teams aware this is still very much up for grabs. 54 min: Liverpool are beginning to stutter. Anfield is very still as a result. You can understand the tension. So close, after 30 years. Wins, so easy to come by for so long, suddenly don\u2019t look quite so simple. 52 min: Stanislas sends a weak shot wide left of goal. A poor end to a promising move that saw Fraser momentarily get clear down the inside right, only to hesitate and see an effort easily blocked. Further proof, though, that Bournemouth don\u2019t intend to lie down and accept the inevitable. 50 min: Stanislas knocks long down the right. Wilson nearly nudges Van Dijk, of all people, off the ball. Van Dijk\u2019s not having it, and barges back to win and clear, but the Bournemouth striker is clearly in the mood to take the game to Liverpool\u2019s centre backs. 49 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain has a dig from 25 yards. The ball cannons off Ake and away from danger. The hosts are on the front foot in the early stages of the second half. 47 min: The corner drops to Wijnaldum, who executes a perfect fresh-air swipe. The ball\u2019s knocked back into the box. Mane tries to flick the ball around Simpson, but it clips the defender\u2019s hand. Liverpool claim for a penalty, but they\u2019re not getting it. The correct decision: Simpson\u2019s arm was down by his side, and the two players were standing right next to each other. 46 min: Gomez slips a pass down the right for Oxlade-Chamberlain, who wins a corner off Ake. Alexander-Arnold to take. Liverpool get the second half underway. They\u2019re kicking towards the Kop. Half-time entertainment: Meanwhile, across the city ... Another good 45 minutes for Jordan Henderson. 45 min +3: Gomez tries to release Salah down the right. Blooter! Overhit! Out of play. Goal kick. 45 min +2: Fraser works hard down the left to win a corner off Alexander-Arnold. Stanislas takes. Milner slaps it clear. Both teams are pushing for a goal that would significantly change the picture at half-time. 45 min +1: The first of four added minutes. Stacey nearly gifts Mane possession in the Bournemouth box, but just about gets away with it. 45 min: Smith barges Salah off the ball down the left, and slips a pass upfield for Wilson. Adrian races out of his area to punt clear, just in time. On the touchline, Klopp is ranting and raving. You\u2019d pay cash money to be a fly on the wall in the Liverpool dressing room during the break. 43 min: Fraser dinks a ball down the left to release Stanislas. Milner does well to track his run, ensuring he can\u2019t slip Wilson in down the middle. Stanislas lays off to Fraser, who dinks into the box for Billing, but Gomez is on hand to clear. Bournemouth are still carrying a threat. Liverpool don\u2019t look secure at the back at all. Lots of space. 41 min: Mane is penalised for being kicked by Lerma. The referee is currently doing a splendid job of riling up both sets of players. 39 min: Stanislas makes good down the inside left and pearls a shot towards the bottom left. Adrian parries, although not in a particularly confident style. The ball spins out for a corner, which Adrian clears with a much more definitive punch. Liverpool attempt to break upfield, but make a Horlicks of the three-on-two. 38 min: More ill feeling, as Gomez nudges Smith off the field and into the advertising hoardings. Smith whacks his noggin. He\u2019s up soon enough, rubbing his head and moaning at the referee. Speaking of Gomez ... \u201cIf Gomez goes down from the initial push the ref would probably blow for a foul before it got any further,\u201d argues Dan C. \u201cMaybe not a \u2018clear and obvious error\u2019 for VAR to overturn, but it doesn\u2019t encourage honesty either. Which would we rather see?\u201d 37 min: Salah, dropping deep on the right, rakes a diagonal looper towards Milner, coming in from the left. Milner connects, but volleys softly into the arms of Ramsdale. Bournemouth are holding on a bit. 35 min: Mane loses the flight of a long ball and sticks up an arm as it sails towards the stand. He\u2019s still in play, though. Lerma and Fraser want him booked, and tell the referee so. The referee isn\u2019t minded to flourish a yellow. The crowd aren\u2019t too happy with Bournemouth\u2019s demands. There\u2019s a bit of an edge to this now, for one reason and another. 34 min: Klopp celebrated that goal with a wild scream, and a pointed holler in the ear of the linesman, who happened to be passing. He\u2019s clearly still livid about that opening goal. Van Dijk intercepts as Bournemouth consider a quick break. He rolls a straight ball down the middle for Mane, who is in acres. Mane advances towards the box, draws Ramsdale, and slips the ball past the keeper and into the bottom right. Easy as that. 31 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain has a dig from 25 yards. It pinballs around the Bournemouth box before the visitors clear. Liverpool are beginning to dominate. 29 min: Another corner for Liverpool ... but this one is whizzed straight out of play by Alexander-Arnold. Bournemouth are getting pushed back again, their early verve suddenly lost. 28 min: This is much better from Simpson! Van Dijk floats a left-to-right diagonal for Alexander-Arnold, who fires across the face of goal. Mane is waiting to tap in, but Simpson somehow hooks behind for a corner, from which nothing occurs. That makes up for his earlier error ... a bit. 27 min: Salah dug Mane out of a hole there. That move looked like falling apart, a superb chance about to be squandered, but Salah ensured it would count with a magnificent finish from the edge of the box. Mane will get an assist for that, but really. Anfield is making some noise now! Mane robs Simpson, who was ambling out from the back, yet to get up to speed. Liverpool are two on one! Mane thinks about shooting, but rolls the ball to Salah on his right. It\u2019s a dreadful pass, behind the man, but Salah checks, shifts inside, and threads a shot into the bottom right. 23 min: You could hear a pin drop at the minute. In the dugout, Klopp tries to whip up his charges. It\u2019s all extremely flat. Penny for Pep Guardiola\u2019s thoughts at the moment. 21 min: Liverpool win their first corner. Alexander-Arnold takes it from the right. Play is stopped as Wijnaldum takes an accidental whack from Ake\u2019s flailing arm. Anfield wants a penalty, but there was no intent. Mind you, elsewhere, Lerma shoved Fabinho to the floor, so perhaps everyone was claiming for that. Either way, Liverpool are getting nowt, and the hosts look extremely agitated. 19 min: Simpson comes on for the Bournemouth captain Steve Cook. \u201cI assume we can stop talking about VAR favouring Liverpool now, right?\u201d asks Oliver Loksa. BT Sport refereeing guru Peter Walton certainly thinks it should have been a foul, as the \u201cclear and obvious\u201d bar is lowered significantly for an \u201cupper body foul\u201d. And he usually just parrots the official line, so make of that what you will. 17 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain plays a cute ball down the inside-right channel. Steve Cook stretches but can\u2019t intercept. Firmino has space to shoot, but his effort is parried by Ramsdale. Bournemouth clear ... but it looks like Cook has done his hamstring. 16 min: Lewis Cook plays a ball down the inside-left channel for Wilson, who beats the offside trap and zips upfield. Liverpool are again short at the back, and lucky that Wilson\u2019s pass forward for Stanislas is too strong. Adrian claims. 14 min: Milner is forced to concede a corner out on the right. Fraser takes. Ake pearls a glorious header goalwards. Liverpool are fortunate that it\u2019s straight at Adrian, who can tip over the bar. The second corner comes to nothing, but you can be sure most of the punters inside Anfield are currently thinking about Devon Loch. 13 min: Let\u2019s see if James Milner\u2019s pre-match team-talk had any effect. There\u2019s no immediate sign, as Fraser crosses from the right. The ball only just flies over the head of Stanislas in the middle. 11 min: Liverpool have only themselves to blame for that one. Wilson did shove Gomez in the back, and off the ball, but everyone in red then stopped. Bournemouth played to the whistle, and VAR official Michael Oliver saw nothing wrong with Wilson\u2019s challenge. Anfield falls silent, bar a few boos, and a cheer in the away end. On the touchline, Klopp throws his hands around, urging the crowd to get going. Billing takes up possession, feeding Lerma down the right. He rolls the ball across the face of goal for Wilson, who taps home. VAR checks, decides there\u2019s no shove on Gomez, and Liverpool are trailing again! 8 min: Wilson barges Gomez out of the way as the pair chase a long ball. It looks like a foul, but ... 6 min: Bournemouth are sitting deep. Liverpool hogging possession. It already looks like being one of those games. Can the title hopefuls break through? Can the relegation strugglers hold out? Alexander-Arnold crosses for Salah. Steve Cook heads behind for a corner, but the flag goes up, correctly, for offside. 4 min: It\u2019s a lovely late-winter, early-spring day at Anfield. Not much in the way of breeze. Liverpool stroke it around the back in a similarly mild style. Then suddenly there\u2019s a little space for Alexander-Arnold down the right, but his cross is easily hoicked clear by Ake. 2 min: Otherwise, it\u2019s a slow start, and Anfield has quickly fallen silent. Expect this to be a tense affair, unless Liverpool score early. 40 secs: A mazy dribble by Oxlade-Chamberlain down the right. The ball\u2019s slipped inside for Van Dijk, who lumps forward and nearly releases Salah down the right. Ramsdale is out quickly to claim. An early statement of intent from the hosts. Bournemouth get the ball rolling. They\u2019ll be kicking towards the Kop in this first half. The teams are out! Liverpool are four wins from the title, and the atmosphere at Anfield is accordingly hot. A huge roar as the players take to the field of play. Much amusement as the players meet, the hosts trooping along the line offering no handshakes, as per the coronavirus edict. Smiles all round at the oddity. Let\u2019s balance out the fun with some pre-match misery, courtesy of Ian Copestake: \u201cDespite defending Lovren far better than Lovren actually can himself, Juergen has not included him on the bench. Kudos to the Croatian for self-isolating. I am going to say this out loud, but I think this will not be a win for Liverpool. I\u2019m no psychologist but until they get the game with Madrid-lite done and won then and only then will the burden they seem to be playing under will be lifted.\u201d BT Sport have been lugging into Liverpool stand-in captain James Milner\u2019s pre-match pep talk. Here\u2019s what he told the rest of the team as they were warming up. \u201cThose reactions, straight away, as soon as we lose it, bodies round it, then we play all that area, eh? Doesn\u2019t matter who scores, we score, they score, we lift it again. Every kick-off is a trigger for us.\u201d Well that\u2019s fate tempted. Goalless draw ahoy! Jurgen\u2019s version. \u201cThe results in the last four games were not exactly how we wanted them to be. So we have the chance to change the situation. Bournemouth have to fight for the league, so we have to fight, make it as difficult as possible, and get a result. In football you always have to find a solution.\u201d Is Robertson rested or injured, BT Sport\u2019s Des Kelly asks. A long pause, before a considered response. \u201cSomething in between?! He would have started today but he felt slightly bad, so he will be good, fine for Wednesday, but not today.\u201d Cherries boss Eddie Howe throws down the gauntlet. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate test and that\u2019s how we have to look at this game and approach it. It\u2019s a great opportunity to show how good we are. You learn from every opponent\u2019s gameplan and see if there\u2019s anything that can help your team, but we are us. We are our unique team with the strengths that we possess, and I think we can cause them problems. We have to believe we can get a positive result today. Being in the bottom three should focus our energies in a positive way. We know we have to do something. The onus is on us.\u201d BREAKING NEWS: Liverpool will be playing in red ... ... while Bournemouth will sport robustly couriered second-choice blue. Liverpool make three changes to the team that went down so spectacularly at Watford last week. Adrian in for Alisson; Joe Gomez for Dejan Lovren; James Milner for Andy Robertson. Bournemouth make one change from last weekend\u2019s draw with Chelsea. Junior Stanislas replaces the injured Josh King. Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Milner, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Mane, Firmino, Salah. Subs: Keita, Minamino, Lallana, Lonergan, Origi, Matip, Williams. Bournemouth: Ramsdale, Stacey, Steve Cook, Ake, Smith, Billing, Lerma, Lewis Cook, Stanislas, Callum Wilson, Fraser. Subs: Boruc, Gosling, Surman, Solanke, Rico, Simpson, Surridge. Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire). Winning the league isn\u2019t meant to be easy. Liverpool supporters are all too aware of this, into the 30th year of the search for their holy grail. Mind you, this time last week, it felt like the Reds were leading a procession, four wins from their first English championship since 1990. But one no-show against Watford later, plus a KO in the cup, and the mood-o-meter has switched from Party to Pensive. If they fail to beat Bournemouth this lunchtime, it won\u2019t exactly be crisis time ... not yet ... but a few nerve-ends will start to jangle, twitch and yip, you can be darn sure of that. As Liverpool have just found out, a lot can change in a couple of matches. But then spin it another way: if they see off relegation-haunted Bournemouth today, as they surely should, then pull off a recovery in the Champions League against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, the entire picture will suddenly look a hell of a lot brighter. It doesn\u2019t take much for the dial to shift either way. And what better opponent to shake off the post-break blues against than Bournemouth? Liverpool have won their last five games against Eddie Howe\u2019s side to the aggregate tune of 17-0. They quite literally couldn\u2019t Cherry-pick a better fixture in which to bounce back. And yet Bournemouth won\u2019t be without hope. They haven\u2019t won in three, but came mighty close to beating Chelsea last weekend. They\u2019ve also claimed a couple of big scalps this season: Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Manchester United at home. And they earned a 2-2 draw at Anfield back in April 2017, the same season they turned Klopp\u2019s side over at Dean Court, coming from behind for a famous smash-and-grab 4-3 victory. It\u2019s not totally been a one-sided relationship. Plus the fact Anfield may get a little nervous if things don\u2019t go to plan for the home heroes in the early exchanges. This could be the match that steadies the champions-elect after a brief, uncharacteristic wobble. Or it could go some way to saving Bournemouth\u2019s Premier League skin, while planting more seeds of doubt in Liverpool\u2019s collective mind, with big away games at Everton and Manchester City coming up. Plenty riding on this, then, and it\u2019s going to be fun finding out how it all comes down. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

Liverpool needed cool heads to get over the line rather than polished feet and Milner and Virgil van Dijk delivered with outstanding second-half displays.

Then, from their first attack of note, the visitors were ahead. There was uproar around Anfield as Wilson escaped with a shove on Joe Gomez in the build-up.

      "bodyText": "Anger shaped J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s reaction to Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s winning goal against Bournemouth. Joy, laced with relief, fuelled the return of his trademark celebration after Liverpool put the one bad week in their phenomenal season behind them. Three punches in front of the Kop: one for each victory Liverpool require to guarantee their first league championship for 30 years. Mohamed Salah marked his 100th Premier League appearance for the Anfield club with his 70th league goal before Man\u00e9 brought Liverpool a new English top-flight record of 22 consecutive home league wins. Those are just the headline figures. This was a dogged fight back to winning ways after three defeats in four matches, one that began with conceding a controversial early goal to Callum Wilson, involved a spectacular goal-line clearance from James Milner and ended with a let-off from Nathan Ak\u00e9 in the 90th minute. Liverpool needed cool heads to get over the line rather than polished feet and Milner and Virgil van Dijk delivered with outstanding second-half displays. They were also indebted to cheap Bournemouth errors for the goals that restored invaluable confidence before Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s visit in the Champions League on Wednesday. \u201cI am happy about the result, the three points and the performance,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cI knew it would be tricky. The decision of the referee around the goals made it more tricky. We wanted to fight back and after that we really had to fight back.\u201d Eddie Howe\u2019s relegation-threatened team were under siege from the start as Liverpool sought to repair their recent blip. Then, from their first attack of note, the visitors were ahead. There was uproar around Anfield as Wilson escaped with a shove on Joe Gomez in the build-up. It was accompanied by the sound of 50,000-plus bums squeaking. Wilson clearly knocked Gomez off balance as they pursued a clearance into the Liverpool half. The ease with which the Liverpool defender was knocked off his stride was also apparent, so too the hosts\u2019 failure to play to the whistle as Wilson found Philip Billing, who released Jefferson Lerma for a low cross turned in by the striker.

      "body": "<p>A woman cannot be elected president. If that statement was not true when Elizabeth Warren announced her intent to run, on New Years Eve 2018, it has become true now. With her exit from the race, the last serious female presidential candidate has now dropped out, and what was once a historically diverse field has narrowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/04/super-tuesday-key-takeaways-democrats-biden-bernie-sanders-warren\">two very old white men</a>, the former vice-president Joe Biden, 77, and the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, 78. The next president, it is now assured, will be a man. Again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/elizabeth-warren-drop-out-bernie\">I'm sad to see Elizabeth Warren drop out. Now she has a choice to make | Derecka Purnell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bruising contest has left the party divided and rancorous, with the result being that no matter who the Democratic nominee is, he will face not only the formidable resources of a moneyed Republican opposition, but also intense internal enmity within his own party. The internal factionalism and wild hatred within the Democratic party makes either candidate, be it Biden or Sanders, much more likely to lose in November. And the advanced ages of both of the two remaining major candidates means that even if one of them wins the presidency in November, it remains a real question whether they can feasibly run for a second term. And so, win or lose, the long, contentious and often hateful Democratic primary cycle will be repeated in four years for the 2024 cycle, further fracturing and handicapping the party, no matter what.</p> <p>All of this could have been avoided if the media and the electorate were less blinded by cynicism, sexism and fear and more willing to see Warren for who she was \u2013 the most capable, competent and kindest candidate in the race.</p> <p>As a woman, the Massachusetts senator always faced an uphill battle of double standards and misogynist resentment. She had to be competent but not condescending, cheery but not pandering, maternal but not frumpy, smart but not haughty. As she rose in the polls last summer and fall, she came under the kind of scrutiny that male frontrunners are not subjected to, and faced skepticism about her claims and character that male candidates do not face.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As she rose in the polls last summer and fall, she came under the kind of scrutiny that male frontrunners are not subjected to</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is the fate of a lot of women who come close to attaining power, and empirical data backs up the phenomenon: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/warren-succeeded-because-voters-saw-her-as-caring-thats-also-why-she-failed/2020/03/06/8064b7c2-5f0f-11ea-b014-4fafa866bb81_story.html\">writing in the Washington Post</a>, the Cornell philosopher Kate Manne cited a 2010 Harvard study that found that women are viewed more negatively simply by seeking office. \u201cVoters view male and female politicians as equally power-seeking, but respond to them quite differently,\u201d Manne writes. \u201cMen who seek power were viewed as stronger and tougher, while power-seeking women provoked feelings of disgust and contempt.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, all of Warren\u2019s virtues were recast as vices in the public eye. Her impressive credentials and superlative intellect became out-of-touch elitism. Her joyousness and enthusiasm were cast as somehow both insincerely pandering and cringingly over-earnest. This kind of transformation of neutral or positive character traits into negative ones is not something that happens to men in similar positions. Sanders can aestheticize his practiced cantankerousness for laughs and sympathy without anyone asking if its a put-on. Biden can use slang from the 1930s without anyone ever questioning whether the ostentatious folksiness of his \u201cno malarkey\u201d messaging might be just a tad affected. But for Warren, every smile was interpreted as a sign of concealed hatred, of secret, nefarious motives.</p> <p>Her policy efforts, too, were cast as a repudiation of her principles rather than as steps toward realizing them. Her attempt to transform Medicare for All from a symbolic rallying cry into a substantive, workable and affordable policy change that can be made in our time brought, paradoxically, accusations that she was <em>less </em>serious about the policy for trying to make it a reality. Her plans to break up tech monopolies, repair the damage to black wealth done by historic redlining policies and reshape massive federal spending projects to make them environmentally sustainable were all cast as signs of duplicity and lack of commitment to her stated values. Meanwhile, male candidates who did not have substantive plans to implement such policies were believed, largely uncritically, when they told the public that they would put them in place.</p> <p>In this race, men\u2019s statements \u2013 about who they are, what they value, what they would do as president \u2013 have largely been taken at face value, even when <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51648166\">male candidates have made false or exaggerated claims</a> or contradicted themselves. But Elizabeth Warren was never given the benefit of the doubt. Her flaws and missteps were magnified, and interpreted in ways disproportionate to their significance, while comparatively greater mistakes by male rivals were all but ignored. When she referred to her father as having worked as a janitor, a days\u2013long news cycle asked why, if he was really a janitor, her brother had once referred to him as a \u201cmaintenance man\u201d. That these are effectively the same did not matter: the irrelevant non-story was interpreted as a sign of her constitutional untrustworthiness.</p> <p>Warren was said to be not really running for president, but running as a spoiler; not really happy to meet voters, but shamelessly pretending with her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/08/elizabeth-warren-2020-campaign-selfies-town-halls\">long selfie lines</a>; not really committed to economic inequality, but merely devoting her life to it as some sort of long con. None of these accusations made much logical sense, but that didn\u2019t matter, because they were backed up by the force of feeling \u2013 a very strong feeling, held by many men and women alike, that a woman seeking power and status just can\u2019t be trusted.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119420828.ch10\">epistemic philosopher Miranda Fricker</a> calls this tendency to disbelieve women, and to believe powerful men, \u201ctestimonial injustice\u201d: the harm done to speakers when prejudiced listeners discount their credibility. Women face testimonial injustice in particular when they challenge or contradict men, as cultural tropes that depict women as conniving, scheming, and selfish can be mustered to make her seem less credible, him more believable. Fricker doesn\u2019t apply her concept of testimonial injustice to gender conflict exclusively, but it is an obstacle that many women recount in their own experiences of gendered injustice: the sense that they cannot be believed, that they cannot achieve equal credibility and moral footing with men in the minds of their peers, that they will always be assumed to be either stupid or dishonest. Branded as dishonest even as she told the truth, duplicitous even as she kept her promises, Warren faced testimonial injustice on a huge scale, and it ultimately doomed her campaign.</p> <p>Which brings us to the real moment, I think, that effectively killed Warren\u2019s chances at the presidency: not the botched communications rollout of her Medicare for All plan, as many pundits have said, but her conflict with Sanders. In January, CNN reported that Warren and Sanders had met privately in late 2018 before announcing their candidacies, and that Warren had told close associates afterwards that Sanders had said something rude, inconsiderate and sexist to her: that he did not think a woman could defeat Donald Trump. Sanders says that\u2019s not what he meant, but the two candidates\u2019 accounts of the conversation are not incompatible. When Warren confirmed the report, the story both pointed to the troublesome misogyny of Sanders supporters and incited it: they began a gruesome, hateful and organized attack against Warren and her supporters. They called her a liar. They called her a snake, and made excessive use of the snake emoji. The online conversation veered from the typical competitive snarkiness into something darker and more hateful. Many of the things Sanders supporters said in response to this incident were deeply sexist and deeply cruel. A few of the things they said were threatening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/05/read-elizabeth-warren-full-statement-quitting-2020-race\">'We will persist': read Elizabeth Warren's full statement on quitting the 2020 race</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the aftermath, it became difficult, if not impossible, to say that you believed Warren about the conversation: any public statement of support for her or belief in her account was met with fierce harassment. Perhaps this is why few of them were made. The public consensus quickly became that she was lying about the conversation with Sanders, and that he was not lying.<strong> </strong>It is plausible, to me, to think that a white man in his late 70s, comfortable in his privilege and out of touch with his time, said something condescending and sexist to a woman in private.

      "bodyText": "A woman cannot be elected president. If that statement was not true when Elizabeth Warren announced her intent to run, on New Years Eve 2018, it has become true now. With her exit from the race, the last serious female presidential candidate has now dropped out, and what was once a historically diverse field has narrowed to two very old white men, the former vice-president Joe Biden, 77, and the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, 78. The next president, it is now assured, will be a man. Again. The bruising contest has left the party divided and rancorous, with the result being that no matter who the Democratic nominee is, he will face not only the formidable resources of a moneyed Republican opposition, but also intense internal enmity within his own party. The internal factionalism and wild hatred within the Democratic party makes either candidate, be it Biden or Sanders, much more likely to lose in November. And the advanced ages of both of the two remaining major candidates means that even if one of them wins the presidency in November, it remains a real question whether they can feasibly run for a second term. And so, win or lose, the long, contentious and often hateful Democratic primary cycle will be repeated in four years for the 2024 cycle, further fracturing and handicapping the party, no matter what. All of this could have been avoided if the media and the electorate were less blinded by cynicism, sexism and fear and more willing to see Warren for who she was \u2013 the most capable, competent and kindest candidate in the race. As a woman, the Massachusetts senator always faced an uphill battle of double standards and misogynist resentment. She had to be competent but not condescending, cheery but not pandering, maternal but not frumpy, smart but not haughty. As she rose in the polls last summer and fall, she came under the kind of scrutiny that male frontrunners are not subjected to, and faced skepticism about her claims and character that male candidates do not face. This is the fate of a lot of women who come close to attaining power, and empirical data backs up the phenomenon: writing in the Washington Post, the Cornell philosopher Kate Manne cited a 2010 Harvard study that found that women are viewed more negatively simply by seeking office. \u201cVoters view male and female politicians as equally power-seeking, but respond to them quite differently,\u201d Manne writes. \u201cMen who seek power were viewed as stronger and tougher, while power-seeking women provoked feelings of disgust and contempt.\u201d As a result, all of Warren\u2019s virtues were recast as vices in the public eye. Her impressive credentials and superlative intellect became out-of-touch elitism. Her joyousness and enthusiasm were cast as somehow both insincerely pandering and cringingly over-earnest. This kind of transformation of neutral or positive character traits into negative ones is not something that happens to men in similar positions. Sanders can aestheticize his practiced cantankerousness for laughs and sympathy without anyone asking if its a put-on. Biden can use slang from the 1930s without anyone ever questioning whether the ostentatious folksiness of his \u201cno malarkey\u201d messaging might be just a tad affected. But for Warren, every smile was interpreted as a sign of concealed hatred, of secret, nefarious motives. Her policy efforts, too, were cast as a repudiation of her principles rather than as steps toward realizing them. Her attempt to transform Medicare for All from a symbolic rallying cry into a substantive, workable and affordable policy change that can be made in our time brought, paradoxically, accusations that she was less serious about the policy for trying to make it a reality. Her plans to break up tech monopolies, repair the damage to black wealth done by historic redlining policies and reshape massive federal spending projects to make them environmentally sustainable were all cast as signs of duplicity and lack of commitment to her stated values. Meanwhile, male candidates who did not have substantive plans to implement such policies were believed, largely uncritically, when they told the public that they would put them in place. In this race, men\u2019s statements \u2013 about who they are, what they value, what they would do as president \u2013 have largely been taken at face value, even when male candidates have made false or exaggerated claims or contradicted themselves. But Elizabeth Warren was never given the benefit of the doubt. Her flaws and missteps were magnified, and interpreted in ways disproportionate to their significance, while comparatively greater mistakes by male rivals were all but ignored. When she referred to her father as having worked as a janitor, a days\u2013long news cycle asked why, if he was really a janitor, her brother had once referred to him as a \u201cmaintenance man\u201d. That these are effectively the same did not matter: the irrelevant non-story was interpreted as a sign of her constitutional untrustworthiness. Warren was said to be not really running for president, but running as a spoiler; not really happy to meet voters, but shamelessly pretending with her long selfie lines; not really committed to economic inequality, but merely devoting her life to it as some sort of long con. None of these accusations made much logical sense, but that didn\u2019t matter, because they were backed up by the force of feeling \u2013 a very strong feeling, held by many men and women alike, that a woman seeking power and status just can\u2019t be trusted. The epistemic philosopher Miranda Fricker calls this tendency to disbelieve women, and to believe powerful men, \u201ctestimonial injustice\u201d: the harm done to speakers when prejudiced listeners discount their credibility. Women face testimonial injustice in particular when they challenge or contradict men, as cultural tropes that depict women as conniving, scheming, and selfish can be mustered to make her seem less credible, him more believable. Fricker doesn\u2019t apply her concept of testimonial injustice to gender conflict exclusively, but it is an obstacle that many women recount in their own experiences of gendered injustice: the sense that they cannot be believed, that they cannot achieve equal credibility and moral footing with men in the minds of their peers, that they will always be assumed to be either stupid or dishonest. Branded as dishonest even as she told the truth, duplicitous even as she kept her promises, Warren faced testimonial injustice on a huge scale, and it ultimately doomed her campaign. Which brings us to the real moment, I think, that effectively killed Warren\u2019s chances at the presidency: not the botched communications rollout of her Medicare for All plan, as many pundits have said, but her conflict with Sanders. In January, CNN reported that Warren and Sanders had met privately in late 2018 before announcing their candidacies, and that Warren had told close associates afterwards that Sanders had said something rude, inconsiderate and sexist to her: that he did not think a woman could defeat Donald Trump. Sanders says that\u2019s not what he meant, but the two candidates\u2019 accounts of the conversation are not incompatible. When Warren confirmed the report, the story both pointed to the troublesome misogyny of Sanders supporters and incited it: they began a gruesome, hateful and organized attack against Warren and her supporters. They called her a liar. They called her a snake, and made excessive use of the snake emoji. The online conversation veered from the typical competitive snarkiness into something darker and more hateful. Many of the things Sanders supporters said in response to this incident were deeply sexist and deeply cruel. A few of the things they said were threatening. In the aftermath, it became difficult, if not impossible, to say that you believed Warren about the conversation: any public statement of support for her or belief in her account was met with fierce harassment. Perhaps this is why few of them were made. The public consensus quickly became that she was lying about the conversation with Sanders, and that he was not lying. It is plausible, to me, to think that a white man in his late 70s, comfortable in his privilege and out of touch with his time, said something condescending and sexist to a woman in private. I find Warren\u2019s account more plausible than the alternative offered by Sanders\u2019 supporters, that a woman invented the story and leaked it to hurt an innocent man. But to those that make it, the feasibility of the accusation is not important. What is important, again, is that the accusation is backed up by feeling, the feeling that Warren owes something to this man, that she betrayed him, that she can\u2019t be trusted. Many people believed Warren was lying when she said that Sanders told her a woman couldn\u2019t be president, and in politics, what gets believed is effectively indistinguishable from the truth, whether or not it has any bearing on fact. Maybe this is why powerful men, given so much credibility and so much benefit of the doubt, seem to have a strange power of pronouncement. They declare that a woman is deceitful and people stop trusting her; they declare that a woman is unelectable and people stop imagining the country she would shape; they say, even allegedly, even third-hand, that a woman can\u2019t beat Trump, and people nod along, believing. And then they vote for a man. Warren events became famous for the selfie lines, the sometimes hours-long rally-after-the-rally in which waiting voters and supporters could chat with campaign reps about the candidate, talk to one another about the issues they cared about and ultimately get a picture with Warren herself.

The message to the children was that women can do anything, that when they grow up their talents won\u2019t be ignored, their intelligence won\u2019t be mocked, their horizons won\u2019t be narrowed because of their sex. But if anything, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s candidacy proved that this is not true.

      "body": "<p>Marsden is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/02/simon-armitage-made-in-mardsen\" title=\"\">the last village in the Colne Valley</a> as it climbs westward from the former textile town of Huddersfield into the West Yorkshire Pennines. My parents lived in a terrace house on the south-facing side (an end terrace, in fact, which we could claim as \u201csemi-detached\u201d in more aspirant moments), up a steep, narrow road that was rumoured to be Roman in origin and still carries the contours of stone steps in the middle of the carriageway, beneath several layers of asphalt. My bedroom, made from a partitioned section of my parents\u2019 bedroom, looked straight down into the bowl of the village, the house occupying an enviable grandstand location for such a modest property.</p> <p>The only other terrace or \u201cblock\u201d with the same aspect consisted of 20 houses and was known colloquially as Titanic Row, either because of its impressive length, or because it was built in 1912, or because it was sinking slowly into the clay foundations. I watched a lot of TV as a kid and didn\u2019t read much other than comics, so I associate my first poetic experiences with the view from that bedroom window, especially the view at night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/07/simon-armitage-poet-laureate-ted-hughes-came-from-the-next-valley\" title=\"\">dreaming with my eyes wide open</a> when I should have been asleep. I\u2019d watch the streetlamps blink into action, the shutters and blinds go down in the shops at the top of Fall Lane, and headlamps illuminate distant lanes and gable ends. I\u2019d watch people whose shapes and outlines I recognised going into the New Inn or coming out of the Old New Inn, and curtains being drawn in the houses of neighbours and family friends.</p> <p>I\u2019d see strangers, on foot or in unfamiliar vehicles, and I\u2019d imagine incidents taking place behind closed doors, though none of this was ever written down at the time. It became a kind of compulsion, or at least a routine, thinking about the invisible goings-on, all the standoffs and stalemates, the affairs and fisticuffs, the shenanigans and shady deals. Thinking also about the mundane and the commonplace, of people performing in the scenes and sketches of their regular lives, reinforcing my understanding of how the world worked and indulging a fascination with everyday domestic detail. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d621140177b2c74eb0a5e52b84fe11a6fa6f4309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d621140177b2c74eb0a5e52b84fe11a6fa6f4309/0_0_3744_4679/800.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Armitage.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Armitage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coming back to the village after three years at Portsmouth Polytechnic, with no job and in no hurry to get one, I started looking out of that window again, and out of the large picture window in the living room with its wide-angle view of Marsden \u2013 and I was ready to write. By that time I was a geography graduate with a head full of theories about people and places. So the village became the drawing board or board game on which I could practise my poetics and play out my perspectives. The frame of the window might have operated as a limiting device, restricting my perception of the wider world, but it was an invaluable template for bringing focus to the poems and legitimising the use of local subjects and vernacular in a poetic context.</p> <p>So the post office got the treatment, as did the fire station, and the petrol station, and the snow-warning light on the main road. Even the house itself became a kind of \u201ccathedral of the ordinary\u201d in that era of few material goods where possessions were somehow part of a ritualistic fabric of life and household events had a near-sacramental pattern and process. My dad\u2019s cars, incomprehensibly expensive at the time, acquired the status of close relatives or large exotic pets, not just means of transportation but characters with names, personalities, idiosyncrasies and smells. Even though I\u2019m pretty sure I never took a bite out of it I can still \u201ctaste\u201d the cracked red leather seats in the back of the Hillman Minx and picture the lettering on the registration plate: BAP 69P.</p> <p>If all that goes some way towards explaining why I wrote so much about Marsden in my first collection, <em>Zoom! </em>(1989), and my second collection <em>Kid</em> (1992), while I was still living there, it doesn\u2019t really explain why<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/07/paper-aeroplane-selected-poems-1989-2014-simon-armitage-review\" title=\"\"> I\u2019ve continued to address it</a> \u2013 on and off \u2013 for another three decades. True, I only live a couple of valleys away, but in these parts that\u2019s the equivalent of self-imposed exile. Yet distance seems to necessitate the occasional recalibration or rebalancing of the scales, as if I\u2019m using the village as a standard of poetic measurement, or as a measurement of poetic standard. In 2015 I published<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/11/simon-armitage-the-unnacompanied-poetry-book-of-the-month-review\" title=\"\"> <em>The Unaccompanied</em>, a collection </a>that had accumulated slowly since around 2008, the year of the financial crash. Until I started to work out an order for the manuscript, I hadn\u2019t realised how much I\u2019d been writing about Marsden again, this time charting the effects of the recession, and the austerity that followed, and a growing sense of marginalisation in what was supposed to be an age of increased communication and connectedness. </p> <p>The village has changed. Many of the amenities and services I described in those early poems no longer exist. Two of the big mills are still standing, but are empty and decaying. New housing estates have replaced brownfield sites or encroached on to the moor. The moors themselves are greener and trees have sprung up even beyond the recognised \u201ctree line\u201d \u2013 a consequence of climate change and reductions in chimney smoke and soot. And the giant eyesore of a gasometer, rising and falling like some grotesque iron lung, is no more. On the other hand, the basic layout is still the same, as is the population size, as is a sizeable proportion of the population. The clock on the Mechanics\u2019 Institute still pokes up above the rooftops on Peel Street, even if it rarely tells the right time. And Samuel Laycock, \u201cthe Marsden poet\u201d (what the hell do I have to do?), still looks out from his plinth near the bandstand in the park. So there\u2019s a surface continuity, at least, to draw on and return to, as well as a continuity of vocabulary and dialect. These days a \u201cregional accent\u201d is usually thought of as a marker of authenticity and identity, but growing up we were told to speak \u201cproperly\u201d and sometimes threatened with elocution lessons, because with the unsophisticated noises that came out of our mouths we would never get anywhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b85d828bb6103bc269f3b2c191aeca62a66cf1bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b85d828bb6103bc269f3b2c191aeca62a66cf1bf/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rain Stone near Blackstone Edge, one of a series of six Stanza Stones on a trail featuring poems by Simon Armitage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rain Stone near Blackstone Edge, one of a series of six Stanza Stones on a trail featuring poems by Simon Armitage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond the linguistics, I\u2019ve come to feel that there is something genuinely unique about this transcendent and transgressive location: a border area where habitation meets the uninhabitable; where Yorkshire meets Lancashire (not just topographically, but culturally); where the land disappears into the sky on many days of the year; where the last lawn is separated from the moor by the dividing line of a privet hedge; where roads peter out into cart-tracks and bridleways. The residents who have resurrected pagan fire festivals in Marsden and celebrate the zeal and resistance of the local Luddites chapter are the same people waiting at the station in the morning, commuting to IT jobs in Manchester and Leeds.</p> <p>The village was an extraordinary adventure playground for a child, with its system of switchbacks, towpaths and unadopted roads, and with its many reservoirs, like a sleeping pantheon of water deities above our heads, whose names became a recited litany of localness and belonging among those in the know. More recently they have lent their titles to beers in the village brewpub, though I\u2019ve never found a pint of Butterley or Cupwith an especially refreshing thought, remembering some of the things we found in those bodies of water, and some of the things we did in them.</p> <p>In attempting to describe border regions as good places to write \u2013 for the friction and exchange that takes place along the collision front \u2013 I once said in an interview that I grew up with one foot on the pavement and the other in the pigsty, something of an exaggerated claim (in fact, on Old Mount Road there were neither). But on Pule Hill, the landmark above Marsden with its distinctive silhouette, prehistoric burial sites and caves exist side by side with quarries and ventilation shafts from the railway tunnel beneath, more honest indicators of the kind of duality or interface I was trying to articulate.</p> <p>My poem \u201cSnow\u201d is carved into the rocky escarpment on the exposed flank of Pule Hill, the first of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/01/blogpost-stanza-stones-simon-armitage-ilkley-literature-festival\" title=\"\">six Stanza Stones </a>that form a 50-mile trail from Marsden to the far side of Ilkley Moor.

The reluctance was mine, too; having identified the house I grew up in as a kind of creative wellspring, it crossed my mind that without it I might dry up.

My parents lived in a terrace house on the south-facing side (an end terrace, in fact, which we could claim as \u201csemi-detached\u201d in more aspirant moments), up a steep, narrow road that was rumoured to be Roman in origin and still carries the contours of stone steps in the middle of the carriageway, beneath several layers of asphalt. My bedroom, made from a partitioned section of my parents\u2019 bedroom, looked straight down into the bowl of the village, the house occupying an enviable grandstand location for such a modest property. The only other terrace or \u201cblock\u201d with the same aspect consisted of 20 houses and was known colloquially as Titanic Row, either because of its impressive length, or because it was built in 1912, or because it was sinking slowly into the clay foundations. I watched a lot of TV as a kid and didn\u2019t read much other than comics, so I associate my first poetic experiences with the view from that bedroom window, especially the view at night, dreaming with my eyes wide open when I should have been asleep. I\u2019d watch the streetlamps blink into action, the shutters and blinds go down in the shops at the top of Fall Lane, and headlamps illuminate distant lanes and gable ends. I\u2019d watch people whose shapes and outlines I recognised going into the New Inn or coming out of the Old New Inn, and curtains being drawn in the houses of neighbours and family friends. I\u2019d see strangers, on foot or in unfamiliar vehicles, and I\u2019d imagine incidents taking place behind closed doors, though none of this was ever written down at the time. It became a kind of compulsion, or at least a routine, thinking about the invisible goings-on, all the standoffs and stalemates, the affairs and fisticuffs, the shenanigans and shady deals. Thinking also about the mundane and the commonplace, of people performing in the scenes and sketches of their regular lives, reinforcing my understanding of how the world worked and indulging a fascination with everyday domestic detail. Coming back to the village after three years at Portsmouth Polytechnic, with no job and in no hurry to get one, I started looking out of that window again, and out of the large picture window in the living room with its wide-angle view of Marsden \u2013 and I was ready to write. By that time I was a geography graduate with a head full of theories about people and places. So the village became the drawing board or board game on which I could practise my poetics and play out my perspectives. The frame of the window might have operated as a limiting device, restricting my perception of the wider world, but it was an invaluable template for bringing focus to the poems and legitimising the use of local subjects and vernacular in a poetic context. So the post office got the treatment, as did the fire station, and the petrol station, and the snow-warning light on the main road. Even the house itself became a kind of \u201ccathedral of the ordinary\u201d in that era of few material goods where possessions were somehow part of a ritualistic fabric of life and household events had a near-sacramental pattern and process. My dad\u2019s cars, incomprehensibly expensive at the time, acquired the status of close relatives or large exotic pets, not just means of transportation but characters with names, personalities, idiosyncrasies and smells. Even though I\u2019m pretty sure I never took a bite out of it I can still \u201ctaste\u201d the cracked red leather seats in the back of the Hillman Minx and picture the lettering on the registration plate: BAP 69P. If all that goes some way towards explaining why I wrote so much about Marsden in my first collection, Zoom! (1989), and my second collection Kid (1992), while I was still living there, it doesn\u2019t really explain why I\u2019ve continued to address it \u2013 on and off \u2013 for another three decades. True, I only live a couple of valleys away, but in these parts that\u2019s the equivalent of self-imposed exile. Yet distance seems to necessitate the occasional recalibration or rebalancing of the scales, as if I\u2019m using the village as a standard of poetic measurement, or as a measurement of poetic standard. In 2015 I published The Unaccompanied, a collection that had accumulated slowly since around 2008, the year of the financial crash. Until I started to work out an order for the manuscript, I hadn\u2019t realised how much I\u2019d been writing about Marsden again, this time charting the effects of the recession, and the austerity that followed, and a growing sense of marginalisation in what was supposed to be an age of increased communication and connectedness. The village has changed. Many of the amenities and services I described in those early poems no longer exist. Two of the big mills are still standing, but are empty and decaying. New housing estates have replaced brownfield sites or encroached on to the moor. The moors themselves are greener and trees have sprung up even beyond the recognised \u201ctree line\u201d \u2013 a consequence of climate change and reductions in chimney smoke and soot. And the giant eyesore of a gasometer, rising and falling like some grotesque iron lung, is no more. On the other hand, the basic layout is still the same, as is the population size, as is a sizeable proportion of the population. The clock on the Mechanics\u2019 Institute still pokes up above the rooftops on Peel Street, even if it rarely tells the right time. And Samuel Laycock, \u201cthe Marsden poet\u201d (what the hell do I have to do?), still looks out from his plinth near the bandstand in the park. So there\u2019s a surface continuity, at least, to draw on and return to, as well as a continuity of vocabulary and dialect. These days a \u201cregional accent\u201d is usually thought of as a marker of authenticity and identity, but growing up we were told to speak \u201cproperly\u201d and sometimes threatened with elocution lessons, because with the unsophisticated noises that came out of our mouths we would never get anywhere. Beyond the linguistics, I\u2019ve come to feel that there is something genuinely unique about this transcendent and transgressive location: a border area where habitation meets the uninhabitable; where Yorkshire meets Lancashire (not just topographically, but culturally); where the land disappears into the sky on many days of the year; where the last lawn is separated from the moor by the dividing line of a privet hedge; where roads peter out into cart-tracks and bridleways. The residents who have resurrected pagan fire festivals in Marsden and celebrate the zeal and resistance of the local Luddites chapter are the same people waiting at the station in the morning, commuting to IT jobs in Manchester and Leeds. The village was an extraordinary adventure playground for a child, with its system of switchbacks, towpaths and unadopted roads, and with its many reservoirs, like a sleeping pantheon of water deities above our heads, whose names became a recited litany of localness and belonging among those in the know. More recently they have lent their titles to beers in the village brewpub, though I\u2019ve never found a pint of Butterley or Cupwith an especially refreshing thought, remembering some of the things we found in those bodies of water, and some of the things we did in them. In attempting to describe border regions as good places to write \u2013 for the friction and exchange that takes place along the collision front \u2013 I once said in an interview that I grew up with one foot on the pavement and the other in the pigsty, something of an exaggerated claim (in fact, on Old Mount Road there were neither). But on Pule Hill, the landmark above Marsden with its distinctive silhouette, prehistoric burial sites and caves exist side by side with quarries and ventilation shafts from the railway tunnel beneath, more honest indicators of the kind of duality or interface I was trying to articulate. My poem \u201cSnow\u201d is carved into the rocky escarpment on the exposed flank of Pule Hill, the first of six Stanza Stones that form a 50-mile trail from Marsden to the far side of Ilkley Moor. Thus far it\u2019s the only one to be vandalised. Just bored kids throwing rocks, probably, but a useful caution against being a priest in your own parish. A few years ago my parents reluctantly flitted from the house they had lived in for over half a century to a house in the village centre, a property near a bus stop, shops, the church, pubs, the doctors\u2019 surgery, and somewhere that doesn\u2019t require a gritting lorry and grappling irons to make it accessible when one of those old-fashioned winters rolls in. The reluctance was mine, too; having identified the house I grew up in as a kind of creative wellspring, it crossed my mind that without it I might dry up. If anything, though, not having a foothold in that property, and having emptied it of family possessions, I\u2019ve felt able to investigate it more freely and without the obligations that superstition and nostalgia can sometimes impose. Free to be more honest, and free to mythologise. \u2022 Magnetic Field: The Marsden Poems is published by Faber (RRP \u00a314.99) on 19 March. To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

But when Hollywood actor Idris Elba comes along waving a record contract, it\u2019s clearly impossible to resist; the 28-year-old rapper and singer recently announced that he\u2019s joined Elba\u2019s 7Wallace roster. Lingo calls himself the \u201cwizard of Wandsworth\u201d, which suggests a sense of humour about his south London ends. His potent single My Block, however, takes aim at the serious matter of police brutality, like a UK answer to Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Alright. The song touches on what he perceives as the injustice surrounding his friend Julian Cole, who was left brain damaged by police after an incident at a nightclub in Bedfordshire in 2013.

Eleven towns \u2013 10 in Lombardy and one in Veneto \u2013 have been under lockdown for almost two weeks. The government is yet to announce whether the quarantine period will be extended. Schools and universities across the country have been closed until 15 March while major sporting events, such as Serie A football games, will be played behind closed doors until 3 April. The outbreak is severely damaging the Italian economy, with warnings the tourism sector alone could experience \u20ac7.4bn (\u00a36.4bn) of losses during this trimester.",

      "bodyText": "NHS England has confirmed it will provide GP surgeries with personal protective equipment (PPE) to help them deal with the coronavirus outbreak, following complaints from ill-equipped doctors. In a letter sent to all 7,000 English GP surgeries on Thursday, NHS England made clear it will give every surgery a full supply of PPE gear, which will help keep staff who come into contact with suspected coronavirus cases safe and help to minimise the spread of the virus. The move follows complaints by GPs and the British Medical Association that practices are ill-equipped to deal with the outbreak. More than 20 GP practices have been forced to close temporarily over concerns about the spread of coronavirus. GPs were advised last month to wear surgical masks and other protective equipment if they came into contact with patients who might have Covid-19, but one doctor pointed out on Twitter that her practice only had two surgical masks left. In a tweet that went viral, South Cumbria GP Dr Alison Johnston asked the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, what he was doing to protect healthcare staff, adding that they had also received no training in the use of PPE. NHS England has now confirmed that all practices will be issued with an initial stock of PPE including 400 general-use aprons, 300 pairs of examination gloves and 300 fluid-repellent face masks. The kits will be sent out next week. Larger surgeries will receive repeat deliveries to ensure they have sufficient amounts, the letter said. The confirmation followed a call from the BMA for practices to be issued with the specialist equipment. Dr Helena McKeown, the chair of the BMA representative body, welcomed the news and said GPs were \u201cthe first-line defence in the NHS\u201d. She said: \u201cWe have been working closely with NHS England to ensure surgeries have the appropriate equipment, and we\u2019re pleased to see that extra supplies are now going to be delivered to practices across the country.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to have discussions with NHS England about the protection of other doctors and medical students, such as those in hospitals and intensive care units where some Covid-19 patients might need further treatment.\u201d The letter from Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS England\u2019s medical director for primary care, said: \u201cI recognise that Covid-19 is placing a new and increasing challenge on already busy practices, and this will be an area of concern for you, your teams and your patients.\u201d She added that NHS England is continually refining plans for the outbreak and is listening to feedback received on emerging coronavirus issues. Dr Steve Mowle, the honorary treasurer of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cThe advice from NHS England for GPs is welcome, particularly the confirmation that GP practices in England will start to receive appropriate and necessary protective equipment early next week. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that anybody working in general practice is doing so safely and is as protected from Covid-19 as possible as we work through this challenging time for the NHS and society in general.\u201d Mowle added that it appears as though the majority of patients are heeding official advice not to go to GP practices if they think they might have Covid-19. However, he said: \u201cAs the situation escalates, we\u2019re going to need to have serious conversations about which tasks to prioritise over others and whether there are any we can stop doing temporarily to create capacity to deal with Covid-19.\u201d On Friday, GP surgeries were told by NHS England to start conducting as many remote consultations as possible, replacing patient visits with phone, video, online or text contact. Only 1% of the 340m appointments a year with GPs and other practice staff are currently carried out by video call. The change could last for several months, as experts believe the virus may not peak until April or May, and could last until June or July.",

      "body": "<p>If someone tells you they have an idea for a book, says Sebastian Barry, advise them to \u201cgo home and drink for a few months, and then come back and have no ideas. Because you don\u2019t have ideas for books.\u201d Indeed, if one does happen to occur, then sadly, \u201cthat\u2019s the end of that book. You have ideas for books when you finish them.\u201d This is very much the counterintuitive, back-to-front and frankly confounding sort of thing Barry says when he\u2019s talking about writing. I point out to him that during the course of our conversation about <em>A Thousand Moons</em>, his eighth work of long-form fiction and a continuation of the Costa-winning <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Days+Without+End+review+the+guradin&amp;oq=Days+Without+End+review+the+guradin&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0.1715j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" title=\"\">Days Without End</a></em>, he has equated the process of creating a novel to being a train robber on the run; to elaborating Einstein\u2019s theories of time; and to ensuring the safe return of Buzz Aldrin and his crew from the moon, in a scenario in which the novelist is at once ground control at Cape Canaveral and \u201calso the fucking rocket\u201d. I mean, what\u2019s going on here?</p> <p>He pauses for a moment. \u201cThere may be a dog in the rocket too,\u201d he adds, almost apologetically. \u201cIt may have snuck on.\u201d</p> <p>But if this sounds like a kind of parody of haute literary pretension, I should point out that much of the time Barry is laughing, although he sometimes seems close to tears, and that I occasionally suspect him of teasing me. In fact, the two conversations we have \u2013 one in the old rectory in the Wicklow mountains that he shares with his wife, actor and screenwriter Alison Deegan, and several dogs ranging from the tiny to the enormous, and the other in the offices of his London publisher \u2013 are notable because of their swift gear changes from the silly to the serious, the light-hearted to the sad and strange.</p> <p>The story behind all his novels \u2013 beginning with <em>The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty</em> in 1998 and including <em>Annie Dunne</em>, the Booker-shortlisted <em>A Long Long Way</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/24/fiction1\" title=\"\">The Secret Scripture</a></em> \u2013 is one of the deliberate and careful construction of a family that would at some level stand \u201cin place of the kind of disaster of the family I was accidentally part of originally. I mean utter disaster.\u201d What was so disastrous about his family? \u201cI don\u2019t see my father. My brother has disappeared. My sister, whom I adore, lives in France. My mother was a complicated bipolar person, absolutely glorious in some ways, absolutely ... I mean, to be a child of those people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In the theatre, every word, every\u00a0sentence, every moment, has to be full of\u00a0electricity; it\u00a0has to be plugged\u00a0in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His brother, he adds, was \u201ca verifiable genius\u201d, who as a young man was inundated with scholarship offers to study astrophysics in the US, and whom Barry doted on in a way that he describes as \u201cfatherly, without the responsibility of being a father\u201d. Later, he developed mental health issues, and Barry isn\u2019t sure exactly where he is. About this relationship, and those with his parents, he is clear and adamant: \u201cSome people may be more practical than me about this. But these are losses, as far as I\u2019m concerned. All these battles were lost.\u201d</p> <p>In the early 1990s, Barry and his wife had twins, who are now 27, and he felt what he terms \u201ca sense of emergency\u201d: \u201cI realised I had to make some reckoning with all of that. And you know, you\u2019ve got to call a loss a loss. It is very like accountancy.\u201d He remembers wanting to create a family history for his children, even if they never made use of it, because it would be preferable to \u201cthe rather frightening thing I knew\u201d.</p> <p>Creating \u2013 often idealising \u2013 a family tree is not uncommon. But Barry\u2019s endeavour turned out not to be one of sanitisation; rather, he notes: \u201cI had a suspicion that it would be among the outlaws that I would find worthy family members.\u201d His characters frequently find themselves at the interstices of history, propelled by forces unknown to them. Violence is commonplace; separation, loss and madness far from unusual.</p> <p>Each of the novels imagines and expands on the history of one of Barry\u2019s ancestors, about whom he often knew only the sketchiest of details. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the woman who became Roseanne McNulty in <em>Secret Scripture</em>,\u201d he recounts. \u201cAll I knew was that she was in my great-uncle\u2019s band, and that she was sectioned for some reason. And she lived the rest of her life in an institution, and he married again. I did meet Lily from <em>On Canaan\u2019s Side</em> once. She was just back for a few days from America. But I didn\u2019t know anything about her life story. I knew one great-uncle had been murdered in Chicago. I didn\u2019t know anything about my great-uncle in the first world war. Apparently, I had three of them.\u201d They became one fictional character, Willie Dunne, from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/03/fiction.bookerprize2005\" title=\"\">A Long Long Way</a></em>.</p> <p>Another forefather, Thomas McNulty, left Ireland during the famine and found himself fighting in both the Indian wars and the American civil war. It was a story that Barry\u2019s grandfather told him as he lay in bed as a child, he says: \u201cIt means one thing when you\u2019re six. But it means a whole different thing when you\u2019re 60.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e16c7262e9c7b8680887451465e713343d654090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e16c7262e9c7b8680887451465e713343d654090/116_0_4541_2725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Secret Scripture\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rooney Mara and Jack Reynor in the 2016 film adaptation of The Secret Scripture<em>.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <em>Days Without End</em>, Barry introduced readers to Thomas, a teenager whose \u201centire history as a human being has been removed from him\u201d. His family lost to the famine and his homeland ravaged, Thomas makes for the US, whereupon he finds himself enlisted in the American army, and falls in love with another soldier, John Cole. When the novel was published, Barry spoke movingly about how it was inspired by and dedicated to his younger son, Toby, who \u2013 after a period of what his parents feared was depression but transpired to have more to do with the pressure of secrecy \u2013 had told them that he was gay. The novel was, said Barry at the time, a celebration of his son, and an insistence on sexual and emotional freedom.</p> <p>But the book was not without its darkness. Thomas and John take in a young Lakota Native American woman, Winona, whom they love as their own child; they have also been \u201cfully complicit in the murder of her people and her family; the thing is utterly disgraceful and infinitely questionable\u201d.</p> <p>In <em>A Thousand Moons</em>, Barry gives Winona her own voice and her own story. The novel is an attempt to allow her to reckon with the violence both past and present that is done to her, her relationship with her adoptive fathers, and the development of her own sexuality.</p> <p>Barry is in the UK ahead of the publication of <em>A Thousand Moons</em> but also because <em>On Blueberry Hill</em>, his prison-cell play, is about to open in the West End of London. In 2017, Barry, the Irish theatre company Fishamble and the play\u2019s cast, Niall Buggy and David Ganly, performed the piece in Mountjoy prison, Dublin; Barry describes the experience of hearing prisoners cheer the actors on as being close to how he imagined Elizabethan theatre. When he reads from his prose fiction, he is strikingly performative, but novels are, of course, different from drama. How do the two work together for him?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3bb1fe0d2217c861bdc9a134d6b1d9b2125d8de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3bb1fe0d2217c861bdc9a134d6b1d9b2125d8de/251_301_3391_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Niall Buggy, left, and David Ganly in On Blueberry Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Niall Buggy, left, and David Ganly in On Blueberry Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Redmond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn the theatre, every word, every sentence, every moment, has to be full of electricity; it has to be all plugged in. You can\u2019t have anything that doesn\u2019t echo or reverberate.\u201d He has tried to bring the same \u201cspontaneity\u201d to the business of writing novels; the paradox is that it requires a great deal of patience. \u201cFor a year you can read and console yourself that you\u2019re doing some work. But then you have this year of waiting. I waited for all those books \u2013 and waiting is very frightening and humiliating.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask Barry how he approached the task of writing from the point of view of a young Native American woman \u2013 and especially the extent to which he worried about issues of cultural appropriation \u2013 he talks to me about his friendship with the late writer and activist Peter Matthiessen, whom he used as a model for the character Dillinger in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/20/on-canaans-side-sebastian-barry-review\" title=\"\">On Canaan\u2019s Side</a></em>. Matthiessen had immersed himself in the lives and civil rights battles of the indigenous people of Dakota; following the publication of Matthiessen\u2019s book <em>In the Spirit of Crazy Horse</em>, the governor of South Dakota and an FBI agent involved in a notorious shootout had attempted to sue his publishers for millions of dollars, disputing his versions of events.</p> <p>Barry recalls Matthiessen saying to him \u2013 in words that he then transferred to the fictional Dillinger \u2013 that the most important thing we\u2019ve been told about in our lifetime is DNA. \u201cBecause the good news is, we\u2019re all the same family. And the bad news is, we\u2019re all the same family. I not only fervently believe that, but I hold on to that, with every grappling hook in my possession.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as you construct, either for positive or negative reasons, divisions among us, then you give rise to a history like Ireland\u2019s history of religious wars. You give rise to my grandfather\u2019s hatred of England; he didn\u2019t even want me to come here. \u2018Is your own country not good enough for you? We fought 1916 for you \u2026 \u2019 All these allegiances have a wonderful side to them, a sort of gold side, but they also have this dreadful, tarnished toxic underbelly. Those ideas that are only made more murderous by insisting on the differences between us.\u201d</p> <p>Winona and Thomas are, he argues, correlatives of one another; their experiences of violence and dispossession relate to one another. But they are also crucially different; although both the Native American and Irish populations have risen to roughly similar levels after huge depletion, the Irish have always been in the majority in their own land. \u201cI\u2019m highly aware of the refuge that America was for Irish people \u2013 although we were called lice and scum when we came during the famine \u2013 and for Jewish people fleeing the Shoah, for black people who were dragged there from west Africa. I understand all that.\u201d But the phrase that has been echoing in his mind with reference to the land taken from the American Indians, especially since Trump rose to power is, \u201cGive it back.\u201d</p> <p>He brightens a little, as he thinks of the determination of those who made long journeys to safe ground, to new horizons. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve got to itemise the glories of mankind,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause there\u2019s been plenty of the other thing.

      "bodyText": "If someone tells you they have an idea for a book, says Sebastian Barry, advise them to \u201cgo home and drink for a few months, and then come back and have no ideas. Because you don\u2019t have ideas for books.\u201d Indeed, if one does happen to occur, then sadly, \u201cthat\u2019s the end of that book. You have ideas for books when you finish them.\u201d This is very much the counterintuitive, back-to-front and frankly confounding sort of thing Barry says when he\u2019s talking about writing. I point out to him that during the course of our conversation about A Thousand Moons, his eighth work of long-form fiction and a continuation of the Costa-winning Days Without End, he has equated the process of creating a novel to being a train robber on the run; to elaborating Einstein\u2019s theories of time; and to ensuring the safe return of Buzz Aldrin and his crew from the moon, in a scenario in which the novelist is at once ground control at Cape Canaveral and \u201calso the fucking rocket\u201d. I mean, what\u2019s going on here? He pauses for a moment. \u201cThere may be a dog in the rocket too,\u201d he adds, almost apologetically. \u201cIt may have snuck on.\u201d But if this sounds like a kind of parody of haute literary pretension, I should point out that much of the time Barry is laughing, although he sometimes seems close to tears, and that I occasionally suspect him of teasing me. In fact, the two conversations we have \u2013 one in the old rectory in the Wicklow mountains that he shares with his wife, actor and screenwriter Alison Deegan, and several dogs ranging from the tiny to the enormous, and the other in the offices of his London publisher \u2013 are notable because of their swift gear changes from the silly to the serious, the light-hearted to the sad and strange. The story behind all his novels \u2013 beginning with The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty in 1998 and including Annie Dunne, the Booker-shortlisted A Long Long Way and The Secret Scripture \u2013 is one of the deliberate and careful construction of a family that would at some level stand \u201cin place of the kind of disaster of the family I was accidentally part of originally. I mean utter disaster.\u201d What was so disastrous about his family? \u201cI don\u2019t see my father. My brother has disappeared. My sister, whom I adore, lives in France. My mother was a complicated bipolar person, absolutely glorious in some ways, absolutely ... I mean, to be a child of those people.\u201d His brother, he adds, was \u201ca verifiable genius\u201d, who as a young man was inundated with scholarship offers to study astrophysics in the US, and whom Barry doted on in a way that he describes as \u201cfatherly, without the responsibility of being a father\u201d. Later, he developed mental health issues, and Barry isn\u2019t sure exactly where he is. About this relationship, and those with his parents, he is clear and adamant: \u201cSome people may be more practical than me about this. But these are losses, as far as I\u2019m concerned. All these battles were lost.\u201d In the early 1990s, Barry and his wife had twins, who are now 27, and he felt what he terms \u201ca sense of emergency\u201d: \u201cI realised I had to make some reckoning with all of that. And you know, you\u2019ve got to call a loss a loss. It is very like accountancy.\u201d He remembers wanting to create a family history for his children, even if they never made use of it, because it would be preferable to \u201cthe rather frightening thing I knew\u201d. Creating \u2013 often idealising \u2013 a family tree is not uncommon. But Barry\u2019s endeavour turned out not to be one of sanitisation; rather, he notes: \u201cI had a suspicion that it would be among the outlaws that I would find worthy family members.\u201d His characters frequently find themselves at the interstices of history, propelled by forces unknown to them. Violence is commonplace; separation, loss and madness far from unusual. Each of the novels imagines and expands on the history of one of Barry\u2019s ancestors, about whom he often knew only the sketchiest of details. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the woman who became Roseanne McNulty in Secret Scripture,\u201d he recounts. \u201cAll I knew was that she was in my great-uncle\u2019s band, and that she was sectioned for some reason. And she lived the rest of her life in an institution, and he married again. I did meet Lily from On Canaan\u2019s Side once. She was just back for a few days from America. But I didn\u2019t know anything about her life story. I knew one great-uncle had been murdered in Chicago. I didn\u2019t know anything about my great-uncle in the first world war. Apparently, I had three of them.\u201d They became one fictional character, Willie Dunne, from A Long Long Way. Another forefather, Thomas McNulty, left Ireland during the famine and found himself fighting in both the Indian wars and the American civil war. It was a story that Barry\u2019s grandfather told him as he lay in bed as a child, he says: \u201cIt means one thing when you\u2019re six. But it means a whole different thing when you\u2019re 60.\u201d In Days Without End, Barry introduced readers to Thomas, a teenager whose \u201centire history as a human being has been removed from him\u201d. His family lost to the famine and his homeland ravaged, Thomas makes for the US, whereupon he finds himself enlisted in the American army, and falls in love with another soldier, John Cole. When the novel was published, Barry spoke movingly about how it was inspired by and dedicated to his younger son, Toby, who \u2013 after a period of what his parents feared was depression but transpired to have more to do with the pressure of secrecy \u2013 had told them that he was gay. The novel was, said Barry at the time, a celebration of his son, and an insistence on sexual and emotional freedom. But the book was not without its darkness. Thomas and John take in a young Lakota Native American woman, Winona, whom they love as their own child; they have also been \u201cfully complicit in the murder of her people and her family; the thing is utterly disgraceful and infinitely questionable\u201d. In A Thousand Moons, Barry gives Winona her own voice and her own story. The novel is an attempt to allow her to reckon with the violence both past and present that is done to her, her relationship with her adoptive fathers, and the development of her own sexuality. Barry is in the UK ahead of the publication of A Thousand Moons but also because On Blueberry Hill, his prison-cell play, is about to open in the West End of London. In 2017, Barry, the Irish theatre company Fishamble and the play\u2019s cast, Niall Buggy and David Ganly, performed the piece in Mountjoy prison, Dublin; Barry describes the experience of hearing prisoners cheer the actors on as being close to how he imagined Elizabethan theatre. When he reads from his prose fiction, he is strikingly performative, but novels are, of course, different from drama. How do the two work together for him? \u201cIn the theatre, every word, every sentence, every moment, has to be full of electricity; it has to be all plugged in. You can\u2019t have anything that doesn\u2019t echo or reverberate.\u201d He has tried to bring the same \u201cspontaneity\u201d to the business of writing novels; the paradox is that it requires a great deal of patience. \u201cFor a year you can read and console yourself that you\u2019re doing some work. But then you have this year of waiting. I waited for all those books \u2013 and waiting is very frightening and humiliating.\u201d When I ask Barry how he approached the task of writing from the point of view of a young Native American woman \u2013 and especially the extent to which he worried about issues of cultural appropriation \u2013 he talks to me about his friendship with the late writer and activist Peter Matthiessen, whom he used as a model for the character Dillinger in On Canaan\u2019s Side. Matthiessen had immersed himself in the lives and civil rights battles of the indigenous people of Dakota; following the publication of Matthiessen\u2019s book In the Spirit of Crazy Horse, the governor of South Dakota and an FBI agent involved in a notorious shootout had attempted to sue his publishers for millions of dollars, disputing his versions of events. Barry recalls Matthiessen saying to him \u2013 in words that he then transferred to the fictional Dillinger \u2013 that the most important thing we\u2019ve been told about in our lifetime is DNA. \u201cBecause the good news is, we\u2019re all the same family. And the bad news is, we\u2019re all the same family. I not only fervently believe that, but I hold on to that, with every grappling hook in my possession.\u201d \u201cAs soon as you construct, either for positive or negative reasons, divisions among us, then you give rise to a history like Ireland\u2019s history of religious wars. You give rise to my grandfather\u2019s hatred of England; he didn\u2019t even want me to come here. \u2018Is your own country not good enough for you? We fought 1916 for you \u2026 \u2019 All these allegiances have a wonderful side to them, a sort of gold side, but they also have this dreadful, tarnished toxic underbelly. Those ideas that are only made more murderous by insisting on the differences between us.\u201d Winona and Thomas are, he argues, correlatives of one another; their experiences of violence and dispossession relate to one another. But they are also crucially different; although both the Native American and Irish populations have risen to roughly similar levels after huge depletion, the Irish have always been in the majority in their own land. \u201cI\u2019m highly aware of the refuge that America was for Irish people \u2013 although we were called lice and scum when we came during the famine \u2013 and for Jewish people fleeing the Shoah, for black people who were dragged there from west Africa. I understand all that.\u201d But the phrase that has been echoing in his mind with reference to the land taken from the American Indians, especially since Trump rose to power is, \u201cGive it back.\u201d He brightens a little, as he thinks of the determination of those who made long journeys to safe ground, to new horizons. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve got to itemise the glories of mankind,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause there\u2019s been plenty of the other thing. You can make a fucking long list.\u201d \u2022 A Thousand Moons by Sebastian Barry is published by Faber (\u00a318.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

Kratzer and his designer, Rainer Sellmaier, have run with this notion: not merely a game of two halves but unmatched halves of two entirely different sports. The prison setting of Act 1 will reassure traditionalists. A French tricolour hangs over the gateway. Frock coats, tricorns, breeches, all confirm the story\u2019s Reign of Terror context. The opera\u2019s plot is straightforward, even if the background details remain obscure: Leonore, dressed as a man and called Fidelio, wants to free her husband, Florestan, a political prisoner, held in a dungeon cell. To do so, she takes a job at the prison and wins the trust of the jailer, Rocco (Georg Zeppenfeld).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More mysterious symphonic struggle than conventional opera, any chance to hear this work is a high day</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But what\u2019s this? We know Marzelline (Amanda Forsythe), the jailer\u2019s daughter, has fallen for this stranger and lost interest in her boyfriend, Jaquino (Robin Tristschler). Normally confined to emptying the laundry basket, here Marzelline tries to pull Fidelio\u2019s trousers off. Logically enough, she soon realises Fidelio is a woman, usually only revealed at the end. It\u2019s an intriguing twist, which humanises Marzelline and fills out a flimsy storyline. There\u2019s another side to her in this production, involving a trumpet and a pistol, which, despite the feminist instinct and Forsythe\u2019s sympathetic performance, backfires. The villainous Pizarro\u2019s loving attention to his horse while he squeezed the life out of a caged bird was well handled. Yet Simon Neal seemed out of sorts as this murderous governor (and pulled out of a subsequent performance). Pappano and the orchestra compensated with chilling volleys and explosions from the pit.</p> <p>In the second act, Kratzer shreds any pretence at good theatrical behaviour. All imagery from the previous act has vanished. The blackness of Beethoven\u2019s score in the revolutionary prelude \u2013 a straight path to Wagner \u2013 heralds not the usual dark dungeon but a bright room full of people, bystanders. We\u2019ve left the 18th century, indicated only by a pedimented doorway, and joined selfie-obsessed modern life. The scene could be a contemporary art gallery, with Kaufmann resembling a hair-shirted John the Baptist splayed on <a href=\"http://www.richardlong.org/Exhibitions/2011exhibitions/whitechapcirc.html\" title=\"\">one of Richard Long\u2019s slate circle sculptures</a>: a mere exhibit.</p> <p>There\u2019s too much messy activity here, not least at the end when the reunited Leonore and Florestan have to change their clothes mid-song. The live video would be more effective if curtailed. The point that society turns its back until forced into understanding is true enough, but clunkily hammered home. If you can, go and see it <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/showings/fidelio-live-2020\" title=\"\">live in cinemas on 17 March</a>. Davidsen, her voice soaring, rich, unstoppable, started a little anxiously and rose to glory. The grand, choral finale is as noisy, joyful and heartbreaking as you\u2019re likely to hear, terrifically sung by the ROH chorus. For those of us who love this work, more mysterious symphonic struggle than conventional opera, any chance to hear it is a high day.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mUDr330lVE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0mUDr330lVE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mUDr330lVE\">Watch Jeremy Denk discuss Beethoven\u2019s Fourth Piano Concerto.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Beethoven spent years reworking <em>Fidelio</em> \u2013 from the first performance in 1805 to the final version in 1814 \u2013 while also completing other scores, among them the Fourth Piano Concerto.

In the second act, Kratzer shreds any pretence at good theatrical behaviour. All imagery from the previous act has vanished. The blackness of Beethoven\u2019s score in the revolutionary prelude \u2013 a straight path to Wagner \u2013 heralds not the usual dark dungeon but a bright room full of people, bystanders. We\u2019ve left the 18th century, indicated only by a pedimented doorway, and joined selfie-obsessed modern life. The scene could be a contemporary art gallery, with Kaufmann resembling a hair-shirted John the Baptist splayed on one of Richard Long\u2019s slate circle sculptures: a mere exhibit. There\u2019s too much messy activity here, not least at the end when the reunited Leonore and Florestan have to change their clothes mid-song. The live video would be more effective if curtailed. The point that society turns its back until forced into understanding is true enough, but clunkily hammered home. If you can, go and see it live in cinemas on 17 March. Davidsen, her voice soaring, rich, unstoppable, started a little anxiously and rose to glory. The grand, choral finale is as noisy, joyful and heartbreaking as you\u2019re likely to hear, terrifically sung by the ROH chorus. For those of us who love this work, more mysterious symphonic struggle than conventional opera, any chance to hear it is a high day. Beethoven spent years reworking Fidelio \u2013 from the first performance in 1805 to the final version in 1814 \u2013 while also completing other scores, among them the Fourth Piano Concerto. The American Jeremy Denk was soloist in a fresh, inventive and engrossing performance with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4. It was part of the LPO\u2019s 2020 Vision series of works spanning three centuries (in which the orchestra also performed Krzysztof Penderecki\u2019s tender Chaconne in memory of John Paul II, 2005, and Enescu\u2019s rampant and colourful Symphony No 1). Denk gave the left hand its own emphasis and vitality, helping us hear the structure, as well as the humour in Beethoven\u2019s familiar but never knowable work. As an encore, Denk wowed everyone with an outrageous ragtime version of the Pilgrim\u2019s Chorus from Tannh\u00e4user. Raise a laugh from Wagner? This pianist manifestly did. Star ratings (out of five) Fidelio \u2605\u2605\u2605 London Philharmonic Orchestra/V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2022 Fidelio is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 17 March",

      "body": "<p>Two of Britain\u2019s greatest athletes are sharing anecdotes about their triumphs and tribulations, laughing like old friends despite having only recently met, when Mary Peters tells a story that makes Katarina Johnson\u2011Thompson gasp.</p> <p>In the months before the 1972 Munich Olympics Peters was desperate to win a pentathlon gold medal to cap off her career. But there was no track near where she lived in Belfast. So at the height of the Troubles she would get two buses across the city to use a run\u2011down facility, carrying her starter\u2019s blocks and a heavy shot to practise her putting, while also holding down a job. Sometimes she would hear bombs go off while she trained.</p> <p>\u201cIt was always raining too,\u201d says a chuckling Peters, who turned 80 and had open heart surgery last year but has the restless energy of someone half her age. \u201cAnd the track was full of potholes. Luckily I got a Churchill scholarship, which allowed me to go to the States for six weeks and train. I didn\u2019t have that much talent \u2013 which sounds ridiculous \u2013 but I worked really hard at it and it all came together.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/16/jemma-reekie-shows-olympic-class-with-special-kick-to-win-glasgow-1500m\">Jemma Reekie's 'special kick' could take her to Olympic glory, predicts coach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Memories of that pentathlon gold in Munich, where she set a world record \u2013 snatching glory in the 200m \u2013 come flooding back. \u201cI never thought: \u2018What will happen to me if I stand on that rostrum?\u2019 but when it happened it was amazing. It\u2019s over 47 years ago now since I had my success but I am still celebrating \u2013 still partying!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want that,\u201d replies Johnson\u2011Thompson, who will compete in the heptathlon in Tokyo later this year. \u201cI want to go on a 47-year celebration.\u201d</p> <p>Peters nods, recognising the spirit of a fellow traveller. \u201cJessica Ennis-Hill set a really high standard and was the face of the 2012 Olympics,\u201d she says, looking Johnson\u2011Thompson in the eye. \u201cAnd you are our next champion.\u201d</p> <p>It feels appropriate that Johnson\u2011Thompson and Peters are getting to know each other only days before International Women\u2019s Day, given one of its focuses is on celebrating sporting trailblazers and visionaries. Peters was certainly that \u2013 and a whole lot more. In the 1960s, when lifting weights was seen as distinctly unladylike, Peters was able to quarter-squat with 825lb (375kg) on her back \u2013 roughly the combined weight of four giant pandas \u2013 and one-arm jerk press an incredible 160lb (73kg).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c2e015a4f8684941b76107f039440c063f4ab61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c2e015a4f8684941b76107f039440c063f4ab61/2_0_3022_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Peters, KJT\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Peters storms home in the 200m in Munich, and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in action in the same event in Doha last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images and Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For good measure she could also do a vertical jump of 32 inches, which she says was then a world record, and also broke 25 British records during a career that spanned three Olympic Games.</p> <p>Not only was Peters a walking advert for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/11/this-girl-can-female-sporting-activity-taboo-busting\" title=\"\">This Girl Can</a> 50 years before the award-winning campaign was dreamed up but she did it all while holding down a full-time job \u2013 first as a teacher and then as a secretary.</p> <p>Of course there were challenges \u2013 plenty of them. While at training college, for instance, Peters had no track to train on, so she used to sprint down corridors after hours. On one occasion the doors ahead of her were suddenly closed and she smashed into them, shattering all the glass.</p> <p>\u201cI worked as a school teacher but I gave it up because they didn\u2019t like giving me time off to do my sport,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo I went to work as my coach\u2019s secretary. I\u2019d work 40 hours a week and train at the end of the day. It wasn\u2019t easy. I would go to the gym at 6am or stay after work at 9pm at night and do some weights.\u201d</p> <p>At this point Johnson-Thompson, who is listening with a mixture of awe and utter horror, chips in. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could cope under those conditions, I\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d she says. \u201cI just find it crazy that you describe yourself as just a hard worker and not talented when you\u2019re doing those events and jumping those heights in the conditions you had and training facilities you had. You\u2019re obviously putting yourself down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had to work really hard at everything I did,\u201d Peters says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t find it a chore.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de6604e109d086a771648c76fad4968237d1fcf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de6604e109d086a771648c76fad4968237d1fcf6/0_0_3022_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Peters, KJT\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peters and Johnson-Thompson tackle the high jump, 47 years apart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images and Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back then it was not just people\u2019s attitudes to women in sport that was less sophisticated. The diet was, too. \u201cI ate everything and more,\u201d Peters admits. \u201cI never had any pasta, never drank water, never carried a bottle of water. And we would have a steak dinner before we went out to compete.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson\u2011Thompson begins to chuckle before asking Peters whether she has seen a film about Steve Prefontaine, the legendary American distance runner of the 1970s who was killed in a car accident aged 24. \u201cThey would have steaks before competition, and beers and cigarettes at every meet,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Did Peters go that far? \u201cNearly,\u201d she replies, laughing.</p> <p>As the conversation continues, the pair find out they also share a deeper bond than an aptitude for multi-events \u2013 both hail from Halewood in Liverpool. Peters grew up there before moving to Northern Ireland when she was 11, while Johnson\u2011Thompson\u2019s mum and nan still live there.</p> <p>\u201cI remember those days vividly,\u201d says Peters. \u201cI used to get a penny for the bus fare home but I\u2019d run and try to beat it so I could save the penny.\u201d</p> <p>Neither woman can explain why Liverpool has produced two world-class multi-eventers but Johnson\u2011Thompson believes it is clear that success breeds success. \u201cI think it\u2019s because you see someone do it,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd that falls down to Denise Lewis and then Jess Ennis\u2011Hill. When you see the way, it makes it easier to believe it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson\u2011Thompson certainly believes. For years she took her licks and kicks, with her chances of glory at major competitions thwarted by a combination of injury, anxiety or plain bad luck. But at the world championships in Doha last October everything clicked. Not only did she defenestrate the queen of heptathlon, Belgium\u2019s Nafi Thiam, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/03/katarina-johnson-thompson-british-record-heptathlon-gold\" title=\"\">to take gold</a>, she also set four personal bests and beat Ennis-Hill\u2019s British record along the way.</p> <p>That victory, she admits, has completely changed her sense of self. \u201cBefore, when I spoke to kids who had dreams and ambitions, I used to say: \u2018Sport is so hard and you might not win,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI never used to believe \u2013 because I hadn\u2019t won.</p> <p>\u201cBut now I feel like I\u2019m able to tell them that, even through the rough times, keep pushing on. When I\u2019m a role model to kids, I am actually proud now.

      "bodyText": "Two of Britain\u2019s greatest athletes are sharing anecdotes about their triumphs and tribulations, laughing like old friends despite having only recently met, when Mary Peters tells a story that makes Katarina Johnson\u2011Thompson gasp. In the months before the 1972 Munich Olympics Peters was desperate to win a pentathlon gold medal to cap off her career. But there was no track near where she lived in Belfast. So at the height of the Troubles she would get two buses across the city to use a run\u2011down facility, carrying her starter\u2019s blocks and a heavy shot to practise her putting, while also holding down a job. Sometimes she would hear bombs go off while she trained. \u201cIt was always raining too,\u201d says a chuckling Peters, who turned 80 and had open heart surgery last year but has the restless energy of someone half her age. \u201cAnd the track was full of potholes. Luckily I got a Churchill scholarship, which allowed me to go to the States for six weeks and train. I didn\u2019t have that much talent \u2013 which sounds ridiculous \u2013 but I worked really hard at it and it all came together.\u201d Memories of that pentathlon gold in Munich, where she set a world record \u2013 snatching glory in the 200m \u2013 come flooding back. \u201cI never thought: \u2018What will happen to me if I stand on that rostrum?\u2019 but when it happened it was amazing. It\u2019s over 47 years ago now since I had my success but I am still celebrating \u2013 still partying!\u201d \u201cI want that,\u201d replies Johnson\u2011Thompson, who will compete in the heptathlon in Tokyo later this year. \u201cI want to go on a 47-year celebration.\u201d Peters nods, recognising the spirit of a fellow traveller. \u201cJessica Ennis-Hill set a really high standard and was the face of the 2012 Olympics,\u201d she says, looking Johnson\u2011Thompson in the eye. \u201cAnd you are our next champion.\u201d It feels appropriate that Johnson\u2011Thompson and Peters are getting to know each other only days before International Women\u2019s Day, given one of its focuses is on celebrating sporting trailblazers and visionaries. Peters was certainly that \u2013 and a whole lot more. In the 1960s, when lifting weights was seen as distinctly unladylike, Peters was able to quarter-squat with 825lb (375kg) on her back \u2013 roughly the combined weight of four giant pandas \u2013 and one-arm jerk press an incredible 160lb (73kg). For good measure she could also do a vertical jump of 32 inches, which she says was then a world record, and also broke 25 British records during a career that spanned three Olympic Games. Not only was Peters a walking advert for This Girl Can 50 years before the award-winning campaign was dreamed up but she did it all while holding down a full-time job \u2013 first as a teacher and then as a secretary. Of course there were challenges \u2013 plenty of them. While at training college, for instance, Peters had no track to train on, so she used to sprint down corridors after hours. On one occasion the doors ahead of her were suddenly closed and she smashed into them, shattering all the glass. \u201cI worked as a school teacher but I gave it up because they didn\u2019t like giving me time off to do my sport,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo I went to work as my coach\u2019s secretary. I\u2019d work 40 hours a week and train at the end of the day. It wasn\u2019t easy. I would go to the gym at 6am or stay after work at 9pm at night and do some weights.\u201d At this point Johnson-Thompson, who is listening with a mixture of awe and utter horror, chips in. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could cope under those conditions, I\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d she says. \u201cI just find it crazy that you describe yourself as just a hard worker and not talented when you\u2019re doing those events and jumping those heights in the conditions you had and training facilities you had. You\u2019re obviously putting yourself down.\u201d \u201cI had to work really hard at everything I did,\u201d Peters says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t find it a chore.\u201d Back then it was not just people\u2019s attitudes to women in sport that was less sophisticated. The diet was, too. \u201cI ate everything and more,\u201d Peters admits. \u201cI never had any pasta, never drank water, never carried a bottle of water. And we would have a steak dinner before we went out to compete.\u201d Johnson\u2011Thompson begins to chuckle before asking Peters whether she has seen a film about Steve Prefontaine, the legendary American distance runner of the 1970s who was killed in a car accident aged 24. \u201cThey would have steaks before competition, and beers and cigarettes at every meet,\u201d she says. Did Peters go that far? \u201cNearly,\u201d she replies, laughing. As the conversation continues, the pair find out they also share a deeper bond than an aptitude for multi-events \u2013 both hail from Halewood in Liverpool. Peters grew up there before moving to Northern Ireland when she was 11, while Johnson\u2011Thompson\u2019s mum and nan still live there. \u201cI remember those days vividly,\u201d says Peters. \u201cI used to get a penny for the bus fare home but I\u2019d run and try to beat it so I could save the penny.\u201d Neither woman can explain why Liverpool has produced two world-class multi-eventers but Johnson\u2011Thompson believes it is clear that success breeds success. \u201cI think it\u2019s because you see someone do it,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd that falls down to Denise Lewis and then Jess Ennis\u2011Hill. When you see the way, it makes it easier to believe it\u2019s possible.\u201d Johnson\u2011Thompson certainly believes. For years she took her licks and kicks, with her chances of glory at major competitions thwarted by a combination of injury, anxiety or plain bad luck. But at the world championships in Doha last October everything clicked. Not only did she defenestrate the queen of heptathlon, Belgium\u2019s Nafi Thiam, to take gold, she also set four personal bests and beat Ennis-Hill\u2019s British record along the way. That victory, she admits, has completely changed her sense of self. \u201cBefore, when I spoke to kids who had dreams and ambitions, I used to say: \u2018Sport is so hard and you might not win,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI never used to believe \u2013 because I hadn\u2019t won. \u201cBut now I feel like I\u2019m able to tell them that, even through the rough times, keep pushing on. When I\u2019m a role model to kids, I am actually proud now. Not just because I\u2019ve won but because of the journey I had to winning.\u201d At 27, Johnson\u2011Thompson believes she is at her peak and primed for Olympic glory. \u201cThe past three years have been about Tokyo,\u201d she says. \u201cMy move to Montpellier [in late 2016] was about Tokyo. It\u2019s hard not to think about it. This is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Her plan for the rest of 2020 \u2013 coronavirus permitting \u2013 is to do a low-key heptathlon in Atlanta before competing on the Diamond League circuit, including at the Anniversary Games in July. \u201cI really look forward to competing at the London Stadium in front of the British crowd, who are always amazing, not just to me, but in creating a great atmosphere for all athletes to compete,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd this year the M\u00fcller Anniversary Games are just before the Tokyo Olympics, so it will provide a great platform for all athletes to put some finishing touches in place.\u201d Peters \u2013 who also competed in Tokyo, finishing fourth at the 1964 Olympics \u2013 will be willing her on. Even now she still regularly goes into schools, trying to inspire the next generation by showing them her medals. \u201cA little boy said one day: \u2018Is it full of chocolate?\u2019\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cPeople never ever ask me to see a Commonwealth medal ever. And yet an Olympic gold medal is something everyone wants a part of. They want to feel it, they want to wear it, they want their picture taken with it. It\u2019s very special.\u201d Come August, Johnson\u2011Thompson intends to experience that emotion for herself \u2013 by claiming a place in that extraordinary exclusive club of British women who are multi\u2011event Olympic champions, alongside Peters, Lewis and Ennis\u2011Hill.

In Loss (Faber, \u00a314.99), we join an eerie narrative that begins at \u201c00:00 and the full of night to come\u201d, as visionary insomnia engulfs a man confronting personal and public losses. While unremittingly bleak, this book-length poetic sequence is powerful in its metaphorical reach: \u201cChildren in a pool of light, a pool of dust; the way / images deceive, the way time shunts and stalls, a test / of what gathers and corrupts\u201d. Like the best poets, Harsent reminds us what it is to lose sight of ourselves, as we might \u201cmeditate / on the effect of pain but never on its cause\u201d. \u2022 Ben Wilkinson\u2019s Way More Than Luck is published by Seren.",

In 1993, John Major responded to the death of two-year-old James Bulger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/mar/03/james-bulger-legacy-disturbed-children\" title=\"\">by insisting that</a> \u201csociety needs to condemn a little more, and understand a little less\u201d and refusing to stand in the way of two 10-year-old boys being tried for his murder.</p> <p>Then came New Labour\u2019s attempt to elide condemnation with understanding, and what the theorist Stuart Hall called the <a href=\"https://www.lwbooks.co.uk/soundings/24/new-labours-double-shuffle\" title=\"\">\u201cdouble-shuffle\u201d</a> of entrenching Thatcherite ideology under the guise of pragmatism.

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re ever on a train going north through Wolverhampton, look out of the window just after you pull out of the station and you\u2019ll see the privately run HMP Oakwood, one of the largest prisons in the country. It was commissioned and built by a Labour government that lost to the Tories shortly after building work began. I pass that prison \u2013 so close to the railway you can clearly see the cell windows \u2013 on the train every couple of weeks and remember that the attitude of Priti Patel didn\u2019t come from nowhere. New Labour also built Yarl\u2019s Wood, the immigration detention centre for women and children. It built Brook House and Colnbrook immigration removal centres, near Gatwick and Heathrow airports, and turned Dungavel open prison in Scotland into a detention facility for people refused asylum. It revoked the asylum claim of Jimmy Mubenga, who died in October 2010 after being restrained on a flight intended to deport him from the UK to Angola. Labour did these things because it had decided that voters wanted a political culture defined by its cruelty and mean-spiritedness. In so doing, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown upheld a seam of deliberate brutality, both in rhetoric and policy. In my lifetime we have seen Margaret Thatcher speaking of \u201cholding out the prospect of an end to immigration\u201d in 1978 and, as prime minister, declining to offer her condolences after the deaths of 13 young black people in a house fire in New Cross, London, in 1981. In 1993, John Major responded to the death of two-year-old James Bulger by insisting that \u201csociety needs to condemn a little more, and understand a little less\u201d and refusing to stand in the way of two 10-year-old boys being tried for his murder. Then came New Labour\u2019s attempt to elide condemnation with understanding, and what the theorist Stuart Hall called the \u201cdouble-shuffle\u201d of entrenching Thatcherite ideology under the guise of pragmatism. The more we were encouraged to believe that Labour was being as tough on the causes of crime as on crime itself, the more politics became a game of seeing what you could get away with in plain sight. HMP Oakwood is run by G4S and Yarl\u2019s Wood by Serco, a pattern of farming out the Home Office\u2019s dirty work that began under Labour. I can\u2019t imagine that, on the doorstep in 1997, 2001 and 2005, anyone promised to vote for the party on the condition that prisons were privatised. Yet Labour went ahead with the policy all the same, as it did with private finance initiatives \u2013 again, was this a compelling doorstep argument? \u2013 and the continual bullying of lone parents and council tenants as though they were, by definition, among the \u201ccauses\u201d of crime. At least for council tenants, stigmatisation brought funding. Children\u2019s centres, new school buildings and renovations under the Decent Homes Standard made estates better places to live in than they had been.

      "bodyText": "When Liselotte Watkins moved with her family to Rome from Milan four years ago, it was in such a rush that she had time to look at only one apartment. The previous owner had lived there for 30 years, and wouldn\u2019t let her take photographs, so \u201cmy husband, Jonas, had to take my word for it,\u201d she says. It was painted dark colours and the layout wasn\u2019t practical, but it was close to Jonas\u2019s new job, a decent school for their children Wim, 10, and Ava, eight, and Villa Borghese park. Swedish-born Watkins, an artist, illustrator and designer who has collaborated with Prada, Marimekko, and the Italian porcelain company Bitossi, works from a studio at home. \u201cIt\u2019s not your classic, elegant Rome apartment: the kitchen is small, the heating and water come and go, and there\u2019s no storage. But it does have big windows, which can be hard to find here, and some lovely original flooring,\u201d she says. \u201cThough it turns into a greenhouse in summer.\u201d Like most Romans, the family rent. But they were allowed to paint the flat white, and redo the kitchen and bathroom floors. Today, it\u2019s a bright, colourful three-bedroom home, filled with vintage furniture and Watkins\u2019 own pieces.

It will not stop the suffering of hundreds of thousands of displaced and terrified people who remain cut off from adequate humanitarian relief and medical aid. It will not solve the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/germany-tweets-to-deter-syrian-refugees-fearing-repeat-of-2015\" title=\"\">refugee crisis</a> on Europe\u2019s borders, nor will it bring justice to victims of numerous atrocious war crimes.</p> <p>This shoddy backroom deal, a stitch-up between the authoritarian leaders of Russia and Turkey, does not end the war. It does not affect the Syrian regime\u2019s determination to retake control of \u201cevery inch\u201d of the last rebel-held province, by whatever means. This bloody denouement has merely been postponed.</p> <p>What the ceasefire pact does do is further reinforce the grip of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, whose power to dispense life and death in Syria on a whim now goes unchallenged by the west. It effectively recognises territorial gains made by Syrian and Russian forces in three months of murderous, criminal attacks on Idlib\u2019s people.</p> <p>The ceasefire also gets Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president, off the hook after at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/dozens-of-turkish-soldiers-killed-in-strike-in-idlib-in-syria-reports-say\" title=\"\">60 Turkish soldiers</a> died last month in fighting with Syrian and Russian forces. As was the case last autumn, when Turkish forces invaded Kurdish areas of north-east Syria then let the Russians in, hapless Erdo\u011fan has again advanced <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/world/europe/erdogan-putin-syria-cease-fire.html\" title=\"\">Moscow\u2019s objectives</a>.</p> <p>Putin has successfully encouraged Erdo\u011fan to believe he can use a tilt to Russia as leverage against western partners critical of his Kurdish vendetta, support for Islamist extremists, and human rights abuses. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s weaponising of the Syrian refugee problem to pressure and disrupt the EU is another tactic approved in Moscow.</p> <p>All this furthers Putin\u2019s broader aim of weakening Nato and dividing the western democracies that, post-Crimea and the imposition of sanctions on Moscow, remain his main geopolitical target.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>European leadership on the Syrian crisis remains woefully lacking, as it has been for the past nine years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Looked at in this wider context, the deal confirms Erdo\u011fan\u2019s role as Russia\u2019s inside man in Nato. The Turkish leader may think he\u2019s a strategic genius, playing power politics on the world stage. In truth, he\u2019s little more than Putin\u2019s useful idiot.</p> <p>A stronger, less-compromised US president would have knocked Erdo\u011fan back into line long ago. Instead, Donald Trump flapped and postured while Putin drew Erdo\u011fan into energy deals, sold him an anti-aircraft system that could compromise Nato defences, and masqueraded as his only friend after coup plotters nearly dislodged him in 2016.</p> <p>It\u2019s plain that Trump will not stand up to Putin on Syria or anything else. On the contrary, he appears happy to accept Russian subversion, already under way according to US intelligence chiefs, if it helps his re-election. Trump finds in Putin a kindred spirit \u2013 vicious, unprincipled and corrupt. Maybe a Biden presidency will be different. But January will be too late for many Syrians. So who now will confront Putin and his tame Turkish sidekick?</p> <p>European parliamentarians, including British MPs, last week demanded that EU and Nato governments impose punitive sanctions if Russia (and Syria, Turkey and Iran) do not cooperate with a new multilateral push to protect Syrian civilians, tackle extremism, and enforce international humanitarian law.</p> <p>The appeal coincided with the latest report from the UN\u2019s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which for the first time formally accused Russia of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/russia-committed-war-crimes-in-syria-finds-un-report\" title=\"\">war crimes</a>, including \u201cindiscriminate attacks in civilian areas\u201d.</p> <p>Despite this, European leadership on the Syrian crisis remains woefully lacking, as it has been for the past nine years.</p> <p>The EU has promised assistance to Greece in handling Syrian refugees approaching its frontiers from Turkey. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, tweeted last week that \u201cour first priority\u201d was maintaining order on Europe\u2019s borders.</p> <p>Given the scale of the emergency, Europe\u2019s \u201cfirst priority\u201d should surely be saving lives, followed by bloc-wide resettlement quotas \u2013 something the EU has failed to agree since the last big refugee crisis in 2015.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Where, meanwhile, are the Arab states that claimed to care so much about Syria\u2019s future?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Countries such as Finland have offered refuge to limited numbers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/migration-eu-praises-greece-as-shield-after-turkey-opens-border\" title=\"\">the displaced</a>. Yet for all its talk about human rights, the EU as a whole has turned a blind eye to violent treatment of migrants by Greek border forces. Instead, it wants the recalcitrant Erdo\u011fan to reinstate the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/four-years-after-turkey-deal-eu-no-closer-to-new-asylum-system\" title=\"\">flawed 2016 migration pact he jettisoned last weekend</a>.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s much-weakened chancellor, continues to talk vaguely about <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-turkey-germany/merkel-calls-for-safety-zones-in-northern-syria-sources-idUSKBN20Q25K\" title=\"\">creating \u201csafety zones\u201d</a> in northern Syria. France has been making noises, too. But there is no appetite for intervention on the ground, with or without a UN mandate. Putin, meanwhile, has ignored Merkel\u2019s call for a four-way summit with France and Turkey.</p> <p>Britain, too, is keeping a safe distance. Speaking in Ankara last week, foreign secretary Dominic Raab sidestepped a question about support for a no-fly zone, saying only that the idea merited \u201cclose examination\u201d. That\u2019s no use to the thousands still freezing and hungry on Idlib\u2019s hillsides. Raab was more concerned to stress Britain\u2019s close relationship with Turkey \u2013 and its hopes for a free trade agreement this year. Oblivious to</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200304-uk-syrian-regime-and-russia-responsible-for-human-tragedy/\" title=\"\">Erdo\u011fan\u2019s tilt to Moscow</a>, or possibly trying to counter it with gross flattery, Raab described Turkey as an \u201cirreplaceable partner\u201d.</p> <p>Where, meanwhile, are the Arab states that claimed to care so much about Syria\u2019s future after the 2011 uprising that they poured money and arms into the hands of rebels and Islamist extremists? They have turned their backs on a catastrophe they helped create. Where is the UN security council? Hobbled by Russian vetoes and American ambivalence.</p> <p>Buck-passing, political cowardice, cynical calculation and compassion fatigue are the ugly measures by which the Syrian war, if it ever ends, will be remembered. Amid the silence following this latest ceasefire, perhaps the cries of victims will be heard more clearly.</p>",

It does not affect the Syrian regime\u2019s determination to retake control of \u201cevery inch\u201d of the last rebel-held province, by whatever means. This bloody denouement has merely been postponed. What the ceasefire pact does do is further reinforce the grip of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, whose power to dispense life and death in Syria on a whim now goes unchallenged by the west. It effectively recognises territorial gains made by Syrian and Russian forces in three months of murderous, criminal attacks on Idlib\u2019s people. The ceasefire also gets Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president, off the hook after at least 60 Turkish soldiers died last month in fighting with Syrian and Russian forces. As was the case last autumn, when Turkish forces invaded Kurdish areas of north-east Syria then let the Russians in, hapless Erdo\u011fan has again advanced Moscow\u2019s objectives. Putin has successfully encouraged Erdo\u011fan to believe he can use a tilt to Russia as leverage against western partners critical of his Kurdish vendetta, support for Islamist extremists, and human rights abuses. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s weaponising of the Syrian refugee problem to pressure and disrupt the EU is another tactic approved in Moscow. All this furthers Putin\u2019s broader aim of weakening Nato and dividing the western democracies that, post-Crimea and the imposition of sanctions on Moscow, remain his main geopolitical target. Looked at in this wider context, the deal confirms Erdo\u011fan\u2019s role as Russia\u2019s inside man in Nato. The Turkish leader may think he\u2019s a strategic genius, playing power politics on the world stage. In truth, he\u2019s little more than Putin\u2019s useful idiot. A stronger, less-compromised US president would have knocked Erdo\u011fan back into line long ago. Instead, Donald Trump flapped and postured while Putin drew Erdo\u011fan into energy deals, sold him an anti-aircraft system that could compromise Nato defences, and masqueraded as his only friend after coup plotters nearly dislodged him in 2016. It\u2019s plain that Trump will not stand up to Putin on Syria or anything else. On the contrary, he appears happy to accept Russian subversion, already under way according to US intelligence chiefs, if it helps his re-election. Trump finds in Putin a kindred spirit \u2013 vicious, unprincipled and corrupt. Maybe a Biden presidency will be different. But January will be too late for many Syrians. So who now will confront Putin and his tame Turkish sidekick? European parliamentarians, including British MPs, last week demanded that EU and Nato governments impose punitive sanctions if Russia (and Syria, Turkey and Iran) do not cooperate with a new multilateral push to protect Syrian civilians, tackle extremism, and enforce international humanitarian law. The appeal coincided with the latest report from the UN\u2019s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which for the first time formally accused Russia of war crimes, including \u201cindiscriminate attacks in civilian areas\u201d. Despite this, European leadership on the Syrian crisis remains woefully lacking, as it has been for the past nine years. The EU has promised assistance to Greece in handling Syrian refugees approaching its frontiers from Turkey. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, tweeted last week that \u201cour first priority\u201d was maintaining order on Europe\u2019s borders. Given the scale of the emergency, Europe\u2019s \u201cfirst priority\u201d should surely be saving lives, followed by bloc-wide resettlement quotas \u2013 something the EU has failed to agree since the last big refugee crisis in 2015. Countries such as Finland have offered refuge to limited numbers of the displaced. Yet for all its talk about human rights, the EU as a whole has turned a blind eye to violent treatment of migrants by Greek border forces. Instead, it wants the recalcitrant Erdo\u011fan to reinstate the flawed 2016 migration pact he jettisoned last weekend. Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s much-weakened chancellor, continues to talk vaguely about creating \u201csafety zones\u201d in northern Syria. France has been making noises, too. But there is no appetite for intervention on the ground, with or without a UN mandate. Putin, meanwhile, has ignored Merkel\u2019s call for a four-way summit with France and Turkey. Britain, too, is keeping a safe distance. Speaking in Ankara last week, foreign secretary Dominic Raab sidestepped a question about support for a no-fly zone, saying only that the idea merited \u201cclose examination\u201d. That\u2019s no use to the thousands still freezing and hungry on Idlib\u2019s hillsides. Raab was more concerned to stress Britain\u2019s close relationship with Turkey \u2013 and its hopes for a free trade agreement this year. Oblivious to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s tilt to Moscow, or possibly trying to counter it with gross flattery, Raab described Turkey as an \u201cirreplaceable partner\u201d. Where, meanwhile, are the Arab states that claimed to care so much about Syria\u2019s future after the 2011 uprising that they poured money and arms into the hands of rebels and Islamist extremists? They have turned their backs on a catastrophe they helped create. Where is the UN security council? Hobbled by Russian vetoes and American ambivalence. Buck-passing, political cowardice, cynical calculation and compassion fatigue are the ugly measures by which the Syrian war, if it ever ends, will be remembered. Amid the silence following this latest ceasefire, perhaps the cries of victims will be heard more clearly.",

Coming off the back of their maiden win in Dunedin last round, the Rebels took the spoils against the Johannesburg-based Lions at their sixth attempt.</p> <p>They did it with only 14 men for 20 minutes, after Test winger Marika Koroibete yellow-carded for a high-tackle before centre Tom English missed the first nine minutes of the second half for a professional foul just before the hooter.</p> <p>The win was sweet revenge after last year\u2019s meeting in South Africa when the Rebels blew a 28-point lead to go down 36-33, with a remarkable 20-1 penalty count proving costly.</p> <p>Winger Andrew Kellaway continued his Super Rugby resurgence with a double to notch seven tries for the season after only scoring three tries in 22 games with the Waratahs. Kellaway opened with a 50-metre effort and then a break by the 24-year-old set up Melbourne\u2019s second try, with flanker Richard Hardwick crossing between the uprights.</p> <p>The Lions kept in touch when with halfback Andre Warner finding winger Jamba Ulengo off the back of a five-metre line-out. A 40th-minute penalty by Elton Jantjies, after English knocked Andre Warner off the ball at the back of the ruck, closed the gap to 15-10 at the break.</p> <p>Despite being down a man, the Rebels started the second half with a bang, with forwards in Matt Philip and Angus Cottrell combining to put Wallabies backrower Isi Naisarani over the line.</p> <p>Skipper Dane Haylett-Petty then scored in the 53rd minute after halfback Ryan Louwrens wrong-footed the defence.

      "bodyText": "That is all, folks. BOG goes to John Millman for his come-from-behind heroics to send Australia into the Davis Cup finals. Not far behind were North Melbourne in the AFLW. They are so good they\u2019re scary. And one vote goes to Sydney FC, who proved against Melbourne Victory that you just can\u2019t keep a good team down. You guys were great as always - I\u2019ll try to find a spot in the votes for you next time - and I think I\u2019ll give myself the Encouragement Award. Until next time. Be good. A scare for Sydney FC after going a goal down but class kicked in as the game wore on and the premiers are now 13 points clear. A bit of controversy late in the game, with Sydney FC\u2019s fourth goal, a penalty, coming after Tim Hoogland was shown a straight red for what looked a 50-50 coming together in the box with Trent Buhagiar. But that incident didn\u2019t go close to deciding this fixture. That\u2019s 15 wins from 18 games this season for Sydney FC. Too big, too strong. Melbourne continue to break new Super Rugby ground, collecting their maiden win over the Lions with an impressive 37-17 victory at AAMI Park on Saturday night. Coming off the back of their maiden win in Dunedin last round, the Rebels took the spoils against the Johannesburg-based Lions at their sixth attempt. They did it with only 14 men for 20 minutes, after Test winger Marika Koroibete yellow-carded for a high-tackle before centre Tom English missed the first nine minutes of the second half for a professional foul just before the hooter. The win was sweet revenge after last year\u2019s meeting in South Africa when the Rebels blew a 28-point lead to go down 36-33, with a remarkable 20-1 penalty count proving costly. Winger Andrew Kellaway continued his Super Rugby resurgence with a double to notch seven tries for the season after only scoring three tries in 22 games with the Waratahs. Kellaway opened with a 50-metre effort and then a break by the 24-year-old set up Melbourne\u2019s second try, with flanker Richard Hardwick crossing between the uprights. The Lions kept in touch when with halfback Andre Warner finding winger Jamba Ulengo off the back of a five-metre line-out. A 40th-minute penalty by Elton Jantjies, after English knocked Andre Warner off the ball at the back of the ruck, closed the gap to 15-10 at the break. Despite being down a man, the Rebels started the second half with a bang, with forwards in Matt Philip and Angus Cottrell combining to put Wallabies backrower Isi Naisarani over the line. Skipper Dane Haylett-Petty then scored in the 53rd minute after halfback Ryan Louwrens wrong-footed the defence. Reserve prop Sti Sithole crossed late after a Lions maul before Kellaway dived across in the corner for his second of the night to secure an important bonus point. - with thanks to AAP Bad, bad news. It looks like Ellyse Perry will be spending an extended spell on the sidelines with that nasty hamstring injury. Australia star Ellyse Perry will have surgery on her torn hamstring and miss up to six months of cricket. Not only does the all-rounder have to deal with missing Sunday\u2019s record-breaking Women\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup final, but she\u2019s unlikely to play again until late this year. The 29-year-old bravely lined up in Australia\u2019s final group game against New Zealand on Monday despite carrying a hip injury. While attempting a diving throw in the field against the White Ferns at the Junction Oval, Perry tore her hamstring off the bone. She has remained with the Australia team as they prepare to face India at the MCG and will have surgery next week. \u201cI\u2019ve had the most incredible run; I\u2019ve been very fortunate with injury for a long period of time,\u201d Perry said. \u201cFirst and foremost, (the final) is the most-important thing and what it presents for the group and for the sport. \u201cOn a personal note, it\u2019s a challenge, but I\u2019m sort of looking forward to it in a roundabout way. I wish it wasn\u2019t the case but, at the same time, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots of things I can take from it and learn from it as well.\u201d Up until Thursday\u2019s thrilling semi-final win against South Africa, Perry had played in every T20 World Cup game for Australia since the first edition of the tournament in 2009. - with thanks to AAP A-League: 75 mins Melbourne Victory 1-3 Sydney FC For all of Melbourne Victory\u2019s fire and bluster, this won\u2019t be their night. Ninkovic\u2019s goal just before half-time planted the seed of doubt, and now two goals in two minutes - to Anthony Caceres and Adam Le Fondre - will see Sydney FC enter the final stages of this match happy to possess the ball and safeguard their buffer. Nice try, Victory, but no dice. That was better from St Kilda in the last quarter but in truth the result was never in doubt. The Blues used the ball better, kicked straighter and were deserved winners. The Saints had eight more inside-50s, only nine fewer disposals but went at 42% kicking efficiency compared to Carlton\u2019s 62%. Madison Prespakis ended the night with 26 touches, while there were two goals apiece for Sarah Hosking and St Kilda\u2019s Caitlin Greiser. Did I mention that Australia were into the Davis Cup finals? Pretty sure I did ... AFLW: 3QT: Carlton 7.2 (44) v St Kilda 3.2 (20) The Blues were threatening to cut loose and they did just that in the third term. Three goals to zip in the premiership quarter will do Carlton nicely. Madison Prespakis is now in excess of 20 disposals and is having a night out. A-League: HT: Melbourne Victory 1-1 Sydney FC It\u2019s a big stalemate at half-time in the Big Blue. Marco Rohas put the wind up the table toppers with his strike after five minutes, but an equaliser from Milos Ninkovic just before the whistle will do Sydney FC\u2019s morale the world of good. They were outplayed by Melbourne Victory for parts of the first half but will start the second stanza on level footing. Cricket: 3rd ODI: 16 overs: Australia 59-3 v South Africa Yes, this was a good toss to win. Looks to be hard going for Australia in Potchefstroom, with David Warner, Aaron Finch and Steve Smith all back in the dressing room. Marnus Labuschagne and D\u2019Arcy Short are the men in the middle, charged with the weighty task of getting their country out of this mess. A big swing and a miss from the latter just now. Not sure how that didn\u2019t hit off stump. Super Rugby: HT: Rebels 15-10 Lions A good defensive effort from the Rebels, but they will be down to 14 men for the first nine minutes of the second half after Tom English was shown a yellow card. The Lions, shooting for their sixth straight win over the Rebels, are right in this. AFLW: HT: Carlton 4.1 (25) v St Kilda 3.0 (18) No quarters given or taken at Ikon Park. Two majors for Sarah Hosking and 15 touches for her Carlton teammate, Madison Prespakis. Anyone\u2019s game. A-League: GOAL! Melbourne Victory 1-0 Sydney FC (Rohas 5\u2019) An early goal at Marvel Stadium and a pearler at that. They call Marco Rojas the \u2018Kiwi Messi\u2019 and this is why. A shimmy here, a shake there, a nutmeg somewhere else, all in traffic, and a clinical finish puts lowly Melbourne Victory 1-nil up against the ladder leaders. Tasty. AFLW: QT: Carlton 3.0 (18) v St Kilda 2.0 (12) Straight kicking is the order of the day here, unlike earlier today in Wagga Wagga, with the Blues holding away by one goal. John Millman has done his country proud, coming from a set down to beat Brazil\u2019s Thiago Monteiro and handing Australia an unassailable 3-1 lead in this qualifying tie. So it\u2019s official: Australia will compete in the Davis Cup finals in Spain in November. Maravilloso! Cricket: 3rd ODI: 5th over: Australia 13-1 v South Africa The hosts won the toss in Potchefstroom, electing to put Australia in. So far, it looks the right call. Plenty of seam movement on what looks a greenish deck and Anrich Nortje got the early breakthrough, getting one to go away from David Warner who edged behind. Aaron Finch, who has a crunching boundary to his name off said paceman, is now joined in the middle by Steve Smith. Yesiree, that was a good old-fashioned spanking. Western United now leapfrog Adelaide into sixth spot on the ladder and, who knows, might be on some sort of roll. That was poor from the Reds, who had plenty of ball and their share of shots but couldn\u2019t make it count. Besart Berishsa. He just doesn\u2019t know how not to score against Adelaide. Two today to make it 21 in all games against them. Not bad. Big win, not to mention a big score that should have been even bigger, for the Giants. And a big day out for Cora Staunton, who booted a career-high four goals and plucked six grabs. This will do GWS\u2019s finals hopes no harm at all - they\u2019re now third in Conference A - but Richmond slump to zip-and-five. Great for Alyce Parker to celebrate a win in her home town of Wagga Wagga. There\u2019s a big, big sound ... Davis Cup-date: John Millman - and let me say right now, onya Johnny - has made it one set apiece in his reverse-singles rubber against Brazil\u2019s Thiago Monteiro. Both sets have gone to tiebreaks. Australia lead the five-rubber tie 2-1, so if Millman wins the deciding set Australia are off to Spain. A-League: 68 mins Adelaide United 1-5 Western United Yikes. Adelaide are shipping goals like tomorrow won\u2019t come. Two goals to the good at the break, it took Western United just three minutes of the second half to make it three when Connor Pain scored. Besart Berisha, who wishes he could play the Reds every day of the week and twice on Sundays, then scored his second of the game - and 21st of his career against Adelaide - after 56 minutes to make it 5-1. It\u2019s been a thoroughly good dismantling at Coopers. Might be some teams a rung or two above Western United looking nervously over their shoulders. AFLW: 3QT: GWS Giants 4.13 (37) v Richmond 1.3 (9) More of the same in the third quarter: the Giants dominating but kicking poorly, the Tigers on the back foot and not able to score against the run of play. A bit of a thriller at Ballymore with the Tahs coming out on top to give themselves a bit of breathing space at the head of affairs. Emily Chancellor scored the first try of the match after seven minutes before Shannon Mato responded in kind for the Reds eight minutes later. But the Waratahs finished the stronger, with a try to Maya Stewart (55 mins) and, crucially, a penalty goal from Bella McKenzie after 68 minutes sealing the deal. How good were the Matildas against Vietnam? Diff\u2019rent gravy. I could waffle on forever. But why would I when Samantha Lewis has filed this ripping piece? AFLW: HT: GWS Giants 3.8 (26) v Richmond 1.2 (8) The Tigers are within three straight kicks of the Giants, but if GWS had kicked straight in the first half this match might be as good as over by now. But enough from me. Over to RoyceHart. A-League: HT: Adelaide United 1-3 Western United The good news for United fans is you\u2019re winning. The bad news for United fans is you\u2019re losing. The Adelaide version started the game brightly enough, with Riley McGree\u2019s 25th-minute strike cancelling out Besart Berisha\u2019s opener for the Western edition, but goals to Alessandro Diamanti and Max Burgess in the space of six minutes blew the game wide open. And they\u2019ve also had a goal disallowed. Work to be done by Adelaide here. Davis Cup-date II: In news just in, John Millman has dropped the first set in his reverse-singles rubber against Thiago Monteiro. Davis Cup-date I: Australia could have booked their ticket to Spain for November\u2019s finals, but a loss to Brazil in this afternoon\u2019s doubles rubber has this tie alive and kicking. Over to AAP ... Brazil have beaten Australia in the doubles rubber to keep their Davis Cup qualifying tie alive in Adelaide. Australia hold a two-one lead ahead of Saturday\u2019s reverse singles at Memorial Drive. Brazil\u2019s Marcelo Demoliner and Felipe Meligeni Rodrigues Alves came from a set down on Saturday to pip Australia\u2019s James Duckworth and John Peers in a tense encounter, prevailing 5-7 7-5 7-6 (8-6). Australia\u2019s John Millman and Jordan Thompson won Friday\u2019s singles rubbers, with Millman to meet Thiago Monteiro in the first reverse singles fixture. Let\u2019s get an early result out of the way. And what a result it is. North Melbourne have been most people\u2019s idea of this season\u2019s AFLW champions and the Kangas are doing nothing to dissuade anyone from that opinion. The Crows might be slightly understaffed at the moment but they are still a very good side even without one or two of their stars. Today, however, they were made to look pedestrian by comfortably the best team in the AFLW. Good afternoon and welcome to Sportwatch on this fine Saturday. Plenty happening today. If there\u2019s nothing on that turns your noodle, you are one tough individual to please. Australia and Brazil are going at it in the Davis Cup, with the winner to advance to the finals in Spain in November, Richmond and GWS face each other in the first AFLW game to be played in Wagga Wagga, we have two A-League games, the Super Rugby and Super W seasons roll on and Australia\u2019s men\u2019s ODI cricketers are in action again in South Africa.

The trevisano is torpedo-shaped, contained and very secretive. The most commonly available here, chioggia, looks like red cabbage except for its white veins like snow-covered trees. And tardivo has tendrils like Medusa\u2019s hair that stay robust and firm when cooked. </p> <p>Whichever type you find (and you can use any in this dish), they all have a very special bitterness that makes them a perfect partner for sweet-and-sour balsamic vinegar and the earthy richness of mushrooms and polenta.</p> <h2>Polenta with balsamic fried radicchio, mushrooms and sage</h2> <p>Once, these special leaves were the preserve of upmarket Italian restaurants only, but these days they make regular cameos in farmers\u2019 markets and even some supermarkets.

      "bodyText": "Radicchio, in its many varieties and hues of pink, is nature\u2019s most outrageous flirt. The castelfranco is big and blowsy, like a giant rose that\u2019s almost too good to eat. The trevisano is torpedo-shaped, contained and very secretive. The most commonly available here, chioggia, looks like red cabbage except for its white veins like snow-covered trees. And tardivo has tendrils like Medusa\u2019s hair that stay robust and firm when cooked. Whichever type you find (and you can use any in this dish), they all have a very special bitterness that makes them a perfect partner for sweet-and-sour balsamic vinegar and the earthy richness of mushrooms and polenta. Polenta with balsamic fried radicchio, mushrooms and sage Once, these special leaves were the preserve of upmarket Italian restaurants only, but these days they make regular cameos in farmers\u2019 markets and even some supermarkets. If you can\u2019t find them, use red endive (chicory) instead, but because bitterness varies between the different breeds, so add the agave syrup to taste. Prep 15 min Cook 45 min Serves 4 1 litre vegetable stock 180g instant polenta Fine sea salt Olive oil, for cooking 1 large head radicchio tardivo (around 500g), cut into 1cm shreds Balsamic vinegar 2 tbsp agave syrup (or to taste) 1 tbsp lemon juice 12 sage leaves 500g chestnut mushrooms, sliced 4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced Extra-virgin olive oil, to finish Put the stock in a saucepan for which you have a lid and bring it to a rolling boil. Pour in the polenta in a thin, steady stream, whisking as you do so, then keep whisking for another minute. The polenta will quickly thicken to a paste, and the moment it starts bubbling like molten lava, turn off the heat (if you let it bubble too much, it will get too thick).

Add two and a half tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, agave syrup to taste, lemon juice and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Cook for another two minutes, transfer the radicchio and all the pan juices to a bowl, then wipe out the pan. Line a small plate with a couple of pieces of kitchen paper(or a clean cloth).

      "body": "<p>Daisy Haggard says she\u2019s sorry, but she is a bit tired. We are in a cafe down the road from where she lives in south London, and as she gets the coffees in, she explains that she was up for most of the night with her two young daughters, who are five and two. They wanted to ask her questions about space. Having established the location of the sun and the moon, her two-year-old then started going through a list of everyone she knows. \u201cAnd saying who she likes, and who she doesn\u2019t like \u2013 oh my God, it\u2019s three in the morning,\u201d says Haggard, giggling. \u201cSo this will be a really bad interview.\u201d</p> <p>It isn\u2019t usually proper to describe any person over the age of 12 as giggly, but Haggard is irrepressibly giggly, and it is infectious. She has the air of a person who seems either delighted by everything, or delighted by the potential of everything to be entertaining. It makes sense that her career has been heavy on the funny stuff because, in person, she is very funny, and she appears to have been in almost every decent British comedy of the last 20 years or so, from Man Stroke Woman to Uncle to Psychoville to Episodes. Last year, she wrote and starred in her own, the brilliantly idiosyncratic Back to Life, about a woman returning to her home town after serving a life sentence. It rightly appeared on many of 2019\u2019s best-of lists.</p> <p>Today, though, and appropriately, given the bad night\u2019s sleep, she is here to talk about Breeders, in which she stars. Haggard plays Ally, who is married to Paul (Martin Freeman), and the show deals with the more exasperating side of parenthood. It came from an idea Freeman had, and as Paul he regularly loses his rag, occasionally calling the kids rude names to their faces. They have stunt scripts that they use for the scenes with the child actors that substitute the swear words for less crude language. \u201cUnfortunately, I find it hilarious,\u201d says Haggard, setting herself off. \u201cYou have fudge, which is a bit boring, but the one that just killed me was that rather than cock, it was clock. I couldn\u2019t get through that scene. I got hysterical.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDKYJwih5-Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KDKYJwih5-Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Along with comedies such as The Letdown and Motherland, Breeders shows the unvarnished side of life with young kids. Why does she think there is an appetite for that? \u201cThere\u2019s a line I say, which is: \u2018Who is happy with two kids under the age of seven?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not shiny, parenting. I am someone who genuinely loves it, but it is lovely when you see people behaving worse than you as parents.\u201d Try as she might, however, Haggard can\u2019t hide the fact that, unlike the characters in Breeders, she does seem to love being a parent. She admits this in exaggeratedly hushed tones. \u201cMe and my husband were saying: \u2018We\u2019re really having fun.\u2019 I think because I\u2019m a bit of an idiot and so is my husband. So we were like: \u2018Two more total twats to play with.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When she auditioned for Breeders, she had only just had her second baby, and she taped herself for it in her kitchen. \u201cI had the newborn baby in a car seat that I was jigging, and my other child was watching In the Night Garden, and I was a bit angry because I was tired.\u201d She laughs. \u201cWe had such a small window before she started screaming, and I thought: \u2018I\u2019m never going to get it.\u2019\u201d But for a show about harried parents it is easy to see why it did the trick. The tape went down well enough for her to be called in to read with Freeman.</p> <p>Haggard shot a pilot for Breeders, then went straight into filming Back to Life, which she co-wrote with Laura Solon. Haggard has been writing since she was a child, but this was the first of her scripts to make it to screen. She was 40 when it came out (she\u2019s 41 now), and seems thrilled by the fact her previously steady career has taken off when it has. \u201cMy priorities are so clear: I don\u2019t need to be rich, I don\u2019t need to run the world, I just need to earn as much as I can to support everyone, then have a big break and be with them.\u201d She is careful to acknowledge that it\u2019s different for everyone, but she has worked more since she\u2019s had kids, and has made that work for her. On the Nick Helm comedy Uncle, she asked for a clause in her contract that allowed her to take breaks for breastfeeding. \u201cWe need to make sure people don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re out of the game just because they decide to have a family.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52a73234771a3e7e2b4f6f4e9d36b77581d99b7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52a73234771a3e7e2b4f6f4e9d36b77581d99b7f/0_292_4400_2641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daisy Haggard with Adeel Akhtar in Back to Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daisy Haggard with Adeel Akhtar in Back to Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Varley/BBC/Two Brothers Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back to Life came from Haggard\u2019s curiosity about the way women are vilified for serious crimes in a way that men are not.

      "bodyText": "Daisy Haggard says she\u2019s sorry, but she is a bit tired. We are in a cafe down the road from where she lives in south London, and as she gets the coffees in, she explains that she was up for most of the night with her two young daughters, who are five and two. They wanted to ask her questions about space. Having established the location of the sun and the moon, her two-year-old then started going through a list of everyone she knows. \u201cAnd saying who she likes, and who she doesn\u2019t like \u2013 oh my God, it\u2019s three in the morning,\u201d says Haggard, giggling. \u201cSo this will be a really bad interview.\u201d It isn\u2019t usually proper to describe any person over the age of 12 as giggly, but Haggard is irrepressibly giggly, and it is infectious. She has the air of a person who seems either delighted by everything, or delighted by the potential of everything to be entertaining. It makes sense that her career has been heavy on the funny stuff because, in person, she is very funny, and she appears to have been in almost every decent British comedy of the last 20 years or so, from Man Stroke Woman to Uncle to Psychoville to Episodes. Last year, she wrote and starred in her own, the brilliantly idiosyncratic Back to Life, about a woman returning to her home town after serving a life sentence. It rightly appeared on many of 2019\u2019s best-of lists. Today, though, and appropriately, given the bad night\u2019s sleep, she is here to talk about Breeders, in which she stars. Haggard plays Ally, who is married to Paul (Martin Freeman), and the show deals with the more exasperating side of parenthood. It came from an idea Freeman had, and as Paul he regularly loses his rag, occasionally calling the kids rude names to their faces. They have stunt scripts that they use for the scenes with the child actors that substitute the swear words for less crude language. \u201cUnfortunately, I find it hilarious,\u201d says Haggard, setting herself off. \u201cYou have fudge, which is a bit boring, but the one that just killed me was that rather than cock, it was clock. I couldn\u2019t get through that scene. I got hysterical.\u201d Along with comedies such as The Letdown and Motherland, Breeders shows the unvarnished side of life with young kids.

      "body": "<p>A bigoted old bastard: that\u2019s how Letitia Clark thought of her dad, Tony, when she found out he had voted to leave. She worked in a restaurant, where many of her colleagues were EU migrants, and was dating an Italian. \u201cHe disappeared for a while,\u201d she says of her father. \u201cI think it was a wish to avoid conflict.\u201d</p> <p>The vote played a significant role in Letitia\u2019s decision to move with her then boyfriend to Sardinia, where she still lives and has written a cookbook, Bitter Honey, about Sardinian cuisine. She and her two brothers \u2013 a journalist in Cape Town, and a captain in the Royal Marines who travels all over the world \u2013 lead very different lives from Tony\u2019s in quiet, rural Devon.</p> <p>\u201cNow, he says he realises it wasn\u2019t a very informed decision, more of a gut instinct,\u201d says Letitia, 32. \u201cI think he also knows that all of us [siblings] have made a conscious effort to escape, and move away from England.\u201d</p> <p>Tony gets a good shoeing over Brexit whenever they see each other, most recently at Christmas. \u201cWe have so little time together as a family anyway, it seems a shame to focus on the things we don\u2019t agree on,\u201d Letitia says. Tony, 70, agrees: \u201cI would never actually fall out with family or friends about it. You shrug your shoulders and get on with it.\u201d He and his daughter share an inability to take themselves too seriously, and clearly love each other very much.</p> <p>We live in a divided country. The 2016 Brexit vote \u2013 and, to a degree, the general election last December \u2013 revealed a fissure of leave v remain, left v right, old v young, urban v provincial. This has manifested in politics and public life, but also crept into our relationships. The fallout for friendships, marriages and families has, for many people, been profound. In <a href=\"https://www.relate.org.uk/policy-campaigns/our-campaigns/way-we-are-now-2016\" title=\"\">a 2016 study</a>, one in five relationship support practitioners (19.4%) from Relate, Marriage Care and Relationships Scotland said clients had mentioned the decision to leave the European Union as an issue in their relationship.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I was being called an idiot, a racist, and accused of not knowing what I\u2019m talking about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet we all have to live together on these little islands, so how can we begin to find a way forward? What strategies are people using to address conflict with loved ones?</p> <p>Laughing about it has helped James, 32, from Maidstone, defuse conflicts that arose as a result of his leave vote. Most of his friends voted to remain. \u201cIt\u2019s usually in the pub. Some of them take it personally, like I\u2019ve attacked their sense of being, when I really haven\u2019t. I decided to vote that way because I didn\u2019t think there was any accountability in Europe,\u201d he says. He found social media especially hard. \u201cI was called an idiot, a racist, and accused of not knowing what I\u2019m talking about. I don\u2019t mind if you disagree with me, but it was the language used.\u201d</p> <p>Then, about a year ago, a girl he had been talking to on a dating app ghosted him because he had voted leave. \u201cAll my friends, even my remainer friends, found it hilarious. That sort of brought us together. You get some perspective, realise that politics isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all,\u201d he says. James says the election did momentarily reignite tensions. \u201cNow, when I go out with friends, we have a no-politics rule. It has got a lot better. They have been a lot less argumentative now that Brexit has happened.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia Whelan, 38, from London, has reached the \u201cresignation\u201d phase: \u201cI can\u2019t have the same argument over and over with people.\u201d Having studied in Germany and worked there for a decade, she was dismayed by the result and by the fact that her parents \u2013 who had lived in Spain for seven years \u2013 voted to leave. \u201cWhen I found out, I was very upset. I found it very difficult for that whole first year to talk about anything else, especially with my dad, who had told my mum how to vote.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e6c51af39939e25805f0a8c71bd3560d5dc0d3ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6c51af39939e25805f0a8c71bd3560d5dc0d3ea/416_1533_3706_4633/800.jpg\" alt=\"Letitia Clark and her father Tony pictured through a window with a bar of the wooden frame dividing them\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He disappeared for a while.

They first went on a date in 2017, but ended up screaming at each other about Brexit. \u201cI felt quite sad. I was still so angry and all I could see was that, if you voted for that, you must be terrible, your politics must be terrible, you must hate this country.

But it isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p> <p>Pete, 37, who is British and lives in Germany, wept at the Brexit result \u2013 voted for by both his parents and their respective partners. It sent him down a long and stressful path towards German citizenship. He became snappy and withdrawn with his mother. \u201cI resented her for what I saw as her supporting people who were working against my way of life, causing chaos for my friends and family, and stripping people in Britain and in the EU of important rights,\u201d he says. What helped was channelling his energy into remain causes and working on his own responses. \u201cI have made personal efforts to change my thinking, and I have the impression she has, too. I am lucky that both my parents are still here, and I want to have enjoyable times with them, and appreciate the good things about our relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Simon, 48, from Solihull, was the first in his family to go to university. He voted remain. He told me how his Brexit-voting father had called him a \u201cliberal elite\u201d and he had called his father \u201ca fucking stupid builder\u201d during years of beer-fuelled arguments in the pub. \u201cFor a while, I was using all the hard data. I\u2019d print out arguments with experts and statistics. He\u2019d look at them, but it took me years to realise that it wasn\u2019t the data that was going to change his mind. He hadn\u2019t used reason to get to that position; he just wanted out.\u201d</p> <p>What was a logical question to him, Simon realised, was an emotional one for his dad. \u201cIt became clear that we were on different wavelengths. If your criteria are completely different then you could be speaking a different language.\u201d But, Simon says, it would never have got to the point where father and son stopped speaking.</p> <p>When Simon wrote to me in January, his father was very ill; he died before the month was out. Despite their political differences, the men were close. \u201cAs I used to say, \u2018Dad, you are a complete arse but I love you.\u2019 Him being ill crystallised the whole thing: some things are more important than politics. Ultimately, this is just an argument in the pub \u2013 it\u2019s not going to change how we feel about each other.\u201d<br><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=It%E2%80%99s%20a%20family%20affair%3A%20how%20to%20mend%20bridges%20post-Brexit%2C%20by%20the%20experts&amp;description=&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"It\u2019s a family affair: how to mend bridges post-Brexit, by the experts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=Lifestyle&opinion-tint=false&title=It%E2%80%99s%20a%20family%20affair%3A%20how%20to%20mend%20bridges%20post-Brexit%2C%20by%20the%20experts&description=&link=false\">It\u2019s a family affair: how to mend bridges post-Brexit, by the experts</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>The philosopher: don\u2019t jump to conclusions</strong></h2> <p>We tend to make presumptions about the wider set of values other people hold on the basis of one or two that are salient.

      "bodyText": "A bigoted old bastard: that\u2019s how Letitia Clark thought of her dad, Tony, when she found out he had voted to leave. She worked in a restaurant, where many of her colleagues were EU migrants, and was dating an Italian. \u201cHe disappeared for a while,\u201d she says of her father. \u201cI think it was a wish to avoid conflict.\u201d The vote played a significant role in Letitia\u2019s decision to move with her then boyfriend to Sardinia, where she still lives and has written a cookbook, Bitter Honey, about Sardinian cuisine. She and her two brothers \u2013 a journalist in Cape Town, and a captain in the Royal Marines who travels all over the world \u2013 lead very different lives from Tony\u2019s in quiet, rural Devon. \u201cNow, he says he realises it wasn\u2019t a very informed decision, more of a gut instinct,\u201d says Letitia, 32. \u201cI think he also knows that all of us [siblings] have made a conscious effort to escape, and move away from England.\u201d Tony gets a good shoeing over Brexit whenever they see each other, most recently at Christmas. \u201cWe have so little time together as a family anyway, it seems a shame to focus on the things we don\u2019t agree on,\u201d Letitia says. Tony, 70, agrees: \u201cI would never actually fall out with family or friends about it. You shrug your shoulders and get on with it.\u201d He and his daughter share an inability to take themselves too seriously, and clearly love each other very much. We live in a divided country. The 2016 Brexit vote \u2013 and, to a degree, the general election last December \u2013 revealed a fissure of leave v remain, left v right, old v young, urban v provincial. This has manifested in politics and public life, but also crept into our relationships. The fallout for friendships, marriages and families has, for many people, been profound. In a 2016 study, one in five relationship support practitioners (19.4%) from Relate, Marriage Care and Relationships Scotland said clients had mentioned the decision to leave the European Union as an issue in their relationship. Yet we all have to live together on these little islands, so how can we begin to find a way forward? What strategies are people using to address conflict with loved ones? Laughing about it has helped James, 32, from Maidstone, defuse conflicts that arose as a result of his leave vote. Most of his friends voted to remain. \u201cIt\u2019s usually in the pub. Some of them take it personally, like I\u2019ve attacked their sense of being, when I really haven\u2019t. I decided to vote that way because I didn\u2019t think there was any accountability in Europe,\u201d he says. He found social media especially hard. \u201cI was called an idiot, a racist, and accused of not knowing what I\u2019m talking about. I don\u2019t mind if you disagree with me, but it was the language used.\u201d Then, about a year ago, a girl he had been talking to on a dating app ghosted him because he had voted leave. \u201cAll my friends, even my remainer friends, found it hilarious. That sort of brought us together. You get some perspective, realise that politics isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all,\u201d he says. James says the election did momentarily reignite tensions. \u201cNow, when I go out with friends, we have a no-politics rule. It has got a lot better. They have been a lot less argumentative now that Brexit has happened.\u201d Olivia Whelan, 38, from London, has reached the \u201cresignation\u201d phase: \u201cI can\u2019t have the same argument over and over with people.\u201d Having studied in Germany and worked there for a decade, she was dismayed by the result and by the fact that her parents \u2013 who had lived in Spain for seven years \u2013 voted to leave. \u201cWhen I found out, I was very upset. I found it very difficult for that whole first year to talk about anything else, especially with my dad, who had told my mum how to vote.\u201d But she has come to understand her parents\u2019 reasons for voting leave. \u201cThey really did think there would be that \u00a3350m a week for the NHS.\u201d She is now, \u201camazingly\u201d, dating a man who voted leave, which she says would have been unthinkable 18 months ago. They first went on a date in 2017, but ended up screaming at each other about Brexit. \u201cI felt quite sad. I was still so angry and all I could see was that, if you voted for that, you must be terrible, your politics must be terrible, you must hate this country. I couldn\u2019t see past it at all.\u201d Has Olivia been through a grieving process of sorts, and come out the other side? \u201cYes, life has to go on. We have to find a way to live together after this.\u201d Whether the harmony with her parents and her partner will continue, she doesn\u2019t know. It depends what happens politically. \u201cIt\u2019s calm at the moment, but if things get hairy again, I\u2019m going to find it quite difficult.\u201d Alison, 75, a British citizen who lives in Portugal, doesn\u2019t know anyone else in her community of expats who voted to leave and, while her husband didn\u2019t vote, he was pro-remain. \u201cI was subjected to a constant barrage of criticism,\u201d she says. \u201cI frequently felt bullied, sidelined and isolated. I love Europe. I\u2019ve always travelled in Europe. It\u2019s the EU I don\u2019t like.\u201d Things have calmed down a little since the election, but it is clear from talking to Alison that she is still hurt. \u201cI can stand up for myself and make my reasons known. But if you\u2019re totally alone in that argument with no support from anybody else, it\u2019s intimidating.\u201d What about her husband? \u201cWe argue every time we watch the news,\u201d she sighs. \u201cYou can\u2019t divorce your husband because of different political views. We\u2019re fine.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound fine \u2013 how does she think things will progress? \u201cI\u2019m not sure. We\u2019re in a bit of a limbo at the moment.

It is time to reimagine museums as sites of conscience \u2013 unique public spaces for understanding, remembering and addressing the legacies of empire and enduring cultural infrastructure of \u201crace science\u201d \u2013 for the restitution of knowledge and memory as well as of property.</p> <p>The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/19/sabisky-row-dominic-cummings-criticised-over-designer-babies-post\" title=\"\">revival</a> of eugenics at the heart of Britain\u2019s political conversation is a wake-up call.

Macron\u2019s report is now leading to action. Last November, the sabre of Omar Saidou Tall, seized as a trophy of war in 1893, was returned from Paris to Dakar. New legislation to make this return permanent, along with the return to Benin of 26 statues looted by Col Alfred Dodds during the sacking of the royal palace of Abomey in 1892, is expected soon. In Germany too, returns of human remains and cultural property \u2013 including the Stone Cross of Cape Cross and the Witbooi Bible taken during the Ovaherero and Nama genocide of 1904-8, when some 100,000 people were slaughtered \u2013 are taking place from Berlin and Stuttgart to Namibia. And the inauguration of a new national museum of the Democratic Republic of Congo in Kinshasa last November is even raising the question of restitutions from Tervuren. New restitution procedures are being developed across Europe from the Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen in the Netherlands to Arts Council England. Times are changing for Europe\u2019s \u201cworld culture\u201d museums. How can they participate in this global present, rather than just representing some old colonial vision? We must let go of our old obsessions with cultural ownership and the spectre of \u201cempty galleries\u201d (a common refrain from those who defend the status quo and envisage western museums stripped of their collections if restitution requests are granted). It is time to reimagine museums as sites of conscience \u2013 unique public spaces for understanding, remembering and addressing the legacies of empire and enduring cultural infrastructure of \u201crace science\u201d \u2013 for the restitution of knowledge and memory as well as of property. The recent revival of eugenics at the heart of Britain\u2019s political conversation is a wake-up call. Far from just places for retelling the history of empire through world culture collections, in the old contemplative mode, museums are unfinished projects, and crucial resources to be rethought and repurposed for the wider, urgent European task of understanding and facing up to the violence and loss wrought by colonialism. \u2022 Dan Hicks is professor of contemporary archeology at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming The Brutish Museums",

      "body": "<p>The most keenly anticipated game of the Serie A season will play to an empty stadium on Sunday. It will be a relief to see it played at all. Juventus were originally supposed to host Internazionale on 1 March, before Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak tipped the country\u2019s top division into a timetabling meltdown.</p> <p>On 27 February, the league\u2019s governing body officially confirmed that the game was going ahead as scheduled but behind closed doors \u2013 in line with a government ban on mass public gatherings in several northern regions of Italy. Two days later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/juventus-inter-milan-serie-a-postponed-coronavirus\">the decision was reversed</a>. Juventus v Inter was postponed, as were five other Serie A games: all at less than 36 hours\u2019 notice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/mar/02/serie-a-anger-grows-postponements-pile-up-coronavirus\">Serie A undercard stars amid fixture conflict, confusion and coronavirus | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inter fans protested outside the league\u2019s offices, accusing organisers of caving to pressure from Juventus. The president of Serie A\u2019s governing body, Paolo dal Pino, pointed a finger back at their club for resisting an attempt to move the game back by one day, and playing it after the government decree was supposed to lapse. Inter\u2019s president, Steven Zhang, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenzhang91_/status/1234709011397795847\">called Dal Pino a \u201cclown\u201d.</a></p> <p>Zhang was incredulous that considerations of competitive advantage and league prestige were being prioritised over public health. Dal Pino had spoken of his duty to represent Serie A\u2019s greater interests for a game that would be broadcast to more than 200 countries. Only after a fresh government intervention, extending the ban on mass gatherings to cover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/italys-serie-a-considering-matches-behind-closed-doors-due-to-coronavirus\">the whole country until 3 April</a>, were all parties able to agree on the best way to proceed.</p> <p>Now there was no choice but to get on with it. The top-flight calendar was already at breaking point after four games were postponed on the weekend of 21-22 February as well.

      "bodyText": "The most keenly anticipated game of the Serie A season will play to an empty stadium on Sunday. It will be a relief to see it played at all. Juventus were originally supposed to host Internazionale on 1 March, before Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak tipped the country\u2019s top division into a timetabling meltdown. On 27 February, the league\u2019s governing body officially confirmed that the game was going ahead as scheduled but behind closed doors \u2013 in line with a government ban on mass public gatherings in several northern regions of Italy. Two days later, the decision was reversed. Juventus v Inter was postponed, as were five other Serie A games: all at less than 36 hours\u2019 notice. Inter fans protested outside the league\u2019s offices, accusing organisers of caving to pressure from Juventus. The president of Serie A\u2019s governing body, Paolo dal Pino, pointed a finger back at their club for resisting an attempt to move the game back by one day, and playing it after the government decree was supposed to lapse. Inter\u2019s president, Steven Zhang, called Dal Pino a \u201cclown\u201d. Zhang was incredulous that considerations of competitive advantage and league prestige were being prioritised over public health. Dal Pino had spoken of his duty to represent Serie A\u2019s greater interests for a game that would be broadcast to more than 200 countries. Only after a fresh government intervention, extending the ban on mass gatherings to cover the whole country until 3 April, were all parties able to agree on the best way to proceed. Now there was no choice but to get on with it. The top-flight calendar was already at breaking point after four games were postponed on the weekend of 21-22 February as well. If Inter reach the finals of the Coppa Italia and Europa League, there would not be enough open dates to squeeze all of their Serie A games in before the scheduled end of this campaign. A decision was taken to play all of last week\u2019s fixtures this Sunday, allowing teams who missed games to at least partially catch up. A sensible step, if not a timely one. Official confirmation of this arrangement did not arrive until Thursday afternoon. That left three days for Juventus and Inter to prepare for a match that may define their seasons. The \u201cDerby d\u2019Italia\u201d will always have inherent prestige, but this is the first time they have gone head-to-head with both clubs as legitimate title contenders in almost two decades. Lazio sit top of Serie A with 62 points from 26 games, but Juventus, on 60, will leapfrog them if they win. Inter, with 54 points from 24 games, need a result to avoid getting cut adrift. Juventus were dismal in their most recent outing, a 1-0 defeat away to Lyon in the Champions League on 26 February which marked the lowest point of Maurizio Sarri\u2019s first season. A team which spent more than \u20ac200m to acquire Cristiano Ronaldo and Matthijs De Ligt was not supposed to lose meekly to opponents who sit fifth in Ligue 1.

Yet they have often disappointed in the biggest games, blowing leads away to Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League and losing to Lazio in their last league outing.

Yes. It is a self inflicted wound. But your quality of journalism makes me believe there is hope for your lovely country and most especially for the next generation. Somehow the Guardian enables me to Keep Calm and Carry On.<br><strong>Wendy Young</strong></p> <p>As a graduate in European Studies in the 1980s, who benefited from partnerships between UK, French and German universities that allowed students to study abroad for an academic year, who has since lived in Asia for many years before returning to live in the UK and voting Remain, I am proud to call myself European as well as being a citizen of the world. The last few years have been challenging. It feels good to know that my favourite newspaper will continue to keep me connected to Europe. Thank you. <br><strong>Nicola Tanner</strong></p> <p>Thanks to the Guardian, for your renovated stance towards Europe, as for your engagement for a journalism without fear and without borders. I\u2019m Italian, I live in Edinburgh and work in Italy: since Nov. 2017, I\u2019m also British. In such a multiple \u2013 and sadly divided \u2013 identity, I\u2019m proud of being a Guardian reader. <br><strong>Isabella Lazzarini</strong></p> <p>Today I am simply writing to you to say a heartfelt thank-you for your commitment to Europe and the launch of the dedicated Europe section. The Guardian is my first port of call every morning and I am glad that I can support the Guardian\u2019s free and impartial journalism through my modest partner/membership fee.<br><strong>Andrew Craston</strong></p> <p>Just to say the new This is Europe section is totally brilliant; we\u2019ve needed this for years! As a professor of modern languages at Birmingham, I regularly work with students and colleagues to explore European perspectives, and this has just made our lives a whole lot easier. Thank you.<br><strong>Helen Abbott</strong></p> <p>I always support your free, independent journalism and read your papers which give me the opportunity to keep abreast of the times with a language full of historical background and of a deep sense of humanity. <br><strong>Anna Giordano</strong> </p> <p>I am French and a daily reader of the Guardian. I was terribly upset by Brexit. I am afraid it will loosen relations with many British people despite the fact they were \u201cremainers\u201d. Your decision to be a European news organisation will greatly help to keep these relations alive.<br><strong>Jacques Roos</strong></p> <p>I am delighted that you have to decided to continue and deepen your coverage of Europe. I am an Irish citizen, and I often feel the coverage of European affairs here is not as good as it should be, so I am looking forward to your weekly newsletter \u2018This is Europe\u2019.<br><strong>Edmond Gibbons</strong></p> <p>Your words are very much appreciated as were Katharine Viner\u2019s. I saw something, clicked and followed, read her editorial, joined. There was no question about thinking about it. This decision by the Guardian to have this new site was an inspired moment for me; the choice between yes and yes.<br><strong>Brian Milne<br></strong><br></p> <p>As a Europe-based supporter of the Guardian, who is highly appreciative of, if not reliant upon, the organisation\u2019s brave journalism in this age of misinformation, I am overjoyed to read of the decision to uphold a European orientation.<br><strong>Peter Symmons</strong><br><br></p> <p>The article by Katharine Viner in yesterday\u2019s paper made me cheer out loud (very loudly)! I also wept and so I recognise I haven\u2019t yet worked through all the stages of grief at leaving the EU!<br><strong>Ellen Wallace</strong><br><br></p> <p>Well done \u2013 you are a constant inspiration to me (for about 50 years!). Thank you.<br><strong>Peter Wishart</strong></p> <p>Delighted to hear from you and your decision to keep a focus on European events. You have my full support. A very happy member.<strong><br>Lesley Siddall<br></strong><br>This is a simple message to tell you how much I value your reporting on European issues. I\u2019m particularly interested in what the rest of Europe is doing about the climate emergency, pollution and how transport, public or private cars, is being incentivised to make a positive impact.<br><strong>Mike Mellor</strong></p> <p>I just wanted to agree totally with your three principal reasons for deepening your commitment to Europe. I think that there are lots of opportunities to learn from our near neighbours, such as:</p> <ul> <li><p>Modern architecture and the public realm \u2013 numerous examples throughout Europe.</p></li> <li><p>Cycling infrastructure and hydro-engineering in the Netherlands.</p></li> <li><p>Regional banks supporting business in Germany.<br><strong>Eric Kelsall</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Thanks so much for Katharine Viner\u2019s inspiring message, and the news that the Guardian is going further than just \u2018not turning its back\u2019 on the rest of Europe. The European idea in the UK can and should survive the setback that Brexit represents, and open-minded journalism of the sort announced here will help considerably. As a linguist and a convinced Europhile over decades, I felt supported and heartened by what I read.<br><strong>Niall Hoskin</strong></p> <p><br>Having moved with my French wife in August last year to escape the disaster that is Brexit, we, as Guardian members, are very heartened by your decision to align and commit yourself to Europe as we have. We look forward to your unsurpassed coverage and more excellent comments and articles, from Rafael Behr, John Crace and Marina Hyde et al and give our wholehearted support to you for our very uncertain future.<br><strong>Vance &amp; V\u00e9ronique Whittall</strong></p> <p><br>Don\u2019t give up.

How welcome it is to see Katharine Viner\u2019s defiant leader. As Keats said on first looking into Chapman\u2019s Homer: \u201cThen felt I like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken ...\u201d etc etc. Denis Loretto I am a Canadian who has followed Brexit with a broken heart. Yes. It is a self inflicted wound. But your quality of journalism makes me believe there is hope for your lovely country and most especially for the next generation. Somehow the Guardian enables me to Keep Calm and Carry On. Wendy Young As a graduate in European Studies in the 1980s, who benefited from partnerships between UK, French and German universities that allowed students to study abroad for an academic year, who has since lived in Asia for many years before returning to live in the UK and voting Remain, I am proud to call myself European as well as being a citizen of the world. The last few years have been challenging. It feels good to know that my favourite newspaper will continue to keep me connected to Europe. Thank you. Nicola Tanner Thanks to the Guardian, for your renovated stance towards Europe, as for your engagement for a journalism without fear and without borders. I\u2019m Italian, I live in Edinburgh and work in Italy: since Nov. 2017, I\u2019m also British. In such a multiple \u2013 and sadly divided \u2013 identity, I\u2019m proud of being a Guardian reader. Isabella Lazzarini Today I am simply writing to you to say a heartfelt thank-you for your commitment to Europe and the launch of the dedicated Europe section. The Guardian is my first port of call every morning and I am glad that I can support the Guardian\u2019s free and impartial journalism through my modest partner/membership fee. Andrew Craston Just to say the new This is Europe section is totally brilliant; we\u2019ve needed this for years! As a professor of modern languages at Birmingham, I regularly work with students and colleagues to explore European perspectives, and this has just made our lives a whole lot easier. Thank you. Helen Abbott I always support your free, independent journalism and read your papers which give me the opportunity to keep abreast of the times with a language full of historical background and of a deep sense of humanity. Anna Giordano I am French and a daily reader of the Guardian. I was terribly upset by Brexit. I am afraid it will loosen relations with many British people despite the fact they were \u201cremainers\u201d. Your decision to be a European news organisation will greatly help to keep these relations alive. Jacques Roos I am delighted that you have to decided to continue and deepen your coverage of Europe. I am an Irish citizen, and I often feel the coverage of European affairs here is not as good as it should be, so I am looking forward to your weekly newsletter \u2018This is Europe\u2019. Edmond Gibbons Your words are very much appreciated as were Katharine Viner\u2019s. I saw something, clicked and followed, read her editorial, joined. There was no question about thinking about it. This decision by the Guardian to have this new site was an inspired moment for me; the choice between yes and yes. Brian Milne As a Europe-based supporter of the Guardian, who is highly appreciative of, if not reliant upon, the organisation\u2019s brave journalism in this age of misinformation, I am overjoyed to read of the decision to uphold a European orientation. Peter Symmons The article by Katharine Viner in yesterday\u2019s paper made me cheer out loud (very loudly)! I also wept and so I recognise I haven\u2019t yet worked through all the stages of grief at leaving the EU! Ellen Wallace Well done \u2013 you are a constant inspiration to me (for about 50 years!). Thank you. Peter Wishart Delighted to hear from you and your decision to keep a focus on European events. You have my full support. A very happy member. Lesley Siddall This is a simple message to tell you how much I value your reporting on European issues. I\u2019m particularly interested in what the rest of Europe is doing about the climate emergency, pollution and how transport, public or private cars, is being incentivised to make a positive impact. Mike Mellor I just wanted to agree totally with your three principal reasons for deepening your commitment to Europe. I think that there are lots of opportunities to learn from our near neighbours, such as: Modern architecture and the public realm \u2013 numerous examples throughout Europe. Cycling infrastructure and hydro-engineering in the Netherlands. Regional banks supporting business in Germany. Eric Kelsall Thanks so much for Katharine Viner\u2019s inspiring message, and the news that the Guardian is going further than just \u2018not turning its back\u2019 on the rest of Europe. The European idea in the UK can and should survive the setback that Brexit represents, and open-minded journalism of the sort announced here will help considerably. As a linguist and a convinced Europhile over decades, I felt supported and heartened by what I read. Niall Hoskin Having moved with my French wife in August last year to escape the disaster that is Brexit, we, as Guardian members, are very heartened by your decision to align and commit yourself to Europe as we have. We look forward to your unsurpassed coverage and more excellent comments and articles, from Rafael Behr, John Crace and Marina Hyde et al and give our wholehearted support to you for our very uncertain future. Vance &amp; V\u00e9ronique Whittall Don\u2019t give up. You\u2019ll be well ahead of the pack when we apply to go back in. Michael Rosenberg",

      "bodyText": "Dalilah Loza is 15 and dreams of being an orthodontist, or an economist \u2013 perhaps even a photographer. But most of all she wants to be the voice of her mother. \u201cI\u2019m the only one who can speak for her now. I\u2019m her daughter. I\u2019m the only one who really cares,\u201d said the teenager, whose 33-year-old mother was murdered at their home in Tijuana last September in front of Dalilah and her baby brother. Before last month Dalilah had never taken part in a political protest. But when Mexican feminists hit the streets on Valentine\u2019s Day to denounce their country\u2019s worsening femicide crisis, she saw a chance to ensure her mother\u2019s life and death were remembered. Flanked by scores of mostly young female demonstrators, Dalilah marched on the attorney general\u2019s office clutching a homemade placard with her portrait and the message: \u201cI miss you, mummy\u201d. \u201cMy mum was the best mum in the world,\u201d she remembered, her face lighting up. \u201cYou could tell her anything you liked and she\u2019d never tell anyone. She was literally my best friend.\u201d Dalilah\u2019s mother, Nery Rodei Pelayo Ram\u00edrez, was stabbed to death by her boyfriend on 16 September \u2013 one of nearly 4,000 Mexican women killed in 2019. And with the violence still rising, a new generation of Mexican feminists \u2013 whose number Dalilah recently joined \u2013 are mobilizing with increasingly radical tactics in the hope of forcing their government to act. \u201cWe won\u2019t just sit around quietly waiting for another woman to be murdered or for another girl to be raped,\u201d said Carolina Barrales, one of the founders of Circulo Violeta (Violet Circle), the Tijuana-based feminist collective that helped organize the 14 February protest there. Barrales said her group wholeheartedly backed direct action as a means of halting gender violence. In the country\u2019s capital, masked feminists clashed with police and covered the presidential palace with blood-red paint and graffiti denouncing the president\u2019s failure to protect Mexico\u2019s women. In Tijuana, activists in balaclavas attempted to close the busiest border crossing on earth, between Mexico and the United States. \u201cIn Circulo Violeta, we believe in smashing whatever needs to be smashed, shouting whatever you need to shout, doing whatever you need to do,\u201d said the 33-year-old mother of one. \u201cWe aren\u2019t vandals \u2026 but we do support this form of protest. It\u2019s our last resort \u2013 and the last resort that they have left us \u2026 We shout and shout and nothing happens\u201d. This weekend activists will launch their latest acts of dissent: a nationwide rally on Sunday and a potentially historic 24-hour women\u2019s strike on Monday in which upwards of 20 million Mexican women are expected to take part by staying at home. \u201cI think it will be a really important moment to show our muscles,\u201d said Soraya V\u00e1zquez, a human rights lawyer who has been part of Tijuana\u2019s feminist movement since the 1980s and called the current mobilization unprecedented in the city\u2019s history. Mexico\u2019s feminist revolt has been gathering steam since last summer when demonstrators poured onto the streets for what was dubbed the \u201crevoluci\u00f3n diamantina\u201d (glitter revolution). But the current mutiny began in February with a trio of macabre, headline-grabbing femicides that shocked the nation and highlighted the government\u2019s failure to protect women. First came the killing of 25-year-old Ingrid Escamilla on 9 February. She was stabbed and skinned by her partner before having a picture of her corpse splashed onto a local tabloid\u2019s front page. Two days later a seven-year-old girl, F\u00e1tima Cecilia Aldrighetti Ant\u00f3n, was abducted and murdered in Mexico City, adding to the outcry. In Tijuana, meanwhile, all eyes were on a third crime: the murder of Marbella Valdez Villarreal, a 20-year-old student whose body was found on a rubbish dump on 8 February. Photographs subsequently emerged showing Valdez\u2019s suspected killer attending her funeral and placing flowers on her coffin. \u201cFor me it was like an earthquake \u2013 a jolt,\u201d said Barrales. \u201cLots of young women saw themselves in her. They saw Marbella\u2019s story as their own \u2026 If it could happen to her, it could happen to any of them.\u201d Mexico\u2019s femicide crisis did not begin with the presidency of its current leader, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a leftwing populist who took office in December 2018 and is best known as Amlo. But the number of killings is rising. Last year 1,006 of 3,825 murders were officially classified as femicides \u2013 women or girls killed because of their gender. That compared to 426 in 2015, when authorities began counting such crimes. And Amlo\u2019s response to the recent killings has infuriated and alienated women\u2019s rights activists, many of whom voted for him in 2018 believing a progressive leader would do more for their cause. In recent weeks Amlo has maligned next Monday\u2019s strike as part of a \u201cdark forces\u201d conspiracy cooked up by conservative agitators. On another occasion he appeared to wash his hands of the femicide crisis, blaming it on the \u201cneoliberal\u201d policies of previous governments. \u201cI\u2019m not burying my head in the sand,\u201d Amlo insisted, although activists claim he is doing just that. Barrales said she had voted for Amlo but had grown increasingly disillusioned as he slashed funding for programs created to support women, including daycare and shelters. With his recent declarations, her patience had run out: \u201cTo be honest, I try to avoid watching the stupidities that this man comes out with. He just don\u2019t care about the pain of women.\u201d Barrales remembered being convinced by Amlo\u2019s pledges to govern for the people and the poor. \u201cBut now we see clearly what we truly mean to him \u2013 that we mean absolutely nothing \u2026 My opinion of him is that he\u2019s the most cynical and poisonous president we\u2019ve ever had, including Pe\u00f1a Nieto,\u201d she added, referring to Amlo\u2019s profoundly unpopular predecessor. As the political battle rages, Dalilah and her family are still grappling with grief. Her grandmother, Elvia Pelayo Guti\u00e9rrez, recalled receiving a phone call from her terror-stricken granddaughter on the afternoon her mother was killed. \u201cPlease come!\u201d Dalilah begged. \u201cI\u2019ll explain when you get here.\u201d When Pelayo arrived, she found the house surrounded by police and her son\u2019s ex-wife \u2013 who had moved to Tijuana nearly 20 years ago in search of a better life \u2013 splayed out inside on a bed. She declined to enter. \u201cI wanted to remember her as she was,\u201d said Pelayo, who said she also believed the government was failing in its duty to protect Mexican women. Six months after Nery\u2019s murder, the main suspect has yet to be arrested, let alone put on trial for the crime. Only 10% of such crimes ever lead to a conviction. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the authorities are doing anything,\u201d Pelayo said. At 61, it now falls to her to raise her two grandchildren, Dalilah and her four-year-old brother. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s young feminists \u2013 among them Dalilah \u2013 are gearing up for a fight. \u201cThis is our feminist spring here in Tijuana \u2026 and we won\u2019t stop until we get justice,\u201d Barrales vowed. \u201cThis has only just begun.\u201d Additional reporting by Jordi Lebrija",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m from Denmark, but have lived in the UK for almost eight years. I\u2019d love to stay. Fingers crossed. I call both countries home, but still find myself caught between the two because while there are Briticisms I have embraced, there are other things I can\u2019t. For as long as there is an ocean between us, or two hours on a low-budget aeroplane, there will always be some fundamental differences between our two kingdoms. Here are my five biggest.</p> <p><strong>You </strong><strong>don\u2019t get to the point</strong><br>The Danes are direct. If you want to send a professional email to someone, asking for some files, regardless of how little you know them, your email will read: \u201cHey, send the files.\u201d That\u2019s it. It took me a while to learn the British way of making every request sound as if you are asking a person for their first-born\u2019s hand in marriage. \u201cDearest Cliff, I hope you are well. I do apologise for getting in touch on this godless Tuesday, but I hope you might consider even the slightest possibility of perhaps finding the time\u2026\u201d And so on. My emails now take 20 times longer to write. Often, I forget the pleasantries and simply send a Danish-style four-word message. Then I am filled with British shame. For this reason, I have considered adding an email signature that reads: \u201cI\u2019m not rude, I\u2019m Danish.\u201d</p> <p><strong>You are filthy as hell, but only secretly</strong><br>Put on any Danish film and you will see genitals. I am not talking about porn (which Denmark was the first country in the world to legalise, in 1967). I\u2019m talking regular prime-time television and mainstream movies. In the opening scene of Nattevagten, a 1994 thriller, we see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/29/nikolaj-coster-waldau-jamie-lannister-tina-fey-louis-ck\" title=\"n\">Nikolaj Coster-Waldau</a>\u2019s flaccid penis swinging back and forth as he gets out of bed. In the incredibly funny sitcom Ditte &amp; Louise (2015-2016), a scene where Ditte is having wild sex up against a desk cuts with another in which Louise is masturbating furiously while drinking wine. Again, prime time. School sex education was fairly straightforward. Then again, everything in Danish schools seems more straightforward. We have mostly mixed-sex schools; we do not wear uniforms; and we call our teachers by their first names. Being taught about penises by our teacher, Tina, was great. I imagine being taught about penises by Miss Hansen when you are a creepy suit-wearing child is a lot scarier.</p> <p>I worked in a sex shop in Denmark when I was 16, which sold porn. It was my job to pack the parcels and send them out. I can reveal that the most hardcore porn was ordered by people in the UK. You\u2019re all filthy as hell, so start standing by it, OK?</p> <p><strong>You do not need a hygge blanket</strong><br>While I\u2019m here, I\u2019d like to blow the whistle on hygge. You must have heard the word a million times, because I\u2019ve seen it a million times in bookshops all over the UK: How To Hygge The Danish Way, Have A Hygge, and other horrible misuses of my language. Hygge is a common word in Denmark. Instead of \u201cTake care!\u201d we might say \u201cHygge!\u201d Instead of \u201cThis is nice!\u201d, we might say \u201cThis is hyggeligt\u201d. Instead of \u201cAh, OK\u201d we might say \u201cHyggeligt.\u201d It covers almost anything, and means cosy or chill. It\u2019s not <em>a Danish activity</em>. You guys hygge all the time. You go to the pub, you watch TV, you drink tea to an almost psychopathic degree. The difference is, in Denmark there aren\u2019t \u00a335 books on how to hygge. You cannot (and need not) buy a \u00a350 hygge-blanket. We don\u2019t have hygge-candles because hygge doesn\u2019t have a smell. If Danes are more relaxed than Brits, it\u2019s to do with our excellent infrastructure, our social security safety net, the fact that we are paid a salary to attend university and have 52 weeks of parental leave \u2013 all because we happily pay about 50% in taxes.

But I try not to show it,\u201d she said. \u201cI pray for the people to get better\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a little nervous,\u201d said Martin Miller, a 40-year resident of Riverderdale. \u201cI have to go downtown a few times a week,\u201d he said. \u201cSubways are crowded \u2013 and you never know who you\u2019re sitting next to.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know who\u2019s sick,\u201d said Miller, 89. In a pharmacy near SAR\u2019s high school campus, a sign advises \u201cAll masks and Purell out of stock.\u201d Customers could be overheard comparing opinions on coronavirus. \u201cI have a case over there \u2026 in New Jersey,\u201d said one man. \u201cI think the hysteria\u2019s worse than the virus,\u201d said another. Back at Gruenebaum\u2019s, the mother said there were efforts to restore normalcy despite coronavirus concerns. Her children were attending class via video, she said. SAR children were using video chat to share their Purim holiday costumes with one another. She wouldn\u2019t skip out on attending an upcoming Purim prayer reading, but might do so via Skype rather than in person. \u201cSo, you\u2019re spending shabbos at home?\u201d Banin asked, half-joking. \u201cLocked up,\u201d the mother said with resignation.",

For a small company, having an unproductive member of staff sitting at home doing nothing on full pay will be a huge burden.\u201d</p> <p>This week the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said guidance has been sent to UK employers telling them staff who are asked to self-isolate should be entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP). He said medical advice on self-isolation should be considered \u201csickness for employment purposes\u201d. <strong>MB</strong></p> <h2><strong>How much will I get under statutory sick pay?</strong></h2> <p>All employed staff who earn at least \u00a3118 a week qualify for statutory sick pay, or whatever your employment contract may provide over and above that. Most employers will allow a certain number of days a year on full pay. After that, employees are entitled to statutory sick pay of \u00a394.25 per week, which will be paid for up to 28 weeks. Until now it has been paid from the fourth day of sickness. A doctor\u2019s note may not be necessary, with employees able to self-certify with symptoms of flu without seeing a doctor, says Evans. Emergency legislation is being rushed through to allow sick pay to start from the first day off instead of the fourth, so claimants should receive it for the entire period they are off work.</p> <p>Trade unions have warned that up to 2 million workers do not earn enough to qualify for SSP, and could lose out if the virus becomes mainstream in the workplace. The government has said up to 20% of the workforce could be off sick during the peak of an epidemic. <strong>MB</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e99ab4d4ae09f04f2cff54535c05d42d2815d60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e99ab4d4ae09f04f2cff54535c05d42d2815d60/0_130_6484_3891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"toddlers girls playing at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If the children are sent home from school or nursery, what are my rights?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oksana Kuzmina/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>My children have been sent home from school to self-isolate.

The Department for Work and Pensions has confirmed that people who are prevented from working because of a risk to public health are able to claim universal credit. They may also be entitled to contributory employment and support allowance, which helps with living costs for people who cannot work because of a health condition. Universal credit is paid monthly in arrears, so you will have to wait one calendar month from the date you submitted your application before your first payment is made.

She\u2019d been living in hostels since she moved away from her parents a few years earlier, so this was the first room of her own. She found in the corner studio in Lyon Street, with its light-filled bay windows and golden oak floors, the beginnings of an adult identity. She filled the space with things collected on walks \u2013 lichen-covered twigs, birds\u2019 nests, bones \u2013 and with old furniture and books. She didn\u2019t yet know that she was a feminist or a writer but she knew that she was a reader and that she was outraged by the expectations of the men around her, whether it was the male poets seeking a muse or the men who followed her in the street, making her panic that she could end up as one of the women she read about in news reports: \u201cbeatnik girl slain by sailor looking for love\u201d.</p> <p><em>Recollections of My Non-Existence</em> announces itself as a memoir that will reveal how this skinny, friendless girl found her voice and her place in the world. There\u2019s a lot of first person writing across Solnit\u2019s books. She has always used her own experience, describing herself walking across cities and deserts, or evading the violence or speechifying of men. And her take on culture is original enough that it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if her take on memoir was original too. But this book feels a little thin, because she\u2019s not an introspective writer. She\u2019s not curious about the relationship between thoughts and feelings or about her own ambivalence or contradictions. There is not here the plunge inwards, the giddying rush of embodied thinking, that we get in, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review\" title=\"\">Maggie Nelson\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review\" title=\"\">The Argonauts</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review\" title=\"\">.</a></p> <p>Solnit\u2019s title is in part an acknowledgement of this, and some of the book\u2019s most striking passages are about non-existence. \u201cTo be a young woman is to face your own annihilation in innumerable ways,\u201d she writes at the start, \u201cor to flee it or the knowledge of it, or all these things at once.\u201d There\u2019s a personal point here. She suggests that, partly because of her violent father, she became \u201cexpert at fading and slipping and sneaking away \u2026 dodging unwanted hugs and kisses and hands \u2026 at the art of non-existence, since existence was so perilous\u201d. She associates this, intriguingly, with her love of reading, suggesting that when she read, she \u201cceased to be myself, and this non-existence I pursued and devoured like a drug\u201d. And she describes how this desire to escape coexisted with fantasies of daring combat and a preoccupation with armour. As always with Solnit, though, this becomes part of a larger political point, because she thinks, rightly, that though male violence affected her \u201cin profoundly personal ways\u201d the cure wasn\u2019t a personal one but rather the public sea-change brought about by feminism. This may be true, but it doesn\u2019t tell us much about Solnit. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>'I wanted to trace the lost patterns that came before the world was broken'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the absence of introspection or of a detailed account of her early life, Solnit tells the story of male violence. This is most powerful when it\u2019s centred on her own youthful experiences. There\u2019s a frightening passage where she describes walking home late at night after a party followed by a large man: \u201cHis shadow and mine swelled and shrank from streetlight to streetlight, and cars passed by and their headlights made all the shadows swirl and vanish.\u201d This scene, together with the early accounts of friend-making and city life, reminded me of Siri Hustvedt\u2019s recent autofictional novel <em>Memories of the Future</em>, which describes Hustvedt\u2019s move to her first flat in New York in 1978. A striking amount of the material is similar, from the shabby flats in run-down neighbourhoods to the in-jokes with friends and the early attempts at writing. In both cases, there\u2019s a feeling of being silenced by men (\u201cover and over, I have spoken and not been heard\u201d, Hustvedt writes) and in both cases there\u2019s a reflective curiosity about the relationship between the older narrator and the recollected girl. Here\u2019s Hustvedt: \u201cI hover above the self that met and then wrote about Wanda. I am somewhere near the cracked ceiling of the shabby, nearly empty apartment.\u201d And here\u2019s Solnit: \u201cthat long-ago girl was not exactly me, not like me at all in crucial ways, but me anyway, an awkward misfit, a daydreamer, a restless wanderer.\u201d</p> <p>The comparison helps to clarify why Solnit\u2019s book feels a little insubstantial. In Hustvedt\u2019s, there\u2019s not all that much introspection, but there\u2019s a willingness to dwell with the flat itself, to turn it into the setting of a kind of Shandean play, where the furniture, the neighbours and the visiting friends and boyfriends come alive. This makes for a more satisfyingly abundant book and allows the violent scenes (\u201ca girl who comes with me leaves with me\u201d, her near-rapist tells her) to provoke a more lived shock in the reader.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>She\u2019s brilliant on art, appreciating male artists, and especially the gay men who helped her interrogate gender norms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Solnit\u2019s book has some great moments of observation and some very fine writing. Fans will be pleased with her defence of her own meandering voice against the Hemingwayesque terseness she was taught at journalism school: \u201cI wanted to trace the lost patterns that came before the world was broken and find the new ones we could make out of the shards.\u201d There\u2019s a compelling passage on penetration, where she suggests that men who see sexual penetration as a way of gaining power over women and making themselves invulnerable would do well to remember that \u201ceveryone is interdependent. Everyone is vulnerable. Everyone is penetrable, and everyone is penetrated incessantly by the vibrations of sound travelling into the inner ear.\u201d</p> <p>As always, she\u2019s brilliant on art, appreciating male artists, and especially the gay men who helped her interrogate gender norms and find a voice, at the same time as seeing the sexism of the Beat poets and artists (\u201chow do you make art when the art that\u2019s all around you keeps telling you to shut up and do the dishes?\u201d), among others. There is some terrific social description of the streets surrounding her Lyon Street flat, filled with places of worship, with shops doubling as museums (there\u2019s a dry cleaner with a display of antique irons) and bordered by a 19th-century cemetery district not long cleared of its dead. With a writer of this stature, there\u2019s a value, too, in the signposting of her career.

      "bodyText": "One Sunday in 1980, the 19-year-old Rebecca Solnit went to see the studio flat in San Francisco that would be her home for the next 26 years. She\u2019d been living in hostels since she moved away from her parents a few years earlier, so this was the first room of her own. She found in the corner studio in Lyon Street, with its light-filled bay windows and golden oak floors, the beginnings of an adult identity. She filled the space with things collected on walks \u2013 lichen-covered twigs, birds\u2019 nests, bones \u2013 and with old furniture and books. She didn\u2019t yet know that she was a feminist or a writer but she knew that she was a reader and that she was outraged by the expectations of the men around her, whether it was the male poets seeking a muse or the men who followed her in the street, making her panic that she could end up as one of the women she read about in news reports: \u201cbeatnik girl slain by sailor looking for love\u201d. Recollections of My Non-Existence announces itself as a memoir that will reveal how this skinny, friendless girl found her voice and her place in the world. There\u2019s a lot of first person writing across Solnit\u2019s books. She has always used her own experience, describing herself walking across cities and deserts, or evading the violence or speechifying of men. And her take on culture is original enough that it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if her take on memoir was original too. But this book feels a little thin, because she\u2019s not an introspective writer. She\u2019s not curious about the relationship between thoughts and feelings or about her own ambivalence or contradictions. There is not here the plunge inwards, the giddying rush of embodied thinking, that we get in, say, Maggie Nelson\u2019s The Argonauts. Solnit\u2019s title is in part an acknowledgement of this, and some of the book\u2019s most striking passages are about non-existence. \u201cTo be a young woman is to face your own annihilation in innumerable ways,\u201d she writes at the start, \u201cor to flee it or the knowledge of it, or all these things at once.\u201d There\u2019s a personal point here. She suggests that, partly because of her violent father, she became \u201cexpert at fading and slipping and sneaking away \u2026 dodging unwanted hugs and kisses and hands \u2026 at the art of non-existence, since existence was so perilous\u201d. She associates this, intriguingly, with her love of reading, suggesting that when she read, she \u201cceased to be myself, and this non-existence I pursued and devoured like a drug\u201d.

Not much, according to Ukraine\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\" title=\"\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, the man who\u2019s done both.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very similar,\u201d he says, his compact frame engulfed by a green leather armchair in his opulent presidential office. Then he changes his mind: in fact, the real job lasts a whole five years, and comes with far greater challenges than can fit into one season of a television show. \u201cIt\u2019s true there are more problems. They are catastrophic. They appear, I\u2019m sorry to say, like pimples on an 18-year-old kid. You don\u2019t know where they will pop up, or when.\u201d The 42-year-old speaks in his native Russian, his expressive face switching from boyish amusement to tortured concern in a flash.</p> <p>The latest problem is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a>. Angry villagers, scared their hospital is hosting returnees from China, have attacked the buses transporting them. The day before we meet, Zelenskiy dispatched his health minister to join the evacuees in quarantine, as proof they pose no danger. \u201cIt was her choice, but I suggested it,\u201d he says, chuckling in a way that implies he gave her little alternative.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll happily talk to you when my five years are up and tell you lots of things that I can\u2019t now. State secrets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is exactly the kind of impetuous decision his television alter ego might have taken. In the Ukrainian series <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6235122/\" title=\"\">Servant Of The People</a>, Zelenskiy plays an everyman with no political experience who is elevated to the country\u2019s presidency. Last April, a couple of weeks after the season three finale aired, he took 73% of the vote in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/21/zelenskiy-wins-second-round-of-ukraines-presidential-election-exit-poll\" title=\"\">the country\u2019s actual presidential election</a>. In May, he started the job for real. In an era of outsider electoral successes, Zelenskiy\u2019s has been perhaps the most unlikely of them all.</p> <p>Running a country of 42 million people that in the past few years has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/ukraine-russia-explainer\" title=\"\">a revolution, a land-grab by Vladimir Putin</a> and an ongoing war in its eastern regions was not going to be an easy task, especially for a political novice. But Zelenskiy\u2019s first real-life presidential season has thrown up one plotline that even his show\u2019s scriptwriters might have discarded as implausible, involving another unlikely president, from across the Atlantic.</p> <p>After decades in which US politicians have chided Ukraine for its venal politics, it\u2019s ironic that an American president should try to corrupt his Ukrainian counterpart. Donald Trump wanted one thing from Zelenskiy: an investigation into the Ukrainian business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Joe \u2013 his potential 2020 presidential opponent. Until he complied, Trump made it clear through aides that he would withhold $391m (\u00a3303m) in military aid, along with Zelenskiy\u2019s chance of a coveted White House visit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/30/trump-ukraine-alleged-bribery-impeachment-inquiry\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelenskiy</a> were at the crux of his impeachment trial in January, with the most damning evidence released by Trump himself: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trumps-phone-call-with-ukraines-president-read-the-full-transcript\" title=\"\">a memorandum of a 25 July call</a> between the leaders. In it, Zelenskiy flatters Trump, while delicately trying not to enter into a criminal conspiracy with him: \u201cYou are a great teacher for us,\u201d he says, in one of several passages it is hard to read without cringing. Trump, meanwhile, underlines how much the US will do for Ukraine, if only Zelenskiy will order a probe into Hunter Biden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df44e8986477a56972615095e31b9bf907ba1302\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df44e8986477a56972615095e31b9bf907ba1302/0_58_4604_2877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump (on right) and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a meeting in New York on September 25, 2019, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the UN summit last September, hours after Trump released the transcript of the call that led to his impeachment.

Not only 100%, but actually 1,000%,\u201d he says when Trump claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> \u201cdoesn\u2019t do anything\u201d for Ukraine (in fact, the EU is its largest financial donor). But the scandal resonated more loudly in the US; with Russia-backed troops still in the east of the country, most Ukrainians are sympathetic to maintaining US support at almost any cost.</p> <p>Zelenskiy appeared rattled when Trump released the memo just hours before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-zelenskiy-ukraine-meeting-un\" title=\"\">the two </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trump-zelenskiy-ukraine-meeting-un\" title=\"\">held an awkward press conference</a> at the UN last September. Today, he looks more comfortable discussing the exchange, though he says he is tired of the impeachment saga dominating every conversation about Ukraine. \u201cI think Ukraine has passed through this story proudly, with its head raised high,\u201d he says. But he has still not received the promised White House invitation, and it\u2019s clear this is an irritation. \u201cI was told it\u2019s being prepared. It\u2019s hard for me to hear that. I am a person who works to deadlines. Our diplomats are discussing it with American diplomats. I would like us to have a fruitful meeting.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Zelenskiy thinks the era of the political outsider is just beginning. \u2018People are tired and want a breath of fresh air'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the humiliations have kept coming. In late January, two days before secretary of state Mike Pompeo was due to travel to Kyiv in a show of US support, he somewhat undermined the message by snapping at a reporter: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/24/mike-pompeo-ukraine-npr-rant\" title=\"\">\u201cDo you think Americans care about Ukraine?\u201d</a> and asking her to point to it on a map, as if it were an obscure principality rather than the biggest country in Europe. When they met, Zelenskiy says, Pompeo insisted he had been misquoted. He says he is \u201cgrateful to the US, because actually both political parties support us\u201d. But what about the president?</p> <p>Zelenskiy pauses and laughs. He draws another breath before giving a long, convoluted and largely meaningless answer about the overwhelming US support he feels, from the president down. There\u2019s not much else he can say. Trump is known to be vindictive, and could win another four years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\" title=\"\">in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\" title=\"\">November</a>. On the other hand, if Zelenskiy comes out in full-blooded support, he will look a fool if a Democrat wins the White House. The best option, it seems, is to say nothing.</p> <p>\u201cWith some issues, I don\u2019t really understand how to help journalists. When it comes to matters of state, I\u2019ll happily talk to you when my five years are up and tell you lots of things I can\u2019t now. But these are state secrets.\u201d</p> <p>After 10 months in office, Zelenskiy is desperate to move the conversation on from the impeachment saga. He has agreed to a rare interview in the hope that he can \u201cchange the context\u201d \u2013 to his focus on making a deal with Putin to end the war, and on further integration with Europe. He speaks passionately and with much gesturing, deploying the easy charm that helped him win the presidency. His future success will depend on whether he can use it to good effect on the European leaders who are his best hope of escaping his unenviable position, stuck between Trump and Putin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1af41c13fc1c29390a20085d6c6e35eb3e6bf2af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1af41c13fc1c29390a20085d6c6e35eb3e6bf2af/163_2314_3471_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Volodymyr Zelenskiy (president of Ukraine) in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"906\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Previous inhabitants felt very at home in these surroundings. I feel horribly uncomfortable.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Bondar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the aftermath of his election victory, Zelenskiy promised voters he would \u201cstay a human being\u201d and not become a typical politician. He claims to have succeeded so far, but our surroundings tell a different story. His cavernous office is done out with gilded stucco ceilings, chandeliers and ruched curtains that cascade down long windows. So far, so very presidential. But the handshakes are hardly over before Zelenskiy tells us how ill at ease he is. \u201cI can\u2019t even sit there, it\u2019s awful,\u201d he says, pointing to the wooden desk laden with malachite ornaments and a bank of secure telephones. \u201cPrevious inhabitants felt very at home in these surroundings, I guess,\u201d he says; they make him feel \u201chorribly uncomfortable\u201d.</p> <p>The most recent renovations were done by president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-yanukovych\" title=\"\">Viktor Yanukovych</a>, whose obscene corruption and cosying up to Russia prompted the 2014 Maidan revolution. We meet six years to the day since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/ukraine-tymoshenko-president-protests\" title=\"\">Yanukovych fled the building</a> during bloody clashes between riot police and protesters in central Kyiv, setting in train the Russian annexation of Crimea and military incursion into eastern Ukraine.</p> <p>Initially, Zelenskiy promised he would move the presidential office, but he has now decided the cost to the taxpayer would be prohibitive: \u201cAnd I can\u2019t do a renovation, because it\u2019s a historic building, so it would be illegal.\u201d But it is noticeable he has not made even small changes, such as replacing the furniture or removing the kitsch bronze figurines. Maybe he needs something to complain about. Or maybe the trappings of power are proving seductive.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, you do start getting used to it.\u201d He laughs.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Volodymyr Zelenskiy was born in 1978, into a Jewish Ukrainian family in Kryvyi Rih, an industrial city in the south-east of Soviet Ukraine, dotted with mines and blast furnaces. It was a tough place to grow up, notorious for gangs of youths fighting to control different neighbourhoods in the years after the Soviet collapse.</p> <p>Zelenskiy\u2019s way out came through comedy. A natural performer, he organised a tight-knit group of friends from high school and law school into a comedy troupe named Kvartal 95, after the neighbourhood in which they grew up. By the mid-2000s, the troupe had moved to Kyiv and were appearing regularly on Ukrainian television. Recently, Zelenskiy has brought in some of them as key advisers. \u201cI have a few people who work with me who have been my friends for a long time\u2026 They have no relation to business, or to the budget,\u201d he says, insisting the appointments are about personal trust, not financial cronyism.</p> <p>Zelenskiy\u2019s humour tended toward the slapstick: his audiences preferred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/21/biography.features\" title=\"\">Benny Hill</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/monty-python\" title=\"\">Monty Python</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47769118\" title=\"\">he has said</a>. In one skit, he and a fellow actor appear to play Chopsticks on the piano using only their penises. But there were also more pointed, political sketches, mocking Ukraine\u2019s corrupt officials and oligarchs. He came to know some of his targets personally, as he took on more work as a television and film producer, bringing him wealth and connections among the elites. Sometimes this got him into trouble, if a sketch cut too deeply. Occasionally, the group poked fun at the authoritarianism of Ukraine\u2019s big neighbour. In a skit to coincide with a Russian presidential election, Zelenskiy and his friends played the returning officers at a local polling station, suicidal because they have accidentally failed to secure a Putin victory in their district.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77fc2e3aed99c9db5c70a70f77a54e548f6a8f07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77fc2e3aed99c9db5c70a70f77a54e548f6a8f07/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stills from Ukranian tv show: Servant of the People featuring Volodymyr Zelenskiy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Servant Of The People: think Yes Minister crossed with House Of Cards</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kvartal 95 PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Servant Of The People, a sharp-edged comedy, first aired in 2015. Zelenskiy stars as high-school teacher Vasyl Holoborodko, whose classroom tirade against corruption is filmed by a pupil and posted online, propelling him to the presidency after the post goes viral.

The popularity of the show prompted a question, backed up by favourable polling numbers: what if Zelenskiy ran for office in real life? In the final moments of 2018, on his new year television show, he announced that he would.</p> <p>He ran a ludicrous, postmodern campaign, the centrepiece of which was a nationwide comedy tour that included video clips of his on-screen president. Mainly, he just wanted to make the audience laugh. One Ukrainians-on-holiday sketch poked fun at a tourist who spends his vacation watching movies on a bus. \u201cBut where did you stop?\u201d he is asked. \u201cSomewhere around Terminator 2,\u201d comes the response.</p> <p>Zelenskiy was up against the incumbent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/petro-poroshenko\" title=\"\">Petro Poroshenko</a>, a billionaire chocolate magnate who had won the presidency a few months after the Maidan revolution. While Poroshenko had brought some reform, he had failed to deliver on his key promise to end corruption. Lagging in the polls, he was flummoxed by Zelenskiy\u2019s insurgent campaign, and tried to paint his opponent as a man who would appease Putin over the war. Meanwhile Zelenskiy largely avoided debate, running a populist campaign \u2013 the people against the old elites \u2013 but without the usual populist tactic of sowing anger and division. Instead, he made vague talk of unification, fighting corruption and ending the war, with few specifics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e4646699dfd10d9f2eb99618032b1cfa9ee6c8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4646699dfd10d9f2eb99618032b1cfa9ee6c8a/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(FromL) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin give a press conference after a summit on Ukraine at the Elysee Palace, in Paris, on December 9, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin in Paris in December.

It wasn\u2019t intended as a serious offer, but with nothing to lose, Poroshenko said yes, gamely showing up for blood and urine tests the day before. The debate was loud, confusing and largely senseless \u2013 which was how Zelenskiy wanted it. In the stadium, both candidates came across badly, bellowing into microphones; but on television, where it really mattered, Zelenskiy was the clear winner.</p> <p>The election was an easy win, too. He came first in almost every region \u2013 something new for a country that has long been divided on regional and linguistic lines. In the minutes after his crushing victory was announced, Zelenskiy strode on to the stage at his campaign headquarters accompanied by the lilting theme tune of Servant Of The People. Nobody quite knew what a Zelenskiy presidency would look like, including the people who had voted for him. But after a two-decade cycle of revolution and disappointment, he had won, not despite his lack of experience but because of it. He called parliamentary elections soon after, announcing that his newly formed party (named the Servant Of The People Party, naturally) would nominate a varied field of candidates, most without political experience. It won more than half the parliamentary seats, giving Zelenskiy huge power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1b5aafae412673b9802c45270b6ef5e1690f07f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1b5aafae412673b9802c45270b6ef5e1690f07f/0_1162_4000_4348/920.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Volodymyr Zelenskiy (president of Ukraine) in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 2020\" width=\"920\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The president can\u2019t change the country on his own.

Zelenskiy smiles. \u201cI understood that, without experienced people it\u2019s impossible to run a country. But these people are at middle level. They are the bureaucrats who know where to scurry to, what to do, whom to bring the papers to.\u201d </p> <p>To manage these bureaucrats, Zelenskiy has enlisted some old friends. <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/who-is-zelenskys-chief-negotiator-andriy-yermak.html?cn-reloaded=1\" title=\"\">Andriy Yermak</a>, the man he entrusted with US negotiations last summer and recently made his chief of staff, is a former copyright lawyer. Serhiy Shefir, another presidential aide, is a co-founder of Zelenskiy\u2019s production studio. A childhood friend, Ivan Bakanov, has been made head of the secret services. While Zelenskiy\u2019s inner circle do not seem to be seeking personal enrichment, there are legitimate concerns about whether his friends are the best qualified people to run the country.</p> <p>Alongside these old friends, Zelenskiy put together a cabinet composed largely of well-regarded reformers, and the general feeling in the international community was that his team was doing surprisingly well, against the odds. However, earlier this week, a few days after our interview, he fired most of the government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/ukrainian-president-removes-pm-government-reshuffle-volodymyr-zelenskiy\">including the 35-year-old prime minister (and also the still-quarantined health minister)</a>. The chief prosecutor, seen as a reformer, was also dismissed by parliament. The move, which Zelenskiy gave no hint was coming during the interview, has been interpreted as a blow for genuine reform efforts.</p> <p>Zelenskiy claimed to us that because he and his circle are demonstrably not on the take, it has become more difficult for anyone else to take a bribe. \u201cThe president can\u2019t change the country on his own. But what can he do? He can give an example.\u201d</p> <p>While Zelenskiy appears to be enjoying himself, he admits the political spotlight has been unwelcome for his family. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t like my work.\u201d Going out for a meal has to be cleared with security; taking a nice holiday looks insensitive when his country is at war.</p> <p>His wife, Olena, is a former writer for Kvartal 95 who, like Zelenskiy, grew up in Kryvyi Rih. He says that while he is used to being in the public eye, she prefers to stay out of the limelight. His 16-year-old daughter is the most irritated by his new job, bristling against the security detail that now follows her everywhere. They try to hide, but she always spots them, her father says. \u201cShe\u2019s at that age when a person is usually most free,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant for her on a human level.\u201d On the other hand, his seven-year-old son is loving it, proudly announcing to anyone who will listen that his father is the president. \u201cI came home the other day and I said, \u2018Why is nobody saying hello to me?\u2019 And I can hear my own voice on the television. It was my speech. And my son says, \u2018Don\u2019t disturb us, we\u2019re watching the president!\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Before Trump hijacked the script, the main villain to Zelenskiy\u2019s hero was meant to be Putin, who annexed Crimea in 2014 and sent money, men and weapons to fuel a war that has killed 14,000 people so far, many of them civilians. Large-scale fighting was halted in 2015, but regular shelling and fatalities on the frontline have been a way of life ever since. Peace could be achieved, Zelenskiy told voters, only if Kyiv began direct negotiations with the Kremlin. This was a radical departure from Poroshenko\u2019s approach and proved popular with a nation suffering from war fatigue \u2013 though a loud minority accused Zelenskiy of capitulating to Russia by even proposing talks. But he says he values saving lives over counting territorial gains. \u201cWho is this all being done for? For people. What\u2019s the point of returning our territory if a million people die?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I do not try to play a role. I feel good being myself and saying what I think. And in this, Trump really was an example</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Putin and Zelenskiy met face to face for the first time in December, at a summit in Paris, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a> and Angela Merkel. They mainly stuck to the technical details of a long-ignored peace treaty, but \u201cthere were a few emotional parts\u201d, Zelenskiy recalls: when Putin complained about radical Ukrainian nationalists, he fired back that Russia has radicals, too. Was he able to get through to Putin? \u201cI think he listened to me. I had that feeling. I hope it\u2019s not a false feeling.\u201d The talks produced modest results: prisoner exchanges, an agreement to disengage military forces, and a ceasefire that has not held, with one soldier killed and several injured in a deadly flare-up in recent weeks.</p> <p>It seems unlikely that Putin will agree to any peace deal remotely acceptable to Ukrainian public opinion, but Zelenskiy says he wants to move fast. \u201cTime is ticking,\u201d he says, pointing at his watch and announcing a timeframe of a year in which to solve the conflict, so he can focus on other domestic issues. \u201cThe government can spend one year on the entire agreement. Then it should be implemented. Any longer is prohibited. If it lasts longer, we need to change the format and choose another strategy,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a dramatic new deadline, but his urgency is undercut by a lack of detail. (At times like this, Zelenskiy sounds rather Trumpian.) He declines to say what the fallback strategy might be, and when his press secretary jumps in to clarify that the one-year deadline dates from the December summit, rather than the start of his presidency in May, he replies with a laugh: \u201cI don\u2019t know any more.\u201d Thinking on the fly, as he often appears to, he buys himself the extra months: yes, it starts from the summit.</p> <p>Zelenskiy\u2019s aides present this kind of improvisation as part of his charm. In meetings with foreign dignitaries, they say, he will read the room and, if he feels he can succeed with a more emotional pitch, discard official briefing notes. And perhaps this might work with Merkel, for one, who reportedly watched clips from Servant Of The People before meeting Zelenskiy.</p> <p>Convincing Merkel and others of Ukraine\u2019s desire for closer integration into Europe is vital, he says. \u201cWe need to give people confidence that the European Union is waiting for Ukraine,\u201d he says. If it takes 20 years, his electorate will lose hope. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really believe in words. Or rather, people believe in words only for a stretch of time. Then they start to look for action.\u201d Merkel gets it, he thinks; he also claims to have developed a warm personal relationship with Macron, though he is wary of the French president\u2019s recent references to the need for warmer relations with Moscow.</p> <p>Watching Brexit unfold from Kyiv has been a strange experience, he says \u2013 seeing a country rush to exit the EU when Ukraine is so keen to join. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a group of people around a table spending a nice evening together. If someone doesn\u2019t want to sit at the table, he\u2019ll definitely ruin the party,\u201d he says, warming to his metaphor. \u201cAnd then there are people standing outside the door, ringing the doorbell, knocking, and they\u2019re told through the peephole: \u2018Yes, you\u2019re welcome to join but come back next time!\u2019 And they\u2019re still outside knocking when the party is over.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1cc730dc2ae9d0698804ee6d8d584405b088368\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1cc730dc2ae9d0698804ee6d8d584405b088368/388_203_2602_2214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky casts his ballot next to his wife Olena (L) at a polling station in Kiev, Ukraine, on July 21, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"851\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his wife Olena, voting in last July\u2019s parliamentary elections.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua News Agency/Eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He revels in these colourful comparisons, which sometimes take him in the wrong direction. He likens his presidency to being on a boat: \u201cThere are holes everywhere, and with your arms and legs, you are trying to close them up. This is how we\u2019re living. We are closing the holes.\u201d When told it sounds like a sinking ship, Zelenskiy looks alarmed, and adds: \u201cBut we\u2019re not sinking!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When he came to power, western diplomats worried Zelenskiy might be a proxy for Ihor Kolomoisky, a controversial billionaire whose television channel aired his show. Kolomoisky is one of a group of oligarchs who made vast fortunes in the transition from communism, while most Ukrainians remained poor. In recent years, they have rebranded themselves as generous philanthropists, while retaining an outsized influence on the political scene, and are far more deserving of the \u201coligarch\u201d title than their counterparts in Russia, long since neutered by Putin.</p> <p>\u201cI want them to have walk-on parts, not leading roles,\u201d Zelenskiy says. Kolomoisky receives no special treatment, he insists, despite their long acquaintance. He dismisses as \u201cinappropriate\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0af836dc-4108-11ea-bdb5-169ba7be433d\" title=\"\">the recent purchase</a> of a 14-bedroom mansion on the French Riviera for \u20ac200m (\u00a3170m) by Rinat Akhmetov, a businessman whose apartment at One Hyde Park was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/19/rinat-akhmetov-one-hyde-park\" title=\"\">the most expensive property ever purchased</a> in the UK when he bought it in 2011, at \u00a3136m.</p> <p>Many in Kyiv see Zelenskiy\u2019s government reshuffle this week as a sign that the old oligarchic players are reasserting their influence, despite his public claims that it was about speeding up reform. It\u2019s certainly true that Ukraine\u2019s oligarchs continue to wield tremendous power, and Zelenskiy won\u2019t be rid of their machinations simply by asking nicely. His TV president might have ordered them hanged or shot for such lavish expenditure abroad during a time of war, but the real Zelenskiy will have to work with them, asking them to invest at home and fund state projects when asked.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019ve chosen democracy, of course we can\u2019t hang people,\u201d he says, but a twinkle appears in his eyes. \u201cAlthough! Sometimes you really want to. And do you know why? Because it would be quicker. Much quicker,\u201d he says, delivering the line with a comic\u2019s timing.</p> <p>\u201cWe are joking,\u201d says his press secretary, looking somewhat concerned, from the other side of the table.</p> <p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re joking,\u201d Zelenskiy says.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In their ill-fated phone call, Zelenskiy thanked Trump for providing him with a model of electoral success. \u201cWe used quite a few of your skills\u2026 we wanted to drain the swamp here in my country,\u201d he says. Is that true, or was he simply following advice that the US president responds well to flattery? He sighs and answers carefully. What Trump showed him, he says, was how an outsider can win without having to adapt to the supposed rules of the game. \u201cI do not try to play a role. I feel good being myself and saying what I think. And in this, he really was an example \u2013 of how you can win without using the standard format.\u201d</p> <p>Zelenskiy thinks the era of the political outsider is just starting and his own campaign model could succeed elsewhere. \u201cI am certain it could, especially where people are tired, where they are running like squirrels<strong> </strong>on a wheel, and there are these long-standing politicians with big financial resources. In these places, where people are searching for a breath of fresh air, it should work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/10/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-press-conference-donald-trump\">Ask me anything: Ukraine's president holds 14-hour press conference</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It sounds like a clear allusion to Ukraine\u2019s neighbour to the east, and its indefatigable leader. Indeed, on the night of his election, Zelenskiy said he wanted his victory to be an example to the entire post-Soviet region, dominated by autocrats. His success has not gone unnoticed inside Russia, and many have made favourable comparisons with the man in the Kremlin: Zelenskiy walking to his inauguration, high-fiving members of the crowd, versus a lonely Putin in his limousine, gliding through the emptied streets of Moscow to his own ceremony. Zelenskiy\u2019s chummy, upbeat new year message to the nation, versus Putin\u2019s staid television address. A Russian channel recently started to broadcast Servant Of The People, but quickly reversed the decision, presumably fearing its message was too subversive.</p> <p>Zelenskiy did not, in the end, bring down Trump, and he may well not succeed in his plans to remodel Ukraine. Could Zelenskiy\u2019s legacy turn out to be piercing Putin\u2019s aura of infallibility? \u201cOf course a new president will appear there. Of course it will happen. What kind of president it will be, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can see that all totalitarian regimes end the same way.\u201d</p> <p>But Putin would never simply give up power to a Zelenskiy figure in Russia. Is he predicting a bloody revolution? \u201cI don\u2019t want people to die anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we should understand that if you keep tightening the spring, at some point it will snap.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the difference between playing a president on screen and being one in real life? Not much, according to Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the man who\u2019s done both. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar,\u201d he says, his compact frame engulfed by a green leather armchair in his opulent presidential office. Then he changes his mind: in fact, the real job lasts a whole five years, and comes with far greater challenges than can fit into one season of a television show. \u201cIt\u2019s true there are more problems. They are catastrophic. They appear, I\u2019m sorry to say, like pimples on an 18-year-old kid. You don\u2019t know where they will pop up, or when.\u201d The 42-year-old speaks in his native Russian, his expressive face switching from boyish amusement to tortured concern in a flash. The latest problem is coronavirus. Angry villagers, scared their hospital is hosting returnees from China, have attacked the buses transporting them. The day before we meet, Zelenskiy dispatched his health minister to join the evacuees in quarantine, as proof they pose no danger. \u201cIt was her choice, but I suggested it,\u201d he says, chuckling in a way that implies he gave her little alternative. It is exactly the kind of impetuous decision his television alter ego might have taken. In the Ukrainian series Servant Of The People, Zelenskiy plays an everyman with no political experience who is elevated to the country\u2019s presidency. Last April, a couple of weeks after the season three finale aired, he took 73% of the vote in the country\u2019s actual presidential election. In May, he started the job for real. In an era of outsider electoral successes, Zelenskiy\u2019s has been perhaps the most unlikely of them all. Running a country of 42 million people that in the past few years has seen a revolution, a land-grab by Vladimir Putin and an ongoing war in its eastern regions was not going to be an easy task, especially for a political novice. But Zelenskiy\u2019s first real-life presidential season has thrown up one plotline that even his show\u2019s scriptwriters might have discarded as implausible, involving another unlikely president, from across the Atlantic. After decades in which US politicians have chided Ukraine for its venal politics, it\u2019s ironic that an American president should try to corrupt his Ukrainian counterpart. Donald Trump wanted one thing from Zelenskiy: an investigation into the Ukrainian business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Joe \u2013 his potential 2020 presidential opponent. Until he complied, Trump made it clear through aides that he would withhold $391m (\u00a3303m) in military aid, along with Zelenskiy\u2019s chance of a coveted White House visit. Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelenskiy were at the crux of his impeachment trial in January, with the most damning evidence released by Trump himself: a memorandum of a 25 July call between the leaders. In it, Zelenskiy flatters Trump, while delicately trying not to enter into a criminal conspiracy with him: \u201cYou are a great teacher for us,\u201d he says, in one of several passages it is hard to read without cringing. Trump, meanwhile, underlines how much the US will do for Ukraine, if only Zelenskiy will order a probe into Hunter Biden. His political opponents seized on his fawning tone and he was even dubbed \u201cMonica Zelenskiy\u201d. \u201cYou are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1,000%,\u201d he says when Trump claims Angela Merkel \u201cdoesn\u2019t do anything\u201d for Ukraine (in fact, the EU is its largest financial donor). But the scandal resonated more loudly in the US; with Russia-backed troops still in the east of the country, most Ukrainians are sympathetic to maintaining US support at almost any cost. Zelenskiy appeared rattled when Trump released the memo just hours before the two held an awkward press conference at the UN last September. Today, he looks more comfortable discussing the exchange, though he says he is tired of the impeachment saga dominating every conversation about Ukraine. \u201cI think Ukraine has passed through this story proudly, with its head raised high,\u201d he says. But he has still not received the promised White House invitation, and it\u2019s clear this is an irritation. \u201cI was told it\u2019s being prepared. It\u2019s hard for me to hear that. I am a person who works to deadlines. Our diplomats are discussing it with American diplomats. I would like us to have a fruitful meeting.\u201d But the humiliations have kept coming. In late January, two days before secretary of state Mike Pompeo was due to travel to Kyiv in a show of US support, he somewhat undermined the message by snapping at a reporter: \u201cDo you think Americans care about Ukraine?\u201d and asking her to point to it on a map, as if it were an obscure principality rather than the biggest country in Europe. When they met, Zelenskiy says, Pompeo insisted he had been misquoted. He says he is \u201cgrateful to the US, because actually both political parties support us\u201d. But what about the president? Zelenskiy pauses and laughs. He draws another breath before giving a long, convoluted and largely meaningless answer about the overwhelming US support he feels, from the president down. There\u2019s not much else he can say. Trump is known to be vindictive, and could win another four years in November. On the other hand, if Zelenskiy comes out in full-blooded support, he will look a fool if a Democrat wins the White House. The best option, it seems, is to say nothing. \u201cWith some issues, I don\u2019t really understand how to help journalists. When it comes to matters of state, I\u2019ll happily talk to you when my five years are up and tell you lots of things I can\u2019t now. But these are state secrets.\u201d After 10 months in office, Zelenskiy is desperate to move the conversation on from the impeachment saga. He has agreed to a rare interview in the hope that he can \u201cchange the context\u201d \u2013 to his focus on making a deal with Putin to end the war, and on further integration with Europe. He speaks passionately and with much gesturing, deploying the easy charm that helped him win the presidency. His future success will depend on whether he can use it to good effect on the European leaders who are his best hope of escaping his unenviable position, stuck between Trump and Putin. In the aftermath of his election victory, Zelenskiy promised voters he would \u201cstay a human being\u201d and not become a typical politician. He claims to have succeeded so far, but our surroundings tell a different story. His cavernous office is done out with gilded stucco ceilings, chandeliers and ruched curtains that cascade down long windows. So far, so very presidential. But the handshakes are hardly over before Zelenskiy tells us how ill at ease he is. \u201cI can\u2019t even sit there, it\u2019s awful,\u201d he says, pointing to the wooden desk laden with malachite ornaments and a bank of secure telephones. \u201cPrevious inhabitants felt very at home in these surroundings, I guess,\u201d he says; they make him feel \u201chorribly uncomfortable\u201d. The most recent renovations were done by president Viktor Yanukovych, whose obscene corruption and cosying up to Russia prompted the 2014 Maidan revolution. We meet six years to the day since Yanukovych fled the building during bloody clashes between riot police and protesters in central Kyiv, setting in train the Russian annexation of Crimea and military incursion into eastern Ukraine. Initially, Zelenskiy promised he would move the presidential office, but he has now decided the cost to the taxpayer would be prohibitive: \u201cAnd I can\u2019t do a renovation, because it\u2019s a historic building, so it would be illegal.\u201d But it is noticeable he has not made even small changes, such as replacing the furniture or removing the kitsch bronze figurines. Maybe he needs something to complain about. Or maybe the trappings of power are proving seductive. \u201cIt\u2019s true, you do start getting used to it.\u201d He laughs. * * * Volodymyr Zelenskiy was born in 1978, into a Jewish Ukrainian family in Kryvyi Rih, an industrial city in the south-east of Soviet Ukraine, dotted with mines and blast furnaces. It was a tough place to grow up, notorious for gangs of youths fighting to control different neighbourhoods in the years after the Soviet collapse. Zelenskiy\u2019s way out came through comedy. A natural performer, he organised a tight-knit group of friends from high school and law school into a comedy troupe named Kvartal 95, after the neighbourhood in which they grew up. By the mid-2000s, the troupe had moved to Kyiv and were appearing regularly on Ukrainian television. Recently, Zelenskiy has brought in some of them as key advisers. \u201cI have a few people who work with me who have been my friends for a long time\u2026 They have no relation to business, or to the budget,\u201d he says, insisting the appointments are about personal trust, not financial cronyism. Zelenskiy\u2019s humour tended toward the slapstick: his audiences preferred Benny Hill to Monty Python, he has said. In one skit, he and a fellow actor appear to play Chopsticks on the piano using only their penises. But there were also more pointed, political sketches, mocking Ukraine\u2019s corrupt officials and oligarchs. He came to know some of his targets personally, as he took on more work as a television and film producer, bringing him wealth and connections among the elites. Sometimes this got him into trouble, if a sketch cut too deeply. Occasionally, the group poked fun at the authoritarianism of Ukraine\u2019s big neighbour. In a skit to coincide with a Russian presidential election, Zelenskiy and his friends played the returning officers at a local polling station, suicidal because they have accidentally failed to secure a Putin victory in their district. Servant Of The People, a sharp-edged comedy, first aired in 2015. Zelenskiy stars as high-school teacher Vasyl Holoborodko, whose classroom tirade against corruption is filmed by a pupil and posted online, propelling him to the presidency after the post goes viral. Think Yes Minister crossed with House Of Cards, transposed on to the grimly cynical world of post-Soviet politics. The popularity of the show prompted a question, backed up by favourable polling numbers: what if Zelenskiy ran for office in real life? In the final moments of 2018, on his new year television show, he announced that he would. He ran a ludicrous, postmodern campaign, the centrepiece of which was a nationwide comedy tour that included video clips of his on-screen president. Mainly, he just wanted to make the audience laugh. One Ukrainians-on-holiday sketch poked fun at a tourist who spends his vacation watching movies on a bus. \u201cBut where did you stop?\u201d he is asked. \u201cSomewhere around Terminator 2,\u201d comes the response. Zelenskiy was up against the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko, a billionaire chocolate magnate who had won the presidency a few months after the Maidan revolution. While Poroshenko had brought some reform, he had failed to deliver on his key promise to end corruption. Lagging in the polls, he was flummoxed by Zelenskiy\u2019s insurgent campaign, and tried to paint his opponent as a man who would appease Putin over the war. Meanwhile Zelenskiy largely avoided debate, running a populist campaign \u2013 the people against the old elites \u2013 but without the usual populist tactic of sowing anger and division. Instead, he made vague talk of unification, fighting corruption and ending the war, with few specifics. When he did agree to a debate, he made it conditional on Poroshenko accepting a set of absurd terms: it would take place on the pitch at Kyiv\u2019s 70,000-seater Olympic stadium, and Poroshenko would have to take a drug and alcohol test beforehand, to prove he wasn\u2019t high. It wasn\u2019t intended as a serious offer, but with nothing to lose, Poroshenko said yes, gamely showing up for blood and urine tests the day before. The debate was loud, confusing and largely senseless \u2013 which was how Zelenskiy wanted it. In the stadium, both candidates came across badly, bellowing into microphones; but on television, where it really mattered, Zelenskiy was the clear winner. The election was an easy win, too. He came first in almost every region \u2013 something new for a country that has long been divided on regional and linguistic lines. In the minutes after his crushing victory was announced, Zelenskiy strode on to the stage at his campaign headquarters accompanied by the lilting theme tune of Servant Of The People. Nobody quite knew what a Zelenskiy presidency would look like, including the people who had voted for him. But after a two-decade cycle of revolution and disappointment, he had won, not despite his lack of experience but because of it. He called parliamentary elections soon after, announcing that his newly formed party (named the Servant Of The People Party, naturally) would nominate a varied field of candidates, most without political experience. It won more than half the parliamentary seats, giving Zelenskiy huge power. Now that he\u2019s in charge, does he regret mocking politicians so mercilessly on his TV show? Zelenskiy smiles. \u201cI understood that, without experienced people it\u2019s impossible to run a country. But these people are at middle level. They are the bureaucrats who know where to scurry to, what to do, whom to bring the papers to.\u201d To manage these bureaucrats, Zelenskiy has enlisted some old friends. Andriy Yermak, the man he entrusted with US negotiations last summer and recently made his chief of staff, is a former copyright lawyer. Serhiy Shefir, another presidential aide, is a co-founder of Zelenskiy\u2019s production studio. A childhood friend, Ivan Bakanov, has been made head of the secret services. While Zelenskiy\u2019s inner circle do not seem to be seeking personal enrichment, there are legitimate concerns about whether his friends are the best qualified people to run the country. Alongside these old friends, Zelenskiy put together a cabinet composed largely of well-regarded reformers, and the general feeling in the international community was that his team was doing surprisingly well, against the odds. However, earlier this week, a few days after our interview, he fired most of the government, including the 35-year-old prime minister (and also the still-quarantined health minister). The chief prosecutor, seen as a reformer, was also dismissed by parliament. The move, which Zelenskiy gave no hint was coming during the interview, has been interpreted as a blow for genuine reform efforts. Zelenskiy claimed to us that because he and his circle are demonstrably not on the take, it has become more difficult for anyone else to take a bribe. \u201cThe president can\u2019t change the country on his own. But what can he do? He can give an example.\u201d While Zelenskiy appears to be enjoying himself, he admits the political spotlight has been unwelcome for his family. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t like my work.\u201d Going out for a meal has to be cleared with security; taking a nice holiday looks insensitive when his country is at war. His wife, Olena, is a former writer for Kvartal 95 who, like Zelenskiy, grew up in Kryvyi Rih. He says that while he is used to being in the public eye, she prefers to stay out of the limelight. His 16-year-old daughter is the most irritated by his new job, bristling against the security detail that now follows her everywhere. They try to hide, but she always spots them, her father says. \u201cShe\u2019s at that age when a person is usually most free,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant for her on a human level.\u201d On the other hand, his seven-year-old son is loving it, proudly announcing to anyone who will listen that his father is the president. \u201cI came home the other day and I said, \u2018Why is nobody saying hello to me?\u2019 And I can hear my own voice on the television. It was my speech. And my son says, \u2018Don\u2019t disturb us, we\u2019re watching the president!\u2019\u201d * * * Before Trump hijacked the script, the main villain to Zelenskiy\u2019s hero was meant to be Putin, who annexed Crimea in 2014 and sent money, men and weapons to fuel a war that has killed 14,000 people so far, many of them civilians. Large-scale fighting was halted in 2015, but regular shelling and fatalities on the frontline have been a way of life ever since. Peace could be achieved, Zelenskiy told voters, only if Kyiv began direct negotiations with the Kremlin. This was a radical departure from Poroshenko\u2019s approach and proved popular with a nation suffering from war fatigue \u2013 though a loud minority accused Zelenskiy of capitulating to Russia by even proposing talks. But he says he values saving lives over counting territorial gains. \u201cWho is this all being done for? For people. What\u2019s the point of returning our territory if a million people die?\u201d Putin and Zelenskiy met face to face for the first time in December, at a summit in Paris, alongside Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. They mainly stuck to the technical details of a long-ignored peace treaty, but \u201cthere were a few emotional parts\u201d, Zelenskiy recalls: when Putin complained about radical Ukrainian nationalists, he fired back that Russia has radicals, too. Was he able to get through to Putin? \u201cI think he listened to me. I had that feeling. I hope it\u2019s not a false feeling.\u201d The talks produced modest results: prisoner exchanges, an agreement to disengage military forces, and a ceasefire that has not held, with one soldier killed and several injured in a deadly flare-up in recent weeks. It seems unlikely that Putin will agree to any peace deal remotely acceptable to Ukrainian public opinion, but Zelenskiy says he wants to move fast. \u201cTime is ticking,\u201d he says, pointing at his watch and announcing a timeframe of a year in which to solve the conflict, so he can focus on other domestic issues. \u201cThe government can spend one year on the entire agreement. Then it should be implemented. Any longer is prohibited. If it lasts longer, we need to change the format and choose another strategy,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a dramatic new deadline, but his urgency is undercut by a lack of detail. (At times like this, Zelenskiy sounds rather Trumpian.) He declines to say what the fallback strategy might be, and when his press secretary jumps in to clarify that the one-year deadline dates from the December summit, rather than the start of his presidency in May, he replies with a laugh: \u201cI don\u2019t know any more.\u201d Thinking on the fly, as he often appears to, he buys himself the extra months: yes, it starts from the summit. Zelenskiy\u2019s aides present this kind of improvisation as part of his charm. In meetings with foreign dignitaries, they say, he will read the room and, if he feels he can succeed with a more emotional pitch, discard official briefing notes. And perhaps this might work with Merkel, for one, who reportedly watched clips from Servant Of The People before meeting Zelenskiy. Convincing Merkel and others of Ukraine\u2019s desire for closer integration into Europe is vital, he says. \u201cWe need to give people confidence that the European Union is waiting for Ukraine,\u201d he says. If it takes 20 years, his electorate will lose hope. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really believe in words. Or rather, people believe in words only for a stretch of time. Then they start to look for action.\u201d Merkel gets it, he thinks; he also claims to have developed a warm personal relationship with Macron, though he is wary of the French president\u2019s recent references to the need for warmer relations with Moscow. Watching Brexit unfold from Kyiv has been a strange experience, he says \u2013 seeing a country rush to exit the EU when Ukraine is so keen to join. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a group of people around a table spending a nice evening together. If someone doesn\u2019t want to sit at the table, he\u2019ll definitely ruin the party,\u201d he says, warming to his metaphor. \u201cAnd then there are people standing outside the door, ringing the doorbell, knocking, and they\u2019re told through the peephole: \u2018Yes, you\u2019re welcome to join but come back next time!\u2019 And they\u2019re still outside knocking when the party is over.\u201d He revels in these colourful comparisons, which sometimes take him in the wrong direction. He likens his presidency to being on a boat: \u201cThere are holes everywhere, and with your arms and legs, you are trying to close them up. This is how we\u2019re living. We are closing the holes.\u201d When told it sounds like a sinking ship, Zelenskiy looks alarmed, and adds: \u201cBut we\u2019re not sinking!\u201d * * * When he came to power, western diplomats worried Zelenskiy might be a proxy for Ihor Kolomoisky, a controversial billionaire whose television channel aired his show. Kolomoisky is one of a group of oligarchs who made vast fortunes in the transition from communism, while most Ukrainians remained poor. In recent years, they have rebranded themselves as generous philanthropists, while retaining an outsized influence on the political scene, and are far more deserving of the \u201coligarch\u201d title than their counterparts in Russia, long since neutered by Putin. \u201cI want them to have walk-on parts, not leading roles,\u201d Zelenskiy says. Kolomoisky receives no special treatment, he insists, despite their long acquaintance. He dismisses as \u201cinappropriate\u201d the recent purchase of a 14-bedroom mansion on the French Riviera for \u20ac200m (\u00a3170m) by Rinat Akhmetov, a businessman whose apartment at One Hyde Park was the most expensive property ever purchased in the UK when he bought it in 2011, at \u00a3136m. Many in Kyiv see Zelenskiy\u2019s government reshuffle this week as a sign that the old oligarchic players are reasserting their influence, despite his public claims that it was about speeding up reform. It\u2019s certainly true that Ukraine\u2019s oligarchs continue to wield tremendous power, and Zelenskiy won\u2019t be rid of their machinations simply by asking nicely. His TV president might have ordered them hanged or shot for such lavish expenditure abroad during a time of war, but the real Zelenskiy will have to work with them, asking them to invest at home and fund state projects when asked. \u201cIf we\u2019ve chosen democracy, of course we can\u2019t hang people,\u201d he says, but a twinkle appears in his eyes. \u201cAlthough! Sometimes you really want to. And do you know why? Because it would be quicker. Much quicker,\u201d he says, delivering the line with a comic\u2019s timing. \u201cWe are joking,\u201d says his press secretary, looking somewhat concerned, from the other side of the table. \u201cOf course we\u2019re joking,\u201d Zelenskiy says. * * * In their ill-fated phone call, Zelenskiy thanked Trump for providing him with a model of electoral success. \u201cWe used quite a few of your skills\u2026 we wanted to drain the swamp here in my country,\u201d he says. Is that true, or was he simply following advice that the US president responds well to flattery? He sighs and answers carefully. What Trump showed him, he says, was how an outsider can win without having to adapt to the supposed rules of the game. \u201cI do not try to play a role. I feel good being myself and saying what I think. And in this, he really was an example \u2013 of how you can win without using the standard format.\u201d Zelenskiy thinks the era of the political outsider is just starting and his own campaign model could succeed elsewhere. \u201cI am certain it could, especially where people are tired, where they are running like squirrels on a wheel, and there are these long-standing politicians with big financial resources. In these places, where people are searching for a breath of fresh air, it should work.\u201d It sounds like a clear allusion to Ukraine\u2019s neighbour to the east, and its indefatigable leader. Indeed, on the night of his election, Zelenskiy said he wanted his victory to be an example to the entire post-Soviet region, dominated by autocrats. His success has not gone unnoticed inside Russia, and many have made favourable comparisons with the man in the Kremlin: Zelenskiy walking to his inauguration, high-fiving members of the crowd, versus a lonely Putin in his limousine, gliding through the emptied streets of Moscow to his own ceremony. Zelenskiy\u2019s chummy, upbeat new year message to the nation, versus Putin\u2019s staid television address. A Russian channel recently started to broadcast Servant Of The People, but quickly reversed the decision, presumably fearing its message was too subversive. Zelenskiy did not, in the end, bring down Trump, and he may well not succeed in his plans to remodel Ukraine. Could Zelenskiy\u2019s legacy turn out to be piercing Putin\u2019s aura of infallibility? \u201cOf course a new president will appear there. Of course it will happen. What kind of president it will be, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can see that all totalitarian regimes end the same way.\u201d But Putin would never simply give up power to a Zelenskiy figure in Russia. Is he predicting a bloody revolution? \u201cI don\u2019t want people to die anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we should understand that if you keep tightening the spring, at some point it will snap.\u201d \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day this weekend, which you\u2019d think presents an easy enough opportunity for streaming sites to promote a timely season or two: a selection of feminist films, or key works by female film-makers, and so on. Yet there doesn\u2019t appear to be much out there. Perhaps marketing films by and about 50% of the world\u2019s population for a single day strikes the big guns as unnecessary; perhaps it doesn\u2019t occur to them at all. Yet at a time when, on balance, even major female directors\u2019 films tend to be harder to track down online than those by their male counterparts, it seems worth doing some curating on one\u2019s own.</p> <p>Mubi is the one site marking the occasion, streaming Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven\u2019s elegant, empowering coming-of-age tale <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/mustang\" title=\"\">Mustang</a></strong> as their International Women\u2019s Day pick \u2013 though their <a href=\"https://mubi.com/showing\" title=\"\">rotating menu</a>, to be fair, is more conscientiously inclusive than most.

The films most prominently highlighted under this banner aren\u2019t deep cuts \u2013 at the moment, Greta Gerwig\u2019s universally beloved <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80205227\" title=\"\">Lady Bird</a></strong>, the original <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/15/to-all-the-boys-ps-i-love-you-netflix-sequel-lara-jean-lana-condor\" title=\"\">To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before</a></strong> and the fine Taylor Swift documentary <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81028336\" title=\"\">Miss Americana </a></strong>get the top spot. It\u2019s also a handy reminder of just how many celebrated Netflix Originals have been female-directed, ranging from Mati Diop\u2019s mesmerising postcolonial ghost story <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81082007\" title=\"\">Atlantics</a> </strong>to Tamara Jenkins\u2019s acutely observed marital drama <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80168222\" title=\"\">Private Life</a> </strong>to Kitty Green\u2019s ingenious, form-busting documentary <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80142316\" title=\"\">Casting JonBenet</a></strong>.</p> <p>As you scroll down, less expected highlights show up, including <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80171405\" title=\"\">Beach Rats</a></strong>, recent Berlinale winner Eliza Hittman\u2019s rawly moving study of unarticulated male queerness, and <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80242008\" title=\"\">Fast Colo</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80242008\" title=\"\">r</a></strong>, a beautifully conceived fantasy from director Julia Hart that bypassed UK cinemas to show up very quietly online.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day this weekend, which you\u2019d think presents an easy enough opportunity for streaming sites to promote a timely season or two: a selection of feminist films, or key works by female film-makers, and so on. Yet there doesn\u2019t appear to be much out there. Perhaps marketing films by and about 50% of the world\u2019s population for a single day strikes the big guns as unnecessary; perhaps it doesn\u2019t occur to them at all. Yet at a time when, on balance, even major female directors\u2019 films tend to be harder to track down online than those by their male counterparts, it seems worth doing some curating on one\u2019s own. Mubi is the one site marking the occasion, streaming Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven\u2019s elegant, empowering coming-of-age tale Mustang as their International Women\u2019s Day pick \u2013 though their rotating menu, to be fair, is more conscientiously inclusive than most. Right now, for example, you can stream Little Joe director Jessica Hausner\u2019s meticulously ambiguous spiritual fable Lourdes, Claire Denis\u2019s untamed, sensualist sci-fi High Life or Belgian director Isabelle Tollenaere\u2019s short The Remembered Film, an inventive soldier study blurring and overlapping multiple wars, from their selection. Over to Netflix, which last year took a significant step by adding Films Directed by Women to its range of searchable genre categories: hardly a genre in itself, admittedly, but a useful shortcut for those looking to break out of their predominantly patriarchal viewing diet. The films most prominently highlighted under this banner aren\u2019t deep cuts \u2013 at the moment, Greta Gerwig\u2019s universally beloved Lady Bird, the original To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before and the fine Taylor Swift documentary Miss Americana get the top spot. It\u2019s also a handy reminder of just how many celebrated Netflix Originals have been female-directed, ranging from Mati Diop\u2019s mesmerising postcolonial ghost story Atlantics to Tamara Jenkins\u2019s acutely observed marital drama Private Life to Kitty Green\u2019s ingenious, form-busting documentary Casting JonBenet. As you scroll down, less expected highlights show up, including Beach Rats, recent Berlinale winner Eliza Hittman\u2019s rawly moving study of unarticulated male queerness, and Fast Color, a beautifully conceived fantasy from director Julia Hart that bypassed UK cinemas to show up very quietly online. Suitable for older kids and their parents, its story of a supernaturally abled young woman (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) turning to her estranged mother and daughter for shelter \u2013 as shadowy pursuers seek to exploit her powers \u2013 reshapes superhero lore for a more diverse real world. Finding less contemporary essentials from female directors, however, entails a bit more hunting. Beyond its fascinating silent-film omnibus Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers, which I\u2019ve singled out before, Netflix is unsurprisingly not the place. Last year, the BBC took a large global critics\u2019 poll to determine the 100 best films by women. It\u2019s a useful starter canon, but it\u2019s surprising how many high-ranking titles on the list \u2013 including Chantal Akerman\u2019s Jeanne Dielman, Larisa Shepitko\u2019s The Ascent and Barbara Loden\u2019s Wanda \u2013 are unavailable to stream in the UK. At least you can head to the BFI Player to see V\u011bra Chytilov\u00e1\u2019s head-scrambling, path-breaking dadaist freakout Daisies from 1966, which has gained an ardent following over the years: you couldn\u2019t spend International Women\u2019s Day in any trippier a way. And while the work of trailblazing Hollywood actor-director Ida Lupino still gets less of a profile than it deserves, her riveting, razor-cut 1953 film noir The Hitch-Hiker \u2013 widely credited as the first in the genre to be directed by a woman \u2013 is free to stream on Amazon Prime. Perfectly curt, crisp and nasty at 71 minutes, it\u2019s a bracingly clear-eyed gaze at the evil men do. And if you\u2019ve never seen Jane Campion\u2019s The Piano, a still-luminescent brute beauty that topped the BBC\u2019s poll to no one\u2019s surprise, iTunes can fill that gap. Still, the streaming world could be doing more to lift women\u2019s voices, past and present. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week Doctor Sleep (Warner Bros, 15) It fizzled in cinemas, but Mike Flanagan\u2019s stylish, shivery sequel to The Shining isn\u2019t the misguided folly it sounds like on paper. It\u2019s a tribute that gradually cultivates its own meditative mood. Sorry We Missed You (Universal, 15) Ken Loach\u2019s furious snapshot of Britain\u2019s zero-hours economy and its human casualties is politically pointed as ever, but dramatically he\u2019s off form, with flat characters feeling subservient to the message. Midway (Lionsgate, 12) The kitsch hypermasculinity of Roland Emmerich\u2019s cotton-brained second world war epic gives it a certain camp zest \u2013 whole passages of it look like Tom of Finland for kids \u2013 but it does go on a bit.",

At a <a href=\"https://commongroundcommittee.org/event/facts-fake-news-the-media/\">Common Ground Committee forum</a> at Columbia Journalism School in New York recently, Wallace was repeatedly challenged about sharing a channel with prime-time opinion hosts such as Sean Hannity. Was he legitimising them, one audience member wondered, and therefore complicit in \u201ctruth-washing\u201d?</p> <p>Wallace repeatedly deflected, insisting on a church and state separation between news and opinion that viewers are intelligent enough to understand.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think many people would mistake me for the prime-time opinion people,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they know the difference.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking alongside Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, Wallace made the questionable assertion that Fox News and the Times are two sides of the same coin. Yet countless articles and books and watchdogs have chronicled Fox News\u2019 influence as a purveyor of untruths, conspiracy theories and race baiting.</p> <p>For a long time, like Trump, it pushed the baseless rumor that Barack Obama was not born in America. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/31/fox-news-viewer-surprised-that-mueller-hadnt-exonerated-trump-obstruction/?arc404=true\">Fox News viewer Cathy Garnaat </a>was stunned to learn from a town hall event that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report contained anything at all negative about Trump.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You want to talk to me about what I do?

Send her back!\u201d about Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born Muslim, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/19/trump-fox-news-ilhan-omar-attack\">offered no condemnation but cheerfully proclaimed:</a> \u201cThe president was on fire.\u201d</p> <p>Wallace said he was not in regular contact with all the prime-time hosts but gets on well with Ingraham.</p> <p>In a joint interview with the Guardian and Hollywood Reporter, he said he no longer wished to talk about the issue.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he explains, friendly but firm. \u201cYou want to talk to me about what I do?

It\u2019s silly.\u201d</p> <p>Does he find himself in a tough spot now Fox News itself has inescapably become part of the Trump story, amplifying the president\u2019s views and influencing his thinking?</p> <p>\u201cNo. I do what I do and I\u2019m sitting there during the week trying to come up with the best guests and the best show I possibly can and I\u2019m not sitting there thinking about how do we fit in some media commentary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e451c1d8df94454d407c9231adb5fe10bc45b747\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e451c1d8df94454d407c9231adb5fe10bc45b747/172_0_2828_1989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wallace on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press ahead of the 1988 election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wallace on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press ahead of the 1988 election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC NewsWire/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cable news, accused of rewarding whoever shouts loudest and brings the most shock value, has been blamed for accelerating America\u2019s coming apart, Fox News and MSNBC offering alternative facts and realities. Wallace is uncertain.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I guess I think they\u2019re contributing to it, all of them together, in perhaps equal measure. I mean, the only hesitation I have in saying that is I don\u2019t know that the polarisation wouldn\u2019t be there if we weren\u2019t on the air.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a 50-50 nation, it\u2019s a divided nation. People are constantly saying, \u2018Why can\u2019t we come together and get things done,\u2019 and part of the problem is we\u2019re just so divided on so many issues. Do I think media commentary plays a role in that? Perhaps. But when you look at the results and it\u2019s 51-49 and Trump wins the electoral vote but Hillary Clinton wins the popular vote, it\u2019s just the way the nation is at this point.\u201d</p> <p>Hours earlier, at a press conference in India, Trump again attacked CNN, prompting Jim Acosta, its chief White House correspondent, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMb5vgf81fE\">to retort:</a> \u201cMr President, I think our record on delivering the truth is a lot better than yours sometimes if you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chris-wallace-says-hes-horrified-by-jim-acostas-press-conference-behavior-1281157\">Wallace was \u201chorrified\u201d,</a> he says, because reporters should be \u201cumpires\u201d and not getting into fights with presidents.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We didn\u2019t identify the support for Donald Trump early enough and we didn\u2019t understand \u2026 he really was striking a chord</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cLook, I think we\u2019re not meek but the point I guess I\u2019d make is first of all he\u2019s the president of the United States, whether you like him or you don\u2019t like him, and I think there\u2019s a certain respect due to the office, even if you don\u2019t feel it for a particular man.</p> <p>\u201cSecondly, I think it falls into this trap of becoming an advocate or an opponent as opposed to being a reporter. We\u2019re not there to try to one-up the president or any politician. If it happened to Nancy Pelosi in a press conference, I would have said the same thing. It\u2019s not our place.\u201d</p> <p>Now Wallace is in the thick of a presidential election. There has been much media soul searching since 2016, when Trump\u2019s outrageous conduct gained millions of dollars of free TV coverage at the same time reporters gave obsessive attention to Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal.</p> <p>Wallace takes some different lessons.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I look back on 2016, things like over-coverage of rallies is certainly something but I think the thing that most serious political reporters feel worst about is that we didn\u2019t identify the support for Donald Trump early enough and that we didn\u2019t understand the degree to which he really was striking a chord among millions of Americans and the degree to which that was going to translate into votes, particularly in the upper rust belt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"49246b20141ebdc61bc49edb593f51031f340187\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49246b20141ebdc61bc49edb593f51031f340187/0_0_4666_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wallace moderates the third 2016 presidential debate, in Las Vegas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wallace moderates the third 2016 presidential debate, in Las Vegas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs you look ahead to 2020, you want to be sure you\u2019re striving to be as effective and as ahead of the curve as possible in identifying what is on the mind of voters and what\u2019s resonating with voters.\u201d </p> <p> Wallace, the son of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/business/media/mike-wallace-cbs-pioneer-of-60-minutes-dead-at-93.html\">journalistic giant Mike Wallace</a>, is now 72.

At a Common Ground Committee forum at Columbia Journalism School in New York recently, Wallace was repeatedly challenged about sharing a channel with prime-time opinion hosts such as Sean Hannity. Was he legitimising them, one audience member wondered, and therefore complicit in \u201ctruth-washing\u201d? Wallace repeatedly deflected, insisting on a church and state separation between news and opinion that viewers are intelligent enough to understand. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people would mistake me for the prime-time opinion people,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they know the difference.\u201d Speaking alongside Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, Wallace made the questionable assertion that Fox News and the Times are two sides of the same coin. Yet countless articles and books and watchdogs have chronicled Fox News\u2019 influence as a purveyor of untruths, conspiracy theories and race baiting. For a long time, like Trump, it pushed the baseless rumor that Barack Obama was not born in America. Last year, Fox News viewer Cathy Garnaat was stunned to learn from a town hall event that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report contained anything at all negative about Trump. And when Trump supporters chanted \u201cSend her back! Send her back!\u201d about Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born Muslim, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham offered no condemnation but cheerfully proclaimed: \u201cThe president was on fire.\u201d Wallace said he was not in regular contact with all the prime-time hosts but gets on well with Ingraham. In a joint interview with the Guardian and Hollywood Reporter, he said he no longer wished to talk about the issue. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he explains, friendly but firm. \u201cYou want to talk to me about what I do? I\u2019m happy to talk about it. I don\u2019t want to talk about what somebody else does. It\u2019s silly.\u201d Does he find himself in a tough spot now Fox News itself has inescapably become part of the Trump story, amplifying the president\u2019s views and influencing his thinking? \u201cNo. I do what I do and I\u2019m sitting there during the week trying to come up with the best guests and the best show I possibly can and I\u2019m not sitting there thinking about how do we fit in some media commentary.\u201d Cable news, accused of rewarding whoever shouts loudest and brings the most shock value, has been blamed for accelerating America\u2019s coming apart, Fox News and MSNBC offering alternative facts and realities. Wallace is uncertain. \u201cYeah, I guess I think they\u2019re contributing to it, all of them together, in perhaps equal measure. I mean, the only hesitation I have in saying that is I don\u2019t know that the polarisation wouldn\u2019t be there if we weren\u2019t on the air. \u201cIt\u2019s a 50-50 nation, it\u2019s a divided nation. People are constantly saying, \u2018Why can\u2019t we come together and get things done,\u2019 and part of the problem is we\u2019re just so divided on so many issues. Do I think media commentary plays a role in that? Perhaps. But when you look at the results and it\u2019s 51-49 and Trump wins the electoral vote but Hillary Clinton wins the popular vote, it\u2019s just the way the nation is at this point.\u201d Hours earlier, at a press conference in India, Trump again attacked CNN, prompting Jim Acosta, its chief White House correspondent, to retort: \u201cMr President, I think our record on delivering the truth is a lot better than yours sometimes if you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201d Wallace was \u201chorrified\u201d, he says, because reporters should be \u201cumpires\u201d and not getting into fights with presidents. \u201cLook, I think we\u2019re not meek but the point I guess I\u2019d make is first of all he\u2019s the president of the United States, whether you like him or you don\u2019t like him, and I think there\u2019s a certain respect due to the office, even if you don\u2019t feel it for a particular man. \u201cSecondly, I think it falls into this trap of becoming an advocate or an opponent as opposed to being a reporter. We\u2019re not there to try to one-up the president or any politician. If it happened to Nancy Pelosi in a press conference, I would have said the same thing. It\u2019s not our place.\u201d Now Wallace is in the thick of a presidential election. There has been much media soul searching since 2016, when Trump\u2019s outrageous conduct gained millions of dollars of free TV coverage at the same time reporters gave obsessive attention to Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal. Wallace takes some different lessons. \u201cWhen I look back on 2016, things like over-coverage of rallies is certainly something but I think the thing that most serious political reporters feel worst about is that we didn\u2019t identify the support for Donald Trump early enough and that we didn\u2019t understand the degree to which he really was striking a chord among millions of Americans and the degree to which that was going to translate into votes, particularly in the upper rust belt. \u201cAs you look ahead to 2020, you want to be sure you\u2019re striving to be as effective and as ahead of the curve as possible in identifying what is on the mind of voters and what\u2019s resonating with voters.\u201d Wallace, the son of journalistic giant Mike Wallace, is now 72. He\u2019s about to publish a book, Countdown 1945, an account of the 116 days leading up to the US attack on Hiroshima in Japan, the world\u2019s first use of the atomic bomb in wartime. But he describes journalism as the best way to make a living and has no intention of quitting the day job. \u201cYou\u2019re talking to a man whose father was still working at 88. When I went to a job interview with Roger Ailes, I was 55 years old and I said I can only give you 30 years. So I\u2019ve got more than a decade left to go.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Medics on YouTube, British manufacturers, and sellers of face masks are among those experiencing an unexpected surge in interest as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>While chaos caused by the virus has resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-knocks-5tn-off-worlds-stock-markets-this-week\">stock prices falling</a>, there has been an upswing for some products and companies.</p> <p>Kate Hills, of the UK manufacturing platform Make It British, said a survey of its members showed 50% of fashion and textile manufacturers had had an increase in inquiries.</p> <p>\u201cCustomers are inquiring about delays in getting these products from China so they are looking to the UK instead,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cI think \u2013 because of this situation \u2013 it\u2019s making people realise how fragile the global supply chains are and that we need an option of local manufactured goods so we can mitigate the risks if something like this happens.\u201d</p> <p>Sam Bramah, the director of Specialised Canvas in Chesterfield, said a lot of people did not want to risk shipments for certain goods being held, so were turning to UK suppliers.</p> <p>His company is one of the only manufacturers in the UK of pathogen isolation chambers, used to transport and treat people with severe infection and health problems. It made chambers that were used for Ebola patients.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe have a small fashion division but it is mainly industrial sewing \u2013 so items for the fire service, police military, lorry sheets, and if it\u2019s made out of textiles we can do it. A lot of people are realising that they may end up with their cash wrapped up on a ship somewhere which may get quarantined, so shipping is becoming an issue.\u201d </p> <p>UK tourism boards suspect there could be an increase in staycations this year, as holidaymakers might think twice about travelling abroad. Malcolm Bell, the chief executive of Visit Cornwall, said since the number of coronavirus cases in Italy exploded in recent weeks, there had been a 10% increase in traffic to the Cornish tourism board\u2019s website.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to tell if this will translate into an increase in bookings at this stage, but that is a significant increase in traffic and very unusual for this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good indication that we could see a rise in staycations being booked from the end of March onwards.\u201d</p> <p>YouTube doctors offering advice on how to cope have also had a surge in interest. The coronavirus is the first novel outbreak of the hyper-digital age. With the proliferation of misinformation, false reports and conspiracy theories online creating an \u201cinfodemic\u201d, a number of doctors and scientists have taken to social media to offer expert advice to alleviate panic.</p> <p>Some videos have been watched millions of times, including one posted by NYC celebrity doctor and YouTuber Dr Mikhail Varshavski \u2013 Dr Mike. A 10-minute video he uploaded in January entitled The Truth About the Coronavirus has had more than 5.2m views and more than 33,000 comments.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Carlisle, Cumbria, a semi-retired medical teacher, John Campbell, has seen subscribers to his YouTube channel surge by more than 129,000 after posting near-daily videos providing evidence-based updates on Covid-19.</p> <p>His channel has gone from averaging 500,000 views a month to 9.6m views in the last 28 days, with the vast majority of views coming from the US (3.6m) and the UK (916,000).</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to inform and educate people to allow them to make informed decisions, like a textbook,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people spreading absolutely bonkers \u2013 and sometimes dangerous \u2013 information, then there\u2019s a minority like me trying to demystify the scientific evidence.</p> <p>\u201cI try to take things from the medical literature and make it easier for people to understand. It\u2019s no good to be reactive all the time; we need to be proactive if we\u2019re going to stop it from spreading. As long as I feel it\u2019s doing something useful I\u2019m going to carry on making the videos.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Navarra, a social media consultant, said given that coronavirus as a topic was ubiquitous, it was unsurprising to find people or organisations leveraging it.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of misinformation and scare stories, and then people trying to sell products that are benefiting from the crisis around the world,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cQualified medical practitioners providing relevant, timely, accurate information \u2013 and not profiteering in any way \u2013 to raise awareness with people not engaged in other forms of media and to help them understand, generally, can only be a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>In tandem, there has been a surge in people seeking out products associated with fending off the virus. Boots ran out of face masks in stores and online last week due to high demand.</p> <p>And data from Kantar Worldpanel showed sales of hand sanitisers in supermarkets soared by 255% last month \u2013 more than triple \u2013 as worried customers cleared the shelves. Sales of liquid soap also increased by 7% and household cleaning products rose 10%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Medics on YouTube, British manufacturers, and sellers of face masks are among those experiencing an unexpected surge in interest as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. While chaos caused by the virus has resulted in stock prices falling, there has been an upswing for some products and companies. Kate Hills, of the UK manufacturing platform Make It British, said a survey of its members showed 50% of fashion and textile manufacturers had had an increase in inquiries. \u201cCustomers are inquiring about delays in getting these products from China so they are looking to the UK instead,\u201d she said. \u201cI think \u2013 because of this situation \u2013 it\u2019s making people realise how fragile the global supply chains are and that we need an option of local manufactured goods so we can mitigate the risks if something like this happens.\u201d Sam Bramah, the director of Specialised Canvas in Chesterfield, said a lot of people did not want to risk shipments for certain goods being held, so were turning to UK suppliers. His company is one of the only manufacturers in the UK of pathogen isolation chambers, used to transport and treat people with severe infection and health problems. It made chambers that were used for Ebola patients. He said: \u201cWe have a small fashion division but it is mainly industrial sewing \u2013 so items for the fire service, police military, lorry sheets, and if it\u2019s made out of textiles we can do it. A lot of people are realising that they may end up with their cash wrapped up on a ship somewhere which may get quarantined, so shipping is becoming an issue.\u201d UK tourism boards suspect there could be an increase in staycations this year, as holidaymakers might think twice about travelling abroad. Malcolm Bell, the chief executive of Visit Cornwall, said since the number of coronavirus cases in Italy exploded in recent weeks, there had been a 10% increase in traffic to the Cornish tourism board\u2019s website. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to tell if this will translate into an increase in bookings at this stage, but that is a significant increase in traffic and very unusual for this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good indication that we could see a rise in staycations being booked from the end of March onwards.\u201d YouTube doctors offering advice on how to cope have also had a surge in interest. The coronavirus is the first novel outbreak of the hyper-digital age. With the proliferation of misinformation, false reports and conspiracy theories online creating an \u201cinfodemic\u201d, a number of doctors and scientists have taken to social media to offer expert advice to alleviate panic. Some videos have been watched millions of times, including one posted by NYC celebrity doctor and YouTuber Dr Mikhail Varshavski \u2013 Dr Mike. A 10-minute video he uploaded in January entitled The Truth About the Coronavirus has had more than 5.2m views and more than 33,000 comments. Meanwhile in Carlisle, Cumbria, a semi-retired medical teacher, John Campbell, has seen subscribers to his YouTube channel surge by more than 129,000 after posting near-daily videos providing evidence-based updates on Covid-19. His channel has gone from averaging 500,000 views a month to 9.6m views in the last 28 days, with the vast majority of views coming from the US (3.6m) and the UK (916,000). \u201cI wanted to inform and educate people to allow them to make informed decisions, like a textbook,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people spreading absolutely bonkers \u2013 and sometimes dangerous \u2013 information, then there\u2019s a minority like me trying to demystify the scientific evidence. \u201cI try to take things from the medical literature and make it easier for people to understand. It\u2019s no good to be reactive all the time; we need to be proactive if we\u2019re going to stop it from spreading. As long as I feel it\u2019s doing something useful I\u2019m going to carry on making the videos.\u201d Matt Navarra, a social media consultant, said given that coronavirus as a topic was ubiquitous, it was unsurprising to find people or organisations leveraging it. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of misinformation and scare stories, and then people trying to sell products that are benefiting from the crisis around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cQualified medical practitioners providing relevant, timely, accurate information \u2013 and not profiteering in any way \u2013 to raise awareness with people not engaged in other forms of media and to help them understand, generally, can only be a good thing.\u201d In tandem, there has been a surge in people seeking out products associated with fending off the virus. Boots ran out of face masks in stores and online last week due to high demand. And data from Kantar Worldpanel showed sales of hand sanitisers in supermarkets soared by 255% last month \u2013 more than triple \u2013 as worried customers cleared the shelves. Sales of liquid soap also increased by 7% and household cleaning products rose 10%.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Marieke Lucas Rijneveld</strong>,<strong> </strong>Netherlands: \u2018It\u2019s difficult for my parents to understand that I\u2019m not the girl that they raised\u2019</h2> <p><br>When Marieke Lucas Rijneveld was three years old, their 12-year-old brother was knocked over and killed by a bus as he walked to school from the family farm. Rijneveld\u2019s response to this early confrontation with the unthinkable was not to draw a veil over it, but to build two books around it. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate for a family to have a writer born into it,\u201d says the 28-year-old author, serenely.</p> <p>In the devoutly religious rural community among which the Rijneveld family still live, the exposure was sudden and extreme. When <em>Calf\u2019s Caul</em>, a poetry collection<em>, </em>was published in 2015, its young author was heralded in the national media as a new star of Dutch literature. More challenging still for the family was the novel that arrived three years later, <em>De avond is ongemak</em>, which appears in English this week as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/23/best-new-translated-books-fiction\" title=\"\">The Discomfort of Evening</a></em> (Faber, translated by Michelle Hutchison), and has just been longlisted for the International Booker prize. \u201cAll the shopkeepers and the hairdresser were talking about it, but my family are too frightened to read it,\u201d says Rijneveld, who uses the pronouns they/them.</p> <p>In <em>The Discomfort of Evening</em>, Matthies dies in a skating accident, leaving his 10-year-old sister Jas fantasising about how to prevent the family from being destroyed in the aftermath. She keeps two toads in a box under her bed, thinking that if they can be persuaded to mate, her parents might too, and everything will be all right again. Meanwhile, left to cope with the emotional turbulence of adolescence without adult support, she plays games with her surviving brother and sister that become increasingly wild and dangerous.</p> <p>The novel is set over the two years in Jas\u2019s life when hormones corral children into adult sexual identities. Rijneveld resists such categorisation, self\u2011describing not as trans but as \u201cin between\u201d. \u201cAs a small child I felt I was a boy, I dressed like a boy and behaved like a boy, but children at that age are still neutral in their gender. In adolescence, when the separation became clear, I dressed like a girl and became a girl, then at 20 I went back to the boy I was at primary school.\u201d Their middle name, Lucas, comes from an imaginary boyfriend they had as a young child. Elegantly dressed in trademark suit and braces, Rijneveld\u2019s composure only breaks when they struggle to remember the name of the film star they aspire to be. It finally emerges in a burst of giggles: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2018/apr/06/is-timothee-chalamet-the-new-leonardo-dicaprio\" title=\"\">Timoth\u00e9e </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2018/apr/06/is-timothee-chalamet-the-new-leonardo-dicaprio\" title=\"\">Chalamet,</a> star of <em>Call Me by Your Name</em> \u2013 I want to be a beautiful boy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Farming keeps me grounded. The cows are my best friends; I like cleaning out the stables and shovelling the shit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They have not yet decided whether to take hormone treatment, so when they read their work publicly it is in an unbroken voice, radiating an androgynous charm that has made them one of the poetry circuit\u2019s rare breakout stars. \u201cWhat a sweetheart,\u201d wrote a commenter in response to a Dutch TV chatshow on the environment, in which Rijneveld signed up to the David Attenborough fan club, urged listeners to heed his warnings about the climate emergency and reported that they had never flown in a plane.</p> <p>Only their hands betray their other life as a one-day-a-week dairy farmer, with scrubbed nails that are bitten to the quick. \u201cFarming keeps me grounded. The cows are my best friends; I like cleaning out the stables and shovelling the shit.\u201d</p> <p>This unglamorous side of farming slops through both the novel and the poems. Jas\u2019s mother doses her children with worm medicine and slathers them with udder ointment to protect against the cold. One of the poems in <em>Calf\u2019s Caul</em> is titled \u201cLice Mothers\u201d. \u201cPeople from the city get scared of these things that villagers think of as normal.\u201d For example? \u201cFor example, torturing frogs \u2013 it\u2019s not very nice but it happens and children will experiment with it.\u201d</p> <p>Despite being published three years apart, the novel and poetry collection began in tandem, even sharing some lines. \u201cThe challenge was how to write them when I didn\u2019t have many memories of my brother\u2019s death. So I started with Matthies, and only during the writing arrived at the shape the novel has now. I saw <em>Calf\u2019s Caul</em> as preparation for writing <em>The Discomfort of Evening</em>.\u201d</p> <p>The collection, which has yet to be published in English, is full of the anxieties that Rijneveld\u2019s chosen identity has created in a family who are god-fearing members of the Reformed church. \u201cPapa has been searching for a daughter for years,\u201d reads one poem. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for my parents to understand that I\u2019m not the girl that they raised,\u201d Rijneveld says. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the Bible.\u201d</p> <p>Whether the papa of the poems is any more Rijneveld\u2019s own father than Jas\u2019s papa in the novel is left open by a writer who admits that they regard their public identity as a performance, to be donned along with the braces. \u201cWriting is playing with who you are. Being an author makes me feel more confident.\u201d</p> <p>Rijneveld was born on 20 April 1991 on a farm in the north Brabant, a province in the south of the Netherlands. The date is significant, they disarmingly disclose, because it means they share a birthday with Adolf Hitler. \u201cAs a child I thought it was a funny idea to be born on the same day as such a monstrous man, but it made me wonder if I was a good or a bad person.\u201d In the novel, Jas builds a fantasy about a Jewish family her mother has hidden away in the basement. She acts out her social alienation by making a Nazi salute at school and cracking a joke which was judged too offensive for the English edition of the novel.</p> <p>It\u2019s part of a strand of black humour that is as dangerous in its way as the children\u2019s games (one gruesome scene involves a dummy cow and an insemination gun). Asked why the novel pushes so hard at boundaries of what is acceptable, the author shrugs: \u201cIt is related by a child and children are naive. They say these things. They don\u2019t know any better, so they can get away with an innocent joke.\u201d</p> <p>At nine years old, Rijneveld says, \u201cI had a very strong belief in God and was convinced he was living in the attic.\u201d The novel is full of glimpses into what it was like growing up in a strict religious household. Jas\u2019s father restricts their TV channels for fear of nudity, which he pronounces \u201cas if a fruit fly had just flown into his mouth \u2013 he spat as he said it\u201d; her mother daringly watches a quiz show involving words that are not in the Bible. \u201cShe called them \u2018blush words\u2019 because some of them made your cheeks turn red.\u201d When her children try out these words, she attempts \u201cto wash them out of our mouths with a bar of green soap, like the grease stains from our good school clothes\u201d.</p> <p>Of their own experience Rijneveld simply says: \u201cBehind the book is such a strong force. After leaving school I didn\u2019t know what to do. I started living in a room in a new city and I just knew I had to write it. In daily life it\u2019s hard to be as strong as I am behind my laptop.\u201d They now live in Utrecht, and work on a farm that is not their parents\u2019.</p> <p>There are only two responses to the death of a child, Rijneveld says: either it draws a family closer or rips them apart. So what happened in their own family? \u201cI have to think about the answer to that \u2026 \u201d Rijneveld says solemnly. \u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t torn us apart, but all the relationships changed.\u201d One brother and sister are now teachers, and a second brother is in the police. None of them has read the novel. \u201cI hope that my parents will read it one day and be proud; that they will understand it\u2019s a novel, it\u2019s not all about them. But it is probably too soon.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Rijneveld\u2019s writing has gained them a new cultural family, which stretches beyond the Netherlands to Italy and Germany. <em>Calf\u2019s Caul</em> has gone through 11 editions to date in Dutch while <em>The Discomfort of Evening</em> has sold 55,000 copies in the Netherlands; it will be published in French in April and is currently being translated into Spanish, Korean, Chinese and Arabic. A second poetry collection is already out, and Rijneveld is working on a second novel. All of which bears out their fervent belief that \u201cthere\u2019s always light in darkness, just as there\u2019s always humour in gruesomeness. It\u2019s just the way things work. There must always be something to laugh about.\u201d <strong>Claire Armitstead</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Marieke Lucas Rijneveld\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-discomfort-of-evening-9780571349364.html\">The Discomfort of Evening</a></em>, translated by Michelle Hutchison, is published by Faber in the UK and out now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fb6984345af5cfd3c9fc9704cee2231583b850b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb6984345af5cfd3c9fc9704cee2231583b850b7/0_196_5642_3386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrzej Tichy \u2026 Wretchedness will be published in the UK in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrzej Tichy \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m not interested in autobiography or autofiction.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carla Orrego Veliz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Andrzej Tich\u00fd</strong>, Sweden: \u2018From the outside, Sweden was this paradise. But it was never actually true\u2019</h2> <p>As a young man travelling around Europe in the late 1990s, the Malm\u00f6-based writer Andrzej Tich\u00fd remembers telling friends about the conditions endured by marginalised groups in Sweden. \u201cAnd they just would not believe me,\u201d he recalls. \u201cFrom the outside Sweden was this harmonious, social democratic paradise and people preferred to believe the folk hymn that here was a society that looked after everyone. But it was never actually true.\u201d He cites historic state-sanctioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/06/stephenbates\" title=\"\">forced sterilisations </a>of those deemed to be mentally or physically impaired, and discrimination against Jews, Roma and indigenous peoples. \u201cAnd there has always been the day-to-day treatment of the poor and of immigrants, let alone the junkies and criminals,\u201d he adds. \u201cOf course there were places in the world that were worse, but Sweden was never perfect.\u201d</p> <p>The poor and the immigrants, the junkies and the criminals, loom large in Tich\u00fd\u2019s prize-winning novel <em>Wretchedness</em> (<em>El\u00e4ndet</em>, translated by Nichola Smalley) which will be published in the UK in June by And Other Stories. It is his fifth novel, but the first to appear in English, and opens with a cellist on his way to a classical concert being asked for money by a drug addict on the street. The encounter summons a swirling sequence of flashbacks from the cellist\u2019s own chaotic past. Graphic depictions of crime, racism, poverty, drug use and violence are rendered through paragraph-free slabs of text that propulsively veer between voices and minds, times and locations: \u201cSuddenly my mouth is full of it again,\u201d the musician declares, \u201cof names and places, of events and movements, of memories and images.\u201d The inescapable realisation is how easy it would have been for him to have become that junkie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48a892bfd61012e2c444b2a45817ff5e331757df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48a892bfd61012e2c444b2a45817ff5e331757df/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees outside the entrance to the Swedish Migration Agency\u2019s arrival centre in Malm\u00f6.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees outside the entrance to the Swedish Migration Agency\u2019s arrival centre in Malm\u00f6.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tt News Agency/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tich\u00fd was born in Prague in 1978 to a Czech father and Polish mother. His family moved to Sweden when he was three, and he was brought up on a Malm\u00f6 housing estate with a large migrant population not unlike the one featured in <em>Wretchedness</em>. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in autobiography or autofiction, but I know there are always borderline areas between the writer and the subject and I am not a stranger to many of the things in the novel. Much comes from personal experience, although sometimes indirectly.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the Swedish estates, the novel draws on Tich\u00fd\u2019s experiences of living in Hamburg and London to paint a picture of a pan-European community of the excluded passing through squats, underground clubs, petty scams and cash-only employment.</p> <p>This internationalism is also reflected in the language he deploys. \u201cA lot of it is written in a sort of slang encompassing many different languages. Some words have long been incorporated into standard Swedish, from Roma for example. But now there are also a lot of Arab words, Serbo-Croat, Polish, Spanish, Albanian. It\u2019s all mixed together, but interestingly while one sentence can contain several different languages, people will know what you mean.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These lives not only deserve to be chronicled, they also deserve to be elevated</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tich\u00fd\u2019s early creative life centered on music \u2013 playing guitar in the hardcore scene rather than classical cello \u2013 which led to him starting up fanzines for which he first wrote poetry and then prose. There is a sense of musicality inherent in the dense text of <em>Wretchedness</em>, as episodes from the composer\u2019s past repeatedly return, with references ranging from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/snoopdogg\" title=\"\"> Snoop Dogg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/12/mobb-deep-review-brutally-to-the-point\" title=\"\">Mobb Deep</a>\u2019s hip-hop to the concert hall avant garde of Julius Eastman and Italian composer<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/26/scelsi-string-quartets-string-trio-review\" title=\"\"> Giacinto Scelsi</a>\u2019s atonal drones.

But they are interested in the themes, which is partly why rap lyrics have always been a huge influence on me. They can be complex and sophisticated yet can describe street stuff in a wonderfully direct and concise manner and so make art out of what is thought of as low life.</p> <p>\u201cThat is partly my project too. I\u2019ve always wanted to depict lives and environments under-explored by literature. These lives not only deserve to be chronicled, they deserve to be elevated.\u201d <strong>Nicholas Wroe</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Andrzej Tichy\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.andotherstories.org/wretchedness/\">Wretchedness</a>, </em>translated by Nichola Smalley<em>, </em>will be published by And Other Stories in the UK in June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6ca527447305c95db2e6e8dd2e40c58f48da829\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6ca527447305c95db2e6e8dd2e40c58f48da829/259_890_4204_5254/800.jpg\" alt=\"Naoise Dolan \u2026 Exciting Times is published in the UK in April.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naoise Dolan \u2026 \u2018Writing was always just kind of something that I plugged away at.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Naoise Dolan</strong>, Ireland: \u2018There are plenty of novels about straight people already\u2019</h2> <p>It is no longer the curse of the Irish author to be compared to James Joyce: these days, if they happen to be sharp, socially conscious and writing about twentysomethings living now, they will be announced as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/25/sally-rooney-interview-normal-people-conversations-with-friends\" title=\"\">the new Sally Rooney</a>, and also as some kind of child prodigy, even when they are well into their 20s. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/26/10-best-debut-novelists-2020-paul-mendez-abi-dare-anappara-elaine-feeney-beth-morrey-douglas-stuart\" title=\"\">Naoise Dolan</a>, 27, finds this all hilarious. \u201cIn any other career, it is completely normal to get going in your 20s \u2013 we\u2019ve just normalised the desperate state of affairs around writing,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the idea that young women couldn\u2019t ever have had an emotional or interesting life, or that it\u2019s somehow cringeworthy to capture the present moment \u2013 both are ridiculous to me.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the inevitable comparisons, Dolan\u2019s debut, <em>Exciting Times,</em> published in April by Weidenfeld, is more caustic and cynical than Rooney\u2019s writing, if just as clever. It follows Ava, a 22-year-old who had \u201cbeen sad in Dublin, decided it was Dublin\u2019s fault and thought Hong Kong would help\u201d. There she meets 29-year-old banker Julian, an only child who went to Eton. (\u201cThese were the two least surprising facts anyone had ever told me about themselves,\u201d Ava notes.) Their relationship is sexual, if carefully ambiguous, and is built mostly on their mutual enjoyment of acidic banter over any deeply-felt romance. Ava admires Julian\u2019s cushions and willingness to give her his credit cards; his highest praise for her is that she is \u201cgood company\u201d: \u201cReally it was amusing that we were having sex,\u201d Ava muses. \u201cHe was attractive and confident, whereas I was willing to centre my emotional life around someone who treated me like a favoured armrest.\u201d When Julian temporarily moves away, Ava meets Edith, a young and wealthy Hong Kong lawyer. It is here that Dolan\u2019s novel feels most contemporaneous; all the fretting over love and class could be compared to Austen or Wharton, but her light treatment of bisexuality and polyamory is utterly 2020. Ava, Julian and Edith are never really a love triangle but a hinge, with Ava in the middle of two people who benignly tolerate each other. The only drama in their arrangement lies in the choice Ava feels she must make, despite Julian\u2019s indifference and Edith saying things like: \u201cI have many opinions about the nexus between monogamy and patriarchy, opinions which are available on request should they interest you.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I think it is more interesting to write about relationships without the assumption that it has to be a monogamous one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dolan is less interested in sexuality than in relationships: \u201cSexuality only affects the ability to be attracted to someone \u2013 how that manifests is more about who that person is. As a queer person, I have no understanding how it might feel different to experience heterosexual attraction, though I\u2019m quite interested in that. But there are plenty of novels about straight people already. And I think it is more interesting to write about relationships without the assumption that it has to be a monogamous one.\u201d She suspects older readers will be baffled by the dynamic. \u201cThere is this expectation that you should write to people who are powerful in ways that you\u2019re not, to explain to them why you\u2019re different. I think it\u2019s better to just throw it out there and if they don\u2019t like it, fine. For people my age, the most important question is: are you treating your partners well or poorly?\u201d When in conversation with older writers, she says, \u201cI sometimes feel like I\u2019m trying to prove that it\u2019s OK to write stories about people who aren\u2019t them. It\u2019s not a gendered thing, there is a class element too. A lot of things that we call \u2018the millennial experience\u2019 were always part of a universal experience for some social groups \u2013 middle-class people are just upset that those things are happening to them now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fa6c6af3e6ea7baac732ba8f558aa5508b46752\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fa6c6af3e6ea7baac732ba8f558aa5508b46752/1401_52_3105_1863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The novel is set in Hong Kong, where the narrator teaches English.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The novel is set in Hong Kong, where the narrator teaches English.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barcroft Media/Barcroft Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dolan grew up in Dublin, studied English at Trinity College and was published in Stinging Fly magazine \u2013 by Rooney, who was editor until 2019. (This makes Dolan \u201csuch an Irish cliche\u201d, she says.) She was always interested in literature, but never had any aspirations to write \u2013 \u201cfirstly because it\u2019s not financially possible for most people, and secondly, I don\u2019t stake a significant amount of my self-image in how I relate to the modes of production. It was a hobby, not a career goal. I have a limited amount of patience for the writer-as-personality thing \u2013 it is a very mechanical and somewhat distant thing for me. I just make things up. I don\u2019t relate to accounts that people give of being struck by ideas or their characters taking over. Writing was always just kind of something that I plugged away at.\u201d</p> <p>Dolan, who is autistic, \u201cdoesn\u2019t like talking to people\u201d, so to get away from colleagues and students at her teaching job, she spent five months hiding in coffeeshops on her lunch breaks. \u201cI find it easier to relate to people by thinking about why they are the way they are. I aim to observe people rather than empathise with them,\u201d she says. And her observations are brilliant, often simultaneously comic and bleak. \u201cJulian often reminded me to eat. It made him feel better about liking that I was thin,\u201d Ava notes. Or, at a party: \u201cRalph\u2019s girlfriend Victoria was good at wearing clothes. She was so beautiful I couldn\u2019t see why she was talking to me. Sometimes her eyes said: I don\u2019t know why, either.\u201d</p> <p>With the emergence of Rooney, Eimear McBride, Lisa McInerney, Nicole Flattery and others, Ireland has been held up for its almost mythic ability to cultivate brilliant women writers \u2013 but Dolan puts this down to Ireland being a more egalitarian playing field than the UK. \u201cIreland isn\u2019t perfect, but we still have relatively good support for the arts so literary writing doesn\u2019t have as much of a bourgeois connotation as it does in the UK. We have a better range of writers here. UK journalists always ask the oddest questions, like, \u2018have you had a job before?\u2019 I\u2019m a normal person \u2013 yes I have.\u201d</p> <p>Dolan stopped travelling by plane in September, after the fires in the Amazon moved her to reconsider her impact on the environment. \u201cIt might hold me back from promoting the book, but to be pumping all that CO<sub>2</sub> into the air to push a novel just seems like such a ridiculous thing. If my novel doesn\u2019t get promoted, someone else\u2019s will. The literary world will be much unaffected.\u201d Her decision, she thinks, comes back to her feelings about being a novelist. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I\u2019m a special person who has an innate entitlement to exist writing novels while demanding other people do less pleasant things with their time. I\u2019m lucky to, but there are a lot of things that I\u2019m not willing to do to keep that situation going.

The former was longlisted for the Independent foreign fiction prize in 2010, and the latter won it in 2014, becoming the first title translated from Arabic to do so.</p> <p>In 2000, Blasim left Iraq, where he had been persecuted for his film-making and where his writing is still banned. He spent four years walking illegally across Europe, eventually settling in Finland. His debut novel, <em>God 99</em> (translated by Jonathan Wright and published in July by Comma), draws on his experience: its protagonist (called Hassan) is an Iraqi refugee attempting to establish himself as a writer in Finland. But he stresses that \u201cthe book puts reality and fiction in dialogue. Autobiography is a fiction \u2013 we lie about things; we misremember and misrepresent. So too fiction has truths. Luckily, I\u2019m not famous enough for people to know my life, so I can still play with it.\u201d</p> <p><em>God 99</em>, he says, is \u201cborn of dialogue \u2013 always in conversation are death and life, war and peace\u201d.

This shift to long-form is not important\u201d). In his mind, his identity is simply \u201cwriter\u201d. \u201cIn England,\u201d he says, \u201cand other parts of western and southern Europe, you have a history with immigrants. In Finland, it\u2019s relatively new, and while some people embrace me as a Finnish writer, others resist.\u201d Because he writes in Arabic, he is ineligible for Finnish literary prizes, and cannot join the Union of Writers.</p> <p>This context, combined with censorship of his work in the Middle East, means translation into English has been vital. But although Blasim attributes his success to translation, he stresses that it was never something he sought: \u201cWhen I came to Europe, I didn\u2019t know where to go. I had this romantic idea of reaching France, because of the literature. But you just go wherever you can. How can you think about the future, when life is like this? How can you think about succeeding as a writer? About reaching English-language readers?\u201d</p> <p>Translating Blasim\u2019s work \u2013 which is as experimental linguistically as it is formally \u2013 is no light task. The Arabic of <em>God 99</em> is what Blasim calls \u201cstreet Arabic\u201d, and it\u2019s another reason he\u2019s reviled by some in Iraq: \u201cThey call me a \u2018dirty writer\u2019 \u2013 they say that I do not respect the language. Nobody can touch classical Arabic because it is a holy language. But nobody uses holy language on the street. And when I dream it is not in classical Arabic.\u201d</p> <p>Does he still feel at risk? \u201cOf course,\u201d he says. He has returned to Iraq only once, secretly, and does not believe he will again. But his new home in Finland is not one of undiluted Scandinavian peace; he is working on a project about the Finnish far right, and confides that he fears for his safety if he publishes it. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll meet you in England, a refugee again,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a refugee, you are always between two fires.

Her novel <em>Three Apples Fell from the Sky</em> has sold more than 160,000 copies since it was first published in 2015 and won Russia\u2019s most prestigious literary award, the Yasnaya Polyana prize (founded by the Tolstoy estate). A magical realist story of friendship and feuds, published in English this month by Oneworld, the book is set in the remote Armenian mountain village of Maran, where the villagers pick mulberries and make baklava. An ancient telegraph wire and a perilous mountain path that even goats struggle to follow is their only connection to the outside world. Abgaryan cites <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/may/30/one-hundred-years-of-solitude-50-years-on\" title=\"\">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/may/30/one-hundred-years-of-solitude-50-years-on\" title=\"\"> </a>by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, set in the isolated fictional village of Macondo, as her favourite book. But she was haunted by the ending of M\u00e1rquez\u2019s multi-generational saga of the Buend\u00eda family, as all traces of Macondo\u2019s existence are wiped away. In <em>Three Apples Fell from the Sky </em>(translated by Lisa C Hayden),<em> </em>she resolved to write a fable that did exactly the opposite. \u201cI wanted to write a story that ends on a note of hope,\u201d she says. \u201cHumanity is in dire need of hope, of kind stories.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe live such fast-paced lives, barely managing to speak to one another, to ask how things are going,\u201d she says. \u201cThe thing that bothers me is how young people are leaving their elders behind.\u201d Abgaryan, who now lives in Moscow, points to how the villagers in her novel spend their days \u201ccultivating wine that nobody wants or needs\u201d. \u201cGlobalisation has benefits, of course, but also negative side-effects, when national customs, the things which define people, are taken away.\u201d</p> <p>Her work has already been translated into 12 languages, and with English being the 13th, she now calls this her lucky number. \u201cWhen you\u2019re published in English there\u2019s a greater chance that your work will resonate more widely,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen your work is translated, you start to work with greater joy and hope.

Delabroy-Allard eventually chose Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit, whose catalogue includes the writers she most admires, including Marguerite Duras. \u201cI signed the contract on my 30th birthday. That was a real party.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u00c7a raconte Sarah</em> (<em>All About Sarah</em>) won a literary award even before it was published in 2018 to almost unanimous praise. The book was shortlisted for a the Prix <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/prix-goncourt\" title=\"\">Goncourt</a>, the most prestigious literary award in France. Translated into English by Adriana Hunter and published this month by Harvill Secker, it is a story of desire and desolation. Its narrator is a bored secondary school teacher and single mother in Paris whose comfortable but humdrum life is upended when she falls in love with Sarah, a professional musician, who is loud and impetuous.</p> <p>The narrator and Sarah embark on an all-consuming, passionate relationship. The first part of the novel concludes when they separate and Sarah reveals she has breast cancer. In the second part, the narrator flees Sarah\u2019s apartment, telling nobody and leaving her child behind. It is unclear whether Sarah has died or dumped the unnamed narrator, who descends into despair.</p> <p>Like the book\u2019s narrator, Delabroy-Allard is a teacher, has a daughter and is in a relationship with a professional violinist called Sarah. But that is where the similarities end, she insists. \u201cI\u2019m not bothered if people think it\u2019s me, but it isn\u2019t. I find it difficult to invent things from nothing, so I use reality as a base. Once I have that base I can create the rest.\u201d</p> <p>She says she left Paris to live in isolation in the countryside to complete the second part of the novel. \u201cIt was very hard being in her head \u2013 almost physically painful. I was happy to finish it.\u201d She is now working on a second novel that she is racing to complete before she and her pregnant partner have a baby in July. The 31-year-old says she wanted to write about a passionate relationship between two women because there are so few \u201clesbian novels\u201d. \u201cBut really this is a portrait of one woman, because everything we know of Sarah is through the narrator and in the second part there is no Sarah.\u201d</p> <p>The novel ends leaving readers in limbo. \u201cSeveral editors wanted me to rewrite it, but I didn\u2019t want to change it.

      "bodyText": "Marieke Lucas Rijneveld, Netherlands: \u2018It\u2019s difficult for my parents to understand that I\u2019m not the girl that they raised\u2019 When Marieke Lucas Rijneveld was three years old, their 12-year-old brother was knocked over and killed by a bus as he walked to school from the family farm. Rijneveld\u2019s response to this early confrontation with the unthinkable was not to draw a veil over it, but to build two books around it. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate for a family to have a writer born into it,\u201d says the 28-year-old author, serenely. In the devoutly religious rural community among which the Rijneveld family still live, the exposure was sudden and extreme. When Calf\u2019s Caul, a poetry collection, was published in 2015, its young author was heralded in the national media as a new star of Dutch literature. More challenging still for the family was the novel that arrived three years later, De avond is ongemak, which appears in English this week as The Discomfort of Evening (Faber, translated by Michelle Hutchison), and has just been longlisted for the International Booker prize. \u201cAll the shopkeepers and the hairdresser were talking about it, but my family are too frightened to read it,\u201d says Rijneveld, who uses the pronouns they/them. In The Discomfort of Evening, Matthies dies in a skating accident, leaving his 10-year-old sister Jas fantasising about how to prevent the family from being destroyed in the aftermath. She keeps two toads in a box under her bed, thinking that if they can be persuaded to mate, her parents might too, and everything will be all right again. Meanwhile, left to cope with the emotional turbulence of adolescence without adult support, she plays games with her surviving brother and sister that become increasingly wild and dangerous. The novel is set over the two years in Jas\u2019s life when hormones corral children into adult sexual identities. Rijneveld resists such categorisation, self\u2011describing not as trans but as \u201cin between\u201d. \u201cAs a small child I felt I was a boy, I dressed like a boy and behaved like a boy, but children at that age are still neutral in their gender. In adolescence, when the separation became clear, I dressed like a girl and became a girl, then at 20 I went back to the boy I was at primary school.\u201d Their middle name, Lucas, comes from an imaginary boyfriend they had as a young child. Elegantly dressed in trademark suit and braces, Rijneveld\u2019s composure only breaks when they struggle to remember the name of the film star they aspire to be. It finally emerges in a burst of giggles: \u201cTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet, star of Call Me by Your Name \u2013 I want to be a beautiful boy.\u201d They have not yet decided whether to take hormone treatment, so when they read their work publicly it is in an unbroken voice, radiating an androgynous charm that has made them one of the poetry circuit\u2019s rare breakout stars. \u201cWhat a sweetheart,\u201d wrote a commenter in response to a Dutch TV chatshow on the environment, in which Rijneveld signed up to the David Attenborough fan club, urged listeners to heed his warnings about the climate emergency and reported that they had never flown in a plane. Only their hands betray their other life as a one-day-a-week dairy farmer, with scrubbed nails that are bitten to the quick. \u201cFarming keeps me grounded. The cows are my best friends; I like cleaning out the stables and shovelling the shit.\u201d This unglamorous side of farming slops through both the novel and the poems. Jas\u2019s mother doses her children with worm medicine and slathers them with udder ointment to protect against the cold. One of the poems in Calf\u2019s Caul is titled \u201cLice Mothers\u201d. \u201cPeople from the city get scared of these things that villagers think of as normal.\u201d For example? \u201cFor example, torturing frogs \u2013 it\u2019s not very nice but it happens and children will experiment with it.\u201d Despite being published three years apart, the novel and poetry collection began in tandem, even sharing some lines. \u201cThe challenge was how to write them when I didn\u2019t have many memories of my brother\u2019s death. So I started with Matthies, and only during the writing arrived at the shape the novel has now. I saw Calf\u2019s Caul as preparation for writing The Discomfort of Evening.\u201d The collection, which has yet to be published in English, is full of the anxieties that Rijneveld\u2019s chosen identity has created in a family who are god-fearing members of the Reformed church. \u201cPapa has been searching for a daughter for years,\u201d reads one poem. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for my parents to understand that I\u2019m not the girl that they raised,\u201d Rijneveld says. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the Bible.\u201d Whether the papa of the poems is any more Rijneveld\u2019s own father than Jas\u2019s papa in the novel is left open by a writer who admits that they regard their public identity as a performance, to be donned along with the braces. \u201cWriting is playing with who you are. Being an author makes me feel more confident.\u201d Rijneveld was born on 20 April 1991 on a farm in the north Brabant, a province in the south of the Netherlands. The date is significant, they disarmingly disclose, because it means they share a birthday with Adolf Hitler. \u201cAs a child I thought it was a funny idea to be born on the same day as such a monstrous man, but it made me wonder if I was a good or a bad person.\u201d In the novel, Jas builds a fantasy about a Jewish family her mother has hidden away in the basement. She acts out her social alienation by making a Nazi salute at school and cracking a joke which was judged too offensive for the English edition of the novel. It\u2019s part of a strand of black humour that is as dangerous in its way as the children\u2019s games (one gruesome scene involves a dummy cow and an insemination gun). Asked why the novel pushes so hard at boundaries of what is acceptable, the author shrugs: \u201cIt is related by a child and children are naive. They say these things. They don\u2019t know any better, so they can get away with an innocent joke.\u201d At nine years old, Rijneveld says, \u201cI had a very strong belief in God and was convinced he was living in the attic.\u201d The novel is full of glimpses into what it was like growing up in a strict religious household. Jas\u2019s father restricts their TV channels for fear of nudity, which he pronounces \u201cas if a fruit fly had just flown into his mouth \u2013 he spat as he said it\u201d; her mother daringly watches a quiz show involving words that are not in the Bible. \u201cShe called them \u2018blush words\u2019 because some of them made your cheeks turn red.\u201d When her children try out these words, she attempts \u201cto wash them out of our mouths with a bar of green soap, like the grease stains from our good school clothes\u201d. Of their own experience Rijneveld simply says: \u201cBehind the book is such a strong force. After leaving school I didn\u2019t know what to do. I started living in a room in a new city and I just knew I had to write it. In daily life it\u2019s hard to be as strong as I am behind my laptop.\u201d They now live in Utrecht, and work on a farm that is not their parents\u2019. There are only two responses to the death of a child, Rijneveld says: either it draws a family closer or rips them apart. So what happened in their own family? \u201cI have to think about the answer to that \u2026 \u201d Rijneveld says solemnly. \u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t torn us apart, but all the relationships changed.\u201d One brother and sister are now teachers, and a second brother is in the police. None of them has read the novel. \u201cI hope that my parents will read it one day and be proud; that they will understand it\u2019s a novel, it\u2019s not all about them. But it is probably too soon.\u201d Meanwhile Rijneveld\u2019s writing has gained them a new cultural family, which stretches beyond the Netherlands to Italy and Germany. Calf\u2019s Caul has gone through 11 editions to date in Dutch while The Discomfort of Evening has sold 55,000 copies in the Netherlands; it will be published in French in April and is currently being translated into Spanish, Korean, Chinese and Arabic. A second poetry collection is already out, and Rijneveld is working on a second novel. All of which bears out their fervent belief that \u201cthere\u2019s always light in darkness, just as there\u2019s always humour in gruesomeness. It\u2019s just the way things work. There must always be something to laugh about.\u201d Claire Armitstead \u2022 Marieke Lucas Rijneveld\u2019s The Discomfort of Evening, translated by Michelle Hutchison, is published by Faber in the UK and out now. Andrzej Tich\u00fd, Sweden: \u2018From the outside, Sweden was this paradise. But it was never actually true\u2019 As a young man travelling around Europe in the late 1990s, the Malm\u00f6-based writer Andrzej Tich\u00fd remembers telling friends about the conditions endured by marginalised groups in Sweden. \u201cAnd they just would not believe me,\u201d he recalls. \u201cFrom the outside Sweden was this harmonious, social democratic paradise and people preferred to believe the folk hymn that here was a society that looked after everyone. But it was never actually true.\u201d He cites historic state-sanctioned forced sterilisations of those deemed to be mentally or physically impaired, and discrimination against Jews, Roma and indigenous peoples. \u201cAnd there has always been the day-to-day treatment of the poor and of immigrants, let alone the junkies and criminals,\u201d he adds. \u201cOf course there were places in the world that were worse, but Sweden was never perfect.\u201d The poor and the immigrants, the junkies and the criminals, loom large in Tich\u00fd\u2019s prize-winning novel Wretchedness (El\u00e4ndet, translated by Nichola Smalley) which will be published in the UK in June by And Other Stories. It is his fifth novel, but the first to appear in English, and opens with a cellist on his way to a classical concert being asked for money by a drug addict on the street. The encounter summons a swirling sequence of flashbacks from the cellist\u2019s own chaotic past. Graphic depictions of crime, racism, poverty, drug use and violence are rendered through paragraph-free slabs of text that propulsively veer between voices and minds, times and locations: \u201cSuddenly my mouth is full of it again,\u201d the musician declares, \u201cof names and places, of events and movements, of memories and images.\u201d The inescapable realisation is how easy it would have been for him to have become that junkie. Tich\u00fd was born in Prague in 1978 to a Czech father and Polish mother. His family moved to Sweden when he was three, and he was brought up on a Malm\u00f6 housing estate with a large migrant population not unlike the one featured in Wretchedness. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in autobiography or autofiction, but I know there are always borderline areas between the writer and the subject and I am not a stranger to many of the things in the novel. Much comes from personal experience, although sometimes indirectly.\u201d As well as the Swedish estates, the novel draws on Tich\u00fd\u2019s experiences of living in Hamburg and London to paint a picture of a pan-European community of the excluded passing through squats, underground clubs, petty scams and cash-only employment. This internationalism is also reflected in the language he deploys. \u201cA lot of it is written in a sort of slang encompassing many different languages. Some words have long been incorporated into standard Swedish, from Roma for example. But now there are also a lot of Arab words, Serbo-Croat, Polish, Spanish, Albanian. It\u2019s all mixed together, but interestingly while one sentence can contain several different languages, people will know what you mean.\u201d Tich\u00fd\u2019s early creative life centered on music \u2013 playing guitar in the hardcore scene rather than classical cello \u2013 which led to him starting up fanzines for which he first wrote poetry and then prose. There is a sense of musicality inherent in the dense text of Wretchedness, as episodes from the composer\u2019s past repeatedly return, with references ranging from Snoop Dogg and Mobb Deep\u2019s hip-hop to the concert hall avant garde of Julius Eastman and Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi\u2019s atonal drones. (There is a coolly eclectic Spotify playlist that accompanies the book). Literary and philosophical influences include Simone Weil and Thomas Bernhard, and Tich\u00fd admits that his is a potentially demanding kind of literature. \u201cI sometimes go out and talk to young people on the estates, people not really interested in books, and some of them find it hard. But they are interested in the themes, which is partly why rap lyrics have always been a huge influence on me. They can be complex and sophisticated yet can describe street stuff in a wonderfully direct and concise manner and so make art out of what is thought of as low life. \u201cThat is partly my project too. I\u2019ve always wanted to depict lives and environments under-explored by literature. These lives not only deserve to be chronicled, they deserve to be elevated.\u201d Nicholas Wroe \u2022 Andrzej Tichy\u2019s Wretchedness, translated by Nichola Smalley, will be published by And Other Stories in the UK in June. Naoise Dolan, Ireland: \u2018There are plenty of novels about straight people already\u2019 It is no longer the curse of the Irish author to be compared to James Joyce: these days, if they happen to be sharp, socially conscious and writing about twentysomethings living now, they will be announced as the new Sally Rooney, and also as some kind of child prodigy, even when they are well into their 20s. Naoise Dolan, 27, finds this all hilarious. \u201cIn any other career, it is completely normal to get going in your 20s \u2013 we\u2019ve just normalised the desperate state of affairs around writing,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the idea that young women couldn\u2019t ever have had an emotional or interesting life, or that it\u2019s somehow cringeworthy to capture the present moment \u2013 both are ridiculous to me.\u201d Despite the inevitable comparisons, Dolan\u2019s debut, Exciting Times, published in April by Weidenfeld, is more caustic and cynical than Rooney\u2019s writing, if just as clever. It follows Ava, a 22-year-old who had \u201cbeen sad in Dublin, decided it was Dublin\u2019s fault and thought Hong Kong would help\u201d. There she meets 29-year-old banker Julian, an only child who went to Eton. (\u201cThese were the two least surprising facts anyone had ever told me about themselves,\u201d Ava notes.) Their relationship is sexual, if carefully ambiguous, and is built mostly on their mutual enjoyment of acidic banter over any deeply-felt romance. Ava admires Julian\u2019s cushions and willingness to give her his credit cards; his highest praise for her is that she is \u201cgood company\u201d: \u201cReally it was amusing that we were having sex,\u201d Ava muses. \u201cHe was attractive and confident, whereas I was willing to centre my emotional life around someone who treated me like a favoured armrest.\u201d When Julian temporarily moves away, Ava meets Edith, a young and wealthy Hong Kong lawyer. It is here that Dolan\u2019s novel feels most contemporaneous; all the fretting over love and class could be compared to Austen or Wharton, but her light treatment of bisexuality and polyamory is utterly 2020. Ava, Julian and Edith are never really a love triangle but a hinge, with Ava in the middle of two people who benignly tolerate each other. The only drama in their arrangement lies in the choice Ava feels she must make, despite Julian\u2019s indifference and Edith saying things like: \u201cI have many opinions about the nexus between monogamy and patriarchy, opinions which are available on request should they interest you.\u201d Dolan is less interested in sexuality than in relationships: \u201cSexuality only affects the ability to be attracted to someone \u2013 how that manifests is more about who that person is. As a queer person, I have no understanding how it might feel different to experience heterosexual attraction, though I\u2019m quite interested in that. But there are plenty of novels about straight people already. And I think it is more interesting to write about relationships without the assumption that it has to be a monogamous one.\u201d She suspects older readers will be baffled by the dynamic. \u201cThere is this expectation that you should write to people who are powerful in ways that you\u2019re not, to explain to them why you\u2019re different. I think it\u2019s better to just throw it out there and if they don\u2019t like it, fine. For people my age, the most important question is: are you treating your partners well or poorly?\u201d When in conversation with older writers, she says, \u201cI sometimes feel like I\u2019m trying to prove that it\u2019s OK to write stories about people who aren\u2019t them. It\u2019s not a gendered thing, there is a class element too. A lot of things that we call \u2018the millennial experience\u2019 were always part of a universal experience for some social groups \u2013 middle-class people are just upset that those things are happening to them now.\u201d Dolan grew up in Dublin, studied English at Trinity College and was published in Stinging Fly magazine \u2013 by Rooney, who was editor until 2019. (This makes Dolan \u201csuch an Irish cliche\u201d, she says.) She was always interested in literature, but never had any aspirations to write \u2013 \u201cfirstly because it\u2019s not financially possible for most people, and secondly, I don\u2019t stake a significant amount of my self-image in how I relate to the modes of production. It was a hobby, not a career goal. I have a limited amount of patience for the writer-as-personality thing \u2013 it is a very mechanical and somewhat distant thing for me. I just make things up. I don\u2019t relate to accounts that people give of being struck by ideas or their characters taking over. Writing was always just kind of something that I plugged away at.\u201d Dolan, who is autistic, \u201cdoesn\u2019t like talking to people\u201d, so to get away from colleagues and students at her teaching job, she spent five months hiding in coffeeshops on her lunch breaks. \u201cI find it easier to relate to people by thinking about why they are the way they are. I aim to observe people rather than empathise with them,\u201d she says. And her observations are brilliant, often simultaneously comic and bleak. \u201cJulian often reminded me to eat. It made him feel better about liking that I was thin,\u201d Ava notes. Or, at a party: \u201cRalph\u2019s girlfriend Victoria was good at wearing clothes. She was so beautiful I couldn\u2019t see why she was talking to me. Sometimes her eyes said: I don\u2019t know why, either.\u201d With the emergence of Rooney, Eimear McBride, Lisa McInerney, Nicole Flattery and others, Ireland has been held up for its almost mythic ability to cultivate brilliant women writers \u2013 but Dolan puts this down to Ireland being a more egalitarian playing field than the UK. \u201cIreland isn\u2019t perfect, but we still have relatively good support for the arts so literary writing doesn\u2019t have as much of a bourgeois connotation as it does in the UK. We have a better range of writers here. UK journalists always ask the oddest questions, like, \u2018have you had a job before?\u2019 I\u2019m a normal person \u2013 yes I have.\u201d Dolan stopped travelling by plane in September, after the fires in the Amazon moved her to reconsider her impact on the environment. \u201cIt might hold me back from promoting the book, but to be pumping all that CO2 into the air to push a novel just seems like such a ridiculous thing. If my novel doesn\u2019t get promoted, someone else\u2019s will. The literary world will be much unaffected.\u201d Her decision, she thinks, comes back to her feelings about being a novelist. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I\u2019m a special person who has an innate entitlement to exist writing novels while demanding other people do less pleasant things with their time. I\u2019m lucky to, but there are a lot of things that I\u2019m not willing to do to keep that situation going. Flying is just one of them.\u201d Sian Cain \u2022 Naoise Dolan\u2019s Exciting Times is published by Orion in the UK in April. Hassan Blasim, Finland: \u2018As a refugee you are always between two fires: your first home and your new one\u2019 \u201cThe thing I write best,\u201d Hassan Blasim says, \u201cis violence.\u201d His acclaimed short-story collections, The Madman of Freedom Square and The Iraqi Christ, are fervent, unblinking depictions of post-invasion Iraq, the country of his birth, though their violence is focused through the lenses of surrealism, humour and poignancy. The former was longlisted for the Independent foreign fiction prize in 2010, and the latter won it in 2014, becoming the first title translated from Arabic to do so. In 2000, Blasim left Iraq, where he had been persecuted for his film-making and where his writing is still banned. He spent four years walking illegally across Europe, eventually settling in Finland. His debut novel, God 99 (translated by Jonathan Wright and published in July by Comma), draws on his experience: its protagonist (called Hassan) is an Iraqi refugee attempting to establish himself as a writer in Finland. But he stresses that \u201cthe book puts reality and fiction in dialogue. Autobiography is a fiction \u2013 we lie about things; we misremember and misrepresent. So too fiction has truths. Luckily, I\u2019m not famous enough for people to know my life, so I can still play with it.\u201d God 99, he says, is \u201cborn of dialogue \u2013 always in conversation are death and life, war and peace\u201d. In the novel, Hassan traverses Europe and interviews 99 refugees, examining the effect of war on their lives, and their impact on the countries they make home. Blasim is ambivalent about the label \u201cEuropean writer\u201d \u2013 more ambivalent than he is about \u201cdebut novelist\u201d, which he flatly rejects (\u201cI just write. This shift to long-form is not important\u201d). In his mind, his identity is simply \u201cwriter\u201d. \u201cIn England,\u201d he says, \u201cand other parts of western and southern Europe, you have a history with immigrants. In Finland, it\u2019s relatively new, and while some people embrace me as a Finnish writer, others resist.\u201d Because he writes in Arabic, he is ineligible for Finnish literary prizes, and cannot join the Union of Writers. This context, combined with censorship of his work in the Middle East, means translation into English has been vital. But although Blasim attributes his success to translation, he stresses that it was never something he sought: \u201cWhen I came to Europe, I didn\u2019t know where to go. I had this romantic idea of reaching France, because of the literature. But you just go wherever you can. How can you think about the future, when life is like this? How can you think about succeeding as a writer? About reaching English-language readers?\u201d Translating Blasim\u2019s work \u2013 which is as experimental linguistically as it is formally \u2013 is no light task. The Arabic of God 99 is what Blasim calls \u201cstreet Arabic\u201d, and it\u2019s another reason he\u2019s reviled by some in Iraq: \u201cThey call me a \u2018dirty writer\u2019 \u2013 they say that I do not respect the language. Nobody can touch classical Arabic because it is a holy language. But nobody uses holy language on the street. And when I dream it is not in classical Arabic.\u201d Does he still feel at risk? \u201cOf course,\u201d he says. He has returned to Iraq only once, secretly, and does not believe he will again. But his new home in Finland is not one of undiluted Scandinavian peace; he is working on a project about the Finnish far right, and confides that he fears for his safety if he publishes it. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll meet you in England, a refugee again,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a refugee, you are always between two fires. Your first home, and your new one.\u201d Will Forrester \u2022 Hassan Blasim\u2019s God 99, translated by Jonathan Wright, will be published by Comma Press in July. Narine Abgaryan, Russia: \u2018Humanity is in dire need of hope, of kind stories\u2019 A Russian writer of Armenian origin, Narine Abgaryan is already renowned as a children\u2019s author and blogger in Russia. Her novel Three Apples Fell from the Sky has sold more than 160,000 copies since it was first published in 2015 and won Russia\u2019s most prestigious literary award, the Yasnaya Polyana prize (founded by the Tolstoy estate). A magical realist story of friendship and feuds, published in English this month by Oneworld, the book is set in the remote Armenian mountain village of Maran, where the villagers pick mulberries and make baklava. An ancient telegraph wire and a perilous mountain path that even goats struggle to follow is their only connection to the outside world. Abgaryan cites One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, set in the isolated fictional village of Macondo, as her favourite book. But she was haunted by the ending of M\u00e1rquez\u2019s multi-generational saga of the Buend\u00eda family, as all traces of Macondo\u2019s existence are wiped away. In Three Apples Fell from the Sky (translated by Lisa C Hayden), she resolved to write a fable that did exactly the opposite. \u201cI wanted to write a story that ends on a note of hope,\u201d she says. \u201cHumanity is in dire need of hope, of kind stories.\u201d \u201cWe live such fast-paced lives, barely managing to speak to one another, to ask how things are going,\u201d she says. \u201cThe thing that bothers me is how young people are leaving their elders behind.\u201d Abgaryan, who now lives in Moscow, points to how the villagers in her novel spend their days \u201ccultivating wine that nobody wants or needs\u201d. \u201cGlobalisation has benefits, of course, but also negative side-effects, when national customs, the things which define people, are taken away.\u201d Her work has already been translated into 12 languages, and with English being the 13th, she now calls this her lucky number. \u201cWhen you\u2019re published in English there\u2019s a greater chance that your work will resonate more widely,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen your work is translated, you start to work with greater joy and hope. You start to believe in yourself more.\u201d Jade Cuttle \u2022 Narine Abgaryan\u2019s Three Apples Fell from the Sky, translated by Lisa C Hayden, is published by Oneworld and is out now. Pauline Delabroy-Allard, France: \u2018I\u2019m not bothered if people think the book is about me \u2013 but it isn\u2019t\u2019 Pauline Delabroy-Allard\u2019s first novel took the French literary world by surprise. She wrote it to get the story out of her head and then stuck it in a drawer. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect anyone would want to publish it.\u201d A few months later, with her 30th birthday approaching, she decided she had nothing to lose by posting the manuscript to a few French publishers. \u201cI told myself I would get a load of rejection letters and then I could stop dreaming and get on with my life.\u201d When publishers began calling the following week, \u201cI thought someone was playing a joke\u201d. Delabroy-Allard eventually chose Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit, whose catalogue includes the writers she most admires, including Marguerite Duras. \u201cI signed the contract on my 30th birthday. That was a real party.\u201d \u00c7a raconte Sarah (All About Sarah) won a literary award even before it was published in 2018 to almost unanimous praise. The book was shortlisted for a the Prix Goncourt, the most prestigious literary award in France. Translated into English by Adriana Hunter and published this month by Harvill Secker, it is a story of desire and desolation. Its narrator is a bored secondary school teacher and single mother in Paris whose comfortable but humdrum life is upended when she falls in love with Sarah, a professional musician, who is loud and impetuous. The narrator and Sarah embark on an all-consuming, passionate relationship. The first part of the novel concludes when they separate and Sarah reveals she has breast cancer. In the second part, the narrator flees Sarah\u2019s apartment, telling nobody and leaving her child behind. It is unclear whether Sarah has died or dumped the unnamed narrator, who descends into despair. Like the book\u2019s narrator, Delabroy-Allard is a teacher, has a daughter and is in a relationship with a professional violinist called Sarah. But that is where the similarities end, she insists. \u201cI\u2019m not bothered if people think it\u2019s me, but it isn\u2019t. I find it difficult to invent things from nothing, so I use reality as a base. Once I have that base I can create the rest.\u201d She says she left Paris to live in isolation in the countryside to complete the second part of the novel. \u201cIt was very hard being in her head \u2013 almost physically painful. I was happy to finish it.\u201d She is now working on a second novel that she is racing to complete before she and her pregnant partner have a baby in July. The 31-year-old says she wanted to write about a passionate relationship between two women because there are so few \u201clesbian novels\u201d. \u201cBut really this is a portrait of one woman, because everything we know of Sarah is through the narrator and in the second part there is no Sarah.\u201d The novel ends leaving readers in limbo. \u201cSeveral editors wanted me to rewrite it, but I didn\u2019t want to change it. Everyone is free to imagine their own ending.\u201d Kim Willsher \u2022 Pauline Delabroy-Allard\u2019s All About Sarah, translated by Adriana Hunter, is published by Harvill Secker on 12 March. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2020. The catalogue of publishers Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit does not include the works of writer Annie Ernaux, as an earlier version said.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cNigeria is a country located in West Africa\u201d: so begins the prologue of Abi Dar\u00e9\u2019s debut novel. The prologue is a brief excerpt from The Book of Nigerian Facts, supposedly published in 2014. Though this book is fictional, the facts it gives are real. It states: \u201cAs the 6th largest crude oil exporter in the world, and with a GDP of $568.5 billion, Nigeria is the richest country in Africa. Sadly, over 100 million Nigerians live in poverty, surviving on less than $1 a day.\u201d It seems a curious place to start a novel. Imagine John Lanchester\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/04/capital-john-lanchester-review\" title=\"\"><em>Capital</em></a> opening with this quote from a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49923129\" title=\"\">2019 article on the BBC website</a>: \u201cOverall, London remains the most dangerous part of England and Wales.\u201d Why choose to begin with these facts in particular?

      "bodyText": "\u201cNigeria is a country located in West Africa\u201d: so begins the prologue of Abi Dar\u00e9\u2019s debut novel. The prologue is a brief excerpt from The Book of Nigerian Facts, supposedly published in 2014. Though this book is fictional, the facts it gives are real. It states: \u201cAs the 6th largest crude oil exporter in the world, and with a GDP of $568.5 billion, Nigeria is the richest country in Africa. Sadly, over 100 million Nigerians live in poverty, surviving on less than $1 a day.\u201d It seems a curious place to start a novel. Imagine John Lanchester\u2019s Capital opening with this quote from a 2019 article on the BBC website: \u201cOverall, London remains the most dangerous part of England and Wales.\u201d Why choose to begin with these facts in particular?

Instead, the candidate headed to Michigan for an event on Friday night, while Biden will rally in Jackson, Mississippi, on Sunday.</p> <p>The shift north by Sanders for the weekend was a tacit acceptance that Biden now has a stranglehold on southern states, propelled by his popularity among black voters. It was also recognition of the high stakes of the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/calendar\">primary in Michigan</a>, with its rich pickings of 125 delegates out of the 1,991 needed to win the nomination.</p> <p>And on Friday, the Associated Press officially declared Biden the winner of Super Tuesday, denying Sanders the runaway victory many critics feared.</p> <p>The AP announced it has allocated more than 92% of the 1,344 delegates that were up for grabs on 3 March, and Biden has such a commanding lead that Sanders cannot catch up and snatch a Super Tuesday lead as the remaining votes from that day\u2019s 14 state primaries are counted.</p> <p>Sanders now sees Michigan as a chance to regain his stride after the knocks of Super Tuesday, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/08/bernie-sanders-wins-michigan-primary-hillary-clinton\">beaten Hillary Clinton</a> there in 2016. He hopes that his focus on policies appealing to working-class Americans, such as a federal $15 minimum wage, will play well not only in that state but across the rust belt in Illinois and Ohio, which hold their primaries on 17 March.</p> <p>\u201cMichigan is an enormously important state,\u201d Sanders said in a post-Super Tuesday press briefing in his home town of Burlington, Vermont. \u201cThe people of Michigan were devastated by trade agreements which I vigorously opposed and Joe Biden supported.\u201d</p> <p>No matter how much of a bounce he enjoys in Michigan, Sanders faces threats as the race enters its next punishing phase. In particular, the Super Tuesday results exposed a fundamental failure to expand the Democratic base by bringing in millions of new voters.</p> <p>Sanders was in a reflective mood after the Super Tuesday result. \u201cIt is not easy trying to bring in people who have not been involved in the political process,\u201d he said. \u201cHave we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? The answer is no.\u201d</p> <p>John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s institute of politics, whose researchers has been studying the youth vote since 2000, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dellavolpe/status/1235320286314102784\">reviewed exit polls</a> from 12 of the most competitive elections. While turnout overall was up in all of the 12 states compared with 2016, the pattern for young people aged 18 to 29 \u2013 the very core of the Sanders revolutionary army \u2013 told a different story.</p> <p>In four of the states youth turnout increased, handsomely in the cases of Iowa (36%) and Virginia (38%). But in two states youth turnout was flat, and in six states it actually declined, as much as 18% in New Hampshire and 20% in Texas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d788fd42a1a80966570d02b911d261de09267104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d788fd42a1a80966570d02b911d261de09267104/0_0_4048_2716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders rallygoers in Phoenix on Thursday night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders rallygoers in Phoenix on Thursday night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Segall/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By contrast, voter turnout for older voters who tend to favor Biden increased in all but one of the 12 states. In South Carolina, where Biden\u2019s campaign was rocket-launched with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/29/south-carolina-primary-voters-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">landslide</a> victory last Saturday, the projected turnout of voters aged 65 and older increased 124% \u2013 the very surge that Sanders had dreamt about for younger voters yet failed to deliver.</p> <p>\u201cFor any candidate to be the nominee of the Democratic party they have to build a broad and diverse coalition across gender, race, age and educational levels,\u201d Della Volpe told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s terrific that Bernie Sanders is building such a great relationship with young voters, but he needs to maximise that support and then expand beyond it, and that\u2019s not what we are seeing.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders partially blamed his difficulties in mobilising a wider coalition of support on his enemies in the \u201ccorporate media\u201d and \u201cestablishment politics\u201d. As he told <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/sanders-insists-emphasis-on-progressive-issues-will-grow-democratic-base-80037957812\">Rachel Maddow on MSNBC</a>: \u201cOne of the problems we have is that people say, \u2018Bernie is an extremist\u2019. There is nothing we are fighting for which is extreme. It is what the American people want.\u201d</p> <p>But there is danger for Sanders here too. By doubling down on his attacks on the media and the \u201cDemocratic establishment\u201d he risks reinforcing the stereotype of himself as a grievance-ridden politician promoted by that same media and Democratic establishment.</p> <p>\u201cThat rhetoric, in my view, signals to voters that he\u2019s a factional candidate,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic strategist who advised Sanders in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020. He said such critiques distract from his core economic message, which remains popular with Democrats and independent voters alike.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s Bernie Sanders on message and Bernie Sanders off message,\u201d Longabaugh said. \u201cOne can win and the other is going to stay at 25%.\u201d</p> <p>Behind the scenes, there are indications that the Sanders camp are attempting to address the candidate\u2019s weakness in the two demographic groups that have flocked to Biden \u2013 older voters and African Americans. Sanders\u2019 campaign co-chair, Ro Khanna, told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/04/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-2020-election-121582\">Politico</a> it would be emphasising healthcare issues for seniors as one way to focus in on the high-voting over 65s.</p> <p>With black voters, the latest Sanders advert to be broadcast in Florida raised eyebrows as it consists of a series of clips of Barack Obama praising him as a politician of \u201cgreat authenticity, great passion\u201d. For Sanders to look to Obama to rescue his fortunes has an air of desperation, given that Biden\u2019s overwhelming popularity among African Americans is largely due to his role as Obama\u2019s vice-president.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes the safest choice is also the riskiest choice. John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore were all safe choices</p> <footer> <cite>Rebecca Katz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But then, the figures do look desperate. Exit polls from Super Tuesday showed Biden trouncing Sanders with black voters by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/exit-polls-2020-super-tuesday-primary/#RACE\">41 percentage points</a>.

Sanders\u2019 defeat there was compounded with the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/majority-whip-jim-clyburn-sanders-never-courted-my-endorsement\">embarrassing disclosure</a> that he hadn\u2019t even asked Clyburn to back him.</p> <p>There is hope in inroads made with Latino voters, which helped Sanders clinch California, the biggest delegate prize of any state.

The Sanders campaign is seeking to reboot following disappointing results on Super Tuesday, which saw Biden prevail in 10 of the 14 states holding primary elections. In the wake of the surprising setback, the US senator from Vermont is repurposing his insurgent pitch for the White House on several fronts.

Sanders was in a reflective mood after the Super Tuesday result. \u201cIt is not easy trying to bring in people who have not been involved in the political process,\u201d he said. \u201cHave we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? The answer is no.\u201d John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s institute of politics, whose researchers has been studying the youth vote since 2000, reviewed exit polls from 12 of the most competitive elections. While turnout overall was up in all of the 12 states compared with 2016, the pattern for young people aged 18 to 29 \u2013 the very core of the Sanders revolutionary army \u2013 told a different story. In four of the states youth turnout increased, handsomely in the cases of Iowa (36%) and Virginia (38%). But in two states youth turnout was flat, and in six states it actually declined, as much as 18% in New Hampshire and 20% in Texas. By contrast, voter turnout for older voters who tend to favor Biden increased in all but one of the 12 states. In South Carolina, where Biden\u2019s campaign was rocket-launched with a landslide victory last Saturday, the projected turnout of voters aged 65 and older increased 124% \u2013 the very surge that Sanders had dreamt about for younger voters yet failed to deliver. \u201cFor any candidate to be the nominee of the Democratic party they have to build a broad and diverse coalition across gender, race, age and educational levels,\u201d Della Volpe told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s terrific that Bernie Sanders is building such a great relationship with young voters, but he needs to maximise that support and then expand beyond it, and that\u2019s not what we are seeing.\u201d Sanders partially blamed his difficulties in mobilising a wider coalition of support on his enemies in the \u201ccorporate media\u201d and \u201cestablishment politics\u201d. As he told Rachel Maddow on MSNBC: \u201cOne of the problems we have is that people say, \u2018Bernie is an extremist\u2019. There is nothing we are fighting for which is extreme. It is what the American people want.\u201d But there is danger for Sanders here too. By doubling down on his attacks on the media and the \u201cDemocratic establishment\u201d he risks reinforcing the stereotype of himself as a grievance-ridden politician promoted by that same media and Democratic establishment. \u201cThat rhetoric, in my view, signals to voters that he\u2019s a factional candidate,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic strategist who advised Sanders in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020. He said such critiques distract from his core economic message, which remains popular with Democrats and independent voters alike. \u201cThere\u2019s Bernie Sanders on message and Bernie Sanders off message,\u201d Longabaugh said. \u201cOne can win and the other is going to stay at 25%.\u201d Behind the scenes, there are indications that the Sanders camp are attempting to address the candidate\u2019s weakness in the two demographic groups that have flocked to Biden \u2013 older voters and African Americans. Sanders\u2019 campaign co-chair, Ro Khanna, told Politico it would be emphasising healthcare issues for seniors as one way to focus in on the high-voting over 65s. With black voters, the latest Sanders advert to be broadcast in Florida raised eyebrows as it consists of a series of clips of Barack Obama praising him as a politician of \u201cgreat authenticity, great passion\u201d. For Sanders to look to Obama to rescue his fortunes has an air of desperation, given that Biden\u2019s overwhelming popularity among African Americans is largely due to his role as Obama\u2019s vice-president. But then, the figures do look desperate. Exit polls from Super Tuesday showed Biden trouncing Sanders with black voters by 41 percentage points. In Alabama that disparity rose to 63 points. Biden built his firewall with black voters in South Carolina based on the endorsement of the influential congressman Jim Clyburn. Sanders\u2019 defeat there was compounded with the embarrassing disclosure that he hadn\u2019t even asked Clyburn to back him. There is hope in inroads made with Latino voters, which helped Sanders clinch California, the biggest delegate prize of any state. In the coming weeks, he will rely on that support to remain competitive in states like Arizona, New York and New Jersey. But he is struggling in Florida, where his comments on 60 Minutes praising Fidel Castro\u2019s literacy program in Cuba has apparently hurt his standing with the state\u2019s Latinos. The most recent Florida poll taken on 4 March has Biden soaring to 61% with Sanders languishing at 12%. Against such deeply worrying indicators for Sanders, progressives warn that the lessons of the past are once again being ignored. Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist who works with progressive candidates, dismissed the idea that Sanders is the risky option in the 2020 race. \u201cSometimes the safest choice is also the riskiest choice,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember that John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore were all safe choices.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Not long ago I scraped together all the coins I had and went into Gosh!, a comic book store in Soho, London, so that I could buy a copy of Black Hole by Charles Burns. It\u2019s a brilliant graphic novel that artfully depicts the teenage angst we all know and have hated. Graphic novels can tell a story in a way that words can\u2019t. It\u2019s amazing how much emotion can be conveyed in those little panels \u2013 which is perhaps why some of them have been so successfully turned into movies (think Ghost World by Daniel Clowes and Watchmen by Alan Moore). Imagine my extreme delight when I saw that Bong Joon-ho, director of Oscar-winning Parasite, will be flip-reversing this and publishing the storyboards of Parasite as a graphic novel. Before shooting the movie, Bong drew every scene as he saw it in his mind. This translates to a 304-page retelling of what we\u2019ve already seen on the screen. As someone who loves graphic novels, I\u2019m thrilled. As someone who doesn\u2019t know how to plan, I\u2019m inspired. Here\u2019s to you, Bong Joon-ho, a director who keeps reminding the west that story alone, and the various ways of telling it, can break down barriers.",

Warhol never forgave him, still bitching about him in diary entries from three years later, writing: \u201cI think Trump\u2019s sort of cheap.\u201d Unexpected admirers Campbell\u2019s Following Warhol\u2019s soup can prints, in 1966 Campbell\u2019s returned the compliment and produced the Souper Dress \u2013 a promotional offer where $1 and two coupons secured you a paper dress printed with Warhol\u2019s artwork. One now resides in the Met Museum. The Muppets Warhol references crop up throughout the Henson universe: Oscar the Grouch and Telly both created soup-can artworks; Kermit appeared as Warhol for a fashion shoot in Zink magazine; the 2019 Sesame Street Road Trip tour saw Big Bird posing at the Warhol Museum. Jeremy Deller As a 20-year-old unknown, conceptual artist Deller spent two weeks at the Factory observing Warhol, having talked his way into his hotel room during a visit to London. (Deller found Warhol and entourage watching Benny Hill on mute while playing Roxy Music.) Unintended consequences The selfie Warhol repeatedly returned to himself as subject matter. His first self-portrait, in 1963, saw him turning a simple photo booth image into a blue silkscreen print, a neat reminder that millennials didn\u2019t invent solipsism. A recurring film joke Warhol\u2019s silkscreen portraits have become a cinematic shorthand for a certain kind of ego. In Working Girl, Sigourney Weaver\u2019s character has a set of Warhol-inspired portraits of herself. Similar visual gags crop up in Dreamgirls, Zoolander and Desperate Housewives. Reality TV Warhol was the first artist to realise the boundless public appetite for watching people do nothing. Years before Big Brother, his films Kiss, Sleep and Eat recorded mundane tasks with a fixed camera for up to five hours at a time. His celebrated contention that \u201cIn the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes\u201d pretty much defines the modern Love Island era. Andy Warhol is at Tate Modern, SE1, Thursday 12 March to 6 September",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Greece</strong><br>A mountain odyssey</h2> <p>I often dream of the journey over the Taygetos mountains from the western coast of the <strong>Peloponnese</strong> peninsula to the town of Sparta. It\u2019s a trip I\u2019ve done many times, most recently with my family. You start by the beaches of Kalamata, where my daughter was born, and a mere 10-minute drive up a small winding road takes you into the mountains, with the white houses and sea below. This is the route Telemachus (Odysseus\u2019 son) took to visit Menelaus and Helen, newly returned from Troy.</p> <p>It\u2019s Greece, so these are proper mountains. The road crests at 1,600 metres, taller than Ben Nevis, and there is a Swiss chalet-style cafe here that serves good hot chocolate. We tend to stop a bit before, at the village of Artemisia, where the Theotokos taverna has a balcony overlooking a valley on one side and a spring on the other.</p> <p>Locals sell herbs and honey down by the spring and the waiters (the owner\u2019s kids) fill up your jug from it. Just before Sparta is Mystra, the ruins of a Byzantine city. The top of its battlements is my favourite spot on Earth \u2013 mountains on one side, the white splash of Sparta on the other. All of history in one spot.<br><strong>Andrew Bostock</strong></p> <h2><strong>Italy<br></strong>Cafe culture in Umbria</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"7aa4f4d01ba2a09930d538b7b13f486724b275a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7aa4f4d01ba2a09930d538b7b13f486724b275a7/0_264_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Old town of Orvieto, Umbria, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old town of Orvieto, Umbria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blue Jay/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It started with a mug. That was when I knew I\u2019d been accepted into the fold at <strong><a href=\"https://www.capitanodelpopolo.com/\" title=\"\">Capitano del Popolo</a></strong>, a bar and restaurant in the Umbrian outpost of Orvieto. I\u2019d sought temporary refuge in the hilltop town after losing my job in Rome in 2016, and was soon enraptured by its charms. Capitano del Popolo quickly became my stomping ground, a convivial place to drink caff\u00e8 latte from my personal mug \u2013 a gift from the wonderful owner and chef, Valentina Santanicchio \u2013 or enjoy one of her dishes, such as handmade pappardelle with wild boar rag\u00f9, while sitting on the terrace under an often-piercing blue winter sky and marvelling at the 14th-century palace across the square.</p> <p>Italy is brimming with history and culture, places to visit and things to do. Venice, Rome and Florence are itinerary staples, Orvieto less so. The town, with its imposing cathedral, fresh air, sublime views of the Umbrian countryside and friendships made, is now my number one place to escape to from Rome. I often describe Orvieto as a comfort blanket, which wrapped me in its warmth at a time when it was needed most.<br><strong>Angela Giuffrida</strong></p> <h2><strong>Belgium</strong><br>Oh, I do like to stroll along the Ostend prom</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2f856a4232fb45ceacb7b9d0aa9842d46f75881\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2f856a4232fb45ceacb7b9d0aa9842d46f75881/0_375_5630_3378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ostend beach, Ostend, Belgium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ostend beach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Horizon Images/Motion/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <strong>Ostend seafront</strong> is one of the places in the EU to which the UK is (geographically) closest. This two-mile strip of Belgian coastline also offers one of the loveliest strolls in Europe. A five-minute walk from the railway station, the promenade starts with stalls selling fresh seafood and chips.</p> <p>Continuing west, the route passes seafront cafes, museums, belle \u00e9poque houses, a modernist casino, the splendid Thermae Palace Hotel, a spooky sculpture in memory of the Ostendais artist L\u00e9on Spilliaert, and children pleased to be at a favourite Belgian beach. But it\u2019s the sea itself that will keep you staring. A hypnotic expanse of water, shifting through black and white, with blue, green and gold reflections of the sky. You can\u2019t see Margate on the British coast but it\u2019s only about 65 miles away.</p> <p>When Charlotte Bront\u00eb arrived in Belgium in 1843, she wrote of her \u201cprosperous and speedy voyage\u201d from London Bridge Wharf along the north Kent coast and on to Ostend. Following the suspension of passenger services from Ramsgate 170 years later, there are sadly now no ferries to this windswept haven for passengers leaving England today.

A resting place for generations of poets, writers and composers, the cemetery is most famous for its thousands of iron, bronze and stone tombs and sepulchral sculptures, as well as the chestnut trees, oaks and lindens that shelter you from the heavens above. But what captivates me most is the beauty and variety of the names of the great and the good of 19th- and early 20th-century Warsaw that lie below them.</p> <p>Many have wonderful foreign names that provoke nostalgia for a long-gone Poland that was genuinely multicultural: names like Pawe\u0142 Pellizzaro, Henryk Leon Malhomme, Kazimierz Wolff-Zdzienicki, Wac\u0142aw Malcolm-Morris, Matylda de Castellaz-Abramowicz. While others are, to me at least, simply glorious names in their own right: Fidelis Matuszewski, Jan Habdank-Stpiczynski, Karolina Semelman Neugebauer, Hipolit Flock and my own personal favourite, Felicjan Szmakfefer.</p> <p>Poland\u2019s cemeteries are known for All Saints Day commemorations (1 November), when millions of Poles gather to lay candles on the graves of loved ones and national heroes. But I find the living\u2019s habit of making the day about themselves can be irritating, and Pow\u0105zki is best visited on a winter\u2019s weekday afternoon, when you have only the dead for company \u2013 a perfect place to reflect on the future of a country and continent that refuses to rest in peace.<br><strong>Christian Davies</strong></p> <h2><strong>Denmark</strong><br>A very broad church</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5499d8ec1776c762a5d572b64dd401959523da7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5499d8ec1776c762a5d572b64dd401959523da7/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dinner in Absalon.

Which makes me a <em>Schwebebahnliebhaberin</em> (floating rail aficionado), a word as slinky as the monorail system itself, an elegant, airy, 13km engineering wonder which snakes its way through the Wupper valley (between D\u00fcsseldorf and Cologne), humming along the track between Barmen and Elberfeld, and must be one of the nearest experiences to flying.</p> <p>\u201cWhy drive, when you can float to work?\u201d was the thinking at the turn of the 20th century, when commuter numbers were growing and construction work on it began. Industrialisation had caused the western German region to develop so quickly that there was no room for broader streets to take the increase in traffic, and so the decision was made to go high. Steel girder construction was all the rage at the time \u2013 Paris got its Eiffel Tower, Wuppertal its floating railway, complete with the strident green limbs that give it its height and majesty.</p> <p>The Kaiser and his wife took a ride on it in 1900, hence the Kaiserwagen (carriage 5) with its velvet upholstery and gold trimmings, which has since been restored and can be ridden at weekends. An even more famous journey was undertaken by a circus elephant called Tuffi, who was put on it as a publicity stunt in 1950 but panicked in the overcrowded carriage and plunged into the river Wupper below. She survived with only minor injuries, as did her story, which has been retold to German children ever since.</p> <p>Not only is it a pleasure to ride \u2013 ideally kneeling on a seat at the back looking out of the window on to city and river life below \u2013 but also very efficient, with a train running every four minutes and reasonably priced (\u20ac2.90 for an adult single, \u20ac7.20 for 24 hours). It remains the transport of choice for Wuppertalers, moving around 25 million passengers a year.Wuppertal is also home to the dance company of the late choreographer Pina Bausch, and the Schwebebahn features in the 2011 film Pina, Wim Wenders\u2019 tribute to Bausch.<br><strong>Kate Connolly</strong></p> <h2><strong>Bulgaria</strong><br>Brutalist classic \u2013 with a great view of Sofia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c20e17714adcf77a11029076b407c4c615138588\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c20e17714adcf77a11029076b407c4c615138588/224_62_1696_1018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kopitoto TV tower in Bulgaria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kopitoto TV tower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vladislav Terziiski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not the tallest structure in Bulgaria.

But <strong>Kopitoto</strong>, or the Vitosha Mountain TV Tower to give it its official name, has defined Sofia\u2019s skyline since the mid-1980s.</p> <p>Most people are quick to laud Kopitoto (which means \u201cthe hoof\u201d) for the spectacular views it offers over the city \u2013 it stands at 186 metres (about double the height of Big Ben) on an outcrop of the 2,290-metre Vitosha mountain, around 20km from the city centre.</p> <p>As a sucker for brutalist architecture, I\u2019ve always loved the sheer scale of this concrete marvel of engineering, which is hexagonal in shape \u2013 but with three of the six sides extended, it appears almost triangular. From the 1960s until the beginning of the 90s, there was a cable car that took you up the mountain.

It\u2019s a pretty place, the sort that Peter Mayle might have settled in had Provence not got him first. As it is, Pyrga\u2019s only claim to fame is that it is home to a remarkable stone building. It could be mistaken for an old storeroom, except the gothic detail above the door hints at something more special. This building is a medieval royal chapel.</p> <p>Inside, damaged but beautiful frescos look as if they have been transported from medieval France. They tell the story of the marriage of King Janus to Charlotte de Bourbon in 1411, and betray the fact that Cyprus was a medieval French kingdom. Its rulers were the Lusignans, cousins to the English Plantagenets and as the chapel\u2019s garrulous caretaker will tell you, Queen Charlotte is an ancestor of the UK\u2019s current queen.</p> <p>Cyprus has not always been comfortable with its medieval heritage. For some, celebrating this French period and subsequent Venetian rule undermines the claim that Cyprus is a Greek island. Yet the Lusignans and their heirs left some stunning monuments, which easily overshadow the Roman remains at sites like Kourion. Apart from Pyrga, Kolossi and Limassol have two of the most intact Crusader castles , and the capital, Nicosia, is encircled by massive Venetian walls.</p> <p>Most dramatic of all, in the middle of Nicosia, sits the huge 13th-century French gothic Cathedral of St Sophia, which was converted into the the Selimiye Mosque in 1570. For a lover of medieval culture like myself, these gothic churches \u2013 many of which have been converted into mosques or subsumed into Byzantine structures \u2013 make Cyprus an unexpected revelation.<br><strong>Michael Paraskos, novelist and lecturer</strong></p> <h2><strong>Luxembourg<br></strong>Shedloads of culture</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"12366653178d2f7cc1d3a729d4d5df5688efa358\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12366653178d2f7cc1d3a729d4d5df5688efa358/0_63_5760_3676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rotondes in Luxembourg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rotondes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Letspicsaboutit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two former railway sheds are now home to one of the most exciting cultural spaces in Luxembourg City, which is aimed at sharing ideas and fostering new talent.

One of my favourite places to visit is <strong><a href=\"https://www.rct.lv/en/\" title=\"\">Riga Central Market</a></strong>, a Unesco world heritage site on the banks of the Daugava a few hundred metres from the old town.

On the top-floor terrace of the museum, you can enjoy a glass of lemonade or an occasional gig, and take in the best view of Romania\u2019s divisive new People\u2019s Salvation Cathedral, which cost the country about \u20ac400m. <br><strong>Paula Erizanu</strong></p> <h2><strong>Netherlands</strong><br>On a sunny day it could almost be Thailand \u2026</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"9a2277e623d38799616dd04c449ac7549a583327\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a2277e623d38799616dd04c449ac7549a583327/0_267_4275_2564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dunes, beach and sea at the coast of Holland during a summer evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Hook of Holland</strong> is an odd place to love. Go there and look south, and you\u2019ll see one of the densest concentrations of industry in Europe: giant cranes, chimneys smoking like upturned cigars, and massive cargo ships rumbling their way from the Rhine into the North Sea. Yet head north and you\u2019ll see something different: an arc of empty white sand stretching for miles. On a sunny day, you could almost be in Thailand.</p> <p>The appeal lies partly in the beach\u2019s beauty, but also in the way it captures the spirit of the Netherlands: beautiful but industrious, peaceful but dynamic. It\u2019s a crossroads where culture and history have always blended, like ingredients in a cocktail.</p> <p>I first came to the Hook a decade ago, soon after I moved to the Netherlands, when I lived just up the coast. Later, my wife and I were married in the sand dunes. Now, I come here often with our little daughter and watch her play in the waves. Sitting on the sand with a plate of fresh fish, we\u2019re nearly as close to Essex as Maastricht.

My favourite place in my adopted homeland is the medieval town of <strong>Kamnik</strong>. Once a far more important city than Ljubljana, it was the feudal stronghold of the Bavarian Andechs clan, who made it a stop on trade routes between Budapest in the east and Venice to the west.</p> <p>Today the town boasts three castles, hiking trails close to the centre, an important rare books library, rich industrial heritage (the KIK factory here once produced much of the gunpowder for the Austro-Hungarian army and the Stol factory exported Thonet rocking chairs to the US), and may have the most microbreweries per capita in the world (six for a population of around 10,000). At the foot of the Kamnik-Savinja mountain range, it is also an ideal gateway to the sunny side of the Alps, a 10-minute drive from the <strong>Velika Planina mountain plateau</strong> , the closest you\u2019ll get to Middle Earth in Middle Europe. <br><strong>Noah Charney, author of Slovenology: Living and Traveling in the World\u2019s Best Country</strong></p> <h2><strong>Austria<br></strong>Vienna\u2019s Imperial Parliament</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3ad6dd4b0851056f665ee3495c950f5ce913af91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ad6dd4b0851056f665ee3495c950f5ce913af91/0_0_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Federal Assembly Chamber at the Austrian Parliament building, Vienna\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My favourite place in Vienna \u2013 and indeed in Austria \u2013 is one that conjures up the most vivid image of the former multi-ethnic and multilingual western half of the Habsburg empire: the chamber of the former House of Commons (Sitzungssaal des Abgeordnetenhauses) in the old <strong><a href=\"http://parlament.gv.at/ENGL/GEBF/index.shtml\" title=\"\">Imperial Parliament</a></strong> (Reichsrat). It\u2019s largely unused since the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918 (except for the swearing-in of the president); miraculously, it also escaped wartime bombing.</p> <p>What is splendid and moving about it, aside from its size, beauty and sense of history, is the fact that representatives from almost all parts of the empire gathered there from 1883. German speakers from Austria itself and also from Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Carniola and Bukovina, as well as Czechs, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Italians, Romanians and even one member of the Jewish National Party, all elected on the basis of universal male suffrage after 1907, met in this chamber. For all the linguistic chaos and political divisions, the riotous and boisterous filibustering, the subterfuges and boycotts, it somehow functioned as the world\u2019s first multinational parliament.</p> <p>In 1918 it became redundant and the individual nations went their own way, leaving the leaders of the new Austrian Republic too few to fill the former Imperial Chamber. Subsequent decades saw conflict between many of the nations that had been part of Austria-Hungary, culminating in the Balkan wars of the 1990s; this chamber is reminiscent of gentler times, when all nations of the monarchy \u2013 no matter their disagreements or even hatreds \u2013 were able to contain themselves in a usually civilised arena rather than resort to violence.</p> <p>The modern-day EU parliament, with its 705 MEPs representing 27 countries, is perhaps its heir, though it lacks its magic and gravitas.</p> <p>At the moment, the Imperial Parliament building is closed for rebuilding and refurbishment, and will remain so until 2021. The glorious former House of Commons chamber itself will undergo a mere clean-up and a few repairs, and will return to its full splendour.<br><strong>Christopher Brennan</strong></p> <h2><strong>Lithuania</strong><br>Modern museum that recreated our past</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0bb2eb9aea858abf3e418d53dd7188e5256f5baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bb2eb9aea858abf3e418d53dd7188e5256f5baa/0_213_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MO Museum in Vilnius\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MO Museum in Vilnius.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Flavijus/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://mo.lt/en/\" title=\"\">MO museum</a></strong>, which opened in October 2018, changed everything in Vilnius. Not only is it an incredible place for Lithuanian modern art, it\u2019s also an example of new-wave Lithuanian philanthropy. The museum was funded by two Lithuanian scientists and designed by architects at Studio Libeskind. It\u2019s a striking building, at the intersection of the old town and the city\u2019s more recent westwards expansion.</p> <p>MO museum recently had a wildly successful exhibition called The Origin of Species: the 1990s DNA. I went four times, because it really was a way to relive our recent history \u2013 the wild 1990s, the starting point of capitalism in Lithuania, the foundation of our modern, democratic state.</p> <p>You could relive experiences such as trying on new jeans in winter while standing on a piece of cardboard in Gari\u016bnai (the infamous open-air market 20 minutes outside Vilnius); buying one cigarette from a kiosk; and watching movies on a VHS player.</p> <p>There are permanent exhibitions of Lithuanian modern art as well \u2013 my favourite painter is the postmodernist \u0160ar\u016bnas Sauka. The museum also has a boutique cinema, a cafe and a small shop full of great Lithuanian art, jewellery and books. At the moment, preparations are being made for a huge exhibition showcasing the works of cult British film director Peter Greenaway.

It\u2019s a social event as much as a shopping expedition and not somewhere you can go in a hurry because there are always updates on children, illnesses, operations and deaths to be discussed. It has a very Mediterranean, familial vibe.</p> <p>I often have breakfast in the market bar, Bar Joan, a family affair run by Joan and his sons and daughters. They know their customers well and no sooner do I pull up a red vinyl stool than one of them is fixing me a caf\u00e9 con leche and calling to the kitchen for a <em>bikini</em> (toasted ham and cheese). They also make a fine <em>tortilla de patatas</em>.</p> <p>One morning I sat next to a man who breakfasted on tripe and beer followed by a <em>carajillo</em> (coffee with a splash of cognac). Spanish men of a certain age often kick off the day with a hit of booze, frequently red wine.

In the oratory of the church of the Order of St John, which is a true gem of high baroque, there is a painting that I really admire and always moves me: <strong>Caravaggio\u2019s </strong><strong>Beheading of St John the Baptist</strong>.</p> <p>Included in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/mar/21/the-10-greatest-works-art-ever\" title=\"\">the Guardian\u2019s list of the 10 greatest works of art ever</a>, and once described as \u201cthe painting of the 17th century\u201d, it is as alive now as it has ever been, and with a message that is still relevant: life and death, youth against old age, the contrast of colours, with light and dark captured by the astounding chiaroscuro technique of the eccentric genius. It reveals not only the story but the very self of the artist, and engulfs the observer in its theatrical action, sparking our emotions too.</p> <p>There are many historical sites to visit in Valletta \u2013 the Grand Master\u2019s Palace, Casa Rocca Piccola (a \u201cliving\u201d 16th-century palazzo), the Malta National Community Art Museum \u2013 but Caravaggio\u2019s masterpiece is the one I always come back to.

Wild herbs blanket this long, spindly island that dangles into the <a href=\"https://www.find-croatia.com/kvarner/\" title=\"\">Kvarner Gulf</a> south of Rijeka, and the smell of them instantly gives me a lift during my meandering bike ride through the pines.</p> <p>Every now and then I park my bike and plunge into the impossibly clear water. I love the fact that the beaches that ring Lo\u0161inj are \u2013 like most of those in Croatia \u2013 pebbly rather than sandy. Some of them take a bit of effort to reach, usually involving a long hike down a rocky trail, if you don\u2019t have your own boat.</p> <p>This all adds to the rough-and-ready ruggedness you get away from the big beach resorts. Simplicity is the key, and you can taste it in the grilled fish served at waterside restaurants and the giant rounds of bread baked under a cast-iron bell.</p> <p>It\u2019s this gentle assault on all the senses that I appreciate every time I go to Croatia\u2019s Adriatic coast \u2013 from the vivid blue-green of the sea to the heady fragrance of herbs and pine that have been baked in the heat.

While I love the bright lights and cosmopolitan vibe of Lisbon and Porto, it is the vestiges of \u201cold\u201d Portugal that really enchant me. To find them, just step into any neighbourhood <em>pastelaria</em> (cafe-bakery). You\u2019ll find the day\u2019s newspaper on a table, the footie on the TV and friends shooting the breeze over average-tasting but cheap (less than \u20ac1) <em>caf\u00e9 expressos</em>.</p> <p>In Portugal, pastelarias double as repositories of local pride. Aside from the ubiquitous <em>pastel de nata</em> (the famous creamy custard tart, now available in M&amp;S), every self-respecting Portuguese town boasts its own speciality sweet. Cernache do Bonjardim has its almond <em>cartuchos</em> (shells); Castro Daire its <em>bolo podre</em> (literally, \u201crotten cake\u201d); Chaves its meat-filled <em>pastel</em>.

A true celebration of the craft, the five-day festival skips the red carpets and invites the audience and acclaimed international directors to the small village of Sodankyl\u00e4, in Finnish Lapland, to enjoy the round-the-clock feature film screenings each June, when the sun blazes above the horizon day and night.</p> <p>The programme ranges from premieres and rarities to classics and oddities, from silent films to karaoke singalong shows in a former circus tent. The morning discussion sessions with directors are a much-loved tradition, but not everybody makes it to those \u2013 the price of wrecking one\u2019s circadian rhythm with high doses of sunshine.</p> <p>The laid-back atmosphere and lack of hierarchy encapsulate something of the Finnish propensity for happiness (Finland has topped the world\u2019s \u201chappy league\u201d for the past two years).

      "bodyText": "Greece A mountain odyssey I often dream of the journey over the Taygetos mountains from the western coast of the Peloponnese peninsula to the town of Sparta. It\u2019s a trip I\u2019ve done many times, most recently with my family. You start by the beaches of Kalamata, where my daughter was born, and a mere 10-minute drive up a small winding road takes you into the mountains, with the white houses and sea below. This is the route Telemachus (Odysseus\u2019 son) took to visit Menelaus and Helen, newly returned from Troy. It\u2019s Greece, so these are proper mountains. The road crests at 1,600 metres, taller than Ben Nevis, and there is a Swiss chalet-style cafe here that serves good hot chocolate. We tend to stop a bit before, at the village of Artemisia, where the Theotokos taverna has a balcony overlooking a valley on one side and a spring on the other. Locals sell herbs and honey down by the spring and the waiters (the owner\u2019s kids) fill up your jug from it. Just before Sparta is Mystra, the ruins of a Byzantine city. The top of its battlements is my favourite spot on Earth \u2013 mountains on one side, the white splash of Sparta on the other. All of history in one spot. Andrew Bostock Italy Cafe culture in Umbria It started with a mug. That was when I knew I\u2019d been accepted into the fold at Capitano del Popolo, a bar and restaurant in the Umbrian outpost of Orvieto. I\u2019d sought temporary refuge in the hilltop town after losing my job in Rome in 2016, and was soon enraptured by its charms. Capitano del Popolo quickly became my stomping ground, a convivial place to drink caff\u00e8 latte from my personal mug \u2013 a gift from the wonderful owner and chef, Valentina Santanicchio \u2013 or enjoy one of her dishes, such as handmade pappardelle with wild boar rag\u00f9, while sitting on the terrace under an often-piercing blue winter sky and marvelling at the 14th-century palace across the square. Italy is brimming with history and culture, places to visit and things to do. Venice, Rome and Florence are itinerary staples, Orvieto less so. The town, with its imposing cathedral, fresh air, sublime views of the Umbrian countryside and friendships made, is now my number one place to escape to from Rome. I often describe Orvieto as a comfort blanket, which wrapped me in its warmth at a time when it was needed most. Angela Giuffrida Belgium Oh, I do like to stroll along the Ostend prom The Ostend seafront is one of the places in the EU to which the UK is (geographically) closest. This two-mile strip of Belgian coastline also offers one of the loveliest strolls in Europe. A five-minute walk from the railway station, the promenade starts with stalls selling fresh seafood and chips. Continuing west, the route passes seafront cafes, museums, belle \u00e9poque houses, a modernist casino, the splendid Thermae Palace Hotel, a spooky sculpture in memory of the Ostendais artist L\u00e9on Spilliaert, and children pleased to be at a favourite Belgian beach. But it\u2019s the sea itself that will keep you staring. A hypnotic expanse of water, shifting through black and white, with blue, green and gold reflections of the sky. You can\u2019t see Margate on the British coast but it\u2019s only about 65 miles away. When Charlotte Bront\u00eb arrived in Belgium in 1843, she wrote of her \u201cprosperous and speedy voyage\u201d from London Bridge Wharf along the north Kent coast and on to Ostend. Following the suspension of passenger services from Ramsgate 170 years later, there are sadly now no ferries to this windswept haven for passengers leaving England today. Thank goodness for Eurostar. Emily Waterfield Poland Warsaw\u2019s cemetery captures the essence of a continent Warsaw\u2019s Old Pow\u0105zki cemetery captures better than almost any other place the essence of a continent that so readily defines itself in terms of its history. A resting place for generations of poets, writers and composers, the cemetery is most famous for its thousands of iron, bronze and stone tombs and sepulchral sculptures, as well as the chestnut trees, oaks and lindens that shelter you from the heavens above. But what captivates me most is the beauty and variety of the names of the great and the good of 19th- and early 20th-century Warsaw that lie below them. Many have wonderful foreign names that provoke nostalgia for a long-gone Poland that was genuinely multicultural: names like Pawe\u0142 Pellizzaro, Henryk Leon Malhomme, Kazimierz Wolff-Zdzienicki, Wac\u0142aw Malcolm-Morris, Matylda de Castellaz-Abramowicz. While others are, to me at least, simply glorious names in their own right: Fidelis Matuszewski, Jan Habdank-Stpiczynski, Karolina Semelman Neugebauer, Hipolit Flock and my own personal favourite, Felicjan Szmakfefer. Poland\u2019s cemeteries are known for All Saints Day commemorations (1 November), when millions of Poles gather to lay candles on the graves of loved ones and national heroes. But I find the living\u2019s habit of making the day about themselves can be irritating, and Pow\u0105zki is best visited on a winter\u2019s weekday afternoon, when you have only the dead for company \u2013 a perfect place to reflect on the future of a country and continent that refuses to rest in peace. Christian Davies Denmark A very broad church A defunct church is potentially an eerie place, but the former church of Absalon in Copenhagen\u2019s hip Vesterbro district is always buzzing with life and laughter. In 2014, Lennart Lajboschitz, founder of the Flying Tiger retail chain, bought the building for \u00a31.2m and exchanged the pews and altar for long tables, comfy sofas and a bar. Now around 700 people visit this community space every day: some come to enjoy a coffee, a chat and a game of backgammon or chess, others to work on their laptops. Every evening at 6pm up to 200 people gather in the main hall for a communal meal. At around \u00a35 a plate, it\u2019s an affordable dining-out option that attracts people of all ages and nationalities. Others come to attend one of numerous activities: yoga, tango lessons, quizzes, drag queen bingo, table tennis, dodgeball tournaments, bridge, life drawing, a writers\u2019 workshop and crafts such as pottery and bookbinding. Some of these may also involve drinking Baileys \u2026 because, well, why not? Andrea Bak Germany The floating railway I could spend all day on the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, a unique suspension railway system in Wuppertal. Which makes me a Schwebebahnliebhaberin (floating rail aficionado), a word as slinky as the monorail system itself, an elegant, airy, 13km engineering wonder which snakes its way through the Wupper valley (between D\u00fcsseldorf and Cologne), humming along the track between Barmen and Elberfeld, and must be one of the nearest experiences to flying. \u201cWhy drive, when you can float to work?\u201d was the thinking at the turn of the 20th century, when commuter numbers were growing and construction work on it began. Industrialisation had caused the western German region to develop so quickly that there was no room for broader streets to take the increase in traffic, and so the decision was made to go high. Steel girder construction was all the rage at the time \u2013 Paris got its Eiffel Tower, Wuppertal its floating railway, complete with the strident green limbs that give it its height and majesty. The Kaiser and his wife took a ride on it in 1900, hence the Kaiserwagen (carriage 5) with its velvet upholstery and gold trimmings, which has since been restored and can be ridden at weekends. An even more famous journey was undertaken by a circus elephant called Tuffi, who was put on it as a publicity stunt in 1950 but panicked in the overcrowded carriage and plunged into the river Wupper below. She survived with only minor injuries, as did her story, which has been retold to German children ever since. Not only is it a pleasure to ride \u2013 ideally kneeling on a seat at the back looking out of the window on to city and river life below \u2013 but also very efficient, with a train running every four minutes and reasonably priced (\u20ac2.90 for an adult single, \u20ac7.20 for 24 hours). It remains the transport of choice for Wuppertalers, moving around 25 million passengers a year.Wuppertal is also home to the dance company of the late choreographer Pina Bausch, and the Schwebebahn features in the 2011 film Pina, Wim Wenders\u2019 tribute to Bausch. Kate Connolly Bulgaria Brutalist classic \u2013 with a great view of Sofia It\u2019s not the tallest structure in Bulgaria. It\u2019s not even the tallest TV tower in the country (that accolade goes to Rousse). But Kopitoto, or the Vitosha Mountain TV Tower to give it its official name, has defined Sofia\u2019s skyline since the mid-1980s. Most people are quick to laud Kopitoto (which means \u201cthe hoof\u201d) for the spectacular views it offers over the city \u2013 it stands at 186 metres (about double the height of Big Ben) on an outcrop of the 2,290-metre Vitosha mountain, around 20km from the city centre. As a sucker for brutalist architecture, I\u2019ve always loved the sheer scale of this concrete marvel of engineering, which is hexagonal in shape \u2013 but with three of the six sides extended, it appears almost triangular. From the 1960s until the beginning of the 90s, there was a cable car that took you up the mountain. Now the defunct graffiti-laden terminus station, right next to the TV tower, attracts urban explorers. My only regret is that it doesn\u2019t do tours. \u2022 Svetoslav Petrov, editor-in-chief of Boyscout in Bulgaria Czech Republic Prague\u2019s coolest cinema The lifeblood of the trendy Letn\u00e1 district, Bio Oko cinema is the perfect place to immerse yourself in Czech culture. When I arrived a decade ago, I was here all the time, devouring every Czech-produced movie I could, trying to get to grips with the country\u2019s dark history and offbeat humour. But it\u2019s far more than just a cinema, and the bar outside the deckchair-strewn auditorium is a great hangout. It\u2019s ideal for a quiet espresso during the day, but in the evening it springs into life with hip locals spilling out from the tables all the way up the stairs, drinking craft lager and eating delicious homemade quiche. The walls are lined with old communist-era movie posters, and many of these original prints are available to buy at the Terry Gilliam-inspired shop, Terry Posters (in sister cinema Kino Svtozor), from as little as \u20ac6. Mark Pickering Ireland Cork\u2019s best bar It\u2019s fair to say that a few years ago Douglas Street, in Cork\u2019s south inner city, an area blighted by the ill effects of anti-social behaviour, did not have the best of reputations. Walk along it today, however, and the historic thoroughfare, just five minutes from the city centre, has significantly been transformed. At the western end is the oasis of Nano Nagle Place, a former convent that in 2017 was converted into a complex that celebrates the extraordinary life of the eponymous 18th-century pioneer of Catholic education. There is a museum, a garden and a \u201csustainable foods cafe\u201d, the Good Day Deli, in an airy modern glass pavilion. At the eastern edge is the primary engine of the area\u2019s positive change: Coughlan\u2019s. An almost 200-year-old \u201cbackstreet old man\u2019s bar\u201d taken over by musician and creative force Edel Curtin in 2012, Coughlan\u2019s \u2013 which with pure Cork perverseness is pronounced \u201cCAW-lans\u201d \u2013 has since become the award-winning best music venue in the country. The intimate listening room in the formerly unloved lounge bar has a total capacity of no more than 65 seated, and yet Coughlan\u2019s has managed to attract star American singer-songwriters Ana\u00efs Mitchell, Ryley Walker and Sarah Jarosz, and leading Irish musicians such as Lisa O\u2019Neill, Glen Hansard, Lisa Hannigan and Mick Flannery. It\u2019s like a major venue in a music-savvy friend\u2019s sitting room, with the added bonus of \u2013 so Coughlan\u2019s claims, and with some justification \u2013 the best pint of stout in Cork. Philip Watson Cyprus Medieval masterpiece The village of Pyrga lies between Nicosia and Larnaca in the east of Cyprus. It\u2019s a pretty place, the sort that Peter Mayle might have settled in had Provence not got him first. As it is, Pyrga\u2019s only claim to fame is that it is home to a remarkable stone building. It could be mistaken for an old storeroom, except the gothic detail above the door hints at something more special. This building is a medieval royal chapel. Inside, damaged but beautiful frescos look as if they have been transported from medieval France. They tell the story of the marriage of King Janus to Charlotte de Bourbon in 1411, and betray the fact that Cyprus was a medieval French kingdom. Its rulers were the Lusignans, cousins to the English Plantagenets and as the chapel\u2019s garrulous caretaker will tell you, Queen Charlotte is an ancestor of the UK\u2019s current queen. Cyprus has not always been comfortable with its medieval heritage. For some, celebrating this French period and subsequent Venetian rule undermines the claim that Cyprus is a Greek island. Yet the Lusignans and their heirs left some stunning monuments, which easily overshadow the Roman remains at sites like Kourion. Apart from Pyrga, Kolossi and Limassol have two of the most intact Crusader castles , and the capital, Nicosia, is encircled by massive Venetian walls. Most dramatic of all, in the middle of Nicosia, sits the huge 13th-century French gothic Cathedral of St Sophia, which was converted into the the Selimiye Mosque in 1570. For a lover of medieval culture like myself, these gothic churches \u2013 many of which have been converted into mosques or subsumed into Byzantine structures \u2013 make Cyprus an unexpected revelation. Michael Paraskos, novelist and lecturer Luxembourg Shedloads of culture Two former railway sheds are now home to one of the most exciting cultural spaces in Luxembourg City, which is aimed at sharing ideas and fostering new talent. Built in 1877 to store steam locomotives, the Rotondes remained underutilised throughout the 20th century (one was a warehouse, the other a bus garage). A decade ago the ministry of culture started to renovate these national monuments to host cultural activities, reopening them five years ago. The Northern roundhouse now hosts exhibitions, lectures, dance, secondhand markets and other events. The Southern roundhouse is a dark, cosy bar that holds quiz nights, concerts and theatre performances. The building between them houses Radio ARA, where I work. Once winter is over, the outdoor courtyard is filled with pallet furniture and people drinking and eating \u2013 bankers, hipsters, mums, musicians \u2013 the place is a magnet for all types, like Luxembourg itself. Wendy Winn, radio presenter Latvia Listed market in old zeppelin hangars Riga is an architecturally eclectic place with an incredible variety of coexisting styles: you can see the finest examples of art deco, alongside brutalist Soviet architecture and neoclassical buildings. One of my favourite places to visit is Riga Central Market, a Unesco world heritage site on the banks of the Daugava a few hundred metres from the old town. It\u2019s a wondrous blend of art deco and neoclassicism, and when it opened in 1930 it was recognised as not only the largest, but also one of the best marketplaces in Europe. The five pavilions are former zeppelin hangars, and beneath each cavernous ceiling is a specialist market selling vegetables, dairy, meat, fish and local specialities. Riga doesn\u2019t have a historic cafe tradition like Paris or Vienna, but the place to meet artists and bump into writers or musicians is the Cafe Osiris restaurant, which has had a loyal clientele for 25 years. The late owner Andrejs \u017dagars, who died last year, once said: \u201cIt\u2019s the only cafe that reflects part of Riga as it was at the beginning of the 1990s. This place ... is an authentic proof of the time when Riga was changing, when Latvia was changing.\u201d With its simple yet refined menu, Cafe Osiris is one of my favourite places to eat in the city, and we\u2019ve used it to host Riga Biennial dinners for visiting artists on many occasions. Agniya Mirgorodskaya, founding director of the Riga Biennial Foundation France An art deco gem in the post-industrial rough As the Eurostar makes its way through northern France\u2019s post-industrial heartland, passengers en route to Paris or Brussels just want to be on their way, which is a pity. In Roubaix, one of the grittier towns in a region once famous for its mines and factories, sits a jewel called La Piscine, an art deco swimming baths transformed into a museum. It doesn\u2019t look much from the outside, but step into the pool hall, with its mosaic tiles and enamelled-brick showers, and the starburst stained-glass windows cast a magical glow over a collection of nude statues and sculptures from various artists and periods posed around the pool. When I visited for the first time, the museum was almost empty and the effect was breathtaking. The frozen figures look as if they\u2019re about to take \u2013 or have just taken \u2013 a dip in the rippling water. There is more to La Piscine: its permanent collection, which has now been extended into a former factory next door, includes works by Giacometti, Rodin, Claudel and Picasso. But the pool hall alone is worth the visit. Get off the train at Lille and take the metro for 30 minutes to Roubaix. Paris and Brussels can wait. Kim Willsher Slovakia A walk by the Danube Unlike most European capitals, Bratislava is not overcrowded. Even so, it\u2019s hard to believe that, tucked just behind the Eurovea shopping mall, there\u2019s such a relaxing, crowd-free spot. I discovered this Danube river walk when I was working in the city and would slip off at lunchtime to stroll beside the water and watch the ducks foraging for food. There are usually couples and colleagues picnicking along the bank, but it\u2019s also dotted with great cafes and restaurants. My favourite is Primi, a chic, Mediterranean-style eatery that serves terrific sea bass and bowls of tasty gazpacho. I actually had my first date with my now husband here \u2013 it must have had a certain kind of magic. If you head over Star\u00fd most \u2013 a newly renovated pedestrian and tram bridge \u2013 the opposite bank offers an incredible view of Bratislava castle, especially dazzling at sunset. The \u201cbotel\u201d and restaurant Dunajsk\u00fd Pivovar offers a good gawping spot, as well as some excellent Slovakian cuisine. For the complete Bratislava experience, order a plate of traditional halu\u0161ky (potato dumplings with sheep\u2019s cheese) and a summery pint of the homemade brew. Mark\u00e9ta Horv\u00e1thov\u00e1 Sweden Our national sauna capital Way up north, surrounded by meadows and forests, the border between Sweden and Finland consists of lively rapids called Kukkolaforsen, part of the larger River Torne. The area has a long history of log-driving, war and smuggling, and four languages are spoken here: Swedish, Finnish, S\u00e1mi and Me\u00e4nkieli \u2013 a minority language closely related to Finnish. At midsummer the sun is up all hours; at midwinter it never rises. The tiny village of Kukkola is the unofficial sauna capital of Sweden. I warmly recommend a sweaty session in the village sauna, a large log cabin that can accommodate 65 fiery enthusiasts on three levels of long benches, heated by a large aggregate that holds 600kg of stone. Afterwards you can take a cooling dip in the stream, then head to the local inn for specialities like moose, gravadlax in a cup and coffee cheese with cloudberries. For a historic sauna experience, follow the river north a bit to the aromatic 300-year-old smoke sauna of Matkakoski \u2013 thought to be the oldest sauna in Sweden still in use. Nearby you can fish for whitefish and salmon and forage for berries and mushrooms. Jens Linder, chef Estonia Half of the country is covered in forest Visitors are always impressed by Tallinn\u2019s old town and fall in love with the local cuisine. But, when they venture out of the city they\u2019re even more amazed by the open spaces, untouched nature, long empty beaches, and bus stops seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Estonia is small (about a fifth the size of the UK) and around half of the country is covered in forest, making it very easy to escape and not see another person. Approximately one-fifth is protected under its five national parks and nature reserves. A network of hiking trails crosses the country, quite literally off the beaten path. Lahemaa national park has a mix of forest, bog and seashore; K\u00f5rvemaa nature reserve is great for birdwatching; and Soomaa national park is unique \u2013 it floods every year, so is only accessible by kayak. But my favourite national park is Matsalu, known for birdwatching \u2013 it is home to over 200 different species. In spring the trees come to life with the sound of thousands of birds chirping. The birdsong is indescribably beautiful; it\u2019s like a symphony and therapy for the soul. Like many Estonians, I have a country house that I escape to \u2013 mine is near Matsalu and has a hot tub and sauna for soaking in post-exploring. Kristina Lupp Hungary Budapest\u2019s beautiful courtyard Budapest has long been marked by grand cafes, pastry shops and, above all, by the Danube flowing between the steep hills of ancient Buda and the expensive villas of Pest on the other side, comprising a wild profusion of building styles. In the heart of Pest there is a small interior courtyard: 10 Magyar utca. You can cut through it by day, proceeding through the quiet Magyar utca gate, stepping over silent wooden cobbles, to the busy M\u00fazeum k\u00f6r\u00fat. Built by Mikl\u00f3s Ybl in 1852, four years after the failure of the 1848 revolution and 15 years before the establishment of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the courtyard is an eclectic, beautifully proportioned, faintly Venetian blend of classic and romantic. Much of Budapest is empire grandeur under bombardment. This is not. There are spaces that hold you through colour, air, texture and proportion. The first time you see Giotto\u2019s Pazzi Chapel in Florence, you feel it. If Budapest has a humane soul, it is something like this. You breathe differently here. You hope for more. George Szirtes Romania From dictator\u2019s palace to brilliant museum One of my favourite places in Bucharest is the National Museum of Contemporary Art (MNAC). It was here that I discovered avant-garde Romanian art, which has flourished ever since the 1970s, when dictator Nicolae Ceausescu stopped imposing the socialist-realist style. The museum is in the neoclassical Casa Poporului, or the Palace of the Parliament, the second-largest government building in the world after the Pentagon and the embodiment of Ceausescu\u2019s ego and ambition: building it required an entire neighbourhood of about six square kilometres to be bulldozed and 57,000 families relocated. Getting to the museum is an adventure in itself, especially if you\u2019re wearing high heels, as it\u2019s a walk of a good seven minutes from the gates to the entrance. It\u2019s not just the contrast with the totalitarian undertones of the Palace that sets MNAC apart. On the top-floor terrace of the museum, you can enjoy a glass of lemonade or an occasional gig, and take in the best view of Romania\u2019s divisive new People\u2019s Salvation Cathedral, which cost the country about \u20ac400m. Paula Erizanu Netherlands On a sunny day it could almost be Thailand \u2026 Hook of Holland is an odd place to love. Go there and look south, and you\u2019ll see one of the densest concentrations of industry in Europe: giant cranes, chimneys smoking like upturned cigars, and massive cargo ships rumbling their way from the Rhine into the North Sea. Yet head north and you\u2019ll see something different: an arc of empty white sand stretching for miles. On a sunny day, you could almost be in Thailand. The appeal lies partly in the beach\u2019s beauty, but also in the way it captures the spirit of the Netherlands: beautiful but industrious, peaceful but dynamic. It\u2019s a crossroads where culture and history have always blended, like ingredients in a cocktail. I first came to the Hook a decade ago, soon after I moved to the Netherlands, when I lived just up the coast. Later, my wife and I were married in the sand dunes. Now, I come here often with our little daughter and watch her play in the waves. Sitting on the sand with a plate of fresh fish, we\u2019re nearly as close to Essex as Maastricht. Britain feels tantalisingly close, yet also very far away. Ben Coates, author of The Rhine: Following Europe\u2019s Greatest River from Amsterdam to the Alps (John Murray Press, \u00a39.99) Slovenia On the sunny side of the Alps If you\u2019re a wise enough traveller to know that Slovenia is well worth a visit, then you\u2019ll be sure to see the delightful capital, Ljubljana, and will doubtless head off to fairytale Lake Bled, dolloped by a church-topped island and with a Grimm castle looming on a clifftop above it. The question, then, is: what else you should see, beyond the Big Two attractions? My favourite place in my adopted homeland is the medieval town of Kamnik. Once a far more important city than Ljubljana, it was the feudal stronghold of the Bavarian Andechs clan, who made it a stop on trade routes between Budapest in the east and Venice to the west. Today the town boasts three castles, hiking trails close to the centre, an important rare books library, rich industrial heritage (the KIK factory here once produced much of the gunpowder for the Austro-Hungarian army and the Stol factory exported Thonet rocking chairs to the US), and may have the most microbreweries per capita in the world (six for a population of around 10,000). At the foot of the Kamnik-Savinja mountain range, it is also an ideal gateway to the sunny side of the Alps, a 10-minute drive from the Velika Planina mountain plateau , the closest you\u2019ll get to Middle Earth in Middle Europe. Noah Charney, author of Slovenology: Living and Traveling in the World\u2019s Best Country Austria Vienna\u2019s Imperial Parliament My favourite place in Vienna \u2013 and indeed in Austria \u2013 is one that conjures up the most vivid image of the former multi-ethnic and multilingual western half of the Habsburg empire: the chamber of the former House of Commons (Sitzungssaal des Abgeordnetenhauses) in the old Imperial Parliament (Reichsrat). It\u2019s largely unused since the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918 (except for the swearing-in of the president); miraculously, it also escaped wartime bombing. What is splendid and moving about it, aside from its size, beauty and sense of history, is the fact that representatives from almost all parts of the empire gathered there from 1883. German speakers from Austria itself and also from Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Carniola and Bukovina, as well as Czechs, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Italians, Romanians and even one member of the Jewish National Party, all elected on the basis of universal male suffrage after 1907, met in this chamber. For all the linguistic chaos and political divisions, the riotous and boisterous filibustering, the subterfuges and boycotts, it somehow functioned as the world\u2019s first multinational parliament. In 1918 it became redundant and the individual nations went their own way, leaving the leaders of the new Austrian Republic too few to fill the former Imperial Chamber. Subsequent decades saw conflict between many of the nations that had been part of Austria-Hungary, culminating in the Balkan wars of the 1990s; this chamber is reminiscent of gentler times, when all nations of the monarchy \u2013 no matter their disagreements or even hatreds \u2013 were able to contain themselves in a usually civilised arena rather than resort to violence. The modern-day EU parliament, with its 705 MEPs representing 27 countries, is perhaps its heir, though it lacks its magic and gravitas. At the moment, the Imperial Parliament building is closed for rebuilding and refurbishment, and will remain so until 2021. The glorious former House of Commons chamber itself will undergo a mere clean-up and a few repairs, and will return to its full splendour. Christopher Brennan Lithuania Modern museum that recreated our past MO museum, which opened in October 2018, changed everything in Vilnius. Not only is it an incredible place for Lithuanian modern art, it\u2019s also an example of new-wave Lithuanian philanthropy. The museum was funded by two Lithuanian scientists and designed by architects at Studio Libeskind. It\u2019s a striking building, at the intersection of the old town and the city\u2019s more recent westwards expansion. MO museum recently had a wildly successful exhibition called The Origin of Species: the 1990s DNA. I went four times, because it really was a way to relive our recent history \u2013 the wild 1990s, the starting point of capitalism in Lithuania, the foundation of our modern, democratic state. You could relive experiences such as trying on new jeans in winter while standing on a piece of cardboard in Gari\u016bnai (the infamous open-air market 20 minutes outside Vilnius); buying one cigarette from a kiosk; and watching movies on a VHS player. There are permanent exhibitions of Lithuanian modern art as well \u2013 my favourite painter is the postmodernist \u0160ar\u016bnas Sauka. The museum also has a boutique cinema, a cafe and a small shop full of great Lithuanian art, jewellery and books. At the moment, preparations are being made for a huge exhibition showcasing the works of cult British film director Peter Greenaway. Artificial rain is said to be part of the show\u2019s experience. Neringa Rekasiute Spain The Barcelona market that feels like home Two or three times a week for the past 18 years, I have shopped in Barcelona\u2019s Santa Caterina market. It\u2019s a social event as much as a shopping expedition and not somewhere you can go in a hurry because there are always updates on children, illnesses, operations and deaths to be discussed. It has a very Mediterranean, familial vibe. I often have breakfast in the market bar, Bar Joan, a family affair run by Joan and his sons and daughters. They know their customers well and no sooner do I pull up a red vinyl stool than one of them is fixing me a caf\u00e9 con leche and calling to the kitchen for a bikini (toasted ham and cheese). They also make a fine tortilla de patatas. One morning I sat next to a man who breakfasted on tripe and beer followed by a carajillo (coffee with a splash of cognac). Spanish men of a certain age often kick off the day with a hit of booze, frequently red wine. Even after living here for 20 years I can\u2019t imagine drinking wine at 8am, which is probably just as well. Stephen Burgen Malta Caravaggio in Valletta In Malta\u2019s capital city there are more than 25 churches displaying incredible baroque paintings and architecture. In the oratory of the church of the Order of St John, which is a true gem of high baroque, there is a painting that I really admire and always moves me: Caravaggio\u2019s Beheading of St John the Baptist. Included in the Guardian\u2019s list of the 10 greatest works of art ever, and once described as \u201cthe painting of the 17th century\u201d, it is as alive now as it has ever been, and with a message that is still relevant: life and death, youth against old age, the contrast of colours, with light and dark captured by the astounding chiaroscuro technique of the eccentric genius. It reveals not only the story but the very self of the artist, and engulfs the observer in its theatrical action, sparking our emotions too. There are many historical sites to visit in Valletta \u2013 the Grand Master\u2019s Palace, Casa Rocca Piccola (a \u201cliving\u201d 16th-century palazzo), the Malta National Community Art Museum \u2013 but Caravaggio\u2019s masterpiece is the one I always come back to. A visit to the cathedral and its oratory is by far the highlight of the Valletta experience. Fra Nikola Soukmandjiev, diplomat, priest and tour guide Croatia A fragrant island The air is heavy with the scent of wild rosemary, sage and pine as I cycle along the path that skirts Lo\u0161inj\u2019s north-western headlands. They call Lo\u0161inj \u201cthe island of vitality\u201d, and this is more than mere marketing guff. Wild herbs blanket this long, spindly island that dangles into the Kvarner Gulf south of Rijeka, and the smell of them instantly gives me a lift during my meandering bike ride through the pines. Every now and then I park my bike and plunge into the impossibly clear water. I love the fact that the beaches that ring Lo\u0161inj are \u2013 like most of those in Croatia \u2013 pebbly rather than sandy. Some of them take a bit of effort to reach, usually involving a long hike down a rocky trail, if you don\u2019t have your own boat. This all adds to the rough-and-ready ruggedness you get away from the big beach resorts. Simplicity is the key, and you can taste it in the grilled fish served at waterside restaurants and the giant rounds of bread baked under a cast-iron bell. It\u2019s this gentle assault on all the senses that I appreciate every time I go to Croatia\u2019s Adriatic coast \u2013 from the vivid blue-green of the sea to the heady fragrance of herbs and pine that have been baked in the heat. Total bliss. Mary Novakovich Portugal The sweet life When democracy returned to Portugal in the spring of 1974, the Portuguese celebrated by throwing themselves into building a \u201cmodern\u201d nation state (with the aid, later, of EU funding). While I love the bright lights and cosmopolitan vibe of Lisbon and Porto, it is the vestiges of \u201cold\u201d Portugal that really enchant me. To find them, just step into any neighbourhood pastelaria (cafe-bakery). You\u2019ll find the day\u2019s newspaper on a table, the footie on the TV and friends shooting the breeze over average-tasting but cheap (less than \u20ac1) caf\u00e9 expressos. In Portugal, pastelarias double as repositories of local pride. Aside from the ubiquitous pastel de nata (the famous creamy custard tart, now available in M&amp;S), every self-respecting Portuguese town boasts its own speciality sweet. Cernache do Bonjardim has its almond cartuchos (shells); Castro Daire its bolo podre (literally, \u201crotten cake\u201d); Chaves its meat-filled pastel. My favourite is the sugary, eggy palha (straw) sweet from the historic city of Abrantes in the centre of the country. For the real deal, head to Confeitaria Palha de Abrantes on the main square: Portugal, in a single bite. Oliver Balch Finland Midsummer movies The Midnight Sun Film Festival, established in 1986, enjoys a stellar reputation among cinephiles and moviemakers. A true celebration of the craft, the five-day festival skips the red carpets and invites the audience and acclaimed international directors to the small village of Sodankyl\u00e4, in Finnish Lapland, to enjoy the round-the-clock feature film screenings each June, when the sun blazes above the horizon day and night. The programme ranges from premieres and rarities to classics and oddities, from silent films to karaoke singalong shows in a former circus tent. The morning discussion sessions with directors are a much-loved tradition, but not everybody makes it to those \u2013 the price of wrecking one\u2019s circadian rhythm with high doses of sunshine. The laid-back atmosphere and lack of hierarchy encapsulate something of the Finnish propensity for happiness (Finland has topped the world\u2019s \u201chappy league\u201d for the past two years). At an intimate festival whose whole ethos is to celebrate a love of cinema, one feels comfortable sharing a drink, a story or even a sauna with a random film buff or a world-famous film director \u2013 former guests include Francis Ford Coppola, Mike Leigh and Terry Gilliam.

It states that force majeure \u201cmeans any cause beyond AEG\u2019s or the organiser\u2019s reasonable control\u201d, which suggests venues/organisers could in theory use this clause to reject claims. Keep a close eye on venue and ticket agency websites, especially before you set off \u2013 many are providing regular updates. If you opt not to go, there are a number of fan-to-fan resale websites, including Twickets, where you can sell your tickets and hopefully recoup your outlay. RJ \u2018Our insurer refused to pay despite travel restrictions\u2019 A couple who were forced to abandon a rowing trip to American Samoa after the governor of the tiny Pacific island imposed a 14-day quarantine over coronavirus fears have been told by Barclays, their travel insurer, that they can\u2019t claim for their lost flights. John and Caroline Turnbull, from Woking, were due to take the trip of a lifetime in April to meet fellow rowing enthusiasts for a two-week tour of the little-known, remote American territory in the South Pacific Ocean. Having booked expensive flights from London to Hawaii, and pricey business class tickets for the five-and-a-half-hour flight to Pago Pago on American Samoa, the couple, both in their 70s, say they have been forced to abandon the Samoa part of the trip to the island, after the governor banned all foreign nationals from landing on the island unless they have spent 14 days in Hawaii. The island had already been battling a deadly measles outbreak that has killed more than 60 people. \u201cThe ban effectively rendered our flights unusable. Hawaiian Airways won\u2019t refund us, as it says that it is still operating the flight,\u201d says John. The couple had worldwide travel insurance provided by Barclays as an add-on to a bank account and duly claimed the \u00a32,500 they had spent on the Hawaii to Samoa flights they could not use. However, Barclays turned down the cancellation claim on the basis that the UK government has not advised against travel to the island. After the Guardian\u2019s intervention, Barclays took a second look at the case, and has now paid up. \u201cThe initial decline decision was the correct given there is no cover in our policy for \u2018closure of borders\u2019. We have, however, reviewed the specifics of this case and have decided that the claim will be paid as a gesture of goodwill,\u201d it said. MB",

At seven months, she started sounding out words like \u201ccat\u201d and \u201cgrandma\u201d; at 11 months, she finished bedtime stories, sometimes from memory, sometimes by recognising words; and by 15 months was reading independently. Now, with an IQ of 160+ (the same range as Einstein and Stephen Hawking), she devours books like the Isadora Moon series, aimed at five- to eight-year-olds, or Enid Blyton\u2019s The Magic Faraway Tree, reading in her head for up to an hour at a time, when most children her age are learning phonics.</p> <p>Her mother Malveen, is a dentist, and her father Hardeep, is an actuary. Both 32, they are high-achievers: Malveen has always been academic, gaining 10 A*s at GCSE and now studying for a postgraduate degree in orthodontics; Hardeep gained a postgraduate distinction in actuarial science and is now studying wealth management. Jeeva also has an older cousin in Mensa.</p> <p>\u201cMalveen has often called her a little Matilda,\u201d says Hardeep, of the book-loving bright spark imagined by Roald Dahl. Jeeva, who has the comprehension and mathematical ability of a child twice her age, says: \u201cI like reading and learning about things in the world and how they work.\u201d</p> <p>She is chatty and sociable despite the fact that, for most of her babyhood she was the only child in her year group who could talk. \u201cI wished they could, because then I could have lots more friends,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Teachers at her private preschool (including Mrs Smart and Mrs Brain, their real names; \u201cIt\u2019s like a Mr Men book,\u201d Jeeva is quick to point out) invite her to read to classmates. \u201cNo one else can read the words that I\u2019m saying,\u201d she says. She goes to gymnastics, and is learning chess and coding. She also has high emotional intelligence and describes feelings in depth. A simple question about her day can trigger lengthy conversations about outer space or how blood pumps around the body. Her parents limit screen time to once a week, during which she has watched the animated film Cars 2 and set her sights on becoming a racing driver, she tells me.</p> <p>Malveen remembers how she used to turn toys upside down to look at the workings: \u201cWe decided early on to ignore the age range on games \u2013 these immediately put limits on a child.\u201d But when we discuss her intelligence, her parents are quick to remind her that she is kind, too. \u201cWe don\u2019t want her to only be in one box: clever,\u201d Malveen says. \u201cMy main thing is that she feels happy and fulfilled, because that isn\u2019t always the case when chasing perfection. We model failure for her, making mistakes in front of her. We ask each day what her successes were, and what she failed at, and celebrate both.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost of all she loves to talk to us,\u201d Hardeep says. \u201cShe\u2019s always trying to crack a joke and is very playful. She\u2019s just a child who needs to enjoy being a child.\u201d</p> <h2><br>Nathan Kai, 10, Derby</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"928ab26d055a8da29bb4ae977cbddbb366873ba9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/928ab26d055a8da29bb4ae977cbddbb366873ba9/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Kai, 10, standing on a wide staircase, wearing a smart jacket and holding a briefcase and a book\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m full of confidence and gratitude for my opportunities,\u2019 says Nathan Kai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian. With thanks to the Multi-Faith Centre at the University of Derby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nathan\u2019s IQ puts him in the top 0.01% of the population. Aged three, he taught himself Debussy\u2019s Clair de Lune on a toy keyboard; by six, he was working at secondary school level; and, aged eight, he walked into the London Book Fair, shook a publisher\u2019s hand and secured an on-the-spot book deal for his motivational compendium, Be Your Best Self: Life Skills For Unstoppable Kids.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was six years old, my mum asked me what I wanted for Christmas,\u201d Nathan says. \u201cI asked for a book about how to be your best self. We searched online, and on bookshop and library shelves, but it didn\u2019t exist. So the opportunity to write it myself was born.\u201d He finished the book two days before his eighth birthday, recruiting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/27/paralympics-2012-danielle-brown\" title=\"\">Paralympic archer Danielle Brown</a> as co-author after hearing her speak at a Mensa event. \u201cWe went to the book fair together,\u201d Nathan says. \u201cI told publishers the backstory and they said yes right there and then. I was very proud.\u201d</p> <p>Nathan is plucky, eloquent \u2013 and more painstakingly polite than any adult I have met. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in self-development,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to spread that message to all children. Everyone I meet says this is rare for a child, but it comes naturally to me. I\u2019m full of confidence and gratitude for my opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>The book was published in the UK last year and launches in the US this month; Nathan hopes motivational speaking bookings will follow. \u201cI hope I get to fly all over the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my dream \u2013 to travel and learn about different cultures. I want to go to Disneyland, and I\u2019d like to stay with indigenous tribes to learn about plants and medicines.\u201d</p> <p>Nathan now plays the piano at grade five standard; his favourite composers are Bach and Beethoven. He is in a swimming team and a European title-holder in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/22/brazilian-jiu-jitsu-a-soul-destroying-ego-clipping-sport-thats-sunk-deep-into-my-veins\" title=\"\">Brazilian jiu-jitsu</a> (\u201cI love the discipline and ethos,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite tactical, like 3D chess\u201d). He also practises yoga and meditation: \u201cIt\u2019s all about harmony and balance, to ground yourself after a busy day.\u201d He watches TV only occasionally, usually David Attenborough documentaries, and is a \u201chuge bookworm\u201d, preferring books on geology, world history or motivational titles.</p> <p>Two years ago, Nathan\u2019s father moved out of the family home, leaving him, his mother and two younger siblings, Simeon, eight, who is also in Mensa, and Oriana, three. Nathan says: \u201cI think having a high IQ made it harder when my dad left,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt I should be able to understand, but I just can\u2019t. We all have a story.\u201d</p> <p>All three children are home-schooled. Their mother, Anna, 40, a lawyer and psychotherapist, says she was known as \u201cthe brains of the family\u201d as a child, but frequently felt misunderstood. She didn\u2019t start Nathan in mainstream education, but he attended for a year aged six, when she was unwell. His unhappiness led the family to visit an educational psychologist, who revealed the extent of Nathan\u2019s intellect. Soon after that, Anna took him out of school again.</p> <p>\u201cOne school teacher nicknamed him \u2018glum Nathan\u2019,\u201d Anna claims. \u201cHe hated every moment. The minute you mention intelligence, there\u2019s a stigma; a perception of silver-spoon upper-class kids on their way to Oxbridge, and a bragging, pushy parent. Gifted children can have barriers to break through and come from every background and life circumstance.\u201d</p> <p>Julie Taplin, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.potentialplusuk.org/\" title=\"\">Potential Plus UK</a>, a charity that supports 550 youngsters with \u201cexceptional intellectual and creative ability\u201d, says she sees this a lot with gifted children. \u201cThey have the potential to thrive in their areas of strength, but they need opportunities, confidence, nurturing and a sense of belonging,\u201d she says, adding that 10% of its members are home-schooled.</p> <p>Nathan says: \u201cI tried school, but no one understood my jokes or really got me. Everyone\u2019s different. I try not to sweat the small stuff. I\u2019ve got better friends now that I follow my passions instead of the crowd. I can discuss physics or marine biology with them, and they don\u2019t make me feel weird.\u201d He reels off a huge list of academic interests: Latin and classical studies; Mandarin and Chinese; Spanish, nutrition, debating, Stem subjects and psychology. He is working on his second book, too. \u201cBut I\u2019m keeping the details a bit hush-hush,\u201d he says. He thinks clever children are often misunderstood. \u201cWe\u2019re more than brains on legs. We have hearts and souls, dreams and feelings, too.\u201d</p> <h2>Abbey McArthur, 10, Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b7d045a3eeeebb56afc9be2db6a97fb89eb3e9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b7d045a3eeeebb56afc9be2db6a97fb89eb3e9a/0_667_4463_3193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abbey McArthur wearing a lab coat and sitting at a microscope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"715\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I see that I\u2019m a bit different, but in a good way,\u2019 says Abbey McArthur, who has an IQ of 144 and excels at art and science.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abbey lists her interests as architecture, space exploration, inventing and home science experiments, and is hoping for a place at grammar school next year. Her IQ of 144 was not tested until a year ago, when teachers called her parents into school, expressing concerns that she was depressed. Five minutes into an appointment with a private psychologist, her parents, account manager Belinda, 43, and Duncan, 45, a director of an IT company, were told: \u201cThis child is not depressed, she\u2019s a genius.\u201d</p> <p>Abbey is creative and methodical. At 18 months, she cut perfect circles with scissors; aged two, she described a seven-mile car journey to her parents using simple directions (\u201cgo there, turn here\u201d) because she wanted to visit a cafe, but didn\u2019t know its name. At six, she would craft intricate fishermen and animals from tinfoil.</p> <p>While Abbey enjoys playing with her younger sisters, Cameron and Erin, she has not celebrated a birthday with friends since she was six, and has already moved schools once since emigrating from South Africa to the UK last year. \u201cI see that I\u2019m a bit different, but in a good way,\u201d Abbey says. \u201cIf someone tells me I\u2019m really clever, it makes me happy and proud, but kids can be mean. At break time, I like to talk about science and things, but the others like to play. Once they agreed to talk about maths with me, then ran away. That made me feel really sad.\u201d</p> <p>Abbey is dyslexic and more comfortable in the company of adults, but has found like-minded friends through Mensa. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to be with clever kids, because you can talk about stuff you like doing,\u201d she says. \u201cI usually finish my schoolwork so quickly that I have to do extra worksheets, fetch stuff from the printer or help others with their work.</p> <p>\u201cIn year one, the maths was really easy. I told my mum and she spoke to the teachers to ask for something harder, which she still does,\u201d Abbey says. \u201cI\u2019m in a higher maths class than my friends. They finish their work as quickly as they can, but I want to stay in class longer. It\u2019s fun and challenging when you\u2019ve not seen something before and you get it for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cAt home, I love baking and cooking. My dad lets me cook dinner with him. I like reading animal encyclopaedias and trying experiments. I know, for example, that octopuses have three hearts \u2013 but what do they do with them? I watch TV, but mostly enjoy art and teaching my puppy, Simba, tricks.\u201d</p> <p>Abbey shows me her sketch book, containing silhouettes of a boat and a page of perfectly spherical doughnuts, shaded with coloured pencil. In South Africa, she was spotted as a \u201cfuture talent\u201d by a Johannesburg art dealer, and has won competitions here, too. \u201cI sold some of my art to the psychologist who did my assessment and asked for a microscope instead of payment,\u201d Abbey says. \u201cI won a hotel talent competition when I was little with a one-minute drawing of a unicorn.\u201d </p> <p>This facility with art and science is not unusual among children with high IQs. Educator and psychologist Lyn Kendall, Mensa\u2019s gifted-child consultant, explains: \u201cResearch shows that the majority of exceptionally able children are good all-rounders due to their highly competitive and driven natures. When they are younger, art may not be a strong point for them, but once their coordination develops, it becomes something else to excel at.\u201d</p> <p>Abbey hopes to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, but her ambitions do not end there. \u201cI\u2019d like to go into space or build a hover car that flies over water and mountains,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>Zayan Rumi Arshad, six, Solihull</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34554291f720f0ac8175455e95ce78a45a354c07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34554291f720f0ac8175455e95ce78a45a354c07/0_2041_4480_4157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zayan Rumi Arshad sitting on the floor with some books and a toy car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"928\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zayan Rumi Arshad could count to 100 by two, and knew the English and Arabic alphabets by three.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time Zayan was two, he could count to 100. Today he is in year two, but is given year five work. \u201cMaths is my best lesson because it\u2019s really easy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy favourite part is doing divides in my head. In maths, my best friend does easy sheets. I do fractions and multiplications.\u201d He enjoys other lessons, too. Excitedly, he says: \u201cWe\u2019re learning about dreams and goals right now. Mine is to become an engineer. I would make stuff, like a Lego drill that can drill for metal.\u201d He runs to get his favourite Lego creation: a 1,167-piece, VW Beetle for ages 16+. He is learning the ukulele and recorder, and enjoys using music apps. \u201cI\u2019ve got something where I can make any beats I want.\u201d </p> <p>His mother and father, Sameela and Adeel, both 29, run a footwear business and were young parents. They are graduates, but wouldn\u2019t describe themselves as being above average intelligence, and have found Zayan\u2019s ability overwhelming. By three, he could count in four languages \u2013 Arabic, Urdu, English and Spanish \u2013 and knew the English and Arabic alphabets. \u201cHe\u2019d hear something in Arabic once or twice at his grandparents\u2019 and pick it up,\u201d Sameela says. \u201cHe brought home a picture book from kindergarten and asked, \u2018What kind of book is this, there are no words?\u2019 He had a huge interest in numbers, and little quirks, too. He didn\u2019t like foods touching on his plate, and would never get muddy.\u201d</p> <p>It was only when his brother Raafi, four, arrived that his parents realised Zayan was different. Raafi hit milestones in line with most children and long after his brother had; they were able to compare the boys\u2019 behaviour, too. As well as an inquisitive mind, Zayan had the heightened emotions common in gifted children. At nursery, he experienced separation anxiety and would cry until he was sick. When Zayan was five, a psychologist confirmed an IQ of 150, the mathematical comprehension of a nine-year-old and the reading age of a 10-year-old.</p> <p>\u201cAt first I didn\u2019t think he was gifted,\u201d Sameela says. \u201cI just needed help. I struggled with how to occupy him or answer his questions.\u201d She sometimes feels obliged to play down his intelligence: \u201cPeople stare or listen once they hear him speak. They ask what I do to make him so smart. When I say I don\u2019t do anything, I often get a shocked face, as though I\u2019m lying. The only thing we push him to do is to work on his confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Now Zayan attends private school \u2013 a choice the family might not have made if he wasn\u2019t so bright \u2013 but still struggles emotionally. \u201cHe\u2019s never just gone somewhere and started playing,\u201d Sameela says. \u201cHe stands back and analyses. His best friends are girls because they\u2019re less boisterous. He feels safe with them, but has huge meltdowns. If they don\u2019t need a boy for their princess game, he gets really upset, really quickly. Emotions are extreme. I book lots of clubs for him at lunchtime so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with playtime.\u201d</p> <p>In Zayan\u2019s bedroom, his shelf is stacked with Roald Dahl and Horrid Henry collections; he\u2019s read them all. He shows me his newest invention \u2013 a \u201crocking rover\u201d vehicle \u2013 and his toy drone. \u201cI love flying my drone or paper planes,\u201d he says. Today is Tuesday, which is homework day. \u201cI\u2019m glad when that\u2019s out of the way. The worst thing about school is comprehension, and going up the tiring stairs. But the best thing is having a long lunchtime. And maths.\u201d</p> <h2>Luca Manfredi, 12, Pontefract</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7c019e9c68e5db4ec37d335a144fca53d2405e9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c019e9c68e5db4ec37d335a144fca53d2405e9a/0_1665_4480_3663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luca Manfredi photographed through glass with complex calculations written on it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"818\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Other kids make fun of me. They love to see you fail,\u2019 says Luca Manfredi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Luca was found to have an IQ of 158 when his academy tested its brightest year eight pupils \u2013 a recent offer to schools that Mensa credits with bringing in more young members. \u201cThey\u2019d give a complicated word and ask for a synonym,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it was easy, but I just worked through.\u201d He describes himself as a \u201chuman calculator\u201d, and is now doing GCSE-level maths.</p> <p>\u201cI like studying variables and I\u2019d love to use my maths inside Nasa,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople think of astronauts, but I want to understand how rockets are programmed and engineered.\u201d Chatting at home after school, Luca is initially reserved, but talks with enthusiasm about studying. \u201cI love having my mind challenged,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew my times tables in reception. By year two, I was doing year six multiplication and long division. I was years ahead, so they would give me algebra. I knew I was bright. We had maths puzzles at home and mum would turn everything into a game. She filled our house with books.\u201d</p> <p>Luca lives with his mother Patrizia, 42, an immigration officer, father Mark, 45, a transport worker, and younger brother Simone, seven. Patrizia was also a bright child, but did not have the opportunities or encouragement to pursue her love of learning. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise the importance of it,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a mum, I try to support him practically and emotionally. I make sure there are books to feed his appetite for knowledge, and explain why children can be cruel, because they don\u2019t understand the importance of certain things or have the right values. Our greatest wish is that our child fulfils his dreams. Being in Mensa is opening a lot of doors.\u201d</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean job opportunities \u2013 Mensa\u2019s consultant Lyn Kendall says that some members don\u2019t put Mensa on their CVs as it can make employers wary. But it is a place to network: the organisation hosts social events for youngsters, has junior newsletters and web forums. Kendall also runs a Facebook group for parents. She says many don\u2019t realise how gifted their children are until they begin education and socialising; while they fit in in their own, often intelligent, households, others notice their precociousness and impose identities on them. \u201cThe minute they go out into the world, they get people saying, \u2018Aren\u2019t you clever?\u2019 at the time when they\u2019re building an identity. They often don\u2019t know how to fail or how to study. A lot of them refuse school or drop out of university because of their fear of failure. Unless you\u2019re very careful, they can grow up to be very fragile people.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Luca says his maturity has left him feeling lonely. \u201cNo one likes a know-it-all,\u201d he says. \u201cMum and dad have told me that being intelligent has negatives now, but will have positives when I do jobs that bring me happiness.\u201d</p> <p>Luca enjoys computer games and watching fantasy and action films, like Men In Black. \u201cI\u2019m always looking below the surface, wondering how creators came up with those characters.\u201d At weekends, he hangs out with his younger brother and parents, or does extra maths papers. He has \u201ca couple of friends\u201d, but rarely goes on playdates and is happiest taking tests. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve done well, I\u2019ve made myself and my family proud,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>British child geniuses in numbers</h2> <p><strong>1,991</strong><strong> </strong>Members of Mensa, the high IQ society, who are under 17</p> <p><strong>600 </strong>Mensa members under 13</p> <p><strong>50% </strong>Increase in child members over the last five years</p> <p><strong>10\u00bd</strong><strong> </strong>Age at which children can sit the adult intelligence test, comprising verbal and non-verbal reasoning papers</p> <p><strong>\u00a3250+ </strong>Cost of Mensa assessment with a private psychologist for younger children, using puzzles and games</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s it like to be a child genius? In the past five years, under-17 membership of Mensa \u2013 the high-IQ society open to those with intelligence scores in the top 2% of the population \u2013 has risen by half, from 1,334 to 1,991, partly as a result of the organisation reaching out to schools and colleges across the country. But children of exceptional ability haven\u2019t always been well served by mainstream education. For many, being gifted is laden with social, emotional and academic challenges. Here, five young people \u2013 from an 11-year-old with his own book deal to a self-proclaimed \u201chuman calculator\u201d \u2013 explain the ups and downs of being a tiny prodigy. Jeeva Jandu, four, Coventry Jeeva was British Mensa\u2019s youngest member when she joined just after her third birthday. (Muhammad Haryz Nadzim, three, from Durham, beat her record earlier this year.) But Jeeva began impressing her parents when she was still a baby. At seven months, she started sounding out words like \u201ccat\u201d and \u201cgrandma\u201d; at 11 months, she finished bedtime stories, sometimes from memory, sometimes by recognising words; and by 15 months was reading independently. Now, with an IQ of 160+ (the same range as Einstein and Stephen Hawking), she devours books like the Isadora Moon series, aimed at five- to eight-year-olds, or Enid Blyton\u2019s The Magic Faraway Tree, reading in her head for up to an hour at a time, when most children her age are learning phonics. Her mother Malveen, is a dentist, and her father Hardeep, is an actuary. Both 32, they are high-achievers: Malveen has always been academic, gaining 10 A*s at GCSE and now studying for a postgraduate degree in orthodontics; Hardeep gained a postgraduate distinction in actuarial science and is now studying wealth management. Jeeva also has an older cousin in Mensa. \u201cMalveen has often called her a little Matilda,\u201d says Hardeep, of the book-loving bright spark imagined by Roald Dahl. Jeeva, who has the comprehension and mathematical ability of a child twice her age, says: \u201cI like reading and learning about things in the world and how they work.\u201d She is chatty and sociable despite the fact that, for most of her babyhood she was the only child in her year group who could talk. \u201cI wished they could, because then I could have lots more friends,\u201d she says. Teachers at her private preschool (including Mrs Smart and Mrs Brain, their real names; \u201cIt\u2019s like a Mr Men book,\u201d Jeeva is quick to point out) invite her to read to classmates. \u201cNo one else can read the words that I\u2019m saying,\u201d she says. She goes to gymnastics, and is learning chess and coding. She also has high emotional intelligence and describes feelings in depth. A simple question about her day can trigger lengthy conversations about outer space or how blood pumps around the body. Her parents limit screen time to once a week, during which she has watched the animated film Cars 2 and set her sights on becoming a racing driver, she tells me. Malveen remembers how she used to turn toys upside down to look at the workings: \u201cWe decided early on to ignore the age range on games \u2013 these immediately put limits on a child.\u201d But when we discuss her intelligence, her parents are quick to remind her that she is kind, too. \u201cWe don\u2019t want her to only be in one box: clever,\u201d Malveen says. \u201cMy main thing is that she feels happy and fulfilled, because that isn\u2019t always the case when chasing perfection. We model failure for her, making mistakes in front of her. We ask each day what her successes were, and what she failed at, and celebrate both.\u201d \u201cMost of all she loves to talk to us,\u201d Hardeep says. \u201cShe\u2019s always trying to crack a joke and is very playful. She\u2019s just a child who needs to enjoy being a child.\u201d Nathan Kai, 10, Derby Nathan\u2019s IQ puts him in the top 0.01% of the population. Aged three, he taught himself Debussy\u2019s Clair de Lune on a toy keyboard; by six, he was working at secondary school level; and, aged eight, he walked into the London Book Fair, shook a publisher\u2019s hand and secured an on-the-spot book deal for his motivational compendium, Be Your Best Self: Life Skills For Unstoppable Kids. \u201cWhen I was six years old, my mum asked me what I wanted for Christmas,\u201d Nathan says. \u201cI asked for a book about how to be your best self. We searched online, and on bookshop and library shelves, but it didn\u2019t exist. So the opportunity to write it myself was born.\u201d He finished the book two days before his eighth birthday, recruiting Paralympic archer Danielle Brown as co-author after hearing her speak at a Mensa event. \u201cWe went to the book fair together,\u201d Nathan says. \u201cI told publishers the backstory and they said yes right there and then. I was very proud.\u201d Nathan is plucky, eloquent \u2013 and more painstakingly polite than any adult I have met. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in self-development,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to spread that message to all children. Everyone I meet says this is rare for a child, but it comes naturally to me. I\u2019m full of confidence and gratitude for my opportunities.\u201d The book was published in the UK last year and launches in the US this month; Nathan hopes motivational speaking bookings will follow. \u201cI hope I get to fly all over the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my dream \u2013 to travel and learn about different cultures. I want to go to Disneyland, and I\u2019d like to stay with indigenous tribes to learn about plants and medicines.\u201d Nathan now plays the piano at grade five standard; his favourite composers are Bach and Beethoven. He is in a swimming team and a European title-holder in Brazilian jiu-jitsu (\u201cI love the discipline and ethos,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite tactical, like 3D chess\u201d). He also practises yoga and meditation: \u201cIt\u2019s all about harmony and balance, to ground yourself after a busy day.\u201d He watches TV only occasionally, usually David Attenborough documentaries, and is a \u201chuge bookworm\u201d, preferring books on geology, world history or motivational titles. Two years ago, Nathan\u2019s father moved out of the family home, leaving him, his mother and two younger siblings, Simeon, eight, who is also in Mensa, and Oriana, three. Nathan says: \u201cI think having a high IQ made it harder when my dad left,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt I should be able to understand, but I just can\u2019t. We all have a story.\u201d All three children are home-schooled. Their mother, Anna, 40, a lawyer and psychotherapist, says she was known as \u201cthe brains of the family\u201d as a child, but frequently felt misunderstood. She didn\u2019t start Nathan in mainstream education, but he attended for a year aged six, when she was unwell. His unhappiness led the family to visit an educational psychologist, who revealed the extent of Nathan\u2019s intellect. Soon after that, Anna took him out of school again. \u201cOne school teacher nicknamed him \u2018glum Nathan\u2019,\u201d Anna claims. \u201cHe hated every moment. The minute you mention intelligence, there\u2019s a stigma; a perception of silver-spoon upper-class kids on their way to Oxbridge, and a bragging, pushy parent. Gifted children can have barriers to break through and come from every background and life circumstance.\u201d Julie Taplin, chief executive of Potential Plus UK, a charity that supports 550 youngsters with \u201cexceptional intellectual and creative ability\u201d, says she sees this a lot with gifted children. \u201cThey have the potential to thrive in their areas of strength, but they need opportunities, confidence, nurturing and a sense of belonging,\u201d she says, adding that 10% of its members are home-schooled. Nathan says: \u201cI tried school, but no one understood my jokes or really got me. Everyone\u2019s different. I try not to sweat the small stuff. I\u2019ve got better friends now that I follow my passions instead of the crowd. I can discuss physics or marine biology with them, and they don\u2019t make me feel weird.\u201d He reels off a huge list of academic interests: Latin and classical studies; Mandarin and Chinese; Spanish, nutrition, debating, Stem subjects and psychology. He is working on his second book, too. \u201cBut I\u2019m keeping the details a bit hush-hush,\u201d he says. He thinks clever children are often misunderstood. \u201cWe\u2019re more than brains on legs. We have hearts and souls, dreams and feelings, too.\u201d Abbey McArthur, 10, Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire Abbey lists her interests as architecture, space exploration, inventing and home science experiments, and is hoping for a place at grammar school next year. Her IQ of 144 was not tested until a year ago, when teachers called her parents into school, expressing concerns that she was depressed. Five minutes into an appointment with a private psychologist, her parents, account manager Belinda, 43, and Duncan, 45, a director of an IT company, were told: \u201cThis child is not depressed, she\u2019s a genius.\u201d Abbey is creative and methodical. At 18 months, she cut perfect circles with scissors; aged two, she described a seven-mile car journey to her parents using simple directions (\u201cgo there, turn here\u201d) because she wanted to visit a cafe, but didn\u2019t know its name. At six, she would craft intricate fishermen and animals from tinfoil. While Abbey enjoys playing with her younger sisters, Cameron and Erin, she has not celebrated a birthday with friends since she was six, and has already moved schools once since emigrating from South Africa to the UK last year. \u201cI see that I\u2019m a bit different, but in a good way,\u201d Abbey says. \u201cIf someone tells me I\u2019m really clever, it makes me happy and proud, but kids can be mean. At break time, I like to talk about science and things, but the others like to play. Once they agreed to talk about maths with me, then ran away. That made me feel really sad.\u201d Abbey is dyslexic and more comfortable in the company of adults, but has found like-minded friends through Mensa. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to be with clever kids, because you can talk about stuff you like doing,\u201d she says. \u201cI usually finish my schoolwork so quickly that I have to do extra worksheets, fetch stuff from the printer or help others with their work. \u201cIn year one, the maths was really easy. I told my mum and she spoke to the teachers to ask for something harder, which she still does,\u201d Abbey says. \u201cI\u2019m in a higher maths class than my friends. They finish their work as quickly as they can, but I want to stay in class longer. It\u2019s fun and challenging when you\u2019ve not seen something before and you get it for the first time. \u201cAt home, I love baking and cooking. My dad lets me cook dinner with him. I like reading animal encyclopaedias and trying experiments. I know, for example, that octopuses have three hearts \u2013 but what do they do with them? I watch TV, but mostly enjoy art and teaching my puppy, Simba, tricks.\u201d Abbey shows me her sketch book, containing silhouettes of a boat and a page of perfectly spherical doughnuts, shaded with coloured pencil. In South Africa, she was spotted as a \u201cfuture talent\u201d by a Johannesburg art dealer, and has won competitions here, too. \u201cI sold some of my art to the psychologist who did my assessment and asked for a microscope instead of payment,\u201d Abbey says. \u201cI won a hotel talent competition when I was little with a one-minute drawing of a unicorn.\u201d This facility with art and science is not unusual among children with high IQs. Educator and psychologist Lyn Kendall, Mensa\u2019s gifted-child consultant, explains: \u201cResearch shows that the majority of exceptionally able children are good all-rounders due to their highly competitive and driven natures. When they are younger, art may not be a strong point for them, but once their coordination develops, it becomes something else to excel at.\u201d Abbey hopes to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, but her ambitions do not end there. \u201cI\u2019d like to go into space or build a hover car that flies over water and mountains,\u201d she says. Zayan Rumi Arshad, six, Solihull By the time Zayan was two, he could count to 100. Today he is in year two, but is given year five work. \u201cMaths is my best lesson because it\u2019s really easy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy favourite part is doing divides in my head. In maths, my best friend does easy sheets. I do fractions and multiplications.\u201d He enjoys other lessons, too. Excitedly, he says: \u201cWe\u2019re learning about dreams and goals right now. Mine is to become an engineer. I would make stuff, like a Lego drill that can drill for metal.\u201d He runs to get his favourite Lego creation: a 1,167-piece, VW Beetle for ages 16+. He is learning the ukulele and recorder, and enjoys using music apps. \u201cI\u2019ve got something where I can make any beats I want.\u201d His mother and father, Sameela and Adeel, both 29, run a footwear business and were young parents. They are graduates, but wouldn\u2019t describe themselves as being above average intelligence, and have found Zayan\u2019s ability overwhelming. By three, he could count in four languages \u2013 Arabic, Urdu, English and Spanish \u2013 and knew the English and Arabic alphabets. \u201cHe\u2019d hear something in Arabic once or twice at his grandparents\u2019 and pick it up,\u201d Sameela says. \u201cHe brought home a picture book from kindergarten and asked, \u2018What kind of book is this, there are no words?\u2019 He had a huge interest in numbers, and little quirks, too. He didn\u2019t like foods touching on his plate, and would never get muddy.\u201d It was only when his brother Raafi, four, arrived that his parents realised Zayan was different. Raafi hit milestones in line with most children and long after his brother had; they were able to compare the boys\u2019 behaviour, too. As well as an inquisitive mind, Zayan had the heightened emotions common in gifted children. At nursery, he experienced separation anxiety and would cry until he was sick. When Zayan was five, a psychologist confirmed an IQ of 150, the mathematical comprehension of a nine-year-old and the reading age of a 10-year-old. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t think he was gifted,\u201d Sameela says. \u201cI just needed help. I struggled with how to occupy him or answer his questions.\u201d She sometimes feels obliged to play down his intelligence: \u201cPeople stare or listen once they hear him speak. They ask what I do to make him so smart. When I say I don\u2019t do anything, I often get a shocked face, as though I\u2019m lying. The only thing we push him to do is to work on his confidence.\u201d Now Zayan attends private school \u2013 a choice the family might not have made if he wasn\u2019t so bright \u2013 but still struggles emotionally. \u201cHe\u2019s never just gone somewhere and started playing,\u201d Sameela says. \u201cHe stands back and analyses. His best friends are girls because they\u2019re less boisterous. He feels safe with them, but has huge meltdowns. If they don\u2019t need a boy for their princess game, he gets really upset, really quickly. Emotions are extreme. I book lots of clubs for him at lunchtime so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with playtime.\u201d In Zayan\u2019s bedroom, his shelf is stacked with Roald Dahl and Horrid Henry collections; he\u2019s read them all. He shows me his newest invention \u2013 a \u201crocking rover\u201d vehicle \u2013 and his toy drone. \u201cI love flying my drone or paper planes,\u201d he says. Today is Tuesday, which is homework day. \u201cI\u2019m glad when that\u2019s out of the way. The worst thing about school is comprehension, and going up the tiring stairs. But the best thing is having a long lunchtime. And maths.\u201d Luca Manfredi, 12, Pontefract Luca was found to have an IQ of 158 when his academy tested its brightest year eight pupils \u2013 a recent offer to schools that Mensa credits with bringing in more young members. \u201cThey\u2019d give a complicated word and ask for a synonym,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it was easy, but I just worked through.\u201d He describes himself as a \u201chuman calculator\u201d, and is now doing GCSE-level maths. \u201cI like studying variables and I\u2019d love to use my maths inside Nasa,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople think of astronauts, but I want to understand how rockets are programmed and engineered.\u201d Chatting at home after school, Luca is initially reserved, but talks with enthusiasm about studying. \u201cI love having my mind challenged,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew my times tables in reception. By year two, I was doing year six multiplication and long division. I was years ahead, so they would give me algebra. I knew I was bright. We had maths puzzles at home and mum would turn everything into a game. She filled our house with books.\u201d Luca lives with his mother Patrizia, 42, an immigration officer, father Mark, 45, a transport worker, and younger brother Simone, seven. Patrizia was also a bright child, but did not have the opportunities or encouragement to pursue her love of learning. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise the importance of it,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a mum, I try to support him practically and emotionally. I make sure there are books to feed his appetite for knowledge, and explain why children can be cruel, because they don\u2019t understand the importance of certain things or have the right values. Our greatest wish is that our child fulfils his dreams. Being in Mensa is opening a lot of doors.\u201d That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean job opportunities \u2013 Mensa\u2019s consultant Lyn Kendall says that some members don\u2019t put Mensa on their CVs as it can make employers wary. But it is a place to network: the organisation hosts social events for youngsters, has junior newsletters and web forums. Kendall also runs a Facebook group for parents. She says many don\u2019t realise how gifted their children are until they begin education and socialising; while they fit in in their own, often intelligent, households, others notice their precociousness and impose identities on them. \u201cThe minute they go out into the world, they get people saying, \u2018Aren\u2019t you clever?\u2019 at the time when they\u2019re building an identity. They often don\u2019t know how to fail or how to study. A lot of them refuse school or drop out of university because of their fear of failure. Unless you\u2019re very careful, they can grow up to be very fragile people.\u201d Still, Luca says his maturity has left him feeling lonely. \u201cNo one likes a know-it-all,\u201d he says. \u201cMum and dad have told me that being intelligent has negatives now, but will have positives when I do jobs that bring me happiness.\u201d Luca enjoys computer games and watching fantasy and action films, like Men In Black. \u201cI\u2019m always looking below the surface, wondering how creators came up with those characters.\u201d At weekends, he hangs out with his younger brother and parents, or does extra maths papers. He has \u201ca couple of friends\u201d, but rarely goes on playdates and is happiest taking tests. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve done well, I\u2019ve made myself and my family proud,\u201d he says.

      "body": "<p>Ever since Margaret Thatcher seized the Tory leadership 45 years ago, one of the few seemingly reliable facts in British politics has been that the Conservatives are aggressively rightwing on the economy. Sanctifying the free market, prioritising the wealthy, promoting competition throughout society, justifying inequality: in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, the Tories have pursued a particular, hard-nosed vision of economic life, even as they\u2019ve softened periodically on social issues.</p> <p>Yet since Boris Johnson eased into the leadership last summer, there have been louder and louder hints that a Tory economic rethink is belatedly under way \u2013 more than a decade after the financial crisis that undermined so much of their economic philosophy. There has been less talk of tax cuts and more of tax increases; an election manifesto that promised \u201copportunity for all\u201d and \u201csocial justice\u201d; an increase in the minimum wage well above the rate of inflation; the nationalisation of Northern Rail; and the possibility of state aid for other troubled but strategically important businesses.</p> <p>This change of tone and, sometimes, substance has been widely seen as a shift to the left \u2013 a shift expected to be confirmed in next week\u2019s budget. Some rightwing observers have been disconcerted. The Institute of Economic Affairs, which provided much of the intellectual basis for Thatcherism, complained that December\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech \u201cfocused on state intervention rather than setting out plans to make people freer\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/06/boris-johnson-voters-wednesday-budget-prime-minister\">For Johnson\u2019s new voters, the betrayal starts now | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But to many commentators, on the left as well as the right, the Conservatives are following a clever new path, which their recent capture of so many Labour seats has both validated and made unavoidable. As the political scientist Matthew Goodwin put it, in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goodwinmj/status/1203023365109374976\" title=\"\">much-cited tweet</a> on election night: \u201cIt is easier for the right to move left on economics.\u201d The Tories\u2019 reputation for ruthlessness and reinvention means they can deploy economic tools \u2013 such as nationalisation \u2013 that are much more controversial when used by Labour.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure the Conservatives\u2019 economic prospects are quite so rosy. As previous governments have found, changing your economic thinking is one thing; changing the British economy, unbalanced and sluggish but set in its ways, is often another. And this task will be harder still during and after the biggest, most economically disruptive public health emergency for decades. The Tories won\u2019t be able to provide economic \u201copportunity for all\u201d if millions of workers are unwilling or unable to leave the house.</p> <p>But even if the party\u2019s economic rethink ultimately disappoints, as Johnson\u2019s big ideas usually did when he was mayor of London, the fact that so many people have taken it seriously, and seen it as a move to the left, is significant. Because in many ways it isn\u2019t a move to the left at all.</p> <p>The Conservatives have little to say about the stark and widening imbalances of power in the modern economy: between employers and employees, digital giants such as Uber and gig workers, company bosses and trade unions, the City of London and everywhere else. Reducing such imbalances would be the aim of any meaningfully left-of-centre economic policy.</p> <p>Instead the idea for transforming the economy that has had the most enthusiastic support from Johnson is the establishment of minimally regulated free ports. Rather than \u201clevelling up\u201d Britain, as the Tories promise, such enclaves would probably make the economy still more uneven, drawing away businesses from elsewhere. And even levelling up isn\u2019t necessarily a left-of-centre policy if it means taking resources away from, say, the large parts of London crammed with renters and the working poor and giving them to towns full of property-owning pensioners in the north.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In last year\u2019s Tory manifesto, the vaguely egalitarian economic passages don\u2019t last long</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The credulity with which the Tory move \u201cleft\u201d has been greeted is revealing. It points to a final, little-noticed victory for Thatcherism. She shifted how Britain thinks about the economy so far and so lastingly to the right that any milder Tory economic policies are mistaken for a dramatic change of heart. In fact they\u2019re compromises between disruptive capitalism and social stability of the sort pre-Thatcher Conservative governments frequently made when circumstances required.</p> <p>From the early 1950s to the early 1970s, Tory chancellors supported full employment and income tax rates of 60% or higher for the rich. But few mistook them for leftists. They were just astute rightwing politicians responding to the fact that many voters bitterly remembered the unemployment and inequality of the interwar years \u2013 and also responding to a Labour party that, even when out of power, had lots of egalitarian economic ideas that were potentially alluring in an anti-elitist age.</p> <p>Something similar may be happening now. The Labour left has been thinking hard about modern capitalism\u2019s problems for much longer than the Tories. Many voters, including Tories, are much less sure than they used to be that the free-market country Thatcher and her party largely created will provide them with a good life. The Johnson government is reacting to these political dangers. But like all Tory governments, it will do no more to curb capitalism than it has to. If the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak</a>, wanted to go further, he would be in a different party.</p> <p>In last year\u2019s Tory manifesto, the vaguely egalitarian economic passages didn\u2019t last long. Like one of Johnson\u2019s apparently meandering, but actually sly, multipurpose speeches, the text quickly moves on to other political messages. \u201cWe as Conservatives want to give you freedom \u2013 low taxes, opportunity,\u201d the manifesto declares, like a Thatcher speech from the 1980s. \u201cWe believe that free markets \u2026 can protect the planet.\u201d Conservatives want to be seen as no longer putting economic growth before social harmony. But in most Tory hearts, the economic infatuation lives on.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ever since Margaret Thatcher seized the Tory leadership 45 years ago, one of the few seemingly reliable facts in British politics has been that the Conservatives are aggressively rightwing on the economy. Sanctifying the free market, prioritising the wealthy, promoting competition throughout society, justifying inequality: in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, the Tories have pursued a particular, hard-nosed vision of economic life, even as they\u2019ve softened periodically on social issues. Yet since Boris Johnson eased into the leadership last summer, there have been louder and louder hints that a Tory economic rethink is belatedly under way \u2013 more than a decade after the financial crisis that undermined so much of their economic philosophy. There has been less talk of tax cuts and more of tax increases; an election manifesto that promised \u201copportunity for all\u201d and \u201csocial justice\u201d; an increase in the minimum wage well above the rate of inflation; the nationalisation of Northern Rail; and the possibility of state aid for other troubled but strategically important businesses. This change of tone and, sometimes, substance has been widely seen as a shift to the left \u2013 a shift expected to be confirmed in next week\u2019s budget. Some rightwing observers have been disconcerted. The Institute of Economic Affairs, which provided much of the intellectual basis for Thatcherism, complained that December\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech \u201cfocused on state intervention rather than setting out plans to make people freer\u201d. But to many commentators, on the left as well as the right, the Conservatives are following a clever new path, which their recent capture of so many Labour seats has both validated and made unavoidable. As the political scientist Matthew Goodwin put it, in a much-cited tweet on election night: \u201cIt is easier for the right to move left on economics.\u201d The Tories\u2019 reputation for ruthlessness and reinvention means they can deploy economic tools \u2013 such as nationalisation \u2013 that are much more controversial when used by Labour. I\u2019m not sure the Conservatives\u2019 economic prospects are quite so rosy. As previous governments have found, changing your economic thinking is one thing; changing the British economy, unbalanced and sluggish but set in its ways, is often another. And this task will be harder still during and after the biggest, most economically disruptive public health emergency for decades. The Tories won\u2019t be able to provide economic \u201copportunity for all\u201d if millions of workers are unwilling or unable to leave the house. But even if the party\u2019s economic rethink ultimately disappoints, as Johnson\u2019s big ideas usually did when he was mayor of London, the fact that so many people have taken it seriously, and seen it as a move to the left, is significant. Because in many ways it isn\u2019t a move to the left at all. The Conservatives have little to say about the stark and widening imbalances of power in the modern economy: between employers and employees, digital giants such as Uber and gig workers, company bosses and trade unions, the City of London and everywhere else. Reducing such imbalances would be the aim of any meaningfully left-of-centre economic policy. Instead the idea for transforming the economy that has had the most enthusiastic support from Johnson is the establishment of minimally regulated free ports. Rather than \u201clevelling up\u201d Britain, as the Tories promise, such enclaves would probably make the economy still more uneven, drawing away businesses from elsewhere. And even levelling up isn\u2019t necessarily a left-of-centre policy if it means taking resources away from, say, the large parts of London crammed with renters and the working poor and giving them to towns full of property-owning pensioners in the north. The credulity with which the Tory move \u201cleft\u201d has been greeted is revealing. It points to a final, little-noticed victory for Thatcherism. She shifted how Britain thinks about the economy so far and so lastingly to the right that any milder Tory economic policies are mistaken for a dramatic change of heart. In fact they\u2019re compromises between disruptive capitalism and social stability of the sort pre-Thatcher Conservative governments frequently made when circumstances required. From the early 1950s to the early 1970s, Tory chancellors supported full employment and income tax rates of 60% or higher for the rich. But few mistook them for leftists. They were just astute rightwing politicians responding to the fact that many voters bitterly remembered the unemployment and inequality of the interwar years \u2013 and also responding to a Labour party that, even when out of power, had lots of egalitarian economic ideas that were potentially alluring in an anti-elitist age. Something similar may be happening now. The Labour left has been thinking hard about modern capitalism\u2019s problems for much longer than the Tories. Many voters, including Tories, are much less sure than they used to be that the free-market country Thatcher and her party largely created will provide them with a good life. The Johnson government is reacting to these political dangers. But like all Tory governments, it will do no more to curb capitalism than it has to. If the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, wanted to go further, he would be in a different party. In last year\u2019s Tory manifesto, the vaguely egalitarian economic passages didn\u2019t last long. Like one of Johnson\u2019s apparently meandering, but actually sly, multipurpose speeches, the text quickly moves on to other political messages. \u201cWe as Conservatives want to give you freedom \u2013 low taxes, opportunity,\u201d the manifesto declares, like a Thatcher speech from the 1980s. \u201cWe believe that free markets \u2026 can protect the planet.\u201d Conservatives want to be seen as no longer putting economic growth before social harmony. But in most Tory hearts, the economic infatuation lives on. \u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist",

HIV, by contrast, took two years to identify after it first appeared in mid-1981, L\u00f3pez-Goni noted.

On Thursday 120 new cases were reported in Wuhan, the lowest figure for six weeks, and, for the first time since the start of the outbreak, none at all in the rest of Hubei province.

By 13 January \u2013 three days after the gene sequence was published \u2013 a reliable test was available, developed by scientists at the department of virology at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 university hospital with help from experts in Rotterdam, London and Hong Kong. We know it can be contained (albeit at considerable cost). China\u2019s draconian quarantine and containment measures appear to be working. On Thursday 120 new cases were reported in Wuhan, the lowest figure for six weeks, and, for the first time since the start of the outbreak, none at all in the rest of Hubei province. Several Chinese provinces have had no new cases for a fortnight and more are reopening their schools. In many countries, infections are in defined clusters, which should allow them to be more readily contained. Catching it is not that easy (if we are careful) and we can kill it quite easily (provided we try). Frequent, careful hand washing, as we now all know, is the most effective way to stop the virus being transmitted, while a solution of ethanol, a solution of hydrogen peroxide or a solution of bleach will disinfect surfaces. To be considered at high risk of catching the coronavirus you need to live with, or have direct physical contact with, someone infected, be coughed or sneezed on by them (or pick up a used tissue), or be in face-to-face contact, within two metres, for more than 15 minutes. We\u2019re not talking about passing someone in the street. In most cases, symptoms are mild, and young people are at very low risk. According to a study of 45,000 confirmed infections in China, 81% of cases caused only minor illness, 14% of patients had symptoms described as \u201csevere\u201d, and just 5% were considered \u201ccritical\u201d, with about half of those resulting in death. Only 3% of cases concern people under 20, children seem barely affected by the virus at all, and the mortality rate for the under-40s is about 0.2%. The rate rises in the over-65s, reaching nearly 15% in the over-80s, especially those with pre-existing heart or lung conditions. Calculating mortality rates during an ongoing epidemic is hard because it is not clear how many mild or asymptomatic cases have been tested for, but the best estimate we have for the coronavirus so far is 1.4% \u2013 somewhere between 1918 Spanish flu and 2009 swine flu. People are recovering from it. As the daily count maintained by the Johns Hopkins CSSE shows, thousands of people around the world are making confirmed recoveries from the coronavirus every day. Hundreds of scientific articles have already been written about it. Type Covid-19 or Sars-19 into the search engine of the US national library of medicine\u2019s PubMed website and you will find, barely five weeks after the emergence of the virus, 539 references to papers about it, dealing with vaccines, therapies, epidemiology, diagnosis and clinical practice. That\u2019s an exponentially faster publication rate than during the Sars epidemic, L\u00f3pez-Go\u00f1i notes \u2013 and most publications\u2019 coronavirus articles are free to access. Vaccine prototypes exist. Commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology labs such as Moderna, Inovio, Sanofi and Novavax, as well as academic groups such as one at the University of Queensland in Australia \u2013 many of which were already working on vaccines for similar Sars-related viruses \u2013 have preventive vaccine prototypes in development, some of which will soon be ready for human testing (although their efficacy and safety will of course take time to establish). Dozens of treatments are already being tested. By mid-February, more than 80 clinical trials were under way for antiviral treatments, according to Nature magazine, and most have already been used successfully in treating other illnesses. Drugs such as remdesivir (Ebola, Sars), chloroquine (malaria), lopinavir and ritonavir (HIV), and baricitinib (rheumatoid polyarthritis) are all being trialled on patients who have contracted the coronavirus, some as a result of the application of artificial intelligence. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2020. An earlier version wrongly stated that \u201ca solution of ethanol, hydrogen peroxide and bleach will disinfect surfaces\u201d. It is dangerous to combine such substances. It now states correctly that \u201ca solution of ethanol, a solution of hydrogen peroxide or a solution of bleach\u201d will disinfect surfaces.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has named congressman Mark Meadows as his new chief of staff, replacing Mick Mulvaney, who had been acting in the role for more than a year. Trump announced the staff reshuffle in Friday night tweets, saying Mulvaney would become the US special envoy for Northern Ireland. \u201cI have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,\u201d Trump said. The long-rumored move makes Meadows, who announced he was not seeking re-election for his House seat from North Carolina, in effect Trump\u2019s fourth chief of staff since taking office in 2017. The decision comes as the Trump administration has faced criticism for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Mulvaney had been leading the interagency response to the virus until Trump designated the vice-president, Mike Pence, to lead the whole-of-government effort more than a week ago. Meadows, a conservative four-term congressman from North Carolina who previously chaired the Freedom Caucus, has long been a close ally to the president. He\u2019s also been a staunch proponent of Trump\u2019s border wall in Congress. He replaces Mick Mulvaney, who became a key figure during the impeachment proceedings. Fiona Hill, a national security council member, testified that Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, said that Mulvaney had approved a White House meeting with Trump for the Ukrainian president on condition Ukraine announced investigations tied Joe Biden. Hill\u2019s account was corroborated in testimony by another firsthand witness to the conversation, Lt Col Alexander Vindman. Mulvaney himself said in a televised October press conference that the White House had conditioned military aid on investigations in Ukraine, but he later denied he had said that.",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Monday\u2019s blog: We\u2019re ending our live coverage for the day, thanks for following along. Some highlights and links: Trump used a freewheeling CDC press conference, intended to provide updates on the coronavirus, as an opportunity to attack Democrats, praise his own intelligence, lash out at CNN and spread false and misleading information about the status of the outbreak. The president made false statements about the availability of tests. Trump also said he wanted exposed passengers to remain on a cruise abroad so that the number of cases wouldn\u2019t increase in the US. The president insulted the governor of Washington state, who is currently overseeing the most serious coronavirus outbreak. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign sued CNN for publishing an opinion piece that argued Trump did not stop Russia from helping the campaign during the presidential election. The president escalated his attacks on Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive health. In a newly released documentary, Bill Clinton claimed the reason for his 1995 extramarital affair with then White House intern Monica Lewinsky was \u201cto manage [his] anxieties\u201d. Trump announced Congressman Mark Meadows as his new chief of staff. The next debate will be Biden v Sanders, with the latest qualifications ensuring Tulsi Gabbard, who is still a candidate, will not join them on the stage. A number of prominent Illinois Democrats endorsed Biden. The president called Elizabeth Warren mean, but praised her attacks on Mike Bloomberg. Some more on Mark Meadows, who Trump just announced as his new chief of staff: The conservative four-term congressman from North Carolina previously chaired the Freedom Caucus and has long been a close ally to the president. He\u2019s also been a staunch proponent of Trump\u2019s border wall in Congress. He replaces Mick Mulvaney, who was acting chief, and who will now become the US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Trump said in his Friday evening tweet: Mulvaney was a key figure during the impeachment proceedings. Trump has just announced Congressman Mark Meadows as his new chief of staff, replacing Mick Mulvaney: Some commentators are calling Trump\u2019s CDC coronavirus press conference today one of his \u201cmost frightening\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d appearances in recent memory, given his political rants, misinformation, bizarre boasting and callousness: He used the press event as an opportunity to attack Democrats, praise his own intelligence, slam CNN and spread false and misleading information about the status of the coronavirus outbreak. While wearing his red \u201cKeep America Great\u201d re-election campaign hat, the president went on a rant criticizing Washington state governor Jay Inslee as a \u201csnake\u201d and saying he disagreed with his vice president\u2019s complimentary remarks toward the Democratic governor. Inslee, who ran for president last year, is overseeing the most serious outbreak in the US. In a moment that has sparked intense scrutiny, the president also said he would prefer that cruise ship passengers exposed to the virus be left abroad so that they don\u2019t add to the number of total infections in the US. \u201cI like the numbers being where they are,\u201d said Trump, who appeared to be explicitly acknowledging his political concerns about the outbreak: \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d The president further implied that the coronavirus test was available to anyone who needs it, even though his own administration has acknowledged that there is currently a shortage among US health care providers. He called the test \u201cperfect\u201d. More on the latest here: The American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), the pro-Israel lobby group, has confirmed that two attendees at their major conference have now tested positive for coronavirus. As reporter Ryan Grim noted, there were 18,000 people in attendance, including two-thirds of Congress, and many of attendees also visited offices on the Hill: Washington state governor Jay Inslee, who is currently overseeing the most serious coronavirus outbreak in the US, has responded to the president\u2019s personal insults and attacks, which Trump made during a rambling tangent at a CDC press conference earlier: The president also said he disagreed with his vice president\u2019s complimentary remarks toward the Democratic governor. Inslee just tweeted: Outside of the CDC, an update on the Biden v Sanders race today: -Sanders has directly criticized Biden over recent attacks against Nina Turner, the Sanders campaign co-chair: Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist and Biden supporter, has faced intense backlash and was forced to apologize after she told Turner, a black woman: \u201cDon\u2019t use Martin Luther King against Joe Biden. You don\u2019t have that stand.\u201d Biden has not tweeted about the dispute, but he did condemn an antisemitic attack against Sanders after a man unfurled a Nazi flag at one of his rallies: To recap what just happened at this Trump CDC press conference on coronavirus: The president wore his re-election campaign hat and interrupted the event to ask a Fox News reporter if his town hall on the network had good ratings. He attacked CNN. He called the governor of Washington state, the epicenter of a major outbreak, a \u201csnake\u201d and \u201cnot a good governor\u201d, and said he disagreed with his own vice president saying nice things about the governor while visiting the state. Trump said he has not considered canceling his rallies and is not worried about risks. He made false and exaggerated claims about the availability of coronavirus tests, ignoring the reality that his vice president has acknowledged, which is that there is a shortage among US healthcare providers right now. He said he would prefer if people on the Grand Princess cruise remained on the ship so that US numbers would not go up. He gloated about his \u201cnatural ability\u201d to understand the epidemic. The president took a break from sharing false and misleading information at his CDC coronavirus press conference to attack the Democratic governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee, who previously was running for president: He\u2019s also using the event as an opportunity to praise himself: Trump is continuing to speak at the CDC about coronavirus, and just said, \u201cAnyone who wants a test can get a test.\u201d There is, in fact, a test kit shortage across the country, as US health care providers have repeatedly reported. Trump\u2019s own vice president has said there are not enough tests to meed the demand. The president is also speaking with characteristic hyperbole, calling the coronavirus tests \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d: The president has repeatedly pushed false statements attempting to blame the Obama administration for current coronavirus testing problems: Here\u2019s recent reporting from the Guardian on what this shortage looks like on the ground from the perspective of US nurses: Trump is again attempting to downplay the threat of the coronavirus outbreak while also going on a tangent about TV ratings and Fox News at the CDC: https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1236051629654388736 Asked about coronavirus, he started talking about flu deaths: \u201cLast year, we had approximately 36,000 deaths due to what\u2019s called the flu. When I first heard this four, five, six weeks ago ... I was shocked to hear it.\u201d Before finishing his thought, he praised Fox News and asked a reporter about ratings: \u201cHow was the show last night, did it get good ratings by the way?\u201d He then said he would prefer that the passengers of the Grand Princess stay on the ship, so that the number of coronavirus cases in the US don\u2019t increase: The quote: I\u2019d rather have the people stay ... I like the numbers being where they are. I don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault. It wasn\u2019t the fault of the people on the ship either ... I\u2019d rather have them stay on, personally. Hello - Sam Levin in Los Angeles here, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. The president is currently touring the CDC, talking with officials while wearing his \u201cKeep America Great\u201d re-election campaign hat: CDC\u2019s direct Robert Redfield began his public comments with praise for Trump\u2019s leadership. Trump is also using this time that was supposed to be a public health update as an opportunity to again insult CNN: The president had arrived at the CDC in the last 20 minutes and is beginning his visit there to be briefed on US efforts to test for and combat the coronavirus outbreak. He hasn\u2019t said anything publicly yet. I\u2019m handing over to my west coast colleague Sam Levin now, to take you through the next few hours in US politics. Here are some of the latest key events: Air Force One disgorges the president in Georgia to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard won\u2019t make the next Democratic debate despite hanging on in the 2020 race for the nomination. It\u2019s down to two, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Joe Biden picked up the endorsements of leading Democratic party figures Lori Lightfoot, Dick Durbin and Deval Patrick this afternoon. The Trump re-election campaign has filed an audacious (and likely extremely long shot) libel lawsuit against CNN over an opinion piece relating to Russian interference to support Trump in the election(s). Bernie Sanders slammed the waving of a swastika flag by a protester at his rally in Phoenix last night as \u201cbeyond disgusting\u201d The president arrived at the main campus of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in Atlanta, Georgia, in the motorcade just moments ago. The reporters\u2019 pool traveling with Donald Trump\u2019s party reported that, on the way there was a mix of well-wishers and protestors along route. One sign said: \u201cWelcome chief idiot.\u201d Another read: \u201cHave faith in science.\u201d Another said: \u201cWe need a vaccine against Trump.\u201d Of course, as Trump fails to grasp, even if there was such a thing as a vaccine against him or his ideology it wouldn\u2019t be ready before the election....(cheat sheet: amid public health concerns, Trump has mentioned incorrectly that a vaccine for the Covid-19 coronavirus was close to ready and has appeared reluctant to grasp that such a thing is 12 - 18 months away. And that the seasonal influenza vaccine won\u2019t work on coronavirus). Hey Democrats, are you Joe a-Biden or feeling the Bern? It\u2019s make your mind up time. The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino indicates that the next primary season debate in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 15, will be a two person affair. Yep, Tulsi Gabbard IS still in the race, but she\u2019s not IN the race. So let\u2019s see how two shouty, tetchy white guys in their late seventies will do, before one of them goes toe-to-toe with their similarly-bracketed but Republican nemesis in the man cave/White House. Another boost for Biden Deval Patrick, former governor of Massachusetts, who ran a very brief campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination to be president, has just endorsed Joe Biden. He will appear with the former vice president at a rally in Jackson, Mississippi, on Sunday, the Boston Globe reports. Biden\u2019s main remaining rival, Bernie Sanders, just pulled out of a rally in Mississippi that was scheduled for today, seemingly being forced to give up on the southern vote to race to Michigan in a last-ditch attempt to grab a mid-western state, as Sanders\u2019 campaign is suddenly \u2018Berning out\u2019. Massachusetts\u2019s first Black governor, Patrick adds to the growing list of one-time candidates to endorse Biden, and offers him a prominent surrogate in Mississippi, where nearly 40 percent of residents are African-American, the Globe writes. Shortly after Cory Booker dropped out of the 2020 race, in January, and Patrick did not cross the party\u2019s threshold to be included in the Democratic primary debates, he said at the time, the Guardian reported: \u201cAmerica will not see herself in full\u201d when the seventh Democratic debate takes place in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday night, Deval Patrick said, citing an absence of candidates of colour. Patrick entered late and remains well off the pace in both poll results and donations, criteria used by the Democratic National Committee to determine debate qualification. On Monday, he responded to Booker\u2019s departure by tweeting: \u201cWhether it\u2019s behind closed doors or screaming it from the rooftops \u2013 every candidate in this race needs to say it out loud: women and people of colour can win. To say otherwise expresses a lack of faith in the American people who deserve more from their leaders.\u201d Campaign legal action slammed as \u201clawsuit spree\u201d The lawsuit filed by the Trump re-election campaign against CNN earlier is the third such in two weeks against media outlets the president frequently criticizes himself - the cable news network, the New York Times and the Washington Post. Here\u2019s what some influential folks and outlets are saying about this on Twitter: Literary and free expression advocates PEN America. This guy: Oof, that\u2019s a gut-punch to the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to sue media outlets it doesn\u2019t like over some articles......but not others.... When Donald Trump attacked the NYT in October, 2018, over its investigation into his financial affairs headlined \u201cTrump Engaged in Suspect Tax Scheme as He Reaped Riches From His Father\u201d, the NYT was swift to note at the time that: Mr. Trump did not offer an outright denial of the facts in the report, such as that the money he made during his decades in real estate came from tax schemes of dubious legality, the existence of records of deception in documenting the family\u2019s financial assets, and that the beginning of the president\u2019s so-called self-made fortune dates back to his toddler years when, by the time he was 3 years old, Mr. Trump earned $200,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars from his father. CNN-er hits back CNN\u2019s media expert Brian Stelter says libel lawsuits like the one Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign just filed against CNN, and prior suits vs the New York Times and the Washington Post won\u2019t succeed and are just a political strategy. Others are weighing in: Stelter points out that there is no official comment from his employer, CNN, at this point, which the Fox News report also noted. Here\u2019s a useful take from Axios, pointing out that: It\u2019s the latest of a series of libel suits by the campaign aimed at media outlets\u2019 opinion articles on issues linked to Russia. Over the last few weeks, the campaign has also sued the New York Times and the Washington Post, alleging similar motives. While President Trump has often threatened to sue news organizations for libel, he has rarely followed through. The efforts face a relatively high bar for proof compared to most lawsuits. In order for a public official to successfully sue for libel, they must be able to prove that the defendant acted with \u201cactual malice.\u201d The article named in the suit, written by CNN contributor Larry Noble and published in June, states that \u201cthe Trump campaign assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia\u2019s help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table.\u201d That assertion is backed up earlier in the piece by citing a Trump interview last year with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos, where Trump said he\u2019d \u201cwant to hear\u201d information offered on political opponents by a foreign government. His statement in that interview was also used to support an argument in one of the Post pieces that resulted in a lawsuit. The CNN piece also cites an \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d interview with White House adviser Jared Kushner, who said that he doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d call the FBI if he were to receive another email like the one before the campaign\u2019s Trump Tower meeting, which had the subject line: \u201cRe: Russia - Clinton - private and confidential.\u201d Illinois Democratic heavyweights Lori Lightfoot, the mayor of Chicago, and Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the US Senate (after minority leader Chuck Schumer), have just endorsed frontrunner Joe Biden for the party nomination to take on Donald Trump in November. Illinois voters go to the polls in the state\u2019s Democratic primary on March 17. Bernie Sanders is desperate to win something in the midwest but is struggling, heading to Detroit as we write in a frantic attempt to snatch Michigan out of the path of Biden\u2019s new South Carolina/Super Tuesday juggernaut. Lightfoot has reportedly been a Sanders critic. Michigan votes this Tuesday. Donald Trump re-election campaign filed a libel lawsuit against CNN on Friday for publishing \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d statements about seeking Russia\u2019s help in the 2020 election, Fox News reports. \u201cThe complaint alleges CNN was aware of the falsity at the time it published them but did so for the intentional purpose of hurting the campaign while misleading its own readers in the process... the campaign filed this lawsuit against CNN and the preceding suits against The New York Times and The Washington Post to hold the publishers accountable for their reckless false reporting and also to establish the truth,\u201d Senior Legal Adviser to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. Jenna Ellis told Fox News. Fox News obtained the complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia where CNN is located. It states in part that CNN claimed Trump\u2019s campaign \u201cassessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia\u2019s help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table.\u201d The complaint said that CNN was well aware the statements were false \u201cbecause there was an extensive record of statements from the Campaign and the administration expressly disavowing any intention to seek Russian assistance\u201d but promoted the claim anyway. The complaint said that Trump\u2019s legal team sent CNN a request to retract and apologize last month but CNN executives refused. The Trump campaign now seeks \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d through litigation. Bernie Sanders spoke a little earlier about an awful incident at his rally in Phoenix, Arizona, last night, where a man unfurled a Nazi swastika flag and shouted anti-Jewish slurs at the 2020 candidate. The interloper was quickly kicked out of the event and Sanders denounced his actions, while noting that he had not noticed the flag or the incident himself and did not learn the details until later. \u201cI heard people booing but I didn\u2019t realise [what happened] until I left the stage,\u201d he said this morning. \u201cI speak not only as a Jewish American but on behalf of the US troops who died fighting Nazism. It\u2019s horrific, it\u2019s beyond disgusting to see, in the United States of America, that people would show the emblem of Hitler and I was shocked to hear that later,\u201d he said. He pointed out that there is sometimes disruption at his campaign events \u201cwith Trump people\u201d, but added: \u201cThis was something different\u201d to \u201chave someone bringing forth the most detestable symbol in modern history.\u201d He congratulated the Phoenix police for dealing with the incident and said he had not felt unsafe. US politics news so far today has been dominated by the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak and the state of the 2020 race for Democrats. There\u2019s plenty more action and drama to come - not least of which, Bernie Sanders is on his way to campaign in Michigan as he tries to save his nomination chances, and Donald Trump is on his way to visit the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, after visiting tornado damage in Tennessee, so do stay tuned. Here are some of the key events so far today: Bernie Sanders has reiterated that, despite divisions, he believes his rival for the Democratic 2020 nomination, Joe Biden, can beat White House incumbent and Republican Donald Trump. Sanders is heading to Detroit after canceling a planned rally in Jackson, Mississippi, today, figuring he has more chance of overcoming Biden in Michigan than the south. The US Congress will hold a hearing next week into Donald Trump\u2019s handling of America\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak (botched, according to one member of the committee that will question health officials next Tuesday). Donald Trump will visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this afternoon, after his plans to visit were initially canceled this morning, then reinstated. The CDC is the primary federal public health agency. The president signed an $8.3bn emergency spending bill passed by Congress yesterday to help fund the US response to coronavirus. The signing occurred in the White House. Bernie Sanders, speaking to the press in Phoenix, Arizona, moments ago before heading to Detroit for a make-or-break weekend of campaigning ahead of the Michigan primary on Tuesday, reiterated a message he said he has asserted since \u201cDay One\u201d of his 2020 campaign - that he believes Joe Biden can beat Donald Trump in November, if his rival becomes the Democratic nominee. Asked straight out, can Joe Biden beat Donald Trump, Sanders said, simply: \u201cYes, he can.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden is my friend,\u201d Sanders said. He gave a laundry list of ways in which their track records and their campaign appeals differ, and we\u2019ll get on that in the next couple of posts - as well as that flag incident, where a swastika was waved at his rally in Phoenix last night. First the vital points that Sanders emphasizes that ousting Trump from the White House is the overarching goal for any Democrat right now. He points out that attacking Joe Biden is part of democracy. Then adds: \u201cI\u2019ve said from Day One I will support the Democratic nominee. The American people and democracy are entitled to a serious debate on our campaigns to decide who is the best to beat Donald Trump but at the end of the day, 98 to 99% of Democrats...are going to come together. \u201cThese differences are minimal compared with Trump.\u201d He adds that the challenge is to get disillusioned voters to the polls. \u201cWe have is to energize those Americans who say [of politicians] \u2018they all stink\u2019.\u201d Bernie Sanders is heading today to campaign in Michigan, canceling a rally he had planned to hold in Jackson, Mississippi. The ultra-progressive is suddenly once again in the fight of his career after moderate Joe Biden roared past him to snatch frontrunner status on Super Tuesday, turbo-charged by the support of 2020 drop-outs Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke, and the pivotal endorsement of South Carolina grandee James Clyburn, to make his great comeback. It seems Sanders has no choice this weekend but to focus on the midwest, where Missouri and Michigan vote in their primaries next Tuesday, March 10, and abandon Mississippi, which also votes that day. After Joe Biden swept the southern states on Super Tuesday this week, starting with surprisingly quick projections of victory in Virginia and South Carolina just moments after the polls closed, Sanders desperately needs a win in the midwest. His efforts are not being helped by the fact that Michigan\u2019s popular Democratic party governor, Gretchen Whitmer, endorsed Biden yesterday. \u201cAll roads to the White House lead through my state, and I want to make sure that we\u2019ve got a strong ability to help impact where we are headed as a nation,\u201d she told MSNBC. Sanders campaigned for Whitmer\u2019s primary challenger in 2018.... Michigan awards three times more pledged delegates (who invariably anoint the nominee) than Mississippi. Dilemma over cruise ship off California After Donald Trump played down the seriousness for the US of the coronavirus outbreak, in a press Q &amp; A at the White House this morning, he immediately expressed concern about the cruise ship anchored near San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge. The ship is under strict quarantine conditions. \u201cIn terms of [US] cases, it\u2019s very, very few...but then we have a ship with many, many Americans on it. We have to make a decision and we are talking to the governor of California about that,\u201d the president said. The Guardian\u2019s Viv Ho reports: Passengers on a Grand Princess cruise ship linked to the first death from coronavirus in California remained off the coast on Thursday as the first two cases were confirmed in San Francisco. A coast guard helicopter was delivering test kits to the cruise ship waiting to dock in the port of San Francisco before flying them back to a laboratory. While the ship has 2,422 passengers and 1,111 crew onboard, according to the cruise line, fewer than 100 have thus far been identified for testing. \u201cThe ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,\u201d said Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, in a news conference Wednesday. The death of a 71-year-old man on Wednesday was the first US fatality reported outside of Washington state. The US death toll is now at 14. Obviously in itself this is a very low figure in a population of more than 325 million. But justified concerns grow over adequate testing and the fact that there is no specialized treatment, cure or preventive vaccine for Covid-19, and the lethality rate is relatively high, especially for vulnerable populations. To say nothing of the Trump administration\u2019s patchy and confusing response so far. Our dedicated global coronavirus live blog can be followed here, by the way. Our business blog, which is keeping an eye on how coronavirus worries are affecting financial markets (Wall Street is tumbling), as well as other economic news, can be followed here. Testing for coronavirus in US \u201cso botched\u201d Illinois congressman and House oversight committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi just hopped onto CNN to talk about the upcoming hearing next week. The committee will meet on Tuesday afternoon and hear sworn testimony from health officials. Contrary to Donald Trump\u2019s blas\u00e9 assertions this morning that the coronavirus outbreak has been \u201cshut down\u201d in the US and is going to \u201cgo away\u201d, Krishnamoorthi has concerns. He said that the Trump administration seems to be \u201ctrying to prevent the public from knowing the scale of the outbreak.\u201d He added: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to tell you where the confirmed cases are, they don\u2019t want to tell you how many people have been tested or how many people\u201d have the novel, pneumonia-like illness that has a relatively high lethality rate for those contracting the virus (between two and 3.4% lethality compared with seasonal influenza which typically kills 0.1% of those who catch it). Krishnamoorthi said that while China, where the outbreak started, is testing 10,000 people a day, the US has \u201cconducted 500 tests total across the country.\u201d \u201cThe whole testing issue has been so botched,\u201d he said. Vice president Mike Pence admitted last night - in a blunt statement that was actually refreshingly devoid of spin - that the US does not have enough coronovirus testing kits to meet demand right now. The oversight committee will seek testimony and answers under oath from public health officials next Tuesday, which the congressman said should elicit answers to important questions and will \u201csend a signal\u201d to the administration of what needs to be done. \u201cWe are worried,\u201d he said. Krishnamoorthi won Tammy Duckworth\u2019s Illinois House seat after she was elected to the US Senate in 2016. The hearing on Tuesday begins at 2pm ET on Capitol Hill. The US death toll from coronavirus has now risen to 14. The United States is considering ways to discourage US travelers from taking cruises as part of a broader Trump administration effort to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to four officials familiar with the situation, Reuters reports. The officials, who asked to remain anonymous, said no decision has been made. The discussions are taking place ahead of a meeting between Vice President Mike Pence, who is in charge of leading the US response to the coronavirus, and the cruise industry this weekend. The administration could advise some or all US travelers to avoid taking cruises in the face of a growing number of coronavirus cases on cruise ships, officials said. More on the quarantined cruise ship anchored off California in a moment... The cruise industry had an economic impact of more than $52.7bn to the United States in 2018, according to a study commissioned by Cruise Lines International Association. This was an increase of more than 10% since 2016. The House oversight committee plans to hold a hearing in Washington next week to question officials from the Department of Health and Human Service and the federal public health agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The president\u2019s visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, is confirmed as back on, the White House says. Trump\u2019s visit was abruptly canceled this morning, then he mentioned that it might be back on. Now there\u2019s been a briefing for journalists accompanying the president on Air Force One (he\u2019s on his way to Tennessee to tour areas damaged by Tuesday\u2019s tornado and will then go to Georgia to the CDC). Pool report: Stephanie Grisham came back during flight to say the CDC visit is back on. There will \u201cprobably be a tour\u201d she said when asked what would be on the itinerary. Explaining the on-off nature of the trip she: \u201cWhat the president said is true.\u201d [Based on his statements at the White House prior to his departure this morning.] A CDC member of staff was suspected to have contracted coronavirus and they did not think they would get the test results in time before president\u2019s trip so \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d, she said, it was postponed for the safety of everyone involved and to allow the CDC to prevent any further spread. \u201cThankfully she\u2019s negative, the person,\u201d tested negative. Itinerary is now to visit Nashville and then go to Atlanta. The president is heading to his private resort club Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, Florida, later today and is holding a fundraiser this evening. But Donald Trump revealed this morning that he is also meeting with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro at the club this weekend. A visit had been talked about, but details were not public. Reuters reports: Trump announced the meeting while speaking to reporters at the White House [on Friday morning], saying the two leaders would have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Trump did not offer any other details. Sources had earlier said the meeting was in the works, and one person familiar with the matter earlier told Reuters that Bolsonaro said he was \u201ccalled\u201d by Trump. \u201cHe wanted to have dinner,\u201d Trump told reporters. The meeting is expected to be closed to the press without any public statements, two others sources said. A preliminary schedule for Bolsonaro\u2019s US visit had shown the Brazilian conservative president would be in Florida from Saturday to Tuesday, including a meeting with a senior US military official, an investor seminar and visit to a plant run by Brazilian plane-maker Embraer. Since becoming president of Brazil, the conservative Bolsonaro has caused shockwaves among supporters of democracy, the environment, a free press, LGBTQ and women\u2019s rights, indigenous rights and..one could go on and on, ending in a primeval scream from the Amazonian rainforest as the logging trucks rumble by. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith also just asked Donald Trump at the White House what he thought of Elizabeth Warren dropping out of the race for the Democratic nomination yesterday, after a very disappointing performance in the Super Tuesday primaries across 14 states (she did not win any and came third in her home state of Massachusetts). Boom! Like taking a doctor\u2019s hammer on the knee, those misogynistic Trumpian reflexes shot up. \u201cI think lack of talent was her problem,\u201d he said, of one of the most talented figures in the Democratic party and the US Senate. Then he paid her a back-handed compliment, for slaying his New York frenemy-turned-arch enemy Mike Bloomberg. \u201cShe was a tremendous debater, she destroyed Mike Bloomberg very quickly,\u201d he said, of Bloomberg\u2019s first debate with his Democratic rivals, earlier this year, when Warren skewered him on his track record of discrimination lawsuits from women employees and sexist jokes, leaving the former New York mayor and billionaire gasping. But of course the irony is that there\u2019s nothing Trump loathes more, is viscerally repelled by, than a strong debating female..... He went on: \u201cBut people don\u2019t like her. She is a mean person. They like a person like me that\u2019s not mean.\u201d Warren wants to up taxes on billionaires. Trump policies put kids in cages at the US-Mexico border and rip families apart with his anti-Muslim travel ban while his rhetoric appears to be inspiring a surge of racist bullying in schools. Donald Trump just lit into Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden almost in a single breath, in one of his free-wheeling Q &amp; As with gathered media at the White House earlier this morning. The Guardian\u2019s Washington bureau chief David Smith is on pool duty today in the capital today. He was at the press session in the Diplomatic Room and got in a series of questions probing for the president\u2019s latest thoughts on the Democratic race for the 2020 party nomination. We\u2019ll come on to what he said about Warren in the next post. Meanwhile, Super Tuesday\u2019s tumultuous events catapulted Joe Biden back from the brink of 2020 failure to a strong position as national frontrunner, while pushing Warren and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg out of the contest in short order. Sanders now finds himself desperately chasing Biden and looking increasingly doomed, when a week ago it was precisely the other way around. Smith asked Trump what he thought of Biden\u2019s comeback and received this rather surprising response. \u201cJoe Biden? He\u2019s leftwing. In many ways he is worse than Bernie,\u201d he said, referring to Sanders\u2019s self-declared longtime label of Democratic socialist v Biden\u2019s stance as a leading moderate in the Democratic party. \u201cHe wants to put Beto in charge of guns,\u201d he said. Former Texas congressman and ex-candidate for 2020 Beto O\u2019Rourke endorsed Biden on the eve of Super Tuesday. And his most famous line from the Democratic debates while he was still in the campaign, and not long after a horrendous, seemingly anti-immigrant-driven mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, in west Texas, last year, was a strong call for federal gun control in America, especially a ban on military-style assault weapons. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15s,\u201d he shouted. Trump then seemingly took a dig at Biden\u2019s mental acuity (the 73-year-old Trump taunting the 77-year-old Biden), saying: \u201cIf he gets in they will be running the government, he has people who are further left than Bernie, he\u2019s going to raise taxes more than Bernie, he will destroy everything that\u2019s been built.\u201d Trump just reiterated his lack of worry about the spread of the novel illness in the US. Perhaps problematic, though is that, to many, he\u2019s coming across as casually dismissive and posturing, not measured, and reassuringly presidential. \u201cYou have to be calm,\u201d he said, at the White House this morning before departing to tour the tornado damage in Tennessee and just after signing an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to deal with the virus. \u201cIt will go away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have very low numbers [of confirmed cases] compared to many countries throughout the world, our numbers are lower than almost anyone...deaths, is it 11?\u201d It is. \u201cIn terms of cases, it\u2019s very very few because we have been very strong at the borders.\u201d He also said he thinks the financial markets will \u201creally bounce back\u201d from the see-sawing of recent days over concerns that the virus is spreading and on governments\u2019 abilities to contain it. \u201cThis came unexpectedly, it came out of China, we closed it down, we stopped it, it was a very early shut down,\u201d he added. There has been no official evidence provided to date that the novel coronavirus illness COVID-19 has been \u201cshut down\u201d in the US. President tells America not to panic over coronavirus The president signed the Congressional emergency funding bill in side the White House and put some characteristic spin on the fact that he\u2019d originally assessed that only about a quarter of the funds that have just been approved would be needed to combat the spread of the disease in the US. Signing the bill in the Diplomatic Room at the White House, he said, according to the Guardian\u2019s David Smith, who is part of the media pool covering the president in Washington today: \u201cWe\u2019ve signed the $8.3 billion. I asked for two and a half and I got 8.3 and I\u2019ll take it.\u201d He also said his CDC trip today had been cancelled because of a suspected coronavirus case at the CDC itself - but that this turned out to be negative, so he may visit after all. \u201cSo I may be going. We\u2019re going to see if they can turn it around.\u201d Trump took questions for 12 minutes from the press and reiterated his message that the public should not panic over the coronavirus - and that it would have been worse but for his early actions. We\u2019ll have fuller quotes for you shortly. But given the mixed messages the president has been putting out about the risks of the virus, including contradicting health officials about the lethality of the illness and confusing the public by talking about people with the virus going to work, when his own health experts recommend not doing that, what is normally considered audacious now sounds closer to dangerous. Upon leaving the White House en route for Tennessee moments ago, the president confirmed he had signed the emergency spending bill to fund the US response to the coronavirus outbreak. He also signaled that his visit to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta this afternoon, a trip that was abruptly canceled this morning, may be back on. The CDC is the frontline federal agency dealing with public health for the nation. Donald Trump has signed the $8.3B special spending bill to combat coronavirus outbreak in US. The bill was passed in Congress yesterday almost with close to bipartisan unanimity. It is a much higher amount than the president originally suggested would be enough to deal with the novel illness. A top communications official is set to leave the White House later this month, it appears, as the president continues to muddle through not just his administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak but its messaging, too. Adam Kennedy, a deputy communications director, is on his way out, according to Politico, which reports that he was: Also a deputy assistant to the president, has overseen a team of 11 communications staffers and also worked on building out messaging materials for various White House policy rollouts, including tax reform. A top research official at the Republican National Committee during 2016, he has worked in the White House since the first day of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Kennedy led the White House\u2019s rapid response efforts on impeachment and other crises, including Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation battle, is leaving the government later this month, according to two White House officials. And here\u2019s the sting in the tail - right-wing BREITBART: Kennedy will be replaced by Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart writer who is currently director of rapid response and surrogate operations for the White House, according to one of the White House officials. Hahn will report to White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. Donald Trump is heading to Nashville this morning to visit areas hit by the deadly nighttime tornado that tore through Tennessee before dawn on Tuesday, killing 25, injuring at least 150 and destroying or damaging almost 600 homes with winds that reached 175mph. The president will be departing the White House soon, so let\u2019s watch out for any comments on the lawn, aka \u201cchopper talk\u201d before he boards the Marine One helicopter to take him to Air Force One and thence the south. He was originally scheduled to go to Atlanta this afternoon, to visit the CDC, which is at the core of US medical efforts to address the coronavirus outbreak. But that trip was abruptly canceled by the White House this morning. The president has been making up statistics on a personal hunch about how deadly the disease is and last night vice president Mike Pence, whom Trump has put in charge of his administration\u2019s task force to tackle the novel virus that\u2019s spreading globally, said the US does not yet have enough equipment to meet testing demands. Pence was in Washington State yesterday, where the worst local outbreak yet in the US is occurring. We\u2019ll bring you selected US coronavirus news here, but for all the details of global developments, including US news on the illness, do follow our dedicated live blog, here. And to keep track of how coronavirus concerns are affecting the financial markets, and the latest US jobs figures, there is quick and clear news in our dedicated business live blog, here. Good morning, live blog readers! It\u2019s Friday and there\u2019s still a lot of action before the political week in Washington is out and another weekend of 2020 campaigning begins for those remaining in the Democratic race for the nomination. Joanna Walters here in New York to take you through today\u2019s developments. Here\u2019s what\u2019s afoot: Breaking news: the White House has unexpectedly canceled a trip by Donald Trump to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today, the federal agency in charge of national public health in the United States, under the umbrella of the health department. The president was due to visit amid the coronavirus outbreak. There\u2019s no official explanation for the cancellation yet. Meanwhile, the race for the Democratic presidential nomination has narrowed to just three contenders: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and long-shot candidate Tulsi Gabbard. With Elizabeth Warren\u2019s announcement yesterday that she would suspend her presidential campaign, the nominating contest is coming down to a face-off between Biden and Sanders. Biden has momentum on his side after his strong performance on Super Tuesday, when he notched 10 state victories to Sanders\u2019 four. But Sanders is hoping he can pull ahead by winning over a high number of Warren\u2019s former supporters. His first test will come on Tuesday, when six states hold primaries. Those contests will give Sanders the chance to recapture the delegate lead, but if Biden can secure more victories on Tuesday, this primary may be over sooner than expected.",

      "body": "<p>Harvey Weinstein\u2019s record of sexual attacks and harassment against women dates back to the 1970s in a \u201clifetime of abuse\u201d in which he \u201ctrapped women into his exclusive control and assaulted or attempted to assault them\u201d, according to New York prosecutors.</p> <p>In a note to the New York supreme court released on Friday ahead of Weinstein\u2019s sentencing next week, the lead prosecutor at his rape trial essentially threw the book at the fallen movie mogul.

      "bodyText": "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s record of sexual attacks and harassment against women dates back to the 1970s in a \u201clifetime of abuse\u201d in which he \u201ctrapped women into his exclusive control and assaulted or attempted to assault them\u201d, according to New York prosecutors. In a note to the New York supreme court released on Friday ahead of Weinstein\u2019s sentencing next week, the lead prosecutor at his rape trial essentially threw the book at the fallen movie mogul. Without providing the state\u2019s desired sentence, Joan Illuzzi-Orbon urged Judge James Burke to impose \u201ca sentence that reflects the seriousness of [his] offenses, his total lack of remorse for the harm he has caused, and the need to deter him and others from engaging in further criminal conduct\u201d. Illuzzi-Orbon gives a devastating account of Weinstein\u2019s sexual crimes. She says of Weinstein that \u201cthroughout his entire adult professional life, [he] has displayed a staggering lack of empathy, treating others with disdain and inhumanity. He has consistently advanced his own sordid desires and fixations over the well-being of others.\u201d She then itemises a stunningly long list of Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct, drawing on a two-year investigation out of the New York district attorney\u2019s office. She breaks the shocking litany up into three categories: \u201csexual assault and harassment\u201d, \u201cbad acts and behavior in the work environment\u201d and \u201cother bad acts\u201d. In total, the sentencing memo chronicles 36 instances of alleged sexual abuse, bullying, harassment and threats over a span of 40 years. Last month the jury of seven men and five women found the former movie mogul guilty of sexually assaulting former production assistant Miriam Haley and of raping an aspiring actor who the Guardian has not named as her wishes in terms of identification are not known. Haley testified that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in his home in 2006, while the other key witness testified that he raped her in March 2013, early in an \u201cextremely degrading\u201d relationship she had with him. The jury acquitted Weinstein on the most serious charges, which carried a potential life sentence. Extraordinarily, the prosecutor\u2019s litany of Weinstein\u2019s sexual and other bad behavior begins as far back as 1978, when it alleges a woman working in Weinstein\u2019s then music company in Buffalo, New York, met him in New York City for a business meeting.

Weinstein then told the woman that he would give her any movie part she wanted if she had sex with him, the sentencing memo says. \u201cDefendant said that when a man is obese, normal sexual positions would not work and other options would have to be used to \u2018get him off\u2019.\u201d In the UK in the 1990s, Weinstein is alleged to have lured a 19-year-old employee to his hotel room under the guise of a script meeting. \u201cDefendant then sexually assaulted the employee, who was left in extreme shock and had difficulty comprehending what had happened.\u201d In another incident in the UK in 1991, a woman also aged 19 who worked as an intern for Weinstein for just one day was told by her supervisor to visit him in his hotel suite. There she was forced to see him naked in the bathtub and to watch him lying on his bed with his dressing gown open. He forced her to take her own top off before she fled. Under the category of \u201cabusive behavior in the workplace\u201d, the memo lists numerous examples of Weinstein\u2019s alleged tantrums and tirades. They include the movie mogul throwing a table of food at an employee who disagreed with him, threatening staff physically and professionally, and getting executives to lie on his behalf. One business executive described Weinstein to prosecutors as \u201cdespicable, aggressive, demeaning, coercive, threatening\u201d and as someone who would \u201cmake you do things you don\u2019t want to do\u201d. Another witness described Weinstein attacking his brother Bob Weinstein so badly that \u201che bled a great deal and was briefly unconscious\u201d.

Illuzzi-Orbon alleges that the woman was one of \u201cmultiple people\u201d who reported to prosecutors that Weinstein had bragged to them about his ability to get people killed. Weinstein told his rape victim that \u201che could send men with baseball bats to assault her father if she wanted, bragging that he had done that with other people in the past\u201d, the memo claims. A lawyer for Weinstein had no immediate comment about the allegations made in the sentencing note. In its memo, the New York district attorney\u2019s office is seeking to firm up the groundbreaking nature of Weinstein\u2019s conviction. The once-powerful titan of Hollywood, who produced such cult films as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, was found guilty of one charge of a criminal sex act and one of rape in the third degree which combined carry a maximum sentence of 29 years in prison. The guilty verdict broke a glass ceiling in prosecutions of sexual assault in the US by convicting a defendant who continued to be in intimate contact with his victims, in some cases sexually. Such cases have almost never been taken all the way to trial as prosecutors have assumed that juries would acquit. Marking the historic victory, Illuzzi-Orbon states in her memo: \u201cIt is totally appropriate in this case to communicate to a wider audience that sexual assault, even if perpetrated upon an acquaintance or in a professional setting, is a serious offense worthy of a lengthy prison sentence.\u201d Weinstein was moved to the prison on Rikers Island in New York on Thursday having undergone heart surgery. He will be sentenced on Wednesday. He still faces sexual assault charges in Los Angeles, which were announced just hours after his New York trial began in January. Dozens of women have also filed civil lawsuits against him.",

The minister urged those who believed they may have been on the same flight to call the 1800 657 398 hotline. She said Victoria had not yet had a case of community transmission of Covid-19. Victoria\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Brett Sutton, urged people to get tested immediately if they suspected they had coronavirus rather than going to work with cold-like symptoms. \u201cWe have all done [that] in the past. We are now at the stage with this illness that we have a particular obligation, and we have a particular obligation as healthcare workers, to exclude ourselves until we can assure a patients that we are not a risk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can turn test around within 24 hours, so you should not feel shy about getting tested so you can reassure yourself about returning to work.\u201d Anyone who has symptoms should call the hotline before presenting to a GP\u2019s clinic. Mikakos said the Doherty Institute in Melbourne was working to develop a 20-minute pin-prick diagnostic test for the disease. However she said estimates for a vaccine were still that it would not be available for 12 to 18 months. Sutton also urged those who were unwell to self-isolate and particularly avoid public transport and public gatherings until they had been tested. However Mikakos said there was no need for panic-buying of supplies. \u201cHave enough of what you need if you need to self isolate for 14 days; that does not mean filling up your home and garage with toilet rolls,\u201d she said. Australian deputy chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly said the government will make 260,000 masks available and that it is considering stockpiling some pharmaceuticals, including antibacterial and antiviral medicines. \u201cWe may be able to take it under control but that\u2019s looking increasingly unlikely ... it may become endemic, so something that comes back around each winter,\u201d he said. He warned that people, including health professionals, should not continue to go to work if they have symptoms. \u201cDon\u2019t soldier on ... we expect our health care workforce particularly to take this onboard.\u201d New South Wales health authorities, meanwhile, were seeking to track down passengers on a Qatar Airways flight from Doha after a man in his 70s was among six new cases of the deadly virus diagnosed in the state. The state government on Saturday announced that an additional six cases of Covid-19 had been discovered, bringing the NSW total number to 34. All the new cases were close contacts or family members of previously confirmed cases except for a man who contracted the virus after visiting Italy. He fell ill day the day after flying back to Sydney via Qatar. NSW Health said it was attempting to contact passengers on Qatar Airways flight QR908 which left Doha on 1 March. \u201cScreening continues at Sydney international Airport,\u201d NSW Health said in a statement. \u201cAs at midnight 7 March, a total of 23,814 passengers have been assessed, and a total of 77 were sent for testing.\u201d With Australian Associated Press",

The tourists are gone and just a couple of families are taking advantage of the locals\u2019 Sunday special of sangria jugs as their children swim in the pool. Mark and Anya spin decks to an empty dance floor. The combined economic impacts of the coronavirus outbreak and the bushfires have kept visitors away from Australia and nowhere is this more acutely felt than north Queensland. The wet season from January has traditionally been a low season for the Queensland tourism industry in the far north, so the growing Chinese market has been a much-needed boost for a region in recent years. However, since Chinese New Year this year, Chinese tourist numbers have dried up because of cancelled inbound flights from China. It\u2019s been a tough blow for region already suffering a struggling market since last year\u2019s floods, the summer\u2019s bushfires and the international attention on coral bleaching.

      "bodyText": "Tullow Oil may emerge as the latest casualty of the coronavirus this week as it prepares to lay bare the toll of a difficult year, amid growing investor concern for the oil industry in the months and years ahead. The troubled exploration company has already lost more than half its market value since the start of 2019 as the Covid-19 outbreak punctured rising oil markets and cast doubt on the size of world energy demand in the year ahead. The FTSE 250 group warned investors in January that it would take a \u00a31.5bn writedown due to the economic impact of the virus, which has stalled growth in China and threatens productivity across the globe. Since then, oil prices have tumbled to a one-year low of below $50 a barrel, from almost $69 at the beginning of the year, as traders warned the market to be prepared for \u201czero growth\u201d in oil demand this year. Tullow\u2019s financial woes began before the coronavirus outbreak hit the globe\u2019s appetite for oil. In December, its shares plunged to a 16-year low after the company surprised investors by slashing its production forecasts, scrapping its dividend and announcing that its chief executive and exploration director had left. Tullow has been plagued by problems in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya. It planned to tap the oil-rich reserves off the Guyanese coast but was forced to admit this year that that \u201ctransformational\u201d project had turned out to be a damp squib. But the impact of a global oil-market downturn, combined with mounting concerns over global heating, is likely to magnify the existing weaknesses of the company \u2013 and many of its peers. Tullow is one of a handful of exploration and production companies listed on the UK\u2019s premium stock markets that are entirely exposed both to the short-term pain of the coronavirus outbreak and the long-term existential risk of the climate crisis. The market has been particularly unforgiving for Premier Oil, which faces a $4bn debt refinancing and has suffered a precipitous plunge in market value, from more than 117p a share at the start of the year to about 62p last week. The combination of weak oil prices and wary investor sentiment means there has never been a worse time to be reliant on fossil fuels and saddled with debt. Oil industry brokers at Peel Hunt slashed their share price targets for companies across the sector late last week. On average, the valuation of all listed oil companies in its sights have fallen by about 15%. The world\u2019s oil supermajors \u2013 Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Repsol \u2013 may be able to keep investors on side by charting a greener future, but UK oil companies such as Tullow, Premier Oil and EnQuest have fewer options, and limited capital, available to weather the coming storm. Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund and Tullow\u2019s fifth-largest investor, made its position on fossil fuel investment clear earlier this month. Larry Fink, the boss of the $7tn fund, said the climate emergency was altering how investors viewed the long-term prospects of companies and warned of a \u201csignificant reallocation of capital\u201d. Weeks later, Jim Cramer, the influential host of the US investment television show Mad Money, said he was \u201cdone with fossil fuels\u201d because they had entered a \u201cdeath-knell phase\u201d. This is worrying news for the UK\u2019s mid-tier oilers, and leaves zero room for missteps.",
