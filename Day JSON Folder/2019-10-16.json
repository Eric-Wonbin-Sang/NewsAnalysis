In an interview with the ABC shortly after being released from immigration detention, Palfreeman said he feared the influence of far-right political movements, which are seeking to have him reimprisoned, on the judiciary and criminal justice system. Palfreeman served 11 years of a 20-year sentence for the 2007 murder of a student, before being paroled last month.

He fears a political push to have his case \u201creopened\u201d could see him reimprisoned far beyond his original sentence. The nationalist VMRO party, a junior government coalition party which has protested his parole, nominated deputy minister of justice Nikolay Prodanov to his position. \u201cThe fear of going back to prison is connected with the fact this fascist party still controls the prisons,\u201d Palfreeman told the ABC. \u201cFor sure they would set me up, they would put drugs in my room, they would get a false witness against me, they would set me up to try to get me another sentence and to put me back into maximum security prison.\u201d Palfreeman said the rule of law in Bulgaria was being sacrificed for political expediency in his case, with politicians seeking to sate populist movements in the country. \u201cThe laws are clear that they shouldn\u2019t send my case back to be reopened, but the laws are also clear that when you\u2019re being attacked by 13 men that you\u2019re allowed to defend yourself, and I got 20 years anyway,\u201d Palfreeman said. While concerned about endemic corruption in the criminal justice system, Palfreeman praised the Bulgarian people for standing up to authoritarian forces in the country. \u201cWhat I would like people in Australia to understand [is] that there are many brave Bulgarians who have been trying to fight against the corruption, against the mafia, the powers that be, that are corrupting the justice system,\u201d he said. Palfreeman has said if he is freed, he would like to stay in Bulgaria to continue his work with the Bulgarian Prisoners\u2019 Association he helped establish, campaigning for inmates\u2019 rights in the country. However, if he is granted his liberty it appears certain Palfreeman will be deported from the country. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister Marise Payne has consistently raised concerns that \u201cnon-legal considerations\u201d were influencing Bulgaria\u2019s highly irregular treatment of Palfreeman\u2019s case since he was paroled. Payne has made repeated entreaties to her Bulgarian counterpart Ekaterina Zakharieva, insisting the Bulgarian government afford Palfreeman \u201cdue process, consistent with Bulgarian law\u201d. Palfreeman, from Sydney, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years for fatally stabbing a 23-year-old law student, Andrei Monov, in Sofia during a night out in December 2007. He was also convicted of attempted murder of Monov\u2019s associate Antoan Zahariev, who was injured. The Australian has consistently maintained he acted in self-defence in the early hours of 28 December 2007, after intervening to prevent Monov and a group of more than a dozen friends from attacking two Roma men in the city centre. His lawyer, Kalin Angelov, has released security camera footage of the brawl, which Palfreeman said exonerated him and demonstrated clearly his stabbing of Monov occurred after the group turned on him. Then 21, Palfreeman pleaded not guilty to murdering Monov (he was carrying a large butterfly knife belonging to a friend with which he stabbed the student in the side of his chest) but was found guilty of murder. The conviction and sentence were upheld by higher courts. Palfreeman said he had been carrying the knife because he\u2019d previously experienced violence in Sofia. While his unexpected parole in September was greeted with elation by his family and supporters in Australia, it was condemned by senior politicians in Bulgaria, including the dead man\u2019s father, and has divided the country\u2019s legal fraternity. Monov\u2019s father, Hristo, a former MP for the Bulgarian Socialist party, said the court had made a mockery of Bulgaria\u2019s people. \u201cThe three judges \u2026 will carry a moral disgrace on their own,\u201d he said. Ultra-nationalist political parties marched on Sofia\u2019s Palace of Justice demanding Palfreeman be reimprisoned, and the country\u2019s prosecutor general launched a highly irregular appeal to the supreme court of cassation, the highest court in the land, for his parole to be overturned. A decision by that court \u2013 likely to ultimately decide Palfreeman\u2019s freedom \u2013 is expected within two months.",

      "bodyText": "Pret a Manger has given its most popular sandwiches \u2013 including the tuna baguette and BLT \u2013 a high profile vegan makeover, in response to the fast-growing demand for plant-based food. Two baguettes, one wrap and a sandwich will go on sale next week, with all four based on bestselling items from the Pret menu but using only vegan ingredients. Its chefs have used chickpeas to mimic the texture and flavour of tuna and mushrooms to replicate bacon and duck in the plant-based versions of the bestselling tuna baguette, BLT, egg mayo baguette and hoisin duck wrap. The new \u201cchuna\u201d mayo baguette, VLT, eggless mayo baguette and hoisin mushroom wrap have all been created in response to soaring consumer demand for more plant-based options. They will be sold, initially, exclusively in the standalone Veggie Pret shops which sell only vegetarian and vegan products, but if successful they will be stocked in the main chain too. An Instagram poll helped to find out which products its customers most wanted in vegan versions, according to Hannah Dolan, Pret\u2019s global head of food innovation. \u201cThese have been nine months in the pipeline and we have gone to great lengths to ensure that the new versions have all the tastes and textures of the original sandwiches they were inspired by,\u201d she said. The new chuna mayo baguette replicates the tuna mayo and cucumber original \u2013 a staple on the Pret menu for two decades and with more than 10,000 now sold in the UK every day. To mimic tuna, crushed chickpeas are flavoured with chopped pickled onions and capers \u2013 and a hint of seaweed \u2013 and mixed with vegan mayonnaise. Its VLT pairs roasted shiitake mushroom \u201crashers\u201d, with sliced tomatoes, green salad and a dollop of vegan mayo on malted bread. The eggless mayo is filled with finely chopped tofu in vegan mayonnaise, while the vegan hoisin and glazed mushroom wrap swaps chestnut mushrooms for duck.",

      "bodyText": "Pioneering work to return a river to its natural path in an attempt to improve the diversity of flora and fauna and reduce the risk of flooding has been launched on Exmoor in Somerset. The scheme, the first of its kind in the UK, has been inspired by projects in the north-west of the US, in which rivers and streams have been encouraged to flow through multiple channels, pools and shallow riffles as they would have done before mankind arrived and began moulding them into shapes to suit farming and settlement. Diggers have begun to move earth around on a spot on the National Trust\u2019s Holnicote Estate called Mud Pool Meadow through which a tributary of the River Aller flows. The idea is that rather than running along a single channel the water will be able to find its own way and meander through the landscape more in the shape of the branches of a tree. It should lead to more areas of wetland and natural pools and streams. Though the National Trust scheme is in its infancy, peregrine falcon and deer have already been spotted returning to the spot, and the hope is that wading birds such as the curlew will be tempted to the site. It should also help a population of water voles that have been re-introduced to Exmoor. Like much of Exmoor and other uplands in the English West Country, land has been drained and rivers and streams managed to maximise land for grazing. The idea at Mud Pool Meadow is to \u201creset\u201d nature and give the water a chance to move and settle in a more natural way. At the moment the digging work means that much of the area is bare earth but trees such as alder and willow are expected to gain a foothold soon. The project is inspired by the Fivemile-Bell restoration scheme in Oregon, where work has been done on rivers and streams to restore them to how they were before settlers drained the land.

In an attempt to improve the way police and prosecutors build cases in one of the most controversial areas of law enforcement, the CPS has revised its advice on what constitutes legitimate medical or therapeutic intervention and what amounts to criminal activity. Since FGM was first outlawed in 1985, there has only been one conviction \u2013 earlier this year when a Ugandan woman, who lived in Walthamstow, east London, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for cutting her three-year-old daughter. There have been several failed prosecutions, including the first in 2015 when a doctor was acquitted after stitching up a mother after childbirth. The offence has been a notoriously difficult legal area for prosecutors, with accusations that cases were pursued to satisfy political pressure for action. The fashion for \u201cdesigner vagina\u201d procedures and genital piercings has complicated consideration of what is illegal and made clearer guidance necessary. Among the most popular types of operation is labiaplasty, which involves cutting labial tissue either side of the vulva. Jaswant Narwal, who is the chief CPS prosecutor in Thames and Chiltern as well as the organisation\u2019s lead on FGM cases, said: \u201cFemale genital mutilation is a sickening offence that can have a serious, lifelong physical and emotional impact on victims. \u201cWe want to send a strong message that this crime does not have to be carried out in the UK for people to be prosecuted by the CPS \u2013 we will seek justice for people affected by this horrific practice.

Suspects can face prosecution in the UK regardless of where in the world any procedure took place. The young age of victims and a reluctance to report the crime to the police because of cultural taboos have both been blamed for low levels of offences being reported. The new guidelines published on Thursday provide clarity on drawing the line between \u201cdesigner vagina\u201d operations and FGM, according to the CPS. In theory, some cosmetic vaginal surgery such as labiaplasty could fall under the definition of FGM in the 2003 act. But prosecutors are advised they should also consider public interest factors, including the age of the alleged victim, whether they provided fully informed and free consent, the level of physical or mental harm caused, and the impact on the individual\u2019s quality of life now and in the future. Piercing female genitalia \u2013 \u201cto adorn it with jewellery or other accessories purely for the purpose of personal decoration or in order to enhance the sensation of sexual contact\u201d \u2013 will not usually amount to FGM, the advice says. In relation to cosmetic surgery or labiaplasty, the guidance states: \u201cProsecutors should consider the evidence of necessity. This may include psychological reasons for the surgery which mean that the surgery will have a therapeutic element.\u201d Factors making it more likely that charges should be initiated are, among others, if the victim supports prosecution, if there is mental or physical harm caused, if the victim was under 18 and if there was no medical benefit.",

He is up just 3lb in the ratings as a result of the narrow margin, proven already on easy ground and open to plenty of improvement with just four runs in the book. Even at 6-4, he looks a fair price against much more exposed opponents. </p> \n<p><strong>Ramatuelle (3.35)</strong> had shown little worthwhile form before being sent to Brighton for her ninth start in early September, and she followed up a third place finish off just 46 with the first win of her career when she returned to the south coast a week later. That was a much improved showing to win a seller off 47 and persuaded Laura Mongan to pay \u00a35,500 to buy her out of Sir Mark Prescott\u2019s stable. Ramatuelle is up another 8lb in the weights, but having found a track that suits her, she could be worth backing to continue her streak. </p> \n<p><strong>Hassaad (4.40)</strong> should go well, while <strong>Arthur\u2019s Gift (1.45)</strong> and <strong>Tegerek (2.20)</strong> have obvious chances at Carlisle. At a bigger price, meanwhile, <strong>Atletico (7.00)</strong> could be worth an interest at around 12-1 to bounce back from a below-par performance on heavy ground when he turns out at Chelmsford City.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"009bd916-d986-4112-96d8-db76ad7a3617\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Carlisle</b> <b>12.15</b> Esprit Du Large <b>12.45</b>&nbsp;Methodtothemadness <b>1.15&nbsp;</b>Bourbon Borderline <b>1.45</b> Arthur\u2019s Gift <b>2.20</b> Tegerek <b>2.55</b> Higgs <b>3.25</b> Never Up <b>4.00</b> Legends Ryde&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Brighton</b> <b>1.25 </b>Bahamian Sunrise <b>1.55</b>&nbsp;Silver&nbsp;Samurai <b>2.30</b> Bardo Contiguo&nbsp;(nap) <b>3.05</b> Spantik <b>3.35</b> Ramatuelle (nb) <b>4.10</b>&nbsp;Field&nbsp;Of Vision <b>4.40</b> Hassaad&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Wincanton</b> <b>1.40</b> Nebuchadnezzar <b>2.10</b>&nbsp;Ecco <b>2.45</b> Wisecracker <b>3.20&nbsp;</b>Pagero <b>3.55</b>&nbsp;Forgot &nbsp;o&nbsp;Ask <b>4.25</b> Dollnamix <br> <b>4.55</b> Archimento <b>5.25</b> The Boola Bee&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Wolverhampton</b> <b>5.10</b> Guroor <b>5.45</b> Informed Front <b>6.15</b> Prince Consort <b>6.45</b> Landing Night <b>7.15</b> Progressive Rating <b>7.45</b> Mojave <b>8.15</b>&nbsp;Tails I Win&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Chelmsford City</b> <b>5.30</b> Moorland Spirit <b>6.00</b>&nbsp;Aquascape<b> 6.30</b> Zeimaam <b>7.00</b> Atletico <b>7.30</b> Mary Somerville <b>8.00</b> Parknacilla <b>8.30</b>&nbsp;Jeweller&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><i>Tips by Greg Wood</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Dee Ex Bee, the runner-up behind Stradivarius in three of the summer\u2019s top staying events, seems likely to be the first big name to be ruled out of Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday following the track\u2019s decision to switch three races on the \u00a34.5m card to its hurdles course after persistent rain left the main Flat course waterlogged. Champions Day is the richest one\u2011day meeting of the Flat season in Britain with nearly \u00a34.5m on offer on a six-race card that includes four Group One contests. However its scheduling in mid-October has resulted in four of the eight renewals since its founding in 2011 being staged on soft ground, with two more on good-to-soft and only two on a surface quicker than good. Dee Ex Bee has winning form on heavy ground as a juvenile but is now almost certain to sidestep the Group Two Long Distance Cup, for which he was the 7-1 third-favourite on Wednesday morning. \u201cHe\u2019s highly unlikely to run,\u201d Mark Johnston, Dee Ex Bee\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cIn fact, I can virtually say he won\u2019t run. I think he would probably handle the ground as well as any of them, but we\u2019re not going to take the risk. We want to end on a reasonably high note for the season, not going round on a jumps course. \u201cIt [the switch in tracks] is hardly ideal, and we wouldn\u2019t want a slog on the last day of the season. We\u2019ve had a great year. It\u2019s been frustrating that he hasn\u2019t won a Group One but this isn\u2019t a Group One anyway. To run in a Group Two in what could be borderline raceable conditions is not what we should be doing with the horse.\u201d In addition to the Long Distance Cup, the Qipco Champion Stakes and the Champion Fillies &amp; Mares Stakes will switch to the inner track, while the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and the Champions Sprint will remain on Ascot\u2019s straight course, where the going is currently heavy. There was only 3mm of rain at Ascot on Wednesday but showers are forecast and Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, said that there had been little choice but to turn to their contingency plan for Saturday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThere were small patches of false waterlogged ground around Swinley Bottom,\u201d Stickels said, \u201cand given the forecast, we wanted to make it clear for everybody.

When voters are asked if they are satisfied with how Boris Johnson is handling Brexit, he gets a net satisfaction rating of -9 (satisfied minus dissatisfied). That is not great, but it is better than his ratings in August and September.</p> \n  <p>However, it is far better than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s rating on the same measure. His net Brexit satisfaction score is -57. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is on -33 and Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is on -23.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a99d56be0efa0a85da7b6701c8868cfbcfeca03\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a99d56be0efa0a85da7b6701c8868cfbcfeca03/0_0_1257_704/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling - leaders and Brexit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"560\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling - leaders and Brexit</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ipsos MORI</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Johnson even beats Corbyn when people are asked if they trust leaders to tell the truth. He has a three-point lead over Corbyn on \u201ctells the truth in general\u201d (22% over 19%) and an eight-point lead over Corbyn on \u201ctells the truth about Brexit\u201d (23% over 15%).</p> \n  <p>This is remarkable because it is very hard to square with any reasonable assessment of the two men\u2019s honesty. Johnson has twice been sacked from jobs for lying, and he is widely seen as someone who is cavalier about the truth. He was described as \u201cthe father of lies\u201d recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/18/father-of-lies-supreme-court-prorogation-boris-johnson\">in no less a venue than the supreme court.</a> By contrast, at Westminster Corbyn is generally seen as someone who is not prone to dissembling and who finds it hard to say something he does not mean.</p> \n  <p>These figures also suggest that the entire, ongoing three-year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/18/boris-johnson-350-million-claim-bogus-foreign-secretary\">demolition of Johnson\u2019s \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350m a week\u201d claim</a> by the fact-checking lobby has been in vain.</p> \n  <p>One explanation for Corbyn\u2019s appalling performance on this measure might be that voters detect the inherent contradiction in a lifelong opponent of the EU leading a pro-European party (although, to be fair, Corbyn has never pretended to be a huge fan of EU membership). Another explanation might be that these figures are a consequence of Corbyn\u2019s overall approval ratings being lower than Johnson\u2019s.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a232e55b41ac747cb28d4a0a2bc0ec4950232503\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a232e55b41ac747cb28d4a0a2bc0ec4950232503/0_0_1270_687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling - leaders and trust\" width=\"1000\" height=\"541\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling - leaders and trust</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ipsos MORI</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T15:57:28.917Z\">at 4.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5da71e1d8f083d8b3b9dd049\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T13:50:30.482Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tusk says 'everything should be clear' by tonight</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the full quote from <strong>Donald Tusk</strong>, president of the European council.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Theoretically in seven to eight hours everything should be clear.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Tusk was speaking to journalists in comments broadcast on private news channel TVN 24.</p> \n  <p>Veteran Brexit observers will know that whenever anyone sets a deadline in this process, it tends to be missed.

But he did say, if there were an agreement, he would expect to see it brought to the Commons on Saturday. When the presenter, <strong>Sarah Montague</strong>, asked a second time whether Bridgen was right, Benn replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are many MPs who are in favour of a confirmatory referendum, as am I. If the government brings a deal before the house on Saturday, then it would not surprise me at all if an effort were made to say, OK, but subject to a confirmatory referendum.

The Scottish hearing has effectively been stayed pending the outcome of this week\u2019s negotiations with the EU.</p> \n  <p>The Benn act, passed with the support of Labour and the broader rebel alliance in parliament, states that the government must ask the EU for an extension if MPs do not approve a Brexit deal by 19 October.</p> \n  <p>Liberty launched its action last month after Johnson said he would flout the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act (also known as the \u201cBenn act\u201d).

But he sounded sceptical, particularly on the latest thinking on \u201cconsent\u201d. (Some commentary has implied that the most serious problems relate to customs, but Wilson\u2019s questioning implied consent could turn out to be more of a stumbling block.)</p> \n  <p>Here are the key points Wilson made.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wilson claimed that removing what was seen as the DUP veto over the arrangements would breach the Good Friday agreement (or the Belfast agreement, as unionists like Wilson call it)</strong>. The Northern Ireland assembly has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/03/what-are-the-concerns-over-stormonts-role-in-proposed-brexit-deal\">a \u201cpetition of concern\u201d process</a> that means key decisions have to have significant support from both unionists and nationalists in the assembly. In practice, this means the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in both get a veto. Sinn F\u00e9in wants Northern Ireland to be aligned with Ireland and the EU, and so in practice, when Boris Johnson put forward double-majority consent plans <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/836030/Explanatory_Note.pdf\">in his paper (pdf) </a>earlier this month, he was proposing a DUP veto. The Irish government and the non-unionist parties in Northern Ireland said this was unacceptable, and Johnson is now said to be looking at another \u201cconsent\u201d mechanism \u2013 perhaps a simple majority in the assembly. Wilson said this would be contrary to the Good Friday agreement, because the agreement includes the principle of \u201ccross-community consent\u201d. He said abandoning the current plan (ie, the one giving the DUP a veto) would be:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Not just against the spirit of the [Good Friday] agreement, but it is explicitly against the terms of the agreement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wilson repeatedly asked for an assurance that the government would not consent mechanism involving just a simple majority in the assembly. And he told Barclay:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What we are told time and time again in this committee [is that the Good Friday agreement] is an internationally binding agreement which, very clearly - in fact, in very explicit and detailed terms - sets out how cross-community support has to be measured in the the assembly. So all I want to hear from you today are that the terms of the Belfast agreement ... will be the terms on which consent for opting into arrangements which diminish the powers of the Northern Ireland assembly, which will treat Northern Ireland differently, to a certain extent, from the rest of the United Kingdom, that that consent by sought on the basis of the agreement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Barclay failed to give Wilson the assurance that he wanted. He just said the government was committed to the Good Friday agreement.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wilson said the plan being considered by the government would \u201cdiminish\u201d the powers of the Northern Ireland assembly.</strong> (See quote above.) He made this point even though the assembly has been suspended for almost three years.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he hoped the government was not planning to keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union for practical purposes.</strong> Talking about this idea, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I hope that first of all the government is not contemplating that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This sounded like a ritual objection. Everyone knows that is exactly what the government is now considering.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He quoted figures saying including Northern Ireland in the EU customs union for practical purposes could cost Northern Irish businesses an extra \u00a3500m.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He signalled that Northern Ireland businesses would expect compensation for these extra costs.</strong> Barclay said the government was planning a new deal for Northern Ireland, but that did not seem to satisfy Wilson.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wilson said he was worried EU state aid rules could prevent compensation being paid in these circumstances.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the suggestions that has been made is that, if there are additional costs, Northern Ireland could be compensated for those additional costs. If we sign up to abiding by some EU regulations, then state aid rules would apply and support could not be given to businesses which were caught with those additional costs.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Barclay did not specifically address this point, although he said the government wanted a new deal for Northern Ireland.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wilson demanded details of exactly what new infrastructure would be needed for imposing customs checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland would work.</strong> Barclay said he could not give details at this point.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T13:50:04.303Z\">at 2.50pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5da6f8e18f083d8b3b9dce47\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T11:04:58.921Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Stephen Barclay hearing is now over. </p> \n  <p>The most significant points were made not by Barclay himself, who studiously avoided saying anything very revealing about the detail of the ongoing Brexit talks, but by Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman.</p> \n  <p>I will post the key quotes in a moment, but the Times\u2019 <strong>Steven Swinford </strong>has the gist of it here.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1184423041872347137\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So while Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds are in No 10, Sammy Wilson is raising significant concerns:<br><br>* Consent *must* be based on cross-community double majority<br><br>* Deal will 'diminish' NI Assembly<br><br>* Customs checks will lead to 'impediments' to trade between GB &amp; NI</p>\u2014 Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1184423041872347137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 16, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5da6f4eb8f083d8b3b9dce21\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T10:48:16.624Z\">11.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: By Saturday will we have clarity on what infrastructure might be in place under these plans?</em></p> \n  <p>Barclay says the first thing to do is to get a deal.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap up this liveblog now and summarise an eventful day in Brexit history. Senior government figures have said there will be \u201cno deal\u201d on Wednesday night. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, attempted to secure backing from Tory Brexiters and the DUP as EU leaders spearheaded talks in Brussels, awaiting the green light to approve a deal before Thursday\u2019s summit. However, the DUP objected to several points in Johnson\u2019s agreement. In addition, an issue over VAT was said to be an obstacle in talks as Michel Barnier briefed EU27 ambassadors this evening. Johnson won the favour of hardline Eurosceptics, including MP Steve Baker. It is thought the prime minister could travel to Brussels early Thursday morning to secure his deal with EU leaders. Johnson is expected to try to pass the deal through parliament on Saturday. Jeremy Corbyn has been dealt a blow as veteran MP Dame Louise Ellman quit Labour accusing him of being a danger to Britain. Dame Louise, 73, who is Jewish, said she had been \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the \u201cgrowth of anti-Semitism\u201d in Labour in recent years. She tweeted: \u201cI have made the truly agonising decision to leave the Labour Party after 55 years. \u201cI can no longer advocate voting Labour when it risks Corbyn becoming PM.\u201d The Liverpool Riverside MP, who has been in the Party 55 years, added: \u201cI believe that Jeremy Corbyn is not fit to serve as our Prime Minister. \u201cWith a looming general election and the possibility of him becoming Prime Minister, I feel I have to take a stand.\u201d And she told the Times newspaper that if he became prime minister \u201cI believe that Jeremy Corbyn would be a danger to the country, a danger to the Jewish community as well, but a danger to the country too\u201d. With Tory Eurosceptics now on the Prime Minister\u2019s side, Mr Johnson is in a race against time to gain support from the DUP and get his deal through to the EU, as explained by Daniel Boffey. Labour MP Stella Creasy has raised suspicions that the DUP are striking a Brexit bargain with the government that will include an attempt to stop expected abortion rights in Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, was seen leaving No 10 shortly before 9pm. In need of a little light relief? Read John Crace\u2019s sketch on the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay: \u201cCalming to the point of comatose, each word more meaningless than the one before. \u201cBy the end of a sentence, you are far worse informed than if he had said nothing.\u201d The Leader of the Independent Group for Change and former Conservative Anna Soubry has described the amount of time MPs would have to scrutinise Boris Johnson\u2019s prospective deal on Saturday as \u201cplain wrong\u201d. While the ERG appear to be rallying behind Johnson and his deal, the PM has to convince the 21 MPs he expelled from the party. If Boris Johnson manages to bring back a deal from Brussels, shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said she expects Labour would support any amendment put forward in the Commons to attach a confirmatory referendum to that deal. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil Show, she added: \u201cThe expectation would be that should a deal be tabled on Saturday, and we don\u2019t know that is going to happen, I am as sure as you can be that there will be an amendment tabled that would want to see a referendum attached to the deal.\u201d Asked if Labour would support this, she said: \u201cI would expect us to support that, yes.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019d rather have a general election but we are not in control of this unfortunately. \u201cSo should that opportunity come, on Saturday, to have that referendum on the deal \u2013 the deal that we don\u2019t know yet is going to be there. \u201cBut should that happen \u2026 in the circumstance I think there is an opportunity there and the pragmatic, sensible thing for the Labour party to do, given that we\u2019ve been asking for this, would be to take that opportunity.\u201d Even if Boris Johnson managed to pull off a Brexit deal, he would still have other problems on his plate as this story on the latest developments on the Arcuri saga by Matthew Weaver shows. Here\u2019s our take on how ERG chair Steve Baker and his allies are warming to a deal after Boris Johnson promised them the UK would leave the customs union and secure a quick free trade deal with the EU. Asked whether there could be a Brexit extension, MP Steve Baker said Boris Johnson confirmed the UK will leave the EU on 31 October. Baker said: \u201cMy sense is we really must see the text, time is becoming very short for everybody.\u201d \u201cThe prime minister has been absolutely clear \u2013 we are leaving on the 31st of October.\u201d Chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) Steve Baker said \u201cgreat progress\u201d has been made in talks with No 10. Speaking to Sky News after a meeting in Downing Street, Baker said: \u201cWe have made great progress in our discussions with No 10,\u201d adding: \u201cReally at this point, it just remains to wish the prime minister every possible success as he goes to negotiate for our country.\u201d Asked if he would back a deal, he said: \u201cI know everybody is desperate for us to say whether we can vote for it but until we can see it, we can\u2019t say.\u201d He added: \u201cWe really must see the text in time to read it in order to vote on Saturday. \u201cTime is becoming very short for everyone now. As Michel Barnier famously said, \u2018the clock is ticking\u2019. \u201cWe need to get through this (European) council, have the text of the deal, have the implementing legislation ready, and we need to be voting on that on Saturday.\u201d Two government sources said there would not be a deal on Wednesday night, although talks will continue. No 10 refused to confirm Boris Johnson\u2019s travel plans for the summit on Thursday, but he could go earlier than usual if it were felt his presence could help move stalled talks along. The anti-Brexit campaigner Jo Maugham QC has announced plans to launch a legal action in an attempt to ban the government from putting the withdrawal agreement before parliament. Quoting a source from No 10, the Sun\u2019s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, has said there will be no deal tonight as government talks are still taking place. Michel Barnier has arrived at a meeting of EU ambassadors in the Europa building in Brussels to brief them on the latest developments in London, reports the Guardian\u2019s Daniel Boffey in Brussels. \u201cHe said nothing to reporters. The deal is done. And all depends on London giving the green light. All that stands in the way of leaders signing off on Thursday are the DUP\u2019s objections,\u201d his report said. At the same time, Downing Street is playing down expectations of a deal being done tonight. Talk of hundreds of millions, if not billions, going the way of Northern Ireland as part of a sweetener for the DUP has piqued the interest of many, though the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry vents the anger of Scottish nationalists here. And one view \u2013 from Irish economist and commentator David Williams \u2013 of the so-called bung that might be headed Northern Ireland\u2019s way \u2026 In Toulouse, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said this evening that she believed it was the \u201cfinal sprint\u201d for negotiations and she was \u201cincreasingly of the belief\u201d that an agreement would be reached with the UK. Merkel said she wanted every success for the agreement and paid tribute to Michel Barnier\u2019s negotiations. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: \u201cI share everything the chancellor has said. \u201cIt\u2019s our hope and will to be able to endorse an agreement, and I hope that agreement will be found in the coming hours.\u201d He said he had heard positive things today. \u201cI thank Michel Barnier for negotiating with a great deal of seriousness and in respect of our member states,\u201d Macron said. \u201cI hope we succeed in getting an agreement on withdrawal and on the political declaration on the future relationship. \u201cWe\u2019re determined that that agreement can be endorsed at the European council.\u201d While you\u2019re waiting for the (blue and yellow? Red, white and blue?) smoke, you might want to have a listen to the Guardian Politics Weekly podcast. Heather Stewart is joined by Katy Hayward, James McGrory and Torsten Bell to discuss whether or not Boris Johnson has prevented the UK from crashing out of the EU. Kate Proctor also reports from the SNP conference, where there were fresh calls for a second Scottish independence referendum. In the absence of any clear briefings or announcements, the battle for the narrative is continuing on Twitter, with Jeffrey Donaldson stepping up as the latest DUP figure to push back on suggestions his party is split. Donaldson was pushing back against BuzzFeed reports that DUP opposition to Downing Street proposals was not based on customs but the principle of consent. Alex Wickham reports: \u201cThe issue is of primary concern for the DUP in terms of domestic politics ahead of the next election, but a Stormont veto on future customs arrangements is likely to remain unacceptable to the EU, one of the sources said.\u201d The latest from the man who moves markets, RT\u00c9\u2019s Europe editor, Tony Connelly, has it that all outstanding issues in the Brexit negotiations have been resolved, with the exception of how VAT will be treated in Northern Ireland. In a piece for the RT\u00c9 news website, he said two senior EU sources have said the main stumbling block to an agreement has been removed, with the DUP accepting the latest proposals on consent. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has been with with Macron today has also indicated that she is hopeful for a deal. Both leaders were keen to demonstrate the solidity of the French-German relationship at a meeting Toulouse, one day before a key EU summit that may approve what ever deal emerges (if it does) tonight. \u201cThe final sprint\u201d was how Merkel put it, according to Andrew Connell, a Sky news producer. Both leaders started with a visit to the headquarters of plane-maker Airbus, widely seen as a symbol of European industrial cooperation, near the city of Toulouse. The company, which is holding its 50th anniversary celebrations this year, has production and manufacturing facilities in countries including Germany, Spain and Britain. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has been speaking and says he \u201cwants to believe\u201d an agreement on Brexit is being finalised by negotiators in Brussels. Speaking in Toulouse, he said \u201cI want to believe that a deal is being finalised and that we can approve it tomorrow [Thursday],\u201d when EU leaders are meeting Boris Johnson. There are few things more pleasurable in politics than being able to say \u2018I told you so\u2019 and when Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU who has become one of the most compelling critics of the Brexit process, gave evidence to the Commons European scrutiny this afternoon, he got the opportunity. Rogers said, in the autumn of 2016, soon after the vote to leave the EU, ministers told him that a free-trade agreement would be in place the day after Brexit. He said: I was preoccupied by ministers telling me \u2018don\u2019t worry Ivan, you don\u2019t understand,\u2019 and they did say to me repeatedly, \u2018you don\u2019t understand, we\u2019re going to have a trade deal in place with the European Union on the day after exit\u2019. And I said \u2018with the greatest of respects, we\u2019re not.\u2019 And I think I\u2019m proven right. Rogers does not seem to have named the credulous ministers (I\u2019m just reading the Press Association copy), but it is a matter of public record that David Davis wrote a ConservativeHome article saying that \u201cthe new trade agreements will come into force at the point of exit from the EU\u201d just before he was appointed Brexit secretary in July 2016. Rogers also criticised the decision of the Boris Johnson government to stop attending some meetings in Brussels even before the UK left. He said: After you leave, you are in this transition ... which may last a year or it may last two or three years. You are still hugely impacted by everything going on in those rooms. Why would you leave those rooms before you have to? The idea that they are liberated off that and go and work on exciting new trade deals. No, they\u2019re not, they\u2019re still living in Brussels and they\u2019re either attending the working group that they used to be in or doing some other business. And some of the other business is finding out what the hell happened in the room when they weren\u2019t there. It doesn\u2019t strike me as a terribly sensible thing to do. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Ben Quinn is taking over now. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford The DUP are going back into Downing Street for further talks tonight, we\u2019ve been told. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Sammy Wilson, the DUP Brexit spokesman, argued this morning that abandoning the plan that would effectively give the DUP a veto over new arrangements would breach the Good Friday agreement and its commitment to the principle of \u201ccross-community consent\u201d. (See 12.39pm.) In the Irish parliament today Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM), described this aspect of the Good Friday agreement as a \u201cflaw\u201d. He was not making a point about Brexit per se, but responding to a question from the Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, who complained that the system for cross-party consent involves members of the legislative assembly having to register themselves as unionist, nationalist or other. Varadkar said the use of the category other in this context was pejorative because \u201cit doesn\u2019t describe that growing identity in Northern Ireland, that centre ground of people who see themselves as being both British and Irish\u201d. He added: One of the real flaws in double majorities in the system of cross community consent is not just that it allows one community or one party within that community to have a veto, it totally discounts and reduces to nothing the votes of those who designated as others. That is something that has developed as a flaw and one that I am very aware of. From Reuters\u2019 Andy Bruce This is what the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalist about today\u2019s cabinet. The prime minister gave an update to cabinet on the progress in the ongoing Brexit talks. He said there was a chance of securing a good deal but we are not there yet and there remain outstanding issues. Following a positive discussion, cabinet gave the PM its full support in the government\u2019s continuing efforts to secure a deal ahead of European council. Asked if the issue of consent was the main stumbling block to a Brexit deal, the spokesman said: \u201cI think there are a number of outstanding issues.\u201d Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter and vice chair of the European Research Group (which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexiter), told reporters after the 1922 Committee meeting that the ERG would take the views of the DUP \u201cstrongly into account\u201d when deciding whether or not to back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. He said: What we have said consistently the ERG and DUP have always been strong allies. We\u2019ve been friends throughout this process. We talk to each other all the time. It is not axiomatic we would follow whatever the DUP do but particularly on anything that relates to Northern Ireland we would take their views very strongly into account. Boris Johnson is fond of Mount Everest similes. He also called his close friend Jennifer Arcuri (who has refused to comment on speculation they had an affair when he was London mayor) \u201cthe Mount Everest every man wants to climb\u201d, according to her account. Boris Johnson told Tory MPs that the government was \u201con the Hillary Step\u201d in relation to the Brexit talks, referring to what was famous as the most perilous part of the route up Everest. But, according to Wikipedia, the Hillary Step was destroyed in an earthquake four years ago. And here are some tweets about Boris Johnson told the 1922 Committee from journalists in the corridor outside. Boris Johnson has been speaking to the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee. But he was not there for long. Only five minutes, or eight minutes, or 10 minutes - the lobby can\u2019t agree. Whatever, he wasn\u2019t there for long. Normally when the PM attends a meeting of the 1922, the session lasts for around an hour. Downing Street has announced that it has tabled a motion for the House of Commons and the House of Lords to sit on Saturday, from 9.30am until 2pm. MPs are due to vote on the motion tomorrow. But if the government decided at the last minute not to go ahead with the Saturday sitting (because the deal did not materialise), it could decide not to move the motion tomorrow (which would mean it did not get put to a vote). From ITV\u2019s Joe Pike When Theresa May was prime minister she told MPs that she was opposed to the EU\u2019s original plan for a Northern Ireland-only backstop because no British prime minister could accept a customs border of that kind down the Irish Sea. The quote will come back to haunt her if Boris Johnson does negotiate a deal that would in practice keep Northern Ireland in the customs union. May told MPs in February 2018: The draft legal text the commission have published would, if implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, and no UK prime minster could ever agree to it. Boris Johnson faces the same problem because, as the People\u2019s Vote campaign points out, he also said that no Conservative government could sign up to a plan that would impose customs controls between Britain and Northern Ireland. What makes this particularly awkward for him is that he made this comment in a speech to the DUP annual conference in November 2018. He said: If we wanted to do free trade deals, if we wanted to cut tariffs ... if we wanted to vary our regulation then we would have to leave Northern Ireland behind as an economic semi-colony of the EU and we would be damaging the fabric of the union with regulatory checks and even customs controls between Great Britain and Northern Ireland \u2013 on top of those extra regulatory checks down the Irish Sea that are already envisaged in the withdrawal agreement. Now I have to tell you, no British Conservative government could or should sign up to any such arrangement. Here is the clip. You might be tempted to see this as another Boris Johnson Brexit lie (see 3.36pm), but breaking a promise is not the same as saying something you know to be untrue (although both are offences against trust). Here is the full version of what Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said in remarks broadcast on TV about the Brexit talks. Theoretically in seven to eight hours everything should be clear. It is still undergoing changes and the basic foundations of this agreement are ready and theoretically we could accept a deal tomorrow ... Yesterday evening I was ready to bet on it ... today again certain doubts have appeared from the British side ... Everything is going in the right direction, but you will have noticed yourselves that with Brexit and above all with our British partners anything is possible. And here is the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on cabinet. From RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly This afternoon\u2019s cabinet is over. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby has some lines from ministers as they were coming out. Ipsos MORI has also published some polling on Brexit today. Its headline finding is that the people think a no-deal Brexit is more likely than an election, a deal, a second referendum or the UK staying in the EU. But what is likely to attract most interest at Westminster is what the polling says about party leaders and Brexit. When voters are asked if they are satisfied with how Boris Johnson is handling Brexit, he gets a net satisfaction rating of -9 (satisfied minus dissatisfied). That is not great, but it is better than his ratings in August and September. However, it is far better than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s rating on the same measure. His net Brexit satisfaction score is -57. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is on -33 and Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is on -23. Johnson even beats Corbyn when people are asked if they trust leaders to tell the truth. He has a three-point lead over Corbyn on \u201ctells the truth in general\u201d (22% over 19%) and an eight-point lead over Corbyn on \u201ctells the truth about Brexit\u201d (23% over 15%). This is remarkable because it is very hard to square with any reasonable assessment of the two men\u2019s honesty. Johnson has twice been sacked from jobs for lying, and he is widely seen as someone who is cavalier about the truth. He was described as \u201cthe father of lies\u201d recently in no less a venue than the supreme court. By contrast, at Westminster Corbyn is generally seen as someone who is not prone to dissembling and who finds it hard to say something he does not mean. These figures also suggest that the entire, ongoing three-year demolition of Johnson\u2019s \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350m a week\u201d claim by the fact-checking lobby has been in vain. One explanation for Corbyn\u2019s appalling performance on this measure might be that voters detect the inherent contradiction in a lifelong opponent of the EU leading a pro-European party (although, to be fair, Corbyn has never pretended to be a huge fan of EU membership). Another explanation might be that these figures are a consequence of Corbyn\u2019s overall approval ratings being lower than Johnson\u2019s. Here is the full quote from Donald Tusk, president of the European council. Theoretically in seven to eight hours everything should be clear. Tusk was speaking to journalists in comments broadcast on private news channel TVN 24. Veteran Brexit observers will know that whenever anyone sets a deadline in this process, it tends to be missed. In fact, you don\u2019t have to be a veteran Brexit watcher; anyone reading this blog only yesterday will recall Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, being quoted as saying that the UK and the EU would have to agree legal text by last night for a deal to be possible at this week\u2019s summit. That legal text has still not been finalised, but the negotiators have not given up hope of there being some agreement at the EU summit. From Sky News Here is the full text of Leo Varadkar\u2019s statement to Irish MPs about the EU summit starting tomorrow. The Irish taoiseach (PM) said he still thought a Brexit deal was possible, but he could not say when. Here is the key passage. I do not think it would be helpful today to say too much about the precise state of play of the discussions or the exact timeframe in which an agreement may be possible. I said last week that I thought that there was a pathway to a possible agreement. That is still my view. However, the question is whether the negotiators will be able to bridge the remaining gaps in advance of tomorrow\u2019s council. What\u2019s important now is that all focus is kept on achieving a deal that delivers for everyone. This is from Sky\u2019s Stephen Murphy. From Reuters\u2019 Peter Thal Larsen Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has dismissed the report from RT\u00c9\u2019s Tony Connelly (see 1.28pm) saying her party has agreed to what is being proposed on consent. On the World at One Andrew Bridgen, one of the 28 Tory \u201cSpartans\u201d who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, said he thought the pro-remain opposition would try to seize control of the Commons timetable for Saturday to allow MPs to vote for a referendum on any Brexit deal secured by Boris Johnson. He said: What they want is to humiliate the prime minister by preventing him from even bringing forward a vote on his deal, and forcing him to send the letter in line with the Benn act ... They may well bring forward a confirmatory referendum which, in my view, would be disastrous. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, was interviewed on the programme immediately after Bridgen. Asked if he knew whether what Bridgen was saying about opposition plans was correct, Benn at first did not answer the question directly. But he did say, if there were an agreement, he would expect to see it brought to the Commons on Saturday. When the presenter, Sarah Montague, asked a second time whether Bridgen was right, Benn replied: There are many MPs who are in favour of a confirmatory referendum, as am I. If the government brings a deal before the house on Saturday, then it would not surprise me at all if an effort were made to say, OK, but subject to a confirmatory referendum. That is not a surprise to anyone given the growing support that there is for that idea. Asked whether that would involve opposition MPs trying to take control of the order paper (by using standing order 24), as opposed to just tabling a confirmatory referendum amendment, Benn said that would depend on how the government planned to organise the vote for Saturday. Earlier I quoted some ComRes polling claiming that more than half of voters want the UK to leave the EU. Other pollsters have criticised the way ComRes presented those findings, arguing that it was misleading because people were asked to choose between three options, not two. I have posted an updated at 9.56am explaining this. You may need to refresh the page to get it to appear. It wouldn\u2019t be Brexit if we didn\u2019t have a contrary view. This is from the Atlantic\u2019s Tom McTague. From RT\u00c9\u2019s Tony Connelly A fresh legal challenge to prevent the prime minister crashing out of the EU without a deal is to be heard in the London courts on Friday, the civil rights organisation Liberty has revealed. The judicial review action, similar to the case already heard in Edinburgh, is an attempt to ensure that Boris Johnson respects the Benn act and seeks an extension to UK membership in the absence of an agreement with Brussels. The case is due to be heard on Friday before three senior judges in the court of appeal. As well as Liberty, the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has also submitted an application on behalf of three low-paid workers who, it is said, will suffer if there is a no-deal Brexit. Confirmation of the hearing signals a fresh round of Brexit-related legal battles in the courts. The Scottish hearing has effectively been stayed pending the outcome of this week\u2019s negotiations with the EU. The Benn act, passed with the support of Labour and the broader rebel alliance in parliament, states that the government must ask the EU for an extension if MPs do not approve a Brexit deal by 19 October. Liberty launched its action last month after Johnson said he would flout the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act (also known as the \u201cBenn act\u201d). The English courts have been significantly slower than their Scottish counterparts in agreeing to hear the claim. In her speech the former prime minister Theresa May said she was \u201ca little concerned\u201d by reports that the government will have different immigration rules for different regions of the country after Brexit. She said the idea that visas could be issued on condition that people went to work in a particular part of the country sounded like a system for \u201cregional visas\u201d. She went on: I would urge [Priti Patel, the home secretary] to look very carefully at how that can operate logistically because it has some very real challenges. And, indeed, I hear from the SNP benches some muttering that it is an issue that has been rejected in the past by the independent migration advisory committee. In the opening of her speech Theresa May said government should not just be about positive headlines and great oratory, PoliticsHome\u2019s Matt Honeycombe-Foster reports. That will obviously be seen as a dig at her successor, Boris Johnson, who is far better than May ever was at coining \u201carresting phrases\u201d. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg The Times\u2019s Brussels correspondent Bruno Waterfield has posted a useful Twitter thread on the state of play in the Brexit talks. It starts here. This, from the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman, backs up the impression given by what Sammy Wilson was saying in the Commons Brexit committee hearing. (See 12.39am.) This is not May\u2019s first speech from the backbenches. She spoke recently in the second reading debate on the domestic abuse bill, which was her first Commons speech as a backbencher since her resignation in July. In the Commons Theresa May, the former prime minister, has just started speaking in the Queen\u2019s speech debate. At the moment she is having a go at Brexit - rehearsing the ancient arguments about whether the last Labour government spent too much ahead of the financial crash. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, used his questions to Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, in the Brexit committee hearing to spell out in some details the DUP\u2019s objections to the plan for a replacement to the backstop being negotiated by the UK and the EU. He did not say his party would oppose the plan (the full details of which have yet to be revealed) in all circumstances. But he sounded sceptical, particularly on the latest thinking on \u201cconsent\u201d. (Some commentary has implied that the most serious problems relate to customs, but Wilson\u2019s questioning implied consent could turn out to be more of a stumbling block.) Here are the key points Wilson made. Wilson claimed that removing what was seen as the DUP veto over the arrangements would breach the Good Friday agreement (or the Belfast agreement, as unionists like Wilson call it). The Northern Ireland assembly has a \u201cpetition of concern\u201d process that means key decisions have to have significant support from both unionists and nationalists in the assembly. In practice, this means the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in both get a veto. Sinn F\u00e9in wants Northern Ireland to be aligned with Ireland and the EU, and so in practice, when Boris Johnson put forward double-majority consent plans in his paper (pdf) earlier this month, he was proposing a DUP veto. The Irish government and the non-unionist parties in Northern Ireland said this was unacceptable, and Johnson is now said to be looking at another \u201cconsent\u201d mechanism \u2013 perhaps a simple majority in the assembly. Wilson said this would be contrary to the Good Friday agreement, because the agreement includes the principle of \u201ccross-community consent\u201d. He said abandoning the current plan (ie, the one giving the DUP a veto) would be: Not just against the spirit of the [Good Friday] agreement, but it is explicitly against the terms of the agreement. Wilson repeatedly asked for an assurance that the government would not consent mechanism involving just a simple majority in the assembly. And he told Barclay: What we are told time and time again in this committee [is that the Good Friday agreement] is an internationally binding agreement which, very clearly - in fact, in very explicit and detailed terms - sets out how cross-community support has to be measured in the the assembly. So all I want to hear from you today are that the terms of the Belfast agreement ... will be the terms on which consent for opting into arrangements which diminish the powers of the Northern Ireland assembly, which will treat Northern Ireland differently, to a certain extent, from the rest of the United Kingdom, that that consent by sought on the basis of the agreement. Barclay failed to give Wilson the assurance that he wanted. He just said the government was committed to the Good Friday agreement. Wilson said the plan being considered by the government would \u201cdiminish\u201d the powers of the Northern Ireland assembly. (See quote above.) He made this point even though the assembly has been suspended for almost three years. He said he hoped the government was not planning to keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union for practical purposes. Talking about this idea, he said: I hope that first of all the government is not contemplating that. This sounded like a ritual objection. Everyone knows that is exactly what the government is now considering. He quoted figures saying including Northern Ireland in the EU customs union for practical purposes could cost Northern Irish businesses an extra \u00a3500m. He signalled that Northern Ireland businesses would expect compensation for these extra costs. Barclay said the government was planning a new deal for Northern Ireland, but that did not seem to satisfy Wilson. Wilson said he was worried EU state aid rules could prevent compensation being paid in these circumstances. He said: One of the suggestions that has been made is that, if there are additional costs, Northern Ireland could be compensated for those additional costs. If we sign up to abiding by some EU regulations, then state aid rules would apply and support could not be given to businesses which were caught with those additional costs. Barclay did not specifically address this point, although he said the government wanted a new deal for Northern Ireland. Wilson demanded details of exactly what new infrastructure would be needed for imposing customs checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland would work. Barclay said he could not give details at this point. The Stephen Barclay hearing is now over. The most significant points were made not by Barclay himself, who studiously avoided saying anything very revealing about the detail of the ongoing Brexit talks, but by Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman. I will post the key quotes in a moment, but the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford has the gist of it here. Q: By Saturday will we have clarity on what infrastructure might be in place under these plans? Barclay says the first thing to do is to get a deal. After that, there will be an urgent need to bring the matter back to the Commons, and to then inform MPs. Q: Is it government policy to oppose customs checks in the Irish Sea? Barclay says the government says Northern Ireland must be part of UK customs territory. As for the details, those are part of the negotiations. It would be better to discuss them when there is \u201cfurther clarity\u201d, he says. In the Brexit committee Sammy Wilson, the DUP Brexit spokesman, is asking about customs arrangements. Q: What assessment has the government made of the impact of imposing EU tariffs on goods coming to Northern Ireland from Great Britain? Barclay says the negotiations are still ongoing. The government wants to understand the impact of any such plan. These ideas are subject to \u201clive discussions\u201d, he says. He says it would not be appropriate to go further. Q: Would Northern Ireland businesses be compensated? Barclay says the government has already proposed a new deal for Northern Ireland. This is part of the PM\u2019s desire to \u201clevel up\u201d those parts of the UK that are less prosperous. Jeremy Corbyn is playing down suggestions that he could remove the whip from any Labour MP who votes for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith reports. If Labour MPs were to lose the whip for voting with the government on this, they would be unable to stand for the party as a candidate at the next election. Nineteen Labour MPs recently signed an open letter saying that they were opposed to extending Brexit (Labour\u2019s official policy) and that they wanted to vote for a deal. No 10 hopes many or all of these MPs might back a deal, potentially compensating for the lack of DUP support. From my colleague Rowena Mason Back in the Commons Stephen Barclay claims that, if the UK leaves the EU this autumn, the negotiation of a future trade deal with the EU could conclude by the end of next year, when the transition is due to end. He says the political declaration will provide a framework for the future deal. And he says the trade negotiators will be able to meet more easily than in, for example, the EU-US trade talks, when negotiators had to fly over from America. From my colleague Daniel Boffey in Brussels This is from PoliticalPics, a Twitter account run by the photographer Steve Back, who regularly covers Downing Street. Back in the Commons committee Barclay says he cannot say what papers would be available to MPs before a possible Commons vote on Saturday. The Tory Richard Graham wanted to know if MPs would be able to read the text of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn Q: What engagement has the UK government had with the Scottish and Welsh governments this week about progress in the talks? Cherry says her suspicion is that there has been none. Barclay says he is not aware of the details, because he has been travelling, but he says he will write to the committee. Cherry says the Scottish and Welsh government are getting far less information than the DUP and the ERG, which have been called in to No 10. Barclay says the SNP has said it will vote against the deal anyway. Back in the Brexit committee the SNP MP Joanna Cherry, one of the people who took the government to court in Scotland seeking an assurance that Boris Johnson would obey the Benn act, is asking the questions now. Cherry asks Stephen Barclay if he agrees with the passage in the judgment from Lord Pentland, who said there was no need for the court to issue an order instructing the government to comply with the Benn act because the government had given assurances it would. Pentland said: I approach matters on the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do. Barclay said the government would obey the law, but he did not endorse Pentland\u2019s actual words. Q: Does the government have a plan to send two letters to the EU, one asking for an extension in line with the Benn act and another saying the government does not want an extension, as Andrea Leadsom suggests. Barclay said he was not aware of any plan to that effect. Barclays plays down suggestions government could use a \u201ctwo-letter\u201d strategy to sabotage the Benn act. These are from RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston say the DUP are going back to Downing Street for another meeting. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister), has been speaking this morning, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby reports. He said he had spoken to Boris Johnson and to the European commission this morning. He said that he was still confident but that there were \u201cmany issues\u201d to be resolved and that another EU summit later this month might be needed. The Tory Brexiter Craig Mackinlay goes next. He says he welcomes what the government is saying about the political declaration (covering the future relationship). There was too much \u201cvassalage\u201d in Theresa May\u2019s version, he says. Barclay says there is a \u201cshared desire\u201d with the EU to move on to that stage of the talks. Q: You and Michael Gove have both said you would back Theresa May\u2019s deal. But it would stop us negotiating good trade deals, wouldn\u2019t it? I am concerned about you thinking along those lines. Barclay says Boris Johnson has been clear about the kind of trade deal he is seeking. The former Tory cabinet minister Stephen Crabb goes next. Q: What makes this deal better than Theresa May\u2019s deal? Barclay says the key difference is that the Boris Johnson plan would be deliverable. Johnson is looking for something that would get through parliament. Q: So why were ERG (European Research Group) MPs so angry after being briefed in No 10 last night? Barclay says he cannot say, as he was not there. Q: Is it fair to say we are moving to a Northern Ireland-only backstop, not a UK-wide one? Barclay says the PM said in his letter to President Juncker earlier this month that the UK must leave the EU whole and entire. Q: Do you acccept, though, that Northern Ireland will be treated differently. Barclay says the sovereignty of the UK must be respected, and that includes in relation to the customs union. Q: Would you be comfortable with a short, technical extension to allow more time for the details to be finalised? No, says Barclay. He says the Commons can legislate quickly. These issues have been discussed extensively. No one thinks MPs have not had enough time to debate Brexit, he says. Barclay says he would oppose even a short, technical extension. Stephen Timms, the Labour MP, is asking the questions now. Q: HM Revenue and Customs says a no-deal Brexit would cost business \u00a315bn. Your party used to be opposed to burdens on business. Barclay says the government wants a deal. Q: Would the government help businesses cover these costs? Barclay repeats the point about wanting a deal. From Bloomberg\u2019s Dara Doyle Sammy Wilson is the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman. From Bloomberg\u2019s Nikos Chrysoloras These are from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From my colleague Daniel Boffey The Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns is asking questions now. She says she was critical of Theresa May\u2019s handling of Brexit (she is one of the 28 \u201cSpartans\u201d, who voted against May\u2019s deal three times) but she says she supports what Boris Johnson is doing. Q: Do you think the Benn act has weakened the government\u2019s negotiating stance? Barclay says it has been \u201cunhelpful\u201d. Benn is now asking questions about the plan for an alternative to the backstop published by Boris Johnson earlier this month. The government\u2019s explanation of those plans is here (pdf). Q: The plan says, if Northern Ireland withdraws consent, the customs rules default to existing rules. What are they? Barclay says they would be the rules that would be in place if there were no deal. Benn says that means there would be a hard border in Ireland. Q: How can the government propose something that would lead to a hard border, if Northern Ireland withdrew consent, when the UK government is opposed to a hard border? Barclay says the UK government is opposed to a hard border. It would not put up infrastructure at the border. Two Tory Brexiters on the committee, Craig Mackinlay and Andrea Jenkyns, complain about Benn\u2019s questioning, saying he is taking up too much time and could be seen as biased, because he put through the Benn Act. Benn asks Barclay how long it would take the government to pass the withdrawal agreement legislation if there is a deal. Barclay tells him that his own bill (the Benn Act - the law requiring the PM to request an extension if there is no deal) showed that it is possible for the Commons to pass legislation very quickly. Q: If there is no agreement reached, will the PM write the letter he has to send by the end of Saturday requesting a Brexit extension? Barclay says the PM will comply with the Benn Act, and with the undertakings given to the court in Scotland. Q: Why did the PM spend so long saying he wouldn\u2019t? Barclay says the government is committed to leaving by 31 October. Q: How will the UK leave the EU on 31 October if the PM sends the extension letter. The two things are incompatible. Barclay says there are a number of variables. The best way to leave on 31 October is to get a deal, he says. The government is \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to this. He says he had 11 bilateral meetings with counterparts in Luxembourg yesterday. Q: If the PM sends the letter, and the EU grants an extension until 31 January, we cannot leave on 31 October, can we? Barclay says Benn is getting \u201cseveral steps ahead\u201d. Barclay refuses to tell MPs how the government could meet its commitment to leave the EU by 31 October if it has to comply with the Benn Act. Q: Are you negotiating a revised political declaration with the EU? Yes, says Barclay. He says the UK and the EU are discussing revised text. Q: Would that be published at the same time as the revised text of the withdrawal agreement? Barclay says the government would want to give as much information to MPs as possible. Q: But MPs would be voting on both? Barclay says that is not necessarily the case. The third \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d was only on the withdrawal agreement (WA). The first two were on the WA and the political declaration. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. Hilary Benn, the committee chairs, asks if the Commons will meet on Saturday if there is no deal. Barclay says that will be something for Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, to announce. ComRes has released some Brexit polling this morning, which was commissioned for a Channel 5 programme going out tonight, Live Brexit Referendum. It was an unusually large poll, featuring 26,000 respondents. Most polls involve 1,000 or 2,000 people taking part. Here are the key findings. More than half of voters want the UK to abide by the referendum result and leave the EU, when don\u2019t knows are excluded, the poll suggests. Some 50% want the UK to leave the EU against 42% who want it to remain in. But, when don\u2019t knows are excluded, those figures amount to 54% for leave and 46% for remain. UPDATE: I have quoted the way ComRes presented these figures. But Anthony Wells, who works for YouGov, argues (persuasively) that these headline statistics are misleading. He explains here. The Irish agriculture minister, Michael Creed, said this morning there was some room for optimism in relation to Brexit. He said: This time last week we were probably engulfed in darkness and depression in the context of Brexit. There is some room for optimism now but we\u2019re not there yet. However I would countenance if we do get a deal in Brussels on Brexit we have been here before with the withdrawal agreement which didn\u2019t get through the House of Commons so there are some hurdles to be cleared yet and I\u2019m not underestimating those in any way. They are significant and reflective of the magnitude of the challenge but we remain hopeful. From Bloomberg\u2019s Nikos Chrysoloras The DUP is denying multiple reports this morning that it had been offered \u201cbillions\u201d in Downing St talks in the past two days. A DUP spokesman said: \u201cThis is categorically untrue and utter nonsense.\u201c The DUP secured \u00a31bn in investment for Northern Ireland as part of the confidence and supply deal with Theresa May after the 2017 election returned a hung parliament. Reports in Ireland suggest what might be on the table is a package involving the EU, Ireland and the UK. The EU has already promised it will continue, whatever the outcome of Brexit talks, the Peace IV programme which has invested millions in cross-community initiatives. Northern Ireland also benefits from the Interreg regional programme for bordering countries, which also includes Scotland. Those reports prompted this tweet last night from Nick Macpherson, a former permanent secretary to the Treasury. Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, has just told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics that he and his ERG colleagues have \u201ca number of concerns\u201d about what is being proposed by Boris Johnson. But he refused to give details. He also said that he would give \u201cvery strong weight\u201d to the views of the DUP when deciding whether or not to back any deal negotiated by Johnson (backing up what David Davis told the Today programme \u2013 see 9.03am.) He also said that, if no deal is agreed in Brussels this week, he would not expect the emergency sitting of the House of Commons planned for Saturday to go ahead. Asked if he would be willing to accept another extension, keeping the UK in the EU beyond 31 October (which many EU figures believe would be essential, even if a deal is agreed this week, to allow time for the details to be finalised), Francois did not firmly rule it out. But he said that most people in the country, particularly outside London, just wanted to see this matter sorted out. Francois is one of the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d \u2013 the 28 ERG Tories who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal on all three occasions. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, told the Today programme this morning that some Tory Brexiters would be strongly influenced by the DUP in deciding whether or not to back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. In an interview this morning the presenter Nick Robinson pointed out that the DUP have 10 votes in the Commons. Davis said that understated their influence. You said 10 votes, by the way earlier. Just as an aside on that, there will be quite a lot of Tory MPs who will take their line from what the DUP do. Davis said he would not decide himself whether or not to back any deal negotiated by Johnson until he had read the detail. But he would take note of the DUP position, he said: I will look at what they say. If the DUP says this is intolerable to us, that will be quite important. When it was put to him that, when he was Brexit secretary, he said he would not accept any part of the UK being treated differently, and that the Johnson deal will treat Northern Ireland differently (because for practical purposes it would be in the EU customs union), Davis replied: If we believe what we read, there is going to be complete openness between the British market, the rest of the UK market, and the Northern Ireland market for British goods sold in Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland goods sold in Britain. There would be a red channel, as it were, for outside goods. That\u2019s what we are told. So that preserves that bit of it. In terms of the union, we are not seeing a break-up of the union in those terms. Davis voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal in the first Commons \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. But in the two subsequent votes, he backed the deal. From Sky\u2019s Michelle Clifford A Number 10 source has told the Press Association that the talks in Brussels went on until 1.30am this morning. \u201cConstructive talks, worked into the night, continue to make progress, continue in the morning,\u201d the source said. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Sarah Marsh. We will be focusing exclusive on Brexit today. Here are the main events in the diary. 9.30am: Simon Byrne, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, gives evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland committee. 10am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. 10am: Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international trade committee. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 1pm (UK time): Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is due to brief EU ambassadors on the talks. 3.30pm: Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, gives evidence to the Commons European scrutiny committee. 4pm: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet 7.30pm: Johnson is due to address the Conservative 1922 Committee. That\u2019s it from me, I am handing over the live blog to Andrew Sparrow. There are multiple reports that the DUP is being offered a significant cash deal alongside the Brexit pact. The Financial Times is reporting sources as saying the DUP were being offered \u201cbillions not millions\u201d as a sweetener. The Irish Times also noted the offer of \u201ca multimillion-euro package of investment funded by the EU, London and Dublin\u201d. They are reporting indications that \u201cpolitical agreement had been reached on the main points and precise details were being worked through\u201d. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston said Downing Street sources were downbeat about a deal. The issue seems to be what is on the table is not going to get the support of the DUP. The DUP\u2019s Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds had a second 90-minute briefing with Downing Street officials last night but declined to comment. A spokesman said \u201cit would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required\u201d. British and EU negotiators are to press on with more talks in Brussels this morning to try and reach a new withdrawal agreement before a summit of EU leaders tomorrow. The EU chief negotiator suggested a deal had to be reached by 11pm UK time to be approved at the summit. With just two weeks until the UK\u2019s scheduled withdrawal from the European Union on 31 October, the National Audit Office (NAO) said that mitigating the risks was now, to some extent, out of the government\u2019s control. The most significant risks to the operation of the border remain business-readiness, EU member states imposing controls, and arrangements for the Northern Ireland and Ireland land border. In its report, the NAO said the government has made progress with putting in place the systems, infrastructure and resources required to manage the border if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 31 October, but said \u201cthere is still some work to do to finalise arrangements in the short time that remains and bringing all these elements together for the first time in a live environment carries inherent risk\u201d. The report adds: \u201cIt is impossible to know exactly what would happen at the border in the event of no deal on October 31 2019.\u201d A delegation of cross-party MPs led by Dominic Grieve is heading to Brussels this morning for a series of meetings with EU diplomats. The delegation is believed to include the Labour MP David Lammy, the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas, the former Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, the leader of Plaid Cymru in the House of Commons, Liz Saville Roberts, and Peter Grant of the SNP. They are not meeting EU officials but have a round of meetings with ambassadors for various EU countries. Grant said in a tweet they were going \u201cto ask the EU not to let Johnston [sic] crash us out without a deal\u201d. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has renewed calls for a second referendum, saying that what Boris Johnson is considering could be \u201cworse for the economy than the hit during the financial crisis\u201d. Swinson said that any deal done in Brussels should be put back to the people for a vote. The government is desperate to try to create a deal no matter how demanding that will be for our country. Let\u2019s be clear at what it looks like [Johnson is] considering, which is some kind of free trade agreement ... [That could be] worse for our economy than the hit during the financial crash. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Swinson went on: There is no deal that is better than deal we have as members EU. We will not support any deal but what we want to happen ... is that whatever Brexit deal is negotiated is put to people so the public can have the final say. Brexit negotiations are to continue on a final day of efforts to get a deal ready for a crucial EU summit, after Tuesday\u2019s talks ran into the small hours of the morning. Time is running out for Boris Johnson to get an agreement in place so it can be approved at the Brussels summit starting on Thursday. Reports had suggested a deal was close ahead of a midnight deadline imposed by the EU, with the prime minister said to be making major concessions on the Irish border. But sources on both sides downplayed this, and Johnson\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cTalks remain constructive but there is more work still to do.\u201d That\u2019s it from me, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Sarah Marsh. Jo Swinson is doing the rounds of breakfast media this morning. She just appeared on BBC Breakfast talking about palns to push for a people\u2019s vote and will be on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme at 7:20am. How the papers covered it The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Kate Proctor reports that the Liberal Democrats will try to push MPs to a fresh vote on a second Brexit referendum next week. The party has tabled an amendment to the Queen\u2019s speech requesting that any deal brought back from Brussels by the prime minister is put to another public vote. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, said: The Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of remain and have been the leading voice in the People\u2019s Vote campaign. Boris Johnson is determined to have a general election, but the best way to resolve the Brexit chaos is to have a people\u2019s vote and give the British people the final say about their future. The best deal we have is as members of the European Union and we want to give the people the chance to choose to stop Brexit. Full story here. At the heart of all this is the Irish border. Here\u2019s our explainer on the issue in relation to Brexit. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political happenings. It\u2019s a pleasure to be with you on the day in which a draft text of a Brexit agreement might, possibly, who knows, finally be published. Johnson appeared to be on the brink of reaching a Brexit deal yesterday after making major concessions to the EU over the issue of the Irish border. If Downing Street gives the final green light, the agreement could be published today, though it will still have to be voted on in parliament, and the deal, which is understood to include a customs border down the Irish Sea, would be unlikely to appeal to the DUP. Yesterday, Michel Barnier had set Johnson a deadline of midnight Wednesday to concede to EU demands and agree to a customs border in the Irish Sea or be left with nothing to take to the Commons. The prime minister will brief his cabinet on the situation at 4pm on Wednesday before addressing a scheduled meeting of the 1922 Committee in the evening. Until then, we will be bringing you the news as it breaks. Thanks for following along. As always, please get in touch via Twitter or email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). I\u2019ll be at the helm of the blog for the next hour or so before I hand over to my wonderful colleagues.",

Officers from the Catalan force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, were reported to have fired teargas and run over two protesters during clashes that quickly spread after a earlier demonstration turned into a series of running battles with police. Police claimed that projectiles had been fired at helicopters. Roger Torrent, the speaker of the Catalan parliament, condemned the violence, tweeting: \u201cThese actions don\u2019t represent us. We must distance ourselves from violent behaviour.\u201d As television news broadcast footage of blazing barricades and protesters hurling projectiles at riot police, Spain\u2019s prime minister warned that his government will not be provoked into overreacting. In a televised address, Pedro S\u00e1nchez called on the pro-independence Catalan president, Quim Torra, to unequivocally condemn the use of violence. Referring to the regional government\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to secure independence, S\u00e1nchez added: \u201cNo leader can camouflage their failure behind curtains of smoke and fire.\u201d S\u00e1nchez said the government would defend Spain\u2019s constitution and peaceful coexistence but would not be tempted into inflaming tensions. \u201cThe state will always guarantee the rights of those who wish to protest their ideas peacefully,\u201d he said. \u201cBut organised violent groups and those who try to break democratic laws will not achieve their aims \u2026 The only hope of those violent groups is that we\u2019ll make mistakes and become over-excited and divided.

Earlier on Wednesday, the nine jailed leaders had issued a joint plea for peaceful protests after the Spanish government warned any further violence would be met with a \u201cfirm, proportional and united\u201d response. The nine called for a huge but peaceful response to their imprisonment. \u201cAll support to mobilisations and massive and peaceful marches,\u201d wrote the nine, who include the former regional vice-president Oriol Junqueras and two influential grassroots leaders, Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart. \u201cNo violence represents us.\u201d On Tuesday, peaceful demonstrations in Barcelona gave way to running battles with the police, 24 hours after thousands of pro-independence protesters attempted to shut down Barcelona airport, leading to police charges. The Spanish government said 51 people had been arrested across Catalonia on Monday and Tuesday, and 54 officers from the regional police force and 18 from the national force had been injured. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s caretaker government has already said it could activate article 155 of the constitution, which would allow it to suspend the regional government and assume direct rule of the region. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s rightwing opponents are calling for the government to take a hard line on the latest eruption of the regional independence crisis. Spain is due to hold its fourth general election in as many years on 10 November. The latest unrest began on Monday after Spain\u2019s supreme court acquitted the nine defendants of the charge of violent rebellion but convicted them variously of sedition, misuse of public funds and disobedience over their parts in the push to secede from Spain. Junqueras was jailed for 13 years, while S\u00e0nchez and Cuixart received nine-year sentences. The six others were given terms of between 10 and a half and 12 years.

      "bodyText": "Labour MP Stella Creasy has accused the government of preparing to hand back control of abortion rights to Stormont to help curry favour with the DUP at a critical moment in the Brexit talks. Creasy led a successful push in the Commons earlier this year to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland \u2013 the only part of the UK where it remains illegal except in a very narrow set of circumstances. MPs amended the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill, to say that the government in Westminster would be required to extend the right to abortion if the Northern Ireland assembly and executive at Stormont are not up and running by 21 October. Another amendment imposed the same requirement in respect of same-sex marriage. With just days to go before that deadline, the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, has spent much of the past few days locked in discussions with all the political parties at Stormont. Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker, speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday evening, hinted the government believes the devolved institutions could soon be restored. \u201cThe British and Irish governments both share the view that there remains an opportunity in the coming days to reach an accommodation,\u201d he said. He said that if the assembly and the executive are not up and running by Monday\u2019s deadline, the government will extend rights to abortion and same sex marriage to Northern Ireland, as required by the act. But he insisted, \u201cthis would not be a good outcome\u201d, saying it would be better for the decisions to be made by the devolved institutions. \u201cOne only has to look at the passionate and sincere demonstrations in recent weeks on both sides of this issue to appreciate that this remains a highly sensitive matter in Northern Ireland. \u201cI understand that there are many people in Northern Ireland who may welcome the change. There are also many who would not. I would prefer, and the government would prefer, that the Northern Ireland assembly was considering reforms of Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion law.\u201d However, Creasy claimed handing control back to Stormont would be in contravention of the act, which places an obligation on the secretary of state to ensure the recommendations of a report by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women be extended to Northern Ireland. \u201cThe act specifically says the regulations that enable abortion rest with Secretary of State and are a human rights issue. For the assembly to take over the responsibility will require change to that,\u201d she said. She tweeted that the government was using women as \u201cbargaining chips\u201d. The DUP, which describes itself as a \u201cpro-life party\u201d, has expressed concerns about the extension of abortion rights; and the party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, joined a demonstration outside Stormont on the issue last month. In an article published shortly afterwards, she said the party\u2019s position on the issue was \u201cresolute and unchanged,\u201d and insisted the planned liberalisation of abortion law was \u201cfar beyond anything any Northern Ireland assembly would ever have endorsed\u201d. With Boris Johnson hoping to secure the DUP\u2019s support for his Brexit deal in the coming days, Creasy challenged Walker in the Commons. \u201cThe last time that there were official cross-party talks was in July.

      "bodyText": "A Democratic lawmaker has called on Google CEO Sundar Pichai to stop investing in organizations that deny the existence of the climate crisis, saying it was hard to overstate how detrimental the impact of such groups had been on the US climate debate. Kathy Castor\u2019s letter to Pichai followed a report in the Guardian last week that revealed Google had made \u201csubstantial\u201d contributions to some of the most notorious climate deniers in Washington, despite the internet giant\u2019s insistence it supports political action to combat the crisis. The groups included the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has actively sought to roll back Obama-era environmental protections and helped convince Donald Trump, the US president, to abandon the Paris Agreement. Google has said it supported the climate accord, but continued to offer financial backing to CEI and similarly-minded groups. \u201cIt is hard to overstate the detrimental impact groups like CEI have had on the climate debate in the United States since the early days of the Kyoto Protocol,\u201d Castor, a Democratic representative from Florida, said. \u201cBecause of their public and behind-the-scenes efforts to obfuscate and obstruct, we have lost critical time to cut greenhouse gas pollution and now face a shrinking window of opportunity to avert the worst impacts of climate change.\u201d Google has said that its support for CEI and other groups, including the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, reflected support for the groups\u2019 \u201cstrong technology policies\u201d, and not their stance on the climate crisis. \u201cWe\u2019ve been extremely clear that Google\u2019s sponsorship doesn\u2019t mean that we endorse that organization\u2019s entire agenda \u2013 we may disagree strongly on some issues,\u201d a Google spokesperson told the Guardian about its donations. But in her letter to Pichai, Castor, who is chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, said there was no way to distinguish their support from other issues. \u201cIt is impossible to separate your support for one sliver of CEI from the whole. Your financial contributions support the organization\u2019s infrastructure, augment its political influence, and, in turn, legitimize all of its activities \u2013 not just the ones you like,\u201d she wrote. Google declined to offer new comment on the letter, and referred to previous statements on the issue. Castor closed her letter by pointing to Google\u2019s own website, and its declaration that the company was striving to \u201cbuild sustainability into everything we do\u201d. \u201cI urge you to apply this mantra when you make decisions about which thinktanks and organizations to support in the future,\u201d she said. It was not the only public response to the Guardian\u2019s report last week, which was part of a broader investigation into the fossil fuel industry, the structures behind it, and the climate emergency. Activists with Extinction Rebellion staged a protest in front of Google\u2019s London headquarters on Wednesday, with more than 100 mothers \u2013 and babies \u2013 staging a \u201cnurse-in\u201d to protest the company\u2019s funding of climate deniers.",

The 21 former Tory MPs who have recently lost their whip could also rebel.</p> \n<p>An issue over VAT was said by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, to be a last-minute obstacle in the negotiations when he briefed European ambassadors on Wednesday night.

Earlier in the day, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, had said the \u201cfoundations\u201d of a Brexit deal were in place and it was only last-minute \u201cdoubts\u201d in London that stood in the way.</p> \n<p>Under the agreement, Barnier told ambassadors that a regulatory and customs border <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/the-irish-sea-border-what-does-it-mean-for-businesses-brexit\">would be drawn in the Irish </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/the-irish-sea-border-what-does-it-mean-for-businesses-brexit\">Sea</a>.</p> \n<p>Northern Ireland would legally be in the UK\u2019s customs territory to allow the prime minister to boast that the country \u201cwhole and entire\u201d has left the EU. </p> \n<p>But it will follow EU rules on tariffs and quotas with exceptions for people moving personal goods, such as furniture, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and an undefined category of other goods that cannot be processed and shipped into the EU. These goods will be agreed by a joint committee of UK and EU officials in the future, giving the EU control over the list.</p> \n<p>Barnier further explained that four years after the end of the transition period, the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont would be able to give its continued consent to continuing the arrangements. The assembly would have to decide whether to vote by a simple majority or under a vote in which 40% of both nationalist and unionist assembly members would be required to give their assent. A 60% threshold of all members would need to be passed in that case. If Stormont is not sitting, the status quo would continue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"73f497f7-48ef-4d47-95b2-af2d926d1a48\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Counties and customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.<br></p>\n    <p>Britain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is in a race against time to secure the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s backing for his newly negotiated Brexit deal as EU leaders said they were ready to approve the agreement on Thursday if the prime minister succeeds. Plans to publish a full legal text ahead of the leaders\u2019 summit had to be put on hold to the frustration of EU officials after the DUP raised a series of objections to the tentative agreement. With time short, Johnson told a meeting of Conservative MPs he was hopeful of a deal but it felt like he was on the Hillary Step of Mount Everest while the summit was \u201cshrouded in mist\u201d. The prime minister appeared to have the party\u2019s hardline Eurosceptics onboard, including Steve Baker, who said Johnson had briefed them that the whole of the UK was leaving the customs union. But they also added a note of caution that they could not vote for any Brexit deal without seeing a legal text. The 21 former Tory MPs who have recently lost their whip could also rebel. An issue over VAT was said by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, to be a last-minute obstacle in the negotiations when he briefed European ambassadors on Wednesday night. But the British objection was described by EU diplomats as a \u201cBritish smokescreen\u201d to give Downing Street more time to win over the DUP\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster. EU officials think Johnson could make a sudden move to seal the deal on Thursday morning. Earlier in the day, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, had said the \u201cfoundations\u201d of a Brexit deal were in place and it was only last-minute \u201cdoubts\u201d in London that stood in the way. Under the agreement, Barnier told ambassadors that a regulatory and customs border would be drawn in the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland would legally be in the UK\u2019s customs territory to allow the prime minister to boast that the country \u201cwhole and entire\u201d has left the EU. But it will follow EU rules on tariffs and quotas with exceptions for people moving personal goods, such as furniture, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and an undefined category of other goods that cannot be processed and shipped into the EU. These goods will be agreed by a joint committee of UK and EU officials in the future, giving the EU control over the list. Barnier further explained that four years after the end of the transition period, the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont would be able to give its continued consent to continuing the arrangements. The assembly would have to decide whether to vote by a simple majority or under a vote in which 40% of both nationalist and unionist assembly members would be required to give their assent. A 60% threshold of all members would need to be passed in that case. If Stormont is not sitting, the status quo would continue. There would be another opportunity a further four years later to give consent if they voted by simple majority, and eight years later if they took the cross-party route. A two-year notice period would be granted if Northern Ireland exited the special relationship with the EU to allow alternative arrangements to be put in place. Johnson has also made a major concession to secure a free-trade agreement with the EU. The prime minister had previously signalled he wanted to abandon a pledge to align to EU standards on the environment, workers\u2019 rights and tax, fuelling Brussels\u2019 fears of a regulatory race to the bottom and the creation of \u201cSingapore on the Thames\u201d. Barnier told EU ambassadors he now had secured a basis for fair competition, as Johnson had agreed that the quid pro quo for any free-trade agreement would be signing up to the EU\u2019s \u201clevel-playing field\u201d provisions, meaning a promise not to ditch EU standards. EU negotiators have long said these promises are vital, because of the UK\u2019s economic weight and geographical proximity. Barnier told the EU ambassadors the British cabinet had backed the agreement, but stressed huge uncertainty that parliament would give its approval. Several ambassadors voiced concern about the limited time, but there was no discussion of extension. During a joint appearance with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told reporters: \u201cI think that a deal is just being finalised and we\u2019re going to be able to work on that tomorrow.\u201d Tusk had said that he had hoped that a deal would have been ready by Wednesday morning but that agreement was still possible. \u201cYesterday evening I was ready to bet that it\u2019s all set and agreed, today there are certain doubts on the British side,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is going in the right direction, but you will have noticed yourselves that with Brexit and above all with our British partners anything is possible.\u201d \u201cWe are still waiting for a signal from across the Channel,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cA lot of things are happening between the cabinet, DUP and the hardest Brexiters.\u201d Despite the prospect of a deal being struck in Brussels, EU sources said the prime minister\u2019s pledge to leave the EU on 31 October, \u201cdo or die\u201d, remained in doubt even if an agreement was secured. EU diplomats said the last-minute nature of the talks meant that time would be required after the summit for governments and parliaments to scrutinise the legal text of the deal. As a result, the EU\u2019s leaders will only give their political rather than full formal agreement to the deal when they meet on Thursday and Friday. The EU27 will then want the Commons, in its \u201csuper Saturday\u201d session, to give its assent to the revised withdrawal agreement and political declaration. Final EU agreement would be given at a later date, likely at a second summit on 29 October, once the member states had time to work through the legal text. Sources in Berlin have suggested that process could take as long as two months. \u201cIt is clear that there can only be a political agreement tomorrow or Friday because we cannot see any text.

Speaking on Wednesday evening after holding talks with other political party leaders, Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the government would defend Spain\u2019s constitution and peaceful coexistence but would not be tempted into inflaming tensions. \u201cThe state will always guarantee the rights of those who wish to protest their ideas peacefully,\u201d he said. \u201cBut organised violent groups and those who try to break democratic laws will not achieve their aims \u2026 The only hope of those violent groups is that we\u2019ll make mistakes and become overexcited and divided.

S\u00e1nchez said the government was ready to respond \u201cto all scenarios\u201d and called on the pro-independence Catalan president, Quim Torra, to unequivocally condemn the use of violence seen since Monday\u2019s verdicts. Referring to the regional government\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to secure independence, S\u00e1nchez added: \u201cNo leader can camouflage their failure behind curtains of smoke and fire.\u201d Torra has been criticised for calling for civil disobedience while sending in Catalan riot police to restore order. While the Catalan president declined to explicitly condemn the violence of recent days as he took part in a protest march from Girona to Barcelona on Wednesday, he later tweeted that \u201cviolence does not represent us\u201d. Earlier on Wednesday, the nine jailed leaders had issued a joint plea for peaceful protests after the Spanish government warned any further violence would be met with a \u201cfirm, proportional and united\u201d response. The nine called for a huge but peaceful response to their imprisonment. \u201cAll support to mobilisations and massive and peaceful marches,\u201d wrote the nine, who include the former regional vice-president Oriol Junqueras and two influential grassroots leaders, Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart. \u201cNo violence represents us.\u201d Planned peaceful demonstrations in Barcelona gave way to running battles with the police on Tuesday evening, 24 hours after thousands of pro-independence protesters attempted to shut down Barcelona airport, leading to police charges. The Spanish government said 51 people had been arrested across Catalonia on Monday and Tuesday, and 54 officers from the regional police force and 18 from the national force had been injured. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s caretaker government has already said it could activate article 155 of the constitution, which would allow it to suspend the regional government and assume direct rule of the region. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s rightwing opponents are calling for the government to take a hard line on the latest eruption of the regional independence crisis. Spain is due to hold its fourth general election in as many years on 10 November.

It sends a poor message about the game of football \u2026 it\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s such a beautiful game and it\u2019s being tarred by people with racist thoughts and racist minds.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible that players have to experience that when they just want to go out and play the game they love. It is important that those who are subject to this kind of abuse and discrimination speak up and highlight the wrongs and the issues. I also think associations and teams need to take a tougher stand. Punishment needs to be more severe because it is not acting as a deterrent, especially when they go abroad to places like Bulgaria.

While he acknowledges that \u201cfor the most part in rugby there\u2019s a different climate and that kind of stuff doesn\u2019t happen\u201d, he suggests the sport needs to remain vigilant.</p> <p>\u201cI know people in rugby who have experienced it in the professional game \u2013 not necessarily in the Premiership but playing in different parts of the world \u2013 and grass roots. In rugby you don\u2019t have microphones everywhere so it\u2019s hard to prove.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important never to just assume that this is a free zone from any form of discrimination. I think rugby is probably, from the sports I\u2019ve seen, right up there in terms of integrity, respect and how they treat people.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s Maro Itoje has slammed this week\u2019s racist abuse in football as appalling and abysmal and warned that rugby union should not consider itself immune from similar problems. Itoje says he has teammates who have been the target of abuse and believes the time has come for more black sports people to take a public stand. The Saracens forward, preparing for the biggest game of his life in the shape of the World Cup quarter-final against Australia on Saturday, has been sickened by events in Bulgaria and is urging rugby to do more to combat racism and discrimination of all kinds. As a keen football fan Itoje has particular sympathy for the England footballers who were abused during their Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s just appalling, it\u2019s abysmal,\u201d said the London-born 24-year-old, whose parents hail from Nigeria. \u201cYou would think they wouldn\u2019t have to go through that. It sends a poor message about the game of football \u2026 it\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s such a beautiful game and it\u2019s being tarred by people with racist thoughts and racist minds. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that players have to experience that when they just want to go out and play the game they love. It is important that those who are subject to this kind of abuse and discrimination speak up and highlight the wrongs and the issues. I also think associations and teams need to take a tougher stand. Punishment needs to be more severe because it is not acting as a deterrent, especially when they go abroad to places like Bulgaria. They need to make it crystal clear.\u201d According to Itoje, that is equally the case in rugby. While he acknowledges that \u201cfor the most part in rugby there\u2019s a different climate and that kind of stuff doesn\u2019t happen\u201d, he suggests the sport needs to remain vigilant. \u201cI know people in rugby who have experienced it in the professional game \u2013 not necessarily in the Premiership but playing in different parts of the world \u2013 and grass roots. In rugby you don\u2019t have microphones everywhere so it\u2019s hard to prove. \u201cIt\u2019s important never to just assume that this is a free zone from any form of discrimination. I think rugby is probably, from the sports I\u2019ve seen, right up there in terms of integrity, respect and how they treat people. But I think it is important to never just assume that it\u2019s always going to be that way. - \u201cI\u2019m sure, a couple of years ago, when this sort of thing wasn\u2019t as rife in football, they assumed it was all OK. I remember a period when I didn\u2019t really hear much about racism in football but then over the last two years there have been several incidents with Raheem Sterling, Dele Alli and with a whole number of black players who play for England or in the Premier League. It is important never just to assume that these things are all hunky dory \u2013 it is something we have to keep on top of.\u201d Itoje\u2019s teammates Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph are friends of Tyrone Mings, among the targets of racist abuse before and during his debut for England in Sofia, and from Japan they have been in touch with the Aston Villa player. Itoje has been impressed with how Mings has handled the situation. \u201cI\u2019m all for player empowerment, I\u2019m all for players speaking up when they feel there are injustices done to them.

That\u2019s fine: that\u2019s what a smart campaign would do. It\u2019s designed to inject new energy into the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Suggestions that Sanders might bow out of the race were evidently premature. He raised $25.3m for his campaign in the last quarter, more than any other Democrat. At Tuesday\u2019s night\u2019s three-hour debate in Ohio, he forcefully defended his healthcare plans and was even humorous; when Cory Booker pointed out that Sanders supports legalising marijuana, Sanders replied: \u201cI\u2019m not on it tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez could prove an invaluable asset and antidote to his perceived weaknesses. While he is in his late 70s, she has just turned 30. While his supporters have sometimes struggled to escape their 2016 reputation as white male \u201cBernie bros\u201d, she is a Hispanic woman with an ability to inspire big, diverse crowds.</p> <p>For Ocasio-Cortez, not endorsing Sanders would have been something of a snub. She was an organizer for his insurgent 2016 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton and has credited him for inspiring her, while working as a bartender, to go into politics. They are aligned as democratic socialists with millennial appeal and a passion for combating the climate crisis.</p> <p>Democratic Socialists of America welcomed the endorsements. \u201cBacked by a diverse, energetic working-class movement and by democratic socialist politicians like Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders can win the Democratic nomination, beat Donald Trump, and, together, we can transform politics in this country and around the world forever,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.dsausa.org/statements/ocasio-cortez-tlaib-and-omar-endorse-bernie-and-the-political-revolution/\">it said in a statement.</a></p> <p>Should Sanders claim the nomination, however, the endorsements will likely delight Trump. He has sought to raise the profile of the squad and portray them as the face of a Democratic party taken over by radical leftists with trillion dollar spending plans. The idea of nominee Sanders sharing a stage with Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Omar would be fodder for the president\u2019s ad-making machine.</p> <p>But for now, the squad represents Sanders\u2019 best hope of blunting Warren\u2019s momentum. Neil Sroka, communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America, said: \u201cThis is an important boost for Senator Sanders at a critical time. There is no doubt that the heart attack amplified concerns people might have had about Senator Sanders and his health.\u201d</p> <p>Sroka added: \u201cWhenever you have a situation like that, you want to show a new sort of energy and I think getting this endorsement at this critical time is a smart move and will undoubtedly be helpful.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s designed to inject new energy into the campaign.\u201d Suggestions that Sanders might bow out of the race were evidently premature. He raised $25.3m for his campaign in the last quarter, more than any other Democrat. At Tuesday\u2019s night\u2019s three-hour debate in Ohio, he forcefully defended his healthcare plans and was even humorous; when Cory Booker pointed out that Sanders supports legalising marijuana, Sanders replied: \u201cI\u2019m not on it tonight.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez could prove an invaluable asset and antidote to his perceived weaknesses. While he is in his late 70s, she has just turned 30. While his supporters have sometimes struggled to escape their 2016 reputation as white male \u201cBernie bros\u201d, she is a Hispanic woman with an ability to inspire big, diverse crowds. For Ocasio-Cortez, not endorsing Sanders would have been something of a snub. She was an organizer for his insurgent 2016 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton and has credited him for inspiring her, while working as a bartender, to go into politics. They are aligned as democratic socialists with millennial appeal and a passion for combating the climate crisis. Democratic Socialists of America welcomed the endorsements. \u201cBacked by a diverse, energetic working-class movement and by democratic socialist politicians like Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders can win the Democratic nomination, beat Donald Trump, and, together, we can transform politics in this country and around the world forever,\u201d it said in a statement. Should Sanders claim the nomination, however, the endorsements will likely delight Trump. He has sought to raise the profile of the squad and portray them as the face of a Democratic party taken over by radical leftists with trillion dollar spending plans. The idea of nominee Sanders sharing a stage with Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Omar would be fodder for the president\u2019s ad-making machine. But for now, the squad represents Sanders\u2019 best hope of blunting Warren\u2019s momentum. Neil Sroka, communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America, said: \u201cThis is an important boost for Senator Sanders at a critical time. There is no doubt that the heart attack amplified concerns people might have had about Senator Sanders and his health.\u201d Sroka added: \u201cWhenever you have a situation like that, you want to show a new sort of energy and I think getting this endorsement at this critical time is a smart move and will undoubtedly be helpful.\u201d",

We had a tough game on Saturday then had to travel here. I am so proud of the team. It means so much to us. \u201cThe performance we put in, the injuries we have got, the week we have had, it was a positive performance from us all. We haven\u2019t seen the best from Atl\u00e9tico but we are near the top of the table and competing in the Champions League.\u201d City too are a very different side. Further into the season they are fitter and fresher than against Atl\u00e9tico last year. But it was the Spanish side who pushed for an equaliser on the break in the second half. Struggling to break through City\u2019s commanding backline, which had conceded only once in seven games, Maria Santos tried to catch Roebuck out from distance but could only loop the ball over the bar. Hemp should have doubled City\u2019s lead after a burst into the box from the left but Laia Aleixandri threw her body in the way. In the end the hosts were punished. Ludmila Silva surged down the right, shoulder to shoulder with Stokes, and having got the better of the full-back passed into the middle for Corral to poke in the late equaliser. City now have a testing run, with away trips to Manchester United, Arsenal and Madrid. \u201cI never think we won\u2019t get a goal so we are just looking forward to that game now,\u201d said Scott. \u201cI\u2019d rather play Arsenal every week. These are the games that I was like an excited kid waiting for. These runs excite the team.\u201d",

We are currently cutting down more trees than we are planting under taxpayer-funded schemes to address climate change, a major new Guardian Australia investigation can reveal. Australia is among the 11 worst countries when it comes to deforestation. Little more than two years of land clearing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/17/australia-spends-billions-planting-trees-then-wipes-out-carbon-gains-by-bulldozing-them\">will cancel out the $1.5bn in taxpayer funds</a> that goes towards protecting native habitat. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/17/stripped-bare-australias-hidden-climate-crisis\">Anne Davies went to the back of Bourke</a> to see the scarred landscape for herself and find out why the issue is bitterly dividing communities.</p> <p>We also explore the bitter fight over Australian farmers clearing their land in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/oct/17/the-bitter-fight-over-australias-farmers-clearing-their-land-podcast\">the first episode of Guardian Australia\u2019s new podcast</a>, Full Story.</p> <p><strong>A Brexit deal won\u2019t happen today, British government sources have confirmed,</strong> despite German chancellor Angela Merkel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/16/brexit-boris-johnson-races-the-clock-as-deadline-for-deal-looms-politics-live\">describing negotiations as in the \u201cfinal sprint\u201d phase</a>. Leading Eurosceptics inside the Conservative party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/tory-eurosceptics-rally-round-boris-johnson-as-deal-nears\">have rallied around Boris Johnson</a> as he seeks to resolve several \u201cred lines\u201d set in negotiations with the Democratic Unionist party. European council president Donald Tusk has suggested the \u201cfoundations\u201d of a Brexit deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/16/michel-barnier-optimistic-of-deal-after-pm-makes-concessions-on-irish-border\">are ready to be approved by EU leaders on Thursday</a> but confirmed that late \u201cdoubts\u201d in London are still holding up the final wording of any agreement.

The comments amp up the agency\u2019s concern about rightwing extremist terrorism, after Asio boss Duncan Lewis told Senate estimates in April it was an important issue but the Christchurch massacre had not changed the agency\u2019s calculus. The massacre of 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch, for which 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant has been charged, prompted renewed scrutiny of the far right.</p> <p><strong>A record number of women have received prime minister\u2019s science awards, </strong>with mathematician Cheryl Praeger taking the top award and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/17/women-break-prize-drought-by-winning-five-2019-prime-ministers-science-awards\">earning praise from Scott Morrison for her \u201coutstanding contribution to mathematics\u201d</a>. 2019 saw a fivefold increase in female representation among prize-winners, with Samantha Moyle, Sarah Finney, Laura McKay and Elizabeth New also receiving major awards.

Top stories You might not realise it if you live in the city, but land clearing in Australia has reached epidemic proportions. In New South Wales alone, the rate of clearing has at least tripled since 2014 - and it has global consequences. We are currently cutting down more trees than we are planting under taxpayer-funded schemes to address climate change, a major new Guardian Australia investigation can reveal. Australia is among the 11 worst countries when it comes to deforestation. Little more than two years of land clearing will cancel out the $1.5bn in taxpayer funds that goes towards protecting native habitat. Anne Davies went to the back of Bourke to see the scarred landscape for herself and find out why the issue is bitterly dividing communities. We also explore the bitter fight over Australian farmers clearing their land in the first episode of Guardian Australia\u2019s new podcast, Full Story. A Brexit deal won\u2019t happen today, British government sources have confirmed, despite German chancellor Angela Merkel describing negotiations as in the \u201cfinal sprint\u201d phase. Leading Eurosceptics inside the Conservative party have rallied around Boris Johnson as he seeks to resolve several \u201cred lines\u201d set in negotiations with the Democratic Unionist party. European council president Donald Tusk has suggested the \u201cfoundations\u201d of a Brexit deal are ready to be approved by EU leaders on Thursday but confirmed that late \u201cdoubts\u201d in London are still holding up the final wording of any agreement. Johnson is still yet to win over many of the 21 rebels he previously expelled from the Conservative party, whose vote may yet prove crucial if any deal is to be ratified in time for Johnson\u2019s 31 October deadline. The threat from extreme rightwing terrorism in Australia has increased in recent years and will remain an \u201cenduring threat\u201d, according to Australia\u2019s spy agency.

The father of a boy killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting has successfully sued a conspiracy theorist who claimed the massacre never occurred, with a jury in Wisconsin awarding him $450,000.

Today we commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2030, and we are currently undertaking a full audit of our emissions to assess how we will achieve this challenging goal.\u201d Guardian Australia editor-in-chief Lenore Taylor writes Australia \u201chas the potential to be a superpower of the post-carbon world economy if we could just set aside the self-defeating culture war and look to the future with imagination\u201d. \u201cGuardian Australia will provide that reporting, because only a properly informed debate can help us avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis and steer us out of this cul-de sac and towards a low-carbon future.\u201d Media roundup A businessman blacklisted by the United Nations for his connections with Liberian dictator Charles Taylor allegedly entered Australia and gambled at Crown Casino between 2010 and 2018, Fairfax papers and the ABC are reporting. Turkey\u2019s ambassador to Australia has confirmed their forces can\u2019t guarantee the safety of 66 Australian citizens believed to be the wives and children of Isis fighters, as it pushes further into Syria, writes the Australian. And former Essendon star Jobe Watson has heightened speculation of fresh revelations in the long-running drugs saga, claims the Herald Sun, encouraging journalists to \u201ckeep digging\u201d. Listen Guardian Australia is launching a news podcast called Full Story. Covering current events and Guardian exclusives, each episode explores one story - where it really started, what happened and what it means for listeners.

Raissouni, who was arrested outside a clinic in Rabat with her fianc\u00e9 on 31 August, maintained from the start that she never underwent an abortion. Both she and the medical staff arrested along with the couple said she was treated to remove a blood clot. Campaigners say that some 800 abortions take place every day in Morocco, where the procedure is illegal except when the woman\u2019s life is threatened due to pregnancy and with a husband\u2019s permission. In a statement from prison before receiving the pardon, Raissouni said she was targeted for her work as as a journalist and for her family\u2019s history as dissidents. \u201cIt is evident that the purpose of my arrest was vengeance against my journalistic activities,\u201d she said. She added that her coverage of the Hirak protest movement in the country\u2019s northern region had put her in the crosshairs of the state. Observers said that the pardon did little to remedy the wider problems that led to Raissouni\u2019s case in the first place, in a country where critics\u2019 personal lives are sometimes publicly used to silence them. \u201cShe should not have been jailed in the first place,\u201d said an Amnesty International staff member who requested not to be named. \u201cShe must be acquitted properly of all charges and her name cleared. Targeting Hajar and intruding in her private life simply for doing her job as a journalist is another indicator of the crackdown on freedom of expression in Morocco.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is yet to win over some of those he expelled from the Conservative party to vote for his EU exit deal, including the former chancellor Philip Hammond, who fears doing so could lead to a much harder Brexit than expected. Johnson will need the backing almost all of the 21 who had the whip removed, plus Eurosceptics and either the Democratic Unionist party or a bloc of Labour MPs, if he is to have a chance of passing any Brexit deal he achieves. However, No 10 has yet to secure promises from many of the anti-no deal rebels that they will vote for an agreement. Senior government figures have been asking the former Tories what they would need to vote for a deal and prevent an extension, but many have worries about being pressed into voting for an agreement with insufficient scrutiny. A source involved in the group led by the former chancellor Philip Hammond said: \u201cThere are versions of it that are pretty suboptimal. Philip, [David] Gauke, Amber [Rudd] and the others have said a few times this needs to be something that works for the whole of the UK, and if this breaches the union there will be some concerns about that. \u201cOn some things there will be a strange sort of common concern that draws from the ERG to DUP to former Tory rebels along the lines of the union, perhaps for different reasons. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a dead cert for any of them that they will vote for it \u2026 I will be very much studying the substance but there are concerns about the shape [of] what has been submitted so far. It is also that Theresa May made a commitment to parliament over its role on the future relationship and the big question will be: what shape does the political declaration take? \u201cThey are only going on what they\u2019ve read in the media, but none of them are people who will just vote for any deal. There are obviously different concerns within the group about what they want to see but it\u2019s broadly along the lines of something that has to work for the whole of the UK.\u201d Hammond later told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil he may not support Johnson\u2019s deal. He said his mind was \u201ccertainly not closed to supporting a deal the PM brings back\u201d, but he was worried about proposed changes to the political declaration that could lead to a more distant trading relationship with the EU in future. \u201cWhat I am hearing from Brussels is that the government is seeking to take out things from the future relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can judge any package until we see the full package.

Grieve said on Wednesday that he would push for an extension to article 50 to go ahead regardless of whether the prime minister brings back the outline of a deal from the European summit this week. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that a final Brexit deal will not be agreed this week \u2026 That means the Benn act comes into play, and an extension to the article 50 deadline must be requested by law,\u201d he said after meetings in Brussels. There have been suggestions that the former Conservatives could have the whip restored if they vote for a deal, although Sam Gyimah has defected to the Liberal Democrats and is committed to a second referendum, while Rory Stewart is running as an independent to be mayor of London. At the same time, Tory sources have suggested Eurosceptics who refuse to back any deal proposed by the prime minister could also have the whip removed. James said it would be \u201cgood for them not to operate a system of double standards\u201d and for No 10 to sack any Tories who do not back Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement. \u201cI think that\u2019s the thinking behind why the whip has not been offered back to us,\u201d the independent MP said. \u201cThe government wants to make clear this is a highly disciplined environment and all members of parliament on the Conservative side should follow the Conservative whip in a vote as important as this one.\u201d",

In the west, where land-clearing laws <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2013-12-03/wa-farmers-welcome-eased-land-clearing-regulation/5132370\">were relaxed under the former Liberal premier Colin Barnett in the name of removing red tape</a>, a partial picture can be calculated by tallying the permits granted by some departments \u2013 but this <a href=\"https://www.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/size-of-land-disturbed-by-wa-miners-in-2017-bigger-than-hong-kong-20180116-h0jbgu.html\">leaves significant gaps</a>.</p> <p>Land clearing in New South Wales is unarguably on the rise.

Though some Liberal ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/13/secret-review-into-soaring-land-clearing-rates-handed-to-nsw-government\">are deeply concerned about the scale and pace of the escalation and its impact on biodiversity</a>, the National party has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/11/nsw-deputy-premier-vows-to-open-up-murray-valley-national-park-to-logging\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/22/nationals-mp-pushes-to-allow-logging-of-huge-river-red-gum-forest\">called</a> for protections to be wound back.</p> <p>The contrast makes little sense to some people planting trees on behalf of taxpayers. Around the Moree water park, a human-made water-skiing area 6km north-west of the New South Wales town, a small forest of native trees is taking root, despite two years of drought, thanks to a $29,500 grant from the 20 million trees program. Eventually 7,000 trees will be planted.</p> <p>John Mailler, 80, a retired share farmer and volunteer working on the project, germinates his own plants from local seed at his property 40km away and drives in regularly to tend the trees, which are being planted by a local employment group. He lists the local species: carbeen, casuarina, box trees, emu apple or grewi, brigalow and roly poly.</p> <p>Mailler\u2019s trees are bred so they don\u2019t need drip irrigation and can survive with an occasional watering.

      "bodyText": "Since 2015 the Australian government has committed more than $1.5bn of taxpayer funds to climate change projects that plant or protect native habitat. Over a slightly longer period it has also spent nearly $62m on a policy to plant 20 million trees promised under Tony Abbott. At the same time the country has significantly stepped up land-clearing programs in several states, bulldozing hundreds of thousands of hectares of forests, mostly for agriculture. Official data allows an estimate of the scale of the contrast: little more than two years of land clearing will effectively cancel out what the public is spending to avoid 125 million tonnes of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere. The equivalent to what has been planted over several years in the 20 million trees program is wiped out in just six months of land clearing. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty absurd,\u201d says Jess Panegyres, the Wilderness Society\u2019s national nature campaigner. \u201cWe\u2019re putting huge amounts of taxpayer dollars into avoided deforestation and reforestation and at the same time we\u2019re allowing Australia to become a deforestation hotspot globally. Any of the gains that we\u2019re making under these taxpayer-funded schemes are being wiped out almost immediately.\u201d What is being lost can be cut up in different ways. Using government figures, the Wilderness Society estimates a Melbourne Cricket Ground-sized area of forest and bushland was cleared every two minutes in 2017. Over a longer timeframe, an academic study found last month that more than 7.7m hectares \u2013 an area larger than Tasmania \u2013 of potential threatened species habitat had been cleared since 1999. It said 93% of this land had not been referred to the federal environment department for assessment and approval before being cleared, as required under national environment laws. Not all land cleared is equal. Much of it is regrown forest in areas that have been felled before. But a significant minority is intact mature forest, which is a deeper store of carbon dioxide. Scientists say both need to be protected if Australia is to stem an unfolding extinction crisis. Australia has a long history of forest clearing. The proportion of the country covered by forest has fallen from about 30% to less than 16% since European invasion. But, after a relative decline, a big upswing in land clearing began in 2013, when Campbell Newman\u2019s Liberal National government relaxed laws preventing mass deforestation in Queensland. Data from the state\u2019s world-leading vegetation monitoring system, known as Slats (statewide landcover and trees study), shows that in the five years that followed about 1.7m hectares \u2013 an area larger than greater Brisbane \u2013 of native vegetation was bulldozed, far more than in the rest of the country combined. In the most recent two years in which data is available, ending in June last year, about 40% of that was in Great Barrier Reef catchments, increasing the amount of sediment running into the ocean along the coast. The Labor state government passed legislation last year that the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said would end broad-scale land clearing \u2013 despite environmental lawyers warning that the new laws were full of loopholes. The latest Slats data that will show the result of that are yet to be released, but Panegyres says while the laws should work to reduce the bulldozing of mature forest, anecdotal evidence suggests the loss of growing forest and native vegetation has continued in some areas. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of land clearing still being reported to us,\u201d she says. While Queensland closely tracks land clearing, the picture in other parts of the country is less clear. Neither Western Australia nor the Northern Territory keep jurisdiction-wide data. In the west, where land-clearing laws were relaxed under the former Liberal premier Colin Barnett in the name of removing red tape, a partial picture can be calculated by tallying the permits granted by some departments \u2013 but this leaves significant gaps. Land clearing in New South Wales is unarguably on the rise. While it has not reached the heights of Queensland, figures from the state\u2019s Office of Environment and Heritage show clearing for crops pasture and thinning tripled between 2014-15 and 2017-18, the year the state government introduced more lenient native vegetation protection laws. More than 27,000 hectares, nearly 100 times the size of Sydney\u2019s central business district, were cleared for agriculture in the latest year for which data is available. Most of the clearing has been between Moree and the Queensland border. If native forestry is included, the figure rises to 58,000 hectares. The data shows land clearing had already escalated before the laws came into effect, farmers having apparently anticipated the change. Though some Liberal ministers are deeply concerned about the scale and pace of the escalation and its impact on biodiversity, the National party has repeatedly called for protections to be wound back. The contrast makes little sense to some people planting trees on behalf of taxpayers. Around the Moree water park, a human-made water-skiing area 6km north-west of the New South Wales town, a small forest of native trees is taking root, despite two years of drought, thanks to a $29,500 grant from the 20 million trees program. Eventually 7,000 trees will be planted. John Mailler, 80, a retired share farmer and volunteer working on the project, germinates his own plants from local seed at his property 40km away and drives in regularly to tend the trees, which are being planted by a local employment group. He lists the local species: carbeen, casuarina, box trees, emu apple or grewi, brigalow and roly poly. Mailler\u2019s trees are bred so they don\u2019t need drip irrigation and can survive with an occasional watering. He loves the work but says the loss of local vegetation around Moree is heartbreaking. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed. That was open grass country,\u201d he says, gesturing towards the horizon to the east. \u201cBut it\u2019s now crops, barley, wheat, chickpeas, lupins, cotton. \u201cThey buy this wide machinery, and they say it\u2019s too much of a problem to go round the trees so they get rid of them. It\u2019s tragic.\u201d The north-west of NSW is ground zero for tree loss. In the Moree council area alone, 1,189 hectares \u2013 roughly the size of the greater Melbourne area \u2013 of woody vegetation was lost to cropping, pasture and thinning in 2017-18. Even more went in neighbouring council areas. The situation is set to get worse in the next year. The NSW government has said it will not pursue cases against farmers who broke the old laws and it is planning to introduce regional plans, beginning with the north-west, that could further increase broad-scale clearing. On a national scale, some experts have doubts about whether national greenhouse accounts accurately reflect the full impact of forest clearing and have called for the federal government to introduce a nationwide monitoring system on a par with that used in Queensland. Even without that, Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist with Berlin-based Climate Analytics, says a key message from the national emissions data published by the government is that it expects clearing to continue at current rates for at least the next decade. Specifically, pollution from land clearing is projected to stay at about 46m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year to 2030, roughly equivalent to emissions from three large coal-fired power plants. \u201cThat\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d Hare says. \u201cThis is significantly damaging the climate, as well as the natural environment, and Australia is not planning to do anything to stop it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The lead protester in the row over LGBT equality teaching has been accused of \u201cinflaming tensions\u201d by inviting a controversial imam who claimed anal sex, paedophilia and transgenderism were being taught in schools to a demonstration. Shakeel Afsar, who has led a long campaign to halt the lessons, was questioned on the third day of a high court hearing to rule on whether an exclusion zone banning protests around Anderton Park primary school in Birmingham should be made permanent. Video footage of the largest protest, when more than 300 people, including young children, gathered outside the Sparkhill school, showed the imam Mullah Bahm holding up an image of a gingerbread man with genitals. Bahm shouted allegations that schools had an anal sex and paedophilia \u201cagenda\u201d and called for mass protests, saying there was a need to show \u201cMuslims are not asleep\u201d on this issue. Jonathan Manning QC, representing Birmingham city council, highlighted other comments made by the imam, from Batley in West Yorkshire, including his description of Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, the school\u2019s headteacher, as \u201cshatani\u201d (devilish) saying: \u201cThat woman needs to be broken.\u201d The temporary injunction bans Afsar, his sister Rosina Afsar \u2013 who had two children at Anderton Park but has since removed them \u2013 and Amir Ahmed from coordinating protests outside the school. During cross-examination, Afsar denied inviting Bahm to the protest, claiming he had never met him. He said he was unaware of Bahm\u2019s intention to make such a controversial speech and did not \u201cendorse it\u201d. However, the court was later shown a video of Afsar introducing the imam at the protest before holding up the illustration of the gingerbread man and briefly holding the microphone as Bahm spoke. Manning, who described the protests as \u201chighly confrontational\u201d, asked Afsar if he was aware young children were present at the demonstration on 24 May. Afsar replied: \u201cI do not endorse what he is saying. I was doing as much as I could to get him off the microphone.\u201d He went on to add that he \u201cdid not realise what was on the paper\u201d he held up for the imam. Manning argued that despite Afsar claiming he did not endorse the imam\u2019s views, Bahm went on to speak for a second time, as Afsar again stood alongside, and his fellow organiser and defendant, Ahmed, held the mic. Afsar was then seen clapping as Bahm finished his speech. During the hearing, Afsar was also accused of inflaming tensions between parents \u2013 many of whom do not speak English \u2013 and the school. In an Ofsted report from December 2017, the school was described as having a positive, \u201cunderstanding\u201d relationship with parents and a culture of care, Manning said. However, this relationship was \u201cdisrupted\u201d, the QC continued, when Afsar and a small number of parents \u201cdecided to adopt a wholly confrontational approach that was not conciliatory in the slightest\u201d. Scrutinising Afsar\u2019s personal Twitter account, Manning asked about a photograph of children allegedly in a classroom being shown images of men dressed in provocative women\u2019s clothing. Manning said these tweets were \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d, adding: \u201cYou are the elected spokesperson of the parents\u2019 group, many of them as you know who don\u2019t speak any English, and you know that suggesting this is being taught in classrooms \u2026 is totally irresponsible and designed to do nothing but inflame concerned parents.\u201d Afsar denied this, saying: \u201cThese are just a number of accusations made against me.

      "bodyText": "In agreeing a deal to guarantee the Irish border remains invisible, with no checks fuelling inter-community tensions, the UK is moving the border to the Irish Sea. But the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) fears it will create an unwelcome new Brexit burden in Great Britain, forcing manufacturers to take on a mountain of paperwork and breaching Theresa May\u2019s promise that east-west trade would remain unfettered. While the DUP softened its previous opposition to such an outcome, Sammy Wilson, the MP for East Antrim, raised concerns about the impact facilitating Boris Johnson\u2019s new deal would have on businesses exporting from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Why is a barrier in the Irish Sea being discussed? If all goods entering the island of Ireland are checked before arrival for standards and tariffs, then cross-border trade can continue to flow unimpeded. It will also protect the single market and reduce the chance of suspect goods making their way to the continent via Northern Ireland and the republic. But will it create barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland? Yes, but the DUP has accepted that regulatory alignment with the EU on goods and agrifood will help keep the Irish border open and maintain peace. How much trade goes from Great Britain to Northern Ireland anyway? Around 450,000 trailers arrive in Northern Ireland every year, transporting everything from cars to soft cheese to school shirts. Trade and services purchased from Great Britain were valued at \u00a313.4bn according to the latest data, \u00a311bn of that representing goods. About 70% of goods purchased by Northern Irish businesses from Great Britain are destined for the high street and are largely food to Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and other supermarkets, clothing and white goods, cars and motorbikes. Who will the new Brexit terms impact? All companies moving goods to Northern Ireland. Business representatives believe the big companies such as supermarket chains will be able to put systems in place to deal with any checks but will be looking for government assistance to help smaller businesses. Will there be a border through the Irish Sea immediately if parliament votes for a deal? No. The discussion over the Irish border is part of Boris Johnson\u2019s alternative arrangements to the controversial backstop. It will only be triggered if the UK and EU do not seal their main trade deal before the end of the transition period. What kind of checks will be made? The extent and type of checks will not be clear until the detail of the deal emerges, but essentially they fall into two categories: tariffs and VAT. Excise duties also apply but will not trouble most importers as they generally apply to a limited amount of controlled goods including alcohol, cigarettes and fuel. Who will be required to have their goods checked? Customs declarations apply for both exports and imports and, although the trade is domestic, for the purposes of this version of a Brexit backstop, the checks will be made on behalf of the EU. It is concerned about goods from a third country leaking into Ireland and therefore the single market. What will businesses selling to Northern Ireland have to do? Exporters from Great Britain will be required to fill out complicated customs declaration forms. Anna Jerzewska, an independent customs consultant, says each form has 50 fields and, according to government estimates last week, will take 1 hour and 45 minutes to complete. Each business will have to establish all its commodity codes, a 10-digit number unique to each product that determines the precise tariff applicable. Using school shirts as an example, the code will vary according to the components in the shirt: whether the shirt is of knitted fabric, cotton, whether it has sleeves, pockets, whether the overlap at the front is right over left or left over right. \u201cAll these commodity codes have to be exact and if you get it wrong you could be committing an offence,\u201d said Jerzewska. \u201cPeople will have to find that code and that will be a challenge. Imagine if you had to find the commodity code for your laptop. Where would you even start?\u201d What happens when the goods arrive in Belfast? The \u201cbuyer\u201d or importer will have to pay an EU tariff. This is likely to be collected on behalf of the EU by UK officials, although in time it is likely to be an electronic transaction. What happens if the importer is also selling that shirt to schools in Dublin? There will not be any check on the box of shirts as it crosses the border, but the importer will not get a rebate on this consignment if it is sold in Dublin. Will getting a rebate be easy? It is not clear how the government intends to proceed with the tariff arrangements but if it works like the Dover-Calais system it will not be easy. There is no system set up for a seamless tariff pay and refund system that will be the success or failure at the heart of the new Irish backstop. Currently the EU operates a streamlined refund system for VAT known as VIES (VAT information exchange system) across Europe. There is nothing similar for tariffs, leaving retailers and traders concerned. \u201cPeople won\u2019t want to pay tariffs upfront and then wait weeks for a refund because it will kill your working capital. It will have to be a seamless invisible transaction,\u201d said Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium.",

Now, the New Jersey senator Cory Booker is introducing legislation that would devote $90m a year to programs that prevent urban gun violence. Booker\u2019s new grant program would focus federal dollars on helping the cities with the highest gun homicide rates, and it would prioritize funding for strategies that do not contribute to mass incarceration. Instead of simply directing more federal money to local law enforcement, the new legislation would require cities to give at least half of their federal grant dollars to community organizations that provide services to high-risk people, or to a public department \u201cthat is not a law enforcement agency\u201d. Booker\u2019s bill does not include any gun control provisions: it\u2019s focused on strategies that prevent shootings by focusing on the people, not the guns. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough political climate,\u201d said Pastor Michael McBride, a California-based activist who has spent the last decade campaigning for more resources for local gun violence prevention. \u201cThis approach charts a way forward that does not bog us down in these intense debates over the second amendment or gun control.\u201d Booker\u2019s legislation is designed to fund programs that have shown success in reducing gun violence in cities such as Oakland and Richmond, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and New York City. The legislation would devote $90m a year over 10 years to evidence-based approaches to gun violence reduction. In the past decade, as they have invested public dollars into expanding community-based strategies, Oakland has seen a 44% decrease in its gun homicide rate, and nearby Richmond has seen a 67% decrease in its gun homicide rate. The decreases in Oakland, Richmond, and San Francisco have driven a 30% decrease in the overall gun homicide rate across the greater San Francisco Bay Area, even as the number of people living in poverty in the region has increased, and as property crime has spiked in some areas. The decrease in the area is much larger than in the nation overall. The successful local strategies highlighted in Booker\u2019s legislation include investing in street outreach workers or \u201cviolence interrupters\u201d, trusted community members who intervene in local gang conflicts to keep violence from spreading; funding intervention programs in hospitals to help shooting victims change their lives; and supporting \u201cgroup violence intervention\u201d strategies, such as Boston\u2019s Operation Ceasefire, that bring together law enforcement, community partners, and faith leaders to intervene with the small number of men in each city who are most likely to shoot or be shot. Booker\u2019s Break the Cycle of Violence Act is co-sponsored by the US representative Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat whose father was shot to death during a robbery when he was 19. \u201cThese deaths are preventable,\u201d Horsford said in a statement. Mass shootings are usually the focus of America\u2019s gun control debate. But the majority of America\u2019s gun homicide victims are killed in smaller daily shootings in neighborhoods that have struggled with gun violence for decades. Black men and boys, who make up just 6% of America\u2019s overall population, represent more than 50% of the country\u2019s gun homicide victims. A 2015 Guardian investigation found that half of the country\u2019s gun homicides were concentrated in just 127 cities and towns. Experts have argued for years that American gun violence is highly concentrated, and that one of the best ways to save lives is to devote more resources into the neighborhoods with the greatest need. Black and brown activists have often felt \u201cinvisible\u201d and \u201cerased\u201d from the American gun control debate, McBride said. \u201cOur communities are used as props, but never really given serious consideration on how to scale up strategies that save our lives and heal our communities,\u201d he said.

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.</p>\n    <p>That leaves north-eastern&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a>&nbsp;divided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF \u2013 for now.</p>\n    <p>On 17 October Turkish president,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara\u2019s operation for&nbsp; five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdo\u011fan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/turkey-and-russia-agree-deal-over-buffer-zone-in-northern-syria\">agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish \u201csafe zone\u201d</a> in Syria.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the SDF come to control the region?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In late 2014, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/turkey-iraqi-kurds-kobani-isis-fighters-us-air-drops-arms\">Kurds were struggling</a>&nbsp;to fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The eldest, Amira, 10, told the film crew that their parents and other immediate adult family members were killed in an air assault on Baghouz, the last Isis stronghold, which fell in March, and she wanted to return to the UK.</p> \n<p>Save the Children, one of the few charities operating in north-east Syria, said the Home Office developments were a step in the right direction but more detail was required.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor this to translate into a real change of policy, we need to know that the government is working on how to bring all British children to the UK while we still can, not just those featured in the media,\u201d the charity said.</p> \n<p>It is not clear how many British unaccompanied children remain in the crowded refugee camps in the Kurdish region of Syria.

Home Office officials said the UK would assist British orphans trapped in Syria after the Turkish invasion, reversing a previous policy that children had to be taken out of the country before they might get any help. Officials would not say exactly how children might be extracted from the country, implying that SAS or other special forces, still understood to be based in the region, could be involved in the repatriations. They said children thought to be British would be assessed on a case-by-case basis once removed from Syria and only orphans and unaccompanied children would be eligible to be brought back to the UK. The shift in policy comes after a BBC reporting team found three English-speaking orphans aged 10 or under in a Syria camp over the weekend. The children are believed to have been taken by their parents to live under Islamic State five years ago. The eldest, Amira, 10, told the film crew that their parents and other immediate adult family members were killed in an air assault on Baghouz, the last Isis stronghold, which fell in March, and she wanted to return to the UK. Save the Children, one of the few charities operating in north-east Syria, said the Home Office developments were a step in the right direction but more detail was required. \u201cFor this to translate into a real change of policy, we need to know that the government is working on how to bring all British children to the UK while we still can, not just those featured in the media,\u201d the charity said.

Full-year profits still collapsed, but only to the degree that embattled chief executive Nick Beighton had indicated in his last profits warning in July \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/16/asos-profits-plunge-70-after-tumultuous-year-of-it-chaos\">they fell 68% to \u00a333.1m</a>.

For all the hype around Asos, the company\u2019s stupendous investment spree \u2013 \u00a3700m spent in the past five years \u2013 has so far succeeded only in demonstrating that cheap and cheerful fashion lines are popular. Revenues last year were \u00a32.7bn.</p> <p>The harder part is making decent money from global expansion and ensuring that new hubs in Atlanta and Berlin earn their keep. Asos\u2019 operating profit margin last year was a skinny 1.3%. In the old days, meaning half a decade ago, Asos aspired to 6%-8%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s hard to tell if that long-term ambition remains wholly intact because Beighton has adopted the guise of man of mystery and has abandoned the policy of offering year-ahead guidance on profits and sales. Actually, though, the new stance is probably sensible for two reasons. First, Asos\u2019 forecasting record was reliably terrible. Second, competition has become stiffer since those long-ago days when Asos seemed to have the twentysomething fast fashion field to itself.</p> <p>Boohoo, with its PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands, has planted itself on the same patch. Meanwhile, Next\u2019s online operation is rapidly expanding into the world of third-party brands and never seems to suffer the warehousing hiccups that have plagued Asos in the past year.</p> <p>Beighton says the problems at Asos have now been fixed. If so, investors may eventually discover the answer to the profit margin riddle. The reassurance for investors is that Asos has beefed up its cast of non-executive directors, led by chairman Adam Crozier, the former ITV chief executive, and they surely won\u2019t tolerate an operational relapse. The prickly Beighton still has a lot of lost ground to recover.</p>",

Actually, though, the new stance is probably sensible for two reasons. First, Asos\u2019 forecasting record was reliably terrible. Second, competition has become stiffer since those long-ago days when Asos seemed to have the twentysomething fast fashion field to itself. Boohoo, with its PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands, has planted itself on the same patch. Meanwhile, Next\u2019s online operation is rapidly expanding into the world of third-party brands and never seems to suffer the warehousing hiccups that have plagued Asos in the past year. Beighton says the problems at Asos have now been fixed. If so, investors may eventually discover the answer to the profit margin riddle. The reassurance for investors is that Asos has beefed up its cast of non-executive directors, led by chairman Adam Crozier, the former ITV chief executive, and they surely won\u2019t tolerate an operational relapse. The prickly Beighton still has a lot of lost ground to recover.",

The frequency with which ERG and DUP figures are entering and exiting 10 Downing Street this week suggests Johnson is keen to bring both on board \u2013 indeed, he has no choice if a deal is to have any chance of getting through Westminster. If Johnson is going to appease both then the appeasement will have to come in some form other than in the substance of the agreement.

The DUP\u2019s newly found fondness for the Good Friday agreement puts them in line for having a say over where Northern Ireland will be aligned at the end of a transition period. Perhaps they are hoping to exploit British commentators\u2019 lack of familiarity with the 1998 agreement as much as they are planning to exploit voters\u2019 lack of care for the differences between customs unions, partnerships and territories.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/brexit-talks-on-knife-edge-as-dup-voices-fears-for-union\">Key DUP member voices concerns over Brexit deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But when all is said and done, the realities of Brexit will have an impact right on their doorstep.

Who dare raise the obvious point that May\u2019s original withdrawal agreement was the version that could give the most succour both to unionists and Brexiteers? The frequency with which ERG and DUP figures are entering and exiting 10 Downing Street this week suggests Johnson is keen to bring both on board \u2013 indeed, he has no choice if a deal is to have any chance of getting through Westminster. If Johnson is going to appease both then the appeasement will have to come in some form other than in the substance of the agreement. For the ERG this may be about creating the conditions for a hard Brexit in the medium term; for the DUP, it may be about being able to present it as a win for unionism. And thus we return to the matter of \u201cconsent\u201d. The DUP\u2019s newly found fondness for the Good Friday agreement puts them in line for having a say over where Northern Ireland will be aligned at the end of a transition period. Perhaps they are hoping to exploit British commentators\u2019 lack of familiarity with the 1998 agreement as much as they are planning to exploit voters\u2019 lack of care for the differences between customs unions, partnerships and territories. But when all is said and done, the realities of Brexit will have an impact right on their doorstep. And a dysfunctional Northern Ireland will not only be an albatross around the neck of Britain (again); it would be a responsibility that the DUP would have to carry. Northern Ireland \u2013 and the Irish border in particular \u2013 is the point at which the UK and EU come together. Rip them apart and the north\u2019s economy, society, politics and peace are also rent asunder. This week a report I\u2019m writing, about the Brexit border, published its interim findings. The study into the central border region of Ireland/Northern Ireland showed that Brexit is already having a tangible negative impact in economic and social terms. Undoing the harm already caused \u2013 let alone preventing further destruction \u2013 will be a challenge that Northern Ireland politicians of all hues will have to take on. As the clock ticks towards 31 October, the DUP must be aware it is a sore that few in Britain will rush to salve. \u2022 Katy Hayward is a reader in sociology at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and the author of Bordering on Brexit",

      "body": "<p>Even a broad church must be bound by a common faith. Labour\u2019s founding purpose was to secure parliamentary representation for organised labour, and to use that power to advance the collective conditions of working people. Sure, there were some interpretations of that historic mission that were more radical than others. Some believed it meant humanising the existing system, others replacing it altogether. (Even New Labour, which struck an accommodation with Thatcherism, invested in public services, the minimum wage and tax credits to improve the lot of millions of working-class people.)</p> <p>A striking exception in Labour history was the premiership of Ramsay MacDonald who, in 1931, attempted to slash public spending and unemployment benefits. When his own party refused to sanction such a remorseless assault on the British working class, MacDonald formed a coalition with the Conservatives, provoking swift expulsion from Labour and leaving his legacy in the history books a byword for betrayal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Workers' rights, environmental and social protections: they will be tossed on a bonfire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which brings me on to those Labour MPs minded to vote for a Tory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/could-boris-johnsons-brexit-deal-pass-through-parliament\" title=\"\">Brexit deal</a>, including one negotiated by Boris Johnson to suit the ideological fantasies of his party\u2019s right. Theresa May was forced to commit to maintain a level playing field with the EU\u2019s workers\u2019 rights and environmental and social policies: in other words, they would remain the baseline, with Britain only able to improve on them. Not so under Johnson: such protections will be tossed on a bonfire, triggering a race to the bottom in hard-won rights.</p> <p>When Angela Merkel talks of a post-Brexit Britain as a <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-sees-post-brexit-uk-as-potential-competitor-to-eu-emmanuel-macron/\" title=\"\">potential competitor</a>, she doesn\u2019t mean because Germany fears a British lion flourishing after being liberated from its cage, but rather of being undercut by inferior rights, protections and wages. This paves the way, of course, for a deal with Donald Trump\u2019s US, where social guarantees are far weaker than in the UK. The Tories have dismissed the president\u2019s original call for the NHS to be on the negotiating table, and yet the only consistency in the Johnson administration is untrustworthiness. Then there\u2019s the peril facing what remains of British industry: according to a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50019069\" title=\"\">letter signed by five </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50019069\" title=\"\">sectors </a>\u2013 ranging from automotive to pharmaceutical \u2013 Johnson\u2019s planned dealignment with EU regulations threatens \u201chuge new costs\u201d and disruption. </p> <p>A Labour MP who votes for a Johnson Brexit deal is voting to slash the living standards, rights and jobs of the very people their party exists to represent and champion. The Tory right always saw Brexit as an opportunity to recast society in their hyper-Thatcherite, dystopian image, where the rich and big business pay little tax, where regulations are eliminated, where workers can be hired and fired on a whim, and where the frontiers of the state can be rolled away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/16/at-first-accepted-brexit-now-clear-must-not-leave-eu\">At first, I accepted Brexit. Now it\u2019s become clear that we must not leave the EU | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A Johnson deal is class war from above, a Tory heist, a scalpel taken to the country\u2019s social fabric. And if a Labour MP votes for such a deal, their betrayal of the most basic reasons their party even exists means they should no longer be a Labour MP, that the party\u2019s leadership should withdraw the whip, or the national executive committee should deselect them.</p> <p>There are 19 Labour backbenchers who have written to the EU urging a deal to be negotiated with the Tories that they can vote for. How many would seriously vote for Johnson\u2019s deal is open to question. But if a Labour MP voted for, say, a Conservative budget or Queen\u2019s speech, they would expect to be evicted from the parliamentary party. This is worse by some magnitude.</p> <p>Such MPs would hand Johnson an electoral boost before an election that could decide Britain\u2019s political direction for a generation. Even a moderate rebellion will grant the Lib Dems a political gift, allowing them to disingenuously claim Labour shares responsibility, advancing their mission to split the anti-Tory vote.</p> <p>While it is true that Labour MPs representing leave seats feel that a remain-dominated left does not understand or empathise with their plight, they don\u2019t tend to have doors slammed in their faces by angry remainers insisting that Labour more enthusiastically embrace their cause. It is much more likely to be leave voters who engage in that type of behaviour on the doorstep, demanding to know why the referendum result has not been implemented. The MPs too are provoked by Labour leave voters questioning their \u201cLabour values\u201d .</p> <p>Yet they must know that those leave voters did not actually seek to trash their rights at work, to destroy their employment or to attack environmental protections when they voted to leave the EU in 2016. If they wanted Thatcherism on speed, they would not be voting for the Labour party. What do claims of \u201cLabour values\u201d amount to other than defensive platitudes if a member of a self-described democratic socialist party is willing to vote for ideological schemes originating in the writings of the uber free-market economist Friedrich Hayek?</p> <p>Whether a Labour parliamentarian hails from the left or right flank of their party is irrelevant. If voting for this cataclysmic deal is not incompatible with party membership, then what is? And what future awaits these MPs when the horror show they\u2019ve signed off on unfolds? The Tory Brexiteers will never respect them, their movement will reject them, and their voters will one day blame them. Ending their political career may be distressing enough, but they may soon find that losing their political dignity is even more haunting.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Sure, there were some interpretations of that historic mission that were more radical than others. Some believed it meant humanising the existing system, others replacing it altogether. (Even New Labour, which struck an accommodation with Thatcherism, invested in public services, the minimum wage and tax credits to improve the lot of millions of working-class people.) A striking exception in Labour history was the premiership of Ramsay MacDonald who, in 1931, attempted to slash public spending and unemployment benefits. When his own party refused to sanction such a remorseless assault on the British working class, MacDonald formed a coalition with the Conservatives, provoking swift expulsion from Labour and leaving his legacy in the history books a byword for betrayal. Which brings me on to those Labour MPs minded to vote for a Tory Brexit deal, including one negotiated by Boris Johnson to suit the ideological fantasies of his party\u2019s right. Theresa May was forced to commit to maintain a level playing field with the EU\u2019s workers\u2019 rights and environmental and social policies: in other words, they would remain the baseline, with Britain only able to improve on them. Not so under Johnson: such protections will be tossed on a bonfire, triggering a race to the bottom in hard-won rights. When Angela Merkel talks of a post-Brexit Britain as a potential competitor, she doesn\u2019t mean because Germany fears a British lion flourishing after being liberated from its cage, but rather of being undercut by inferior rights, protections and wages. This paves the way, of course, for a deal with Donald Trump\u2019s US, where social guarantees are far weaker than in the UK. The Tories have dismissed the president\u2019s original call for the NHS to be on the negotiating table, and yet the only consistency in the Johnson administration is untrustworthiness. Then there\u2019s the peril facing what remains of British industry: according to a letter signed by five sectors \u2013 ranging from automotive to pharmaceutical \u2013 Johnson\u2019s planned dealignment with EU regulations threatens \u201chuge new costs\u201d and disruption. A Labour MP who votes for a Johnson Brexit deal is voting to slash the living standards, rights and jobs of the very people their party exists to represent and champion. The Tory right always saw Brexit as an opportunity to recast society in their hyper-Thatcherite, dystopian image, where the rich and big business pay little tax, where regulations are eliminated, where workers can be hired and fired on a whim, and where the frontiers of the state can be rolled away. A Johnson deal is class war from above, a Tory heist, a scalpel taken to the country\u2019s social fabric. And if a Labour MP votes for such a deal, their betrayal of the most basic reasons their party even exists means they should no longer be a Labour MP, that the party\u2019s leadership should withdraw the whip, or the national executive committee should deselect them. There are 19 Labour backbenchers who have written to the EU urging a deal to be negotiated with the Tories that they can vote for. How many would seriously vote for Johnson\u2019s deal is open to question. But if a Labour MP voted for, say, a Conservative budget or Queen\u2019s speech, they would expect to be evicted from the parliamentary party. This is worse by some magnitude. Such MPs would hand Johnson an electoral boost before an election that could decide Britain\u2019s political direction for a generation. Even a moderate rebellion will grant the Lib Dems a political gift, allowing them to disingenuously claim Labour shares responsibility, advancing their mission to split the anti-Tory vote. While it is true that Labour MPs representing leave seats feel that a remain-dominated left does not understand or empathise with their plight, they don\u2019t tend to have doors slammed in their faces by angry remainers insisting that Labour more enthusiastically embrace their cause. It is much more likely to be leave voters who engage in that type of behaviour on the doorstep, demanding to know why the referendum result has not been implemented. The MPs too are provoked by Labour leave voters questioning their \u201cLabour values\u201d . Yet they must know that those leave voters did not actually seek to trash their rights at work, to destroy their employment or to attack environmental protections when they voted to leave the EU in 2016. If they wanted Thatcherism on speed, they would not be voting for the Labour party. What do claims of \u201cLabour values\u201d amount to other than defensive platitudes if a member of a self-described democratic socialist party is willing to vote for ideological schemes originating in the writings of the uber free-market economist Friedrich Hayek? Whether a Labour parliamentarian hails from the left or right flank of their party is irrelevant. If voting for this cataclysmic deal is not incompatible with party membership, then what is? And what future awaits these MPs when the horror show they\u2019ve signed off on unfolds? The Tory Brexiteers will never respect them, their movement will reject them, and their voters will one day blame them. Ending their political career may be distressing enough, but they may soon find that losing their political dignity is even more haunting. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

Hatred of the backstop has its origin in the ambition to extricate the UK economy from social protections preferred by many European countries.

The similarity of political constraints on the two Tory leaders \u2013 the strain of managing a minority government \u2013 creates a false impression that their Brexit deals are alike. But Mr Johnson\u2019s approach renounces frictionless trade. It sacrifices access to EU markets on an altar of deregulation. His cut-throat competition model complicates negotiation of level-playing field provisions \u2013 the presumption of equivalent market conditions between trading partners. That introduces new hurdles for the completion of a free-trade agreement with Brussels post-Brexit. It erects costly new barriers, not just with Ireland but at every port in the UK. Hard Brexiters imagine compensation for restricted European access in the form of new free-trade deals around the world, but those would take time to negotiate, especially if discussions had to happen in parallel with the next stage of Brussels talks. The certain outcome is a prolonged period of trading limbo, the cost of which would come from the pockets of British workers.</p> <p>Mr Johnson\u2019s frantic rush to strike a Brexit bargain by 31 October has forced a focus on technicalities of withdrawal, but it also serves his agenda to distract attention from the bigger picture. Next week\u2019s deadline has become a prop in a political drama, scripted by the prime minister, in which the 11th-hour delivery of a deal is meant to be the heroic climax.</p> <p>But Brexit is not a game to help advance one man\u2019s ambitions. It involves choices that will shape the strategic direction of the country for generations and affect millions of livelihoods. Any deal Mr Johnson can strike now is just the vehicle for withdrawal; what matters most is the eventual destination. The rhetoric he has relied upon, the fanatics he flatters and the political trajectory of his career all indicate a plan to take Britain in entirely the wrong direction.</p>",

That vision implies a different future relationship with the EU from the one signalled by Mrs May. The similarity of political constraints on the two Tory leaders \u2013 the strain of managing a minority government \u2013 creates a false impression that their Brexit deals are alike. But Mr Johnson\u2019s approach renounces frictionless trade. It sacrifices access to EU markets on an altar of deregulation. His cut-throat competition model complicates negotiation of level-playing field provisions \u2013 the presumption of equivalent market conditions between trading partners. That introduces new hurdles for the completion of a free-trade agreement with Brussels post-Brexit. It erects costly new barriers, not just with Ireland but at every port in the UK. Hard Brexiters imagine compensation for restricted European access in the form of new free-trade deals around the world, but those would take time to negotiate, especially if discussions had to happen in parallel with the next stage of Brussels talks. The certain outcome is a prolonged period of trading limbo, the cost of which would come from the pockets of British workers. Mr Johnson\u2019s frantic rush to strike a Brexit bargain by 31 October has forced a focus on technicalities of withdrawal, but it also serves his agenda to distract attention from the bigger picture. Next week\u2019s deadline has become a prop in a political drama, scripted by the prime minister, in which the 11th-hour delivery of a deal is meant to be the heroic climax. But Brexit is not a game to help advance one man\u2019s ambitions. It involves choices that will shape the strategic direction of the country for generations and affect millions of livelihoods. Any deal Mr Johnson can strike now is just the vehicle for withdrawal; what matters most is the eventual destination. The rhetoric he has relied upon, the fanatics he flatters and the political trajectory of his career all indicate a plan to take Britain in entirely the wrong direction.",

      "bodyText": "Three American diplomats were briefly detained in Russia near the military test site where a mysterious explosion released radiation in August, several Russia state news agencies have reported. The US embassy has confirmed the incident, the Interfax news service reported, but said the three diplomats had filed the proper paperwork to travel in the area. The Russian foreign ministry said the diplomats had named a different city as their destination and had \u201cobviously got lost\u201d. The report comes just days after the United States said the accident was caused by a nuclear reaction when Russia tried to retrieve a nuclear-powered cruise missile from the Barents Sea. The diplomats were detained on Monday on a train in the city of Severodvinsk, near where Russian authorities said they had been testing a rocket engine with a nuclear component before the accident took place. The diplomats, who have been identified by Interfax as military attaches, were later released, but could face administrative charges for traveling in a restricted military area, agencies reported. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry confirmed that the diplomats were on an official trip and had informed the Russian defence ministry of their plans. \u201cOnly, they said their intention was to visit Arkhangelsk and they ended up en route to Severodvinsk,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cThey obviously got lost. We are ready to give the US embassy a map of Russia,\u201d the ministry added. The blast at the military test site in August killed at least five people and caused panic after radiation levels jumped to 16 times their normal levels in nearby Severodvinsk. Russian authorities have given little information about the accident. But a US diplomat this week said that the accident took place when Russia attempted to retrieve a nuclear-powered cruise missile called Burevestnik from the Barents Sea. \u201cThe United States has determined that the explosion near Nyonoksa was the result of a nuclear reaction that occurred during the recovery of a Russian nuclear-powered cruise missile,\u201d Thomas DiNanno, the diplomat, said during a speech at the UN. Russia\u2019s plans for a nuclear-powered cruise missile that could in theory fly indefinitely were first revealed by Vladimir Putin during a speech last year. The missile is still undergoing testing, and some weapons experts doubt if it can ever be made operable. Russia\u2019s military was attempting to retrieve the missile from another failed 2017 test when the accident took place. It was not immediately clear whether the diplomats were traveling to or from Nyonoksa, the village near the military testing site, when they were detained. But train timetables would indicate they were returning from the village when they were arrested close to 6pm in Severodvinsk.

      "bodyText": "Nursing mothers and youths blockaded Google\u2019s London headquarters on Wednesday in protest at the company\u2019s funding of climate deniers, as Extinction Rebellion defied a police order by continuing to stage actions in the capital. A Guardian investigation revealed last week that Google had made \u201csubstantial\u201d contributions to some of the most notorious climate deniers in Washington, despite its insistence that it supports action on the climate emergency. Mothers of infants held a \u201cnurse-in\u201d outside the company\u2019s offices in King\u2019s Cross and members of XR Youth climbed on top of the entrance to Google-owned YouTube, on the other side of the same building, holding a banner reading, \u201cYouTube, stop climate denial\u201d. In a letter to YouTube, they said the platform, which has 1.9bn users, had a responsibility to stop hosting \u201cmisleading and inherently dangerous\u201d climate denial videos. They pointed out that a recent survey found more than half of teenagers in the US said they got their news from YouTube. As of 8am on Wednesday there had been 1,642 arrests made over XR protests, according to the Metropolitan police. The rate of arrests accelerated on Monday night after the police imposed a section 14 order in effect banning all protest by the group in London. Lawyers for XR filed an application for an urgent judicial review hearing at the high court. Tobias Garnett, a human rights lawyer working with XR\u2019s legal team, said they would argue that the order was an infringement of the right to protest, was disproportionate, and went beyond the powers given to police by the Public Order Act. \u201cThere\u2019s a general consensus that this is unlawful overreach and that it risks criminalising anyone who seeks to protest about the climate and ecological emergency,\u201d he said. The application was accepted for a directions hearing at 2pm on Thursday. One of the applicants in the case is Ellie Chowns, a Green MEP who was among those arrested under the new order on Trafalgar Square on Monday night. She said she had not been part of the protests and had been arrested after asking questions of police officers about the legality of their actions. She said: \u201cI do plan to go to Trafalgar Square at lunchtime today to stand in solidarity with the Extinction Rebellion protesters because I believe that the right to protest peacefully in a public place is a fundamental cornerstone of our democracy.\u201d The Met\u2019s deputy assistant commissioner, Laurence Taylor, denied that the force had banned protests and said it had every right to order the demonstrations in Trafalgar Square and elsewhere to end on Monday evening, after nine days. He said \u201csignificant disruption\u201d had been caused to London and the Met was under such strain that it had had to draft in 500 officers from across the country. In spite of the order, hundreds of protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square on Wednesday afternoon for a people\u2019s assembly, asking: \u201cHow do we respond to the silence of the government on the climate and ecological emergency in the face of the attempt to silence people with a London-wide ban on our peaceful assembly?\u201d Police issued attendees with notice of the section 14 and at one stage confiscated a packed-up tent. Among those who addressed the crowd was George Monbiot, the Guardian environment writer, who went on to block the road at the top of Whitehall along with a number of other activists including Jonathan Bartley, a co-leader of the Green party. Monbiot was later arrested. Shortly after he was carried away by police, Monbiot said: \u201cI feel we\u2019ve got to make as much of a stand as we possibly can to prevent ecocide. Business as usual, politics as usual \u2013 that is ecocide. It\u2019s the destruction of conditions that make life possible on this earth.

      "bodyText": "Iran will further reduce its commitment to the nuclear deal signed with world powers by limiting international inspectors\u2019 access to its nuclear sites, senior Iranian MPs have said. The move, which is expected to take place at the beginning of November, will be the fourth Iranian step away from the deal, and puts pressure on France, Germany and the UK to make some form of counter-move. The joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) was signed in 2015 but Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018, placing pressure on Europe to prove to Iran it was worth sticking with the deal. On Wednesday, the spokesman for the Iranian parliament\u2019s national security committee, Hossein Naghavi-Hosseini, said: \u201cIn the fourth step of reducing JCPOA commitments, we will probably impose limits on inspections, which means the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s surveillance on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities will be reduced.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen the other party doesn\u2019t fulfil its commitments, there is no necessity for us to meet our part of commitments. \u201cWe will certainly take the fourth step of reducing commitments to the JCPOA; Europeans have not honoured their part of the commitments and we have not seen any practical step taken by the other side.\u201d On Monday the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said Tehran was working on advanced IR-9 centrifuges for uranium enrichment. Those centrifuges do not appear in the 2015 accord. The French foreign ministry publicly urged Iran not to take what it said would be \u201cparticularly worrying steps\u201d. Iran has justified the step by step reduction in its commitment by pointing to the EU\u2019s inability to make good on its promises to increase trade between Iran and Europe. In July, Iran abandoned two of its commitments under the deal by allowing its stockpile of enriched uranium to exceed the 300kg limit and breaching the cap on the purity of its uranium stocks. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, earlier this month told the French parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee it was up to Iran to pick up the proposals his country sought to broker at the UN general assembly in New York last month. He said: \u201cWe consider that these initiatives, which didn\u2019t succeed, are still on the table and it is up to Iran and the United States to seize [them] in a relatively short amount of time because Iran has announced new measures to reduce its commitments to the Vienna accord [JCPOA] in November.\u201d Tensions between France and Iran have risen after the Iranian intelligence agencies captured an Iranian exile based in Paris, Rouhollah Zam, who had led a media campaign against the government. He was captured in Jordan this week on his way to Baghdad. France has also disclosed that Iran has detained Roland Marchal, a senior researcher from Sciences Po University in Paris, since June. The tensions came as the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said one or more foreign powers were behind the missile attack on an Iranian tanker in the Red Sea last week. Despite the bellicose rhetoric, Iran is exploring if there is room for mediation with Saudi Arabia, after Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from Syria and his refusal to take military action against Iran in the wake of the September missile attacks on the Aramco Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities.",

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, congratulated Praeger for her \u201coutstanding contribution to mathematics\u201d. \u201cOur science community plays such a big role in the prosperity of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cScientists are the ultimate problem solvers. They grow the economy and create jobs.\u201d Karen Andrews, the industry, science and technology minister, said female representation in the honours had gone \u201cfrom just one female recipient last year to five this year, the most ever represented in the awards\u201d. \u201cI hope this will inspire even more girls and women to be involved in [science, technology, engineering and maths],\u201d she said. The Walter and Eliza Hall institute of medical research won the prime minister\u2019s prize for innovation for its role in developing a breakthrough anti-cancer drug. The group of researchers including Peter Czabotar, David Huang, Guillaume Lessene and Andrew Roberts were recognised for their roles in developing venetoclax, a drug that can flick a switch within a leukaemia cell to kill it. Both major awards have prize money of $250,000. Other award recipients included: Samantha Moyle and Sarah Finney for excellence in science teaching in secondary and primary school Laura MacKay, who won the Frank Fenner prize for life scientist of the year for work in identifying the role of tissue-resident T cells in protecting the body from infection and cancer Elizabeth New, who won the Malcolm McIntosh prize for physical scientist of the year for pioneering the development of new chemical imaging tools to observe healthy and diseased cells Luke Campbell, who won the new innovator prize for inventing the nura, headphones that adapt to an individual\u2019s unique hearing to enhance the audio experience. Those awards have prize money of $50,000. In 2016 the chief scientist released a report that found just 16% of the 2.3 million Stem-qualified Australians are female; the largest gender gap was in engineering. Despite a focus at the government level on Stem courses to improve innovation, the Grattan Institute has argued that science graduates have worse job prospects than those in technology, engineering and maths and worse pay outcomes.",

      "bodyText": "This week it was a man objecting to his wife cooking herself a comfort meal. \u201cAm I the asshole?\u201d he asked the internet. She was sick, he explained, in the grip of an endometriosis flare up, and made bolognese to cheer herself up. The problem is he\u2019s vegetarian and would either have to cook for himself or go hungry for one whole night. \u201cI argued calmly I felt like I was being cheated out of a nice meal,\u201d the most un-self-aware man on the planet wrote on Reddit\u2019s AITA (Am I the Asshole?) forum, a modern crowd-sourced advice column where people seek arbitration on their behaviour. \u201cShe burst into tears and asked why I was being so fucking difficult about this. Now I feel like a dick. So, Reddit, AITA?\u201d It was screenshot, reposted and discussed in a frenzy of can-you-believe-this. Before him it was a father wondering if it was so wrong he and his wife let their \u201cactive\u201d four-year-old \u201cexplore\u201d a \u201cmedium-nice\u201d restaurant while they ate. He was upset when a waitress juggling a tray of food reprimanded their precious child. \u201cI felt it was completely uncalled for,\u201d the second most un-self-aware man on the planet wrote to Slate\u2019s parenting advice column, Care and Feeding. Flash back further and you\u2019ll find a woman with a potentially fatal allergy to mushrooms grappling with parents-in-law who were sneaking mushrooms \u2013 even mushroom powder \u2013 into almost every meal. \u201cShort of taking them a doctor\u2019s note, telling them my allergy is real, I\u2019m not sure what to do,\u201d she lamented to New York Magazine\u2019s Ask Polly. Each of these viral problems achieved something seemingly impossible in our divided, hyper-partisan online world. They provided rare moments of unity and moral clarity. \u201cIn these difficult times, I\u2019m glad we can all come together and agree that this man objectively sucks,\u201d the feminist writer Jessica Valenti tweeted about the first problem. We are living in a new golden age of advice columns. They\u2019re everywhere \u2013 thanks to readers like me who can\u2019t get enough \u2013 and they\u2019re better than ever. They range from the pithy (Reddit) and the utilitarian (Ask a Manager) to the genuinely philosophical. When I can\u2019t sleep at night, sometimes I turn on the Dear Sugar podcast \u2013 the smooth voices, wisdom and empathy of hosts Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond is a weighted blanket for the soul. The first golden age of agony aunts, as they were once known, began in the mid 19th century and was powered by technological and cultural change: mass media and mass literacy converging with shifting social mores. Cheap to produce and compulsive to read, these columns proliferated in newspapers and magazines, instructing anonymous readers \u2013 frequently concerned women \u2013 how to behave properly and, often, be good wives. The new boom is similarly made possible by technological shifts. Asking for, sharing and bingeing on advice is ever more accessible. The irresistible allure of other people\u2019s problems remains a big drawcard. \u201cThey\u2019re even more assuring these days because they\u2019re an antidote to the angst of observing everyone\u2019s polished social media,\u201d one friend and fellow addict observed. \u201cThey\u2019re a reminder that everyone doesn\u2019t have their shit together.\u201d They\u2019re also an affirmation of the indignities and frustrations we all endure. It\u2019s little surprise the genre of AITA problems that often strike a chord with women are those that highlight the cluelessness of some men about the imbalance of labour, both domestic and emotional, in heterosexual relationships (like the aforementioned vegetarian left to fend for himself for one meal). Many women share these questions as if to say \u201csee what we have to put up with out here?\u201d But there\u2019s more to the new gilded age than that. In a world where traditional moral structures and authorities have crumbled and real-world communities have fractured, these corners of the internet offer rare, ordered space to collectively process who we are today, and what an ethical, satisfying life might look like. From the most irritating minutiae of modern life (Help! My Sister\u2019s Fianc\u00e9e Has a Fake Service Dog) to the biggest questions (I\u2019m Paralysed by Anxiety About Climate Change), someone has asked \u2013 and someone has answered. For me, it\u2019s the answers more than the questions that keep me coming back. Advice columns are no longer just a place to ask questions we can\u2019t broach with family or friends for fear of embarrassment. Many now serve to answer questions that would be wholly foreign to our parents. The unimpeachable, all knowing (and usually straight, white and prim) agony aunt has given way to a more diverse generation of writers who openly discuss their own faults and lives, or crowds coming together in comment threads and forums. There\u2019s less moral absolutism and more let\u2019s figure this out. Since coming out as trans, Dear Prudence\u2019s Daniel Mallory Ortberg frequently helps his readers navigate coming out to their families or how to be a good ally. Consent in the age of #MeToo was explored across three moving episodes of Dear Sugar, where the hosts reckoned with their sexual histories alongside their listeners. Ask Polly has become something of a beacon to listless, anxious and broke millennials seeking reassurance that they\u2019re doing OK. \u201cLearn to treat yourself the way a loving older parent would,\u201d she told one questioner. \u201cTell yourself: this reckoning serves a purpose.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s because we live in such uncertain times \u2013 an era marked by the absence, indeed the refusal, to commit to solutions to the big problems threatening our very existence. Reading about climate change, inequality and rising extremism can make us feel hopeless and adrift. Is it any wonder that a place where problems, however small, are earnestly shared and thoughtfully resolved is so alluring, and can maybe even help us sleep at night?",

Last week the former officer, Rick Flori, was told by the state\u2019s information watchdog that police could not provide information relating to \u201cpublic interest disclosures\u201d he made between 2010 and 2018 because \u201cthe information is nonexistent\u201d. Police had told the office of the information commissioner they did not keep a public interest disclosures register like other government agencies, but instead kept an internal complaints management system. \u201cComplaints are not classified as [public interest disclosures] through this recording mechanism,\u201d police said. \u201cThere is no meaningful way of filtering \u2018possible [public interest disclosures]\u2019 through the system.\u201d Agencies are required to keep records of all public interest disclosures, which carry specific protections under Queensland law. A leading integrity expert at Griffith University, AJ Brown, said it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cworrisome\u201d if police did not have a system to easily identify and monitor disclosures. Sources with detailed knowledge of the Queensland public interest disclosure system have questioned whether the police statements were designed to restrict information released to Flori, who is suing the service in relation to alleged reprisals. The suggestion that police do not keep accurate records of public interest disclosures appears at odds with previous statements. In 2010 the assistant commissioner, Peter Martin, gave information about numbers and types of disclosures. \u201cThe claim is nonsense and the QPS knows it,\u201d Flori said in an email to the commissioner, Katarina Carroll. Flori has emails and other records that confirm a complaint he made in 2010 was recorded as a public interest disclosure. He also made a number of allegations he says are public interest disclosures up to 2018. Flori is well known in Queensland as the officer who made public a recording of four colleagues battering an unarmed Gold Coast father in a police station carpark. None of the officers was charged. Instead police attempted to prosecute Flori for releasing the footage, taken from the basement of the Surfers Paradise police station in 2012. He was found not guilty of misconduct last year and subsequently launched a civil case, naming the police service and several senior officers as defendants, alleging he had been targeted for reprisals. The Queensland police service did not respond to a request for comment. Brown, an expert on whistleblower protections, said government agencies were required to keep proper records of public interest disclosures, even if they had complaints systems. \u201cIt would be rather absurd if the police service did not have these records,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be strange and worrisome if the police complaint management system did not allow them to identify \u2026 matters under the [public interest disclosure] act. \u201cUnless there\u2019s a system for keeping proper records of a disclosure, there\u2019s no way of knowing that it has been handled properly and that a whistleblower hasn\u2019t ended up suffering reprisals or the investigation has been mismanaged, which are fundamental reasons for the legislation.\u201d",

In September, a two-week private expedition to monitor and tag sawfish in the Norman River, Queensland, returned without finding a single sawfish. Sawfish are known for their distinct protruding toothed saw \u2013 or rostrum \u2013 that can detect electrical signals and movement from nearby prey before swiping at it. Some sawfish can grow to seven metres in length, with the saw accounting for about one-quarter its length. The largetooth and green sawfish are internationally listed as critically endangered, and the dwarf and narrow sawfish are listed as endangered. All four exist in coastal habitats in the Gulf of Carpentaria, considered to be a global stronghold for sawfish. Guardian Australia can reveal three conservation groups have written to the Department of Environment asking for a suite of rules and restrictions to be imposed on the Queensland-managed Gulf of Carpentaria Inshore Fin Fish Fishery. A national recovery plan for three of the sawfish species, published in 2015, states the main threats include commercial, recreational and unregulated fishing, Indigenous fishing and habitat changes. The sawfish rostrum easily tangles around ropes and fishing nets. Aquarist Nicole Weller, of the Sea Life Sydney aquarium, returned from a 14-day sawfish monitoring trip in the Gulf of Carpentaria in September without finding a single sawfish. Weller said they searched across three different sites along the Norman River but poor weather and murky water made the task harder. She said: \u201cWe were looking to find them, measure them and tag them. We were hopeful that we would have found at least one, so to not get any was disappointing.\u201d Dr Barbara Wueringer, founder and principal scientist at Sharks and Rays Australia, a conservation group that organised the trip, said they had been visiting river systems over the past five years to gather data on sawfish. She said: \u201cWe do know the numbers have declined. Northern Australia is the last global stronghold for four of the five species of sawfish.

They\u2019re not targeted by fishing, but they are being caught. We have to deal with this bycatch issue so that animals can be released safely.\u201d He said pressures on sawfish were less in western areas of the gulf in the Northern Territory where there was little fishing activity. The Queensland Department of Fisheries has applied to the federal government for a renewal of the Wildlife Trade Operation for its Gulf of Carpentaria fishery. According to its application, some 395 \u201csawfish and rays\u201d were caught as bycatch in the fishery between 2003 and 2017. Conservation groups WWF, the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) and Humane Society International, have written to the federal environment department to ask for a range of restrictions to be placed on the fishery to stop sawfish being caught. In a submission seen by Guardian Australia, the groups say a lack of rules in the fishery would \u201clikely to lead to the extirpation of sawfish\u201d and the rare \u201cspeartooth\u201d river shark. Dr Leonardo Guida, a campaigner at AMCS, said \u201cto help the survival of the species\u201d the \u201cmost tangible and effective\u201d step would be to remove gillnets from critical habitats. He said a lack of independent observers on boats in the region meant that reported bycatch numbers were likely an underestimate, adding: \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure how many sawfish have been caught, or what species, and we don\u2019t know the fate of them.\u201d Dr Richard Pillans, a CSIRO research scientist, said it was \u201cirrefutable\u201d that the numbers of sawfish left were much lower than they were \u201c100 years ago\u201d. He said the level of reporting of sawfish as bycatch was \u201cgenerally acknowledged to be an underestimate\u201d. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said that due to concern for the conservation status of the narrow sawfish, on 29 September she had prioritised the species for a threatened species assessment under the EPBC Act. She said: \u201cThe department is currently assessing the new application from Fin Fish Fishery\u2019s against the EPBC Act and a fundamental part of that assessment will be to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to minimise the impacts of fishing on all bycatch species, including protected species.\u201d She added the government had invested more than $850,000 over the past four years on the national recovery plan for sawfish and river sharks. A spokesperson for the minister added she was \u201ccognisant of the concerns raised by conservation groups and the public regarding bycatch of sawfish and speartooth shark in the Gulf of Carpentaria Inshore Fin Fish Fishery.\u201d A Queensland Department of Fisheries spokesperson said under its Sustainable Fisheries Strategy, \u201cthe Queensland Government has committed to undertaking ecological risk assessments for priority fisheries.\u201d An assessment of Gulf of Carpentaria fisheries was currently underway, the spokesperson said. The department said while a \u201cnumber of sawfish are caught in nets\u201d many were \u201csuccessfully released alive.\u201d Publicly available data from fishing logbooks show only 46 sawfish had died from capture between 2006 and 2018, but this data covers all of Queensland. Fisheries Queensland was also looking at \u201cadditional education\u201d to help fishers with techniques to release sawfish. The spokesperson added: \u201cIt is illegal to be in possession of any part of any no-take species, which sawfish are under fisheries legislation in Queensland. This means that it is illegal to be in possession of a sawfish rostrum.\u201d",

Extinction Rebellion is one of several major examples of nonviolent civil disobedience and direct action over the last year, including the school climate strikes and the resistance to the DSEI arms fair in London in September, which itself resulted in over 100 arrests.</p> <p>Nonviolent resistance exposes as a lie the claim that power can be maintained only through violence. Active nonviolence \u2013 including direct action, civil disobedience and mass non-cooperation, as well as many forms of lawful campaigning \u2013 undermines the common notion that we must choose between violence and passivity.

It\u2019s the only way to save the planet, 16 October), nonviolent civil disobedience has been a vital part of achieving political and social change. Examples in the UK range from votes for women to the rights of Welsh speakers. Progress comes from below, not from above. While some may be more critical of Extinction Rebellion than others, the police\u2019s outrageous attempt to ban its protests in London is a reminder that active nonviolence disturbs the powerful and those who maintain the status quo. Extinction Rebellion is one of several major examples of nonviolent civil disobedience and direct action over the last year, including the school climate strikes and the resistance to the DSEI arms fair in London in September, which itself resulted in over 100 arrests. Nonviolent resistance exposes as a lie the claim that power can be maintained only through violence. Active nonviolence \u2013 including direct action, civil disobedience and mass non-cooperation, as well as many forms of lawful campaigning \u2013 undermines the common notion that we must choose between violence and passivity. As pacifists have long maintained, nonviolence is an ethical and effective alternative to both. Symon Hill Campaigns and communications manager, Peace Pledge Union \u2022 Polly Toynbee is spot-on (The veteran heroes of Extinction, G2, 16 October). We oldies have been demonstrating against Trident, the Iraq war, the poll tax, etc for many years \u2013 and getting arrested. I am unable to be in London for the present actions, although I have marched and demonstrated about climate change in Scotland. I am biding my time until November next year, when the next COP summit takes place in Glasgow. This gives me lots of time to plan something really significant. Rose Harvie Dumbarton",

      "bodyText": "An experienced army officer who oversaw a course during which a soldier fatally collapsed on a hot summer day has told an inquest he had been given no formal health and safety training. Cpl Joshua Hoole, 26, died within an hour of collapsing on an annual fitness test (AFT) in Brecon, south Wales, in July 2016. Three years earlier, three army reservists sustained fatal heat illness during an SAS selection march in the Brecon Beacons. Capt Colin Nufer, who has served in the armed forces for more than 30 years, told the inquest at Birmingham coroner\u2019s court he took a \u201ccommonsense\u201d approach to assessing whether a march should be stopped because of health and safety concerns. Nufer, who was the officer commanding (OC) of the training team, which ran the AFT, refused to answer some questions from a barrister for the Ministry of Defence (MoD), saying he did not trust the people the lawyer represented. The inquest was told Nufer signed off a risk assessment for the march, and he was asked by the senior coroner Louise Hunt about his understanding of a key army health and safety document known as JSP 539, which addresses the topic of heat injuries. Nufer said he had been given no formal training on JSP 539, although he had read a copy after it was referred to in an internal email in 2016 after the three reservists\u2019 deaths. \u201cI did know it existed \u2013 I wasn\u2019t familiar with it, and I wasn\u2019t trained to interpret it,\u201d Nufer said. He applied his experience and the advice of others as to whether an activity such as an AFT should be stopped. When the coroner asked who he believed was in charge of the AFT march, he said it was the physical training instructor, Rifleman Keith Macguire. Nufer added that the PTI had been \u201ccontent\u201d with the risk assessment before the march set off. Nufer was also asked about the requirement to check a key temperature gauge, the wet-bulb globe thermometer (WGBT), before setting out on the AFT. The inquest has heard exercises should neither start nor be continued if the gauge measuring heat and humidity, which was located outside a gym at the army base in Brecon, hits 20C (68F). When questioned by Hunt as to whether he had checked the WBGT before heading out, Nufer replied \u201cno\u201d, adding: \u201cWhen we arrived, I encouraged the PTI to touch base with the gym and I assume that is what he did.\u201d Asked if he had been aware of the 20C limit, Nufer said he was unsure and relied on the PTI to assess that, as he was the \u201csubject matter expert\u201d. \u201cIn absolute honesty, I was unsure of what those limits were and I rely on the SME as to what, where and how those limits apply.

      "body": "<p>Fred Herzog, who has died aged 88, was belatedly acknowledged as a pioneer of colour photography. He was given his <a href=\"http://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/exhibitions/fred-herzog-vancouver-photographs\" title=\"\">first major exhibition</a> in 2007 at the Vancouver Art Gallery, when he was 76.</p> <p>Many of the images on the walls had been shot more than 50 years before, when, in his spare time, Herzog would roam the city on foot, photographing now vanished shopfronts, streets and working-class neighbourhoods. He wanted, he said years later, to show the \u201cvitality\u201d of his adopted hometown.</p> <p>Herzog used vibrant Kodachrome slide film at a time when established photographers equated seriousness with the starkness of black and white.

      "bodyText": "Before the Democratic debate on Tuesday night, Cardi B expressed doubt that any of the Democratic presidential candidates have what it takes to beat Donald Trump next year. In an appearance alongside Chance the Rapper on TI\u2019s podcast expediTIously With Tip, she worried that no 2020 candidate had risen above the pack and suggested Trump\u2019s base was too entrenched to be beaten. Chance said: \u201cI think Trump is going to win again at the next election because he\u2019s got the biggest base.\u201d Cardi agreed: \u201cI really hate to say it, but sometimes I do believe that Trump will be winning. Just because every single time I don\u2019t see nobody saying they love a Democratic candidate. There\u2019s no candidate that people are saying like we love, we want them to win.\u201d Cardi has been an enthusiastic supporter of Bernie Sanders, and praised him on the podcast as \u201creally a person that cares\u201d \u2013 but her comments come as something of a surprise. This summer she sat down for an interview with Sanders as part of an effort to encourage young people to vote. On the podcast, Cardi said she believed many of Trump\u2019s supporters had fallen for his hateful rhetoric and voted for him despite it not being in their best interests. She said: \u201cEvery single time he always talk about how he wants to take away Medicare and shit like that.

      "body": "<p>The breathtaking match between the hosts Japan and Gregor Townsend\u2019s Scotland was effectively a knockout game with a little bit more bite. Held in the wake of a devastating typhoon, it brought a brief respite as Japan\u2019s fans cheered and cried and coerced their beloved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/japan-scotland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Brave Blossoms to a victory</a> borne on raw emotion and bottled-up energy.</p> \n<p>The speed of ball and movement generated in attack by Jamie Joseph\u2019s side was a joy to behold. It negated any need to throw bodies at breakdowns and kept players on their feet and in the game.</p> \n<p>With speed sometimes comes a lack in accuracy. Not with this Japan team. Their play was as precise as it was pacy. Passes went to hand, the players ran into space, the point of attack was changed to slow any momentum Scotland\u2019s defensive line speed could generate. The fundamentals were sturdy and were respected.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/16/rugby-union-power-rankings-all-blacks-england-ireland-wales-japan-australia-france-south-africa\">Rugby World Cup power rankings: breaking down all 20 teams in Japan</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There has been a lot of talk about high tackles this tournament. I\u2019ve also talked incessantly over the past few years about the abhorrence the breakdown has become. Scotland lost one of their own, Hamish Watson, as a result of one of those careless and illegal clear\u2011outs in the pool matches and he was missed last weekend.</p> \n<p>In Yokohama there were hardly any high shots and very few horizontal Japanese players off their feet at rucks. Why? Because of their alignment in their structures and their application to working hard at their basics. If you are collectively quick of thought, and clearly know your roles, you can react quicker, better and more skilfully. Watch the Japanese first phase \u2013 they were so good that they didn\u2019t need to use blunt force to clear a defender because they got to the ruck so quickly and the ball was gone so rapidly.</p> \n<p>This Japan team show us the blueprint of what is possible and that the laws do not need to be ignored to play the modern game. Alain Rolland and World Rugby take note. Stop allowing sloppy technique. You\u2019ve clamped down on the high tackle; now, after this World Cup, do the same for the breakdown. It will lead to smarter training across the game as technique and speed is honed, not heavy weights harnessed and hits heightened.</p> \n<p>The question now is can the first Asian side to make the knockout stage go any further when they face the very good South Africans, who beat them in Tokyo 41-7 in their last warm-up game, and are a team many class as one of the favourites to win the whole thing.</p> \n<p>It was hard to gauge real form from those pre-tournament match\u2011ups but the Boks were direct and uncompromising against Japan. For the home heroes to get into the final four they will have to pump that accelerator a little more and for a little longer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce0002cf0a53e3d35c33a16b56732f7912e9fb2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce0002cf0a53e3d35c33a16b56732f7912e9fb2/0_5_3280_1967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japan v South Africa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa\u2019s Handre Pollard wins the ball from Japan\u2019s Yu Tamura in their friendly last month, a match in which the Springboks dominated the lineout.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>South Africa pulled apart the Japanese lineout last time and also went to the sky to pepper the back three and test their aerial and kicking skills. They didn\u2019t pass those tests with flying colours and it is very likely Rassie Erasmus\u2019s men will play to a similar tune this weekend.</p> \n<p>Carries around the edges, a kicking game to suffocate and turn, a set piece to try to crumble the Japanese ability to generate that first-phase foothold to move the Springboks around. The key sounds obvious, but possession will be everything. The top teams do not always need parity of possession to win and it has often been better for them to play without the ball than with it at certain times this tournament.</p> \n<p>But Japan will need the ball for whacking great periods to win this quarter-final. It\u2019s possible \u2013 their penalty count needs to be tiny, and accuracy and adherence to their alignment in attack needs brilliance. They have already shown that twice \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/28/japan-ireland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">against Ireland</a> and Scotland \u2013 and I\u2019d love to see it again this Sunday in Tokyo.</p> \n<p>The other quarter-finals also all provide intrigue and interest. They are the best eight sides and each will have done their homework pre\u2011tournament on their likely knockout opponents.

      "bodyText": "The breathtaking match between the hosts Japan and Gregor Townsend\u2019s Scotland was effectively a knockout game with a little bit more bite. Held in the wake of a devastating typhoon, it brought a brief respite as Japan\u2019s fans cheered and cried and coerced their beloved Brave Blossoms to a victory borne on raw emotion and bottled-up energy. The speed of ball and movement generated in attack by Jamie Joseph\u2019s side was a joy to behold. It negated any need to throw bodies at breakdowns and kept players on their feet and in the game. With speed sometimes comes a lack in accuracy. Not with this Japan team. Their play was as precise as it was pacy. Passes went to hand, the players ran into space, the point of attack was changed to slow any momentum Scotland\u2019s defensive line speed could generate. The fundamentals were sturdy and were respected. There has been a lot of talk about high tackles this tournament. I\u2019ve also talked incessantly over the past few years about the abhorrence the breakdown has become. Scotland lost one of their own, Hamish Watson, as a result of one of those careless and illegal clear\u2011outs in the pool matches and he was missed last weekend. In Yokohama there were hardly any high shots and very few horizontal Japanese players off their feet at rucks. Why? Because of their alignment in their structures and their application to working hard at their basics. If you are collectively quick of thought, and clearly know your roles, you can react quicker, better and more skilfully. Watch the Japanese first phase \u2013 they were so good that they didn\u2019t need to use blunt force to clear a defender because they got to the ruck so quickly and the ball was gone so rapidly. This Japan team show us the blueprint of what is possible and that the laws do not need to be ignored to play the modern game. Alain Rolland and World Rugby take note. Stop allowing sloppy technique. You\u2019ve clamped down on the high tackle; now, after this World Cup, do the same for the breakdown. It will lead to smarter training across the game as technique and speed is honed, not heavy weights harnessed and hits heightened. The question now is can the first Asian side to make the knockout stage go any further when they face the very good South Africans, who beat them in Tokyo 41-7 in their last warm-up game, and are a team many class as one of the favourites to win the whole thing. It was hard to gauge real form from those pre-tournament match\u2011ups but the Boks were direct and uncompromising against Japan. For the home heroes to get into the final four they will have to pump that accelerator a little more and for a little longer. South Africa pulled apart the Japanese lineout last time and also went to the sky to pepper the back three and test their aerial and kicking skills. They didn\u2019t pass those tests with flying colours and it is very likely Rassie Erasmus\u2019s men will play to a similar tune this weekend. Carries around the edges, a kicking game to suffocate and turn, a set piece to try to crumble the Japanese ability to generate that first-phase foothold to move the Springboks around. The key sounds obvious, but possession will be everything. The top teams do not always need parity of possession to win and it has often been better for them to play without the ball than with it at certain times this tournament. But Japan will need the ball for whacking great periods to win this quarter-final. It\u2019s possible \u2013 their penalty count needs to be tiny, and accuracy and adherence to their alignment in attack needs brilliance. They have already shown that twice \u2013 against Ireland and Scotland \u2013 and I\u2019d love to see it again this Sunday in Tokyo. The other quarter-finals also all provide intrigue and interest. They are the best eight sides and each will have done their homework pre\u2011tournament on their likely knockout opponents. Those electronic folders will be reopened now and any recent action will have been integrated into their thinking before the final game plan is settled on. Each team\u2019s core won\u2019t be changed but the nuances the opposition (and the officials) bring will mean some tweaking is required. This will come in strategy and in selection. France, say, may well decide to play narrower and stop the Welsh line speed and interceptions. Or Australia could try to coax England into a less controlled game through changes in lineout formations, midfield kicks and perhaps targeting George Ford in defence. Selection plays its part too. Injuries permitting, no rotation here, with the best players suited to the opposition being picked. Come the semi-finals, and the mood might be more around pragmatism as the difference in the teams gets even slimmer, but this weekend I think they will all be bold and brave to make the next round. My hope alongside this is that no more red cards will be dished out to tilt the tussles too much. The odds on that aren\u2019t great based on recent results, but for once I hope history holds firm as no quarter-final in a Rugby World Cup has ever featured a red card. Tackles low and drama high.

      "bodyText": "A young, pregnant woman flees the violence of Aleppo, leaving her family and husband behind. She settles in Cologne, where she can pick up the threads of her career as an opera singer, and where her daughter is born. Sometime later, she dreams of singing Schumann\u2019s song cycle Dichterliebe, and that performance becomes entwined with memories of her life in Syria and the horrors of her escape. That\u2019s the starting point for Zauberland, composer Bernard Foccroulle and writer Martin Crimp\u2019s \u201cEncounter with Schumann\u2019s Dichterliebe\u201d, staged by Katie Mitchell. First seen in Paris in the spring, the production is touring Europe and the US with soprano Julia Bullock as the protagonist. It is a strange, unsatisfactory piece. Foccroulle has written 16 songs to Crimp\u2019s often banal English texts in a neo-expressionist, post-Schoenbergian style, complementing the Heine settings of Schumann\u2019s sublime cycle. The Schumann is performed first, with the narrative flipping between past and present, between what the woman has left behind and her new life with her daughter in Zauberland \u2013 the magic land of the west epitomised by Schumann\u2019s romanticism. Four actors (one female, three male) flesh out the scenario, taking the other parts in the woman\u2019s story, moving her around, constantly undressing and dressing her. Shrouded corpses are wheeled on; a bride who dances across the stage is later seen being doused in petrol; snow falls at one point; display cases containing naked Barbie dolls appear at another. The performance is immaculate \u2013 Mitchell\u2019s stagecraft is as precise as usual \u2013 but given the subject matter it is almost shockingly unmoving. And, despite Bullock\u2019s tirelessly fine performance, C\u00e9dric Tiberghien\u2019s cool, elegant account of Schumann\u2019s accompaniments and Foccroulle\u2019s dense, demanding piano writing, a feeling of \u201cSo what?\u201d remains. \u2022 At the Linbury theatre, London, until 18 October.",

Think sprinklings of rose petals and water churned purple with acai powder. The taxidermist Some might consider it bizarre to stuff and mount dead animals for a living, or indeed just for fun. But James Cranfield, taxidermy enthusiast and owner of Cranfield\u2019s Curiosity Cabinet in Essex, boasts more than 44,000 followers on Instagram, where he publicises newly curated sculptures, from two-headed ducklings to giraffes, moths and fox cubs. Elsewhere, more unfortunate mammals have ended up on the Crap Taxidermy Instagram account. The insect enthusiast Adrian Kozakiewicz, or Insecthaus, started breeding insects when he was 10 years old and made a name for himself by putting bugs of all shapes, sizes and colours on his face. He posts photos and videos of his collection of beloved creepy-crawlies \u2013 some of which he has bred himself, others he has collected on world travels \u2013 to the delight of his 635,000 Instagram followers. In similar fashion, Bee Influencer uses a 110,000 strong Instagram following to raise money for bee conservation using CGI-generated images of bees posing in protests, on the beach, painting watercolours and everything in between. The CGI influencer So convincing are the popular CGI Instagrammers Miquela (1.5 million followers) and Bermuda that their followers often don\u2019t realise they aren\u2019t real. Even Barbie is a YouTuber now (one with more than 7.6 million subscribers). The unfluencer We come full circle to the unfluencers: influencers against whom people rebel, doing and wanting the opposite of anything they recommend. Despite being turned off by their controversial, sponsored or clickbait posts, some followers cannot help but read on, knowing they will be disappointed and/or infuriated. The name of the game remains, however, that whether you love it or hate it, you most definitely saw it.",

      "bodyText": "One of the four inquiries into claims of a conflict of interest involving Boris Johnson and a US businesswoman has been scaled back and a second has been put on hold after requests by the police watchdog. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is concerned that the reviews could prejudice its decision on whether to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct in public office against Johnson when he was mayor of London. The current mayor, Sadiq Khan, ordered an inquiry into his predecessor after it was reported that Johnson\u2019s friend Jennifer Arcuri was awarded \u00a3126,000 in public money and given coveted places on mayoral trade missions despite failing to meet the criteria for them. Khan\u2019s officials appointed the London fire brigade general counsel, Kathryn Robinson, to look into London &amp; Partners, the mayor\u2019s promotional agency, which granted Arcuri \u00a311,500 in sponsorship and a place on the trips after intervention from Johnson\u2019s office. Explaining Robinson\u2019s investigation on LBC this month, Khan said it would look at three key questions: what processes were in place when Johnson was mayor, were those processes followed, and what lessons need to be learned. Following a request by the IOPC, it has been decided Robinson will not examine Johnson\u2019s time as mayor and will focus instead only on current procedures at L&amp;P. A separate review by City Hall\u2019s watchdog has been paused following a similar request. The IOPC is examining documents and emails handed over by L&amp;P that relate to the sponsorship for Arcuri\u2019s company and her places on trade trips, before it makes its decision about whether to investigate Johnson. A spokesman for Khan said: \u201cThe mayor\u2019s office has agreed with Kathryn Robinson that she will look into the processes currently in place at London &amp; Partners and the Greater London Authority\u2019s involvement in them, to see if they need to be strengthened. This review will begin shortly, irrespective of the IOPC\u2019s work.\u201d He added: \u201cThe IOPC has informed GLA officers that they are concerned that unless the review is limited to current processes, there is a risk it could prejudice the work they are undertaking.

The committee had threatened to use its powers to summon the former mayor to answer questions in person, as it did over his failed garden bridge project. A fourth investigation is under way into how a \u00a3100,000 cyber skills immediate impact fund (CSIIF) grant aimed at fostering digital talent in the UK was awarded to Arcuri\u2019s company, Hacker House. On Wednesday, MPs will question the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, about why her department awarded the money to the company despite its tenuous links to the UK. Questions have already been raised in the Commons about the due diligence carried out on the grant approval after ministers justified awarding the money \u2013 meant to be spent on improving IT skills in the UK \u2013 by saying the company had a British phone number. Calls to the number from the Guardian were answered by a receptionist in the US, where Arcuri is now based.

      "body": "<p>For 30 years Martin Forwood, who has died of cancer aged 79, was a thorn in the side of the huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2012/mar/12/sellafield-nuclear-power-energy-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Sellafield nuclear complex</a> in Cumbria. With his unrivalled collection of original documents on the nuclear industry he was a more reliable source of information to journalists and campaigners than the government-owned industry British Nuclear Fuels, or anyone in Whitehall.</p> <p>But Martin was not just an armchair campaigner; he went in for many imaginative direct actions, including, in 2003, chaining himself to a railway line to halt a nuclear waste shipment from Italy destined for Sellafield. When he came up in court charged with a Victorian-era offence of obstructing the railway, which carried a potential sentence of life imprisonment, the judge acknowledged his sincerity, reduced the charge and fined him.</p> <p>Afterwards he collected some radioactive mud from the Esk estuary near Sellafield, fashioned it into something resembling a mud pizza and delivered it in a lead-lined suitcase to the Italian embassy in London. It was taken away by the Environment Agency, which tested it, found it was indeed radioactive and eventually, forced by its own regulations, returned it to Sellafield to be disposed of in the Drigg low level waste depository.</p> <p>On another occasion, donning a wetsuit on a dark night, Martin swam out to a nuclear waste ship anchored in Barrow harbour, fixing industrial magnets to the keel to show how vulnerable the ship was to terrorist attack. Next day he rang the harbour master to tell him about his action and navy divers removed the magnets. Security was stepped up but Martin was never charged; he suspected the authorities were too embarrassed to take things any further.</p> <p>For a man who had once been a servant of the state \u2013 as a detective in the Cheshire constabulary, a military policeman along the Berlin Wall, and a scientific officer for the Met Office \u2013 a career switch to undermining the establishment had previously seemed unlikely.</p> <p>His parents, Brittain Forwood, a farm manager, and his wife, Nan (nee McAfee), came from wealthy backgrounds; his great-grandfather was Sir William Forwood, a Liverpool shipowner and philanthropist.</p> <p>Born in Borth Wen, Anglesey, Martin went to Shrewsbury school and then joined the merchant navy as an officer cadet with the Clan Line shipping company, sailing repeatedly to the Bay of Bengal. Tiring of that life, he joined the Cheshire police force in 1959 before signing up with the Royal Military Police in 1963, which immediately posted him to Berlin.</p> <p>He did a three-year stint patrolling both the Berlin Wall and the border fence between East and West Germany, witnessing many failed attempts by East Germans to reach the west.

      "bodyText": "For 30 years Martin Forwood, who has died of cancer aged 79, was a thorn in the side of the huge Sellafield nuclear complex in Cumbria. With his unrivalled collection of original documents on the nuclear industry he was a more reliable source of information to journalists and campaigners than the government-owned industry British Nuclear Fuels, or anyone in Whitehall. But Martin was not just an armchair campaigner; he went in for many imaginative direct actions, including, in 2003, chaining himself to a railway line to halt a nuclear waste shipment from Italy destined for Sellafield. When he came up in court charged with a Victorian-era offence of obstructing the railway, which carried a potential sentence of life imprisonment, the judge acknowledged his sincerity, reduced the charge and fined him. Afterwards he collected some radioactive mud from the Esk estuary near Sellafield, fashioned it into something resembling a mud pizza and delivered it in a lead-lined suitcase to the Italian embassy in London. It was taken away by the Environment Agency, which tested it, found it was indeed radioactive and eventually, forced by its own regulations, returned it to Sellafield to be disposed of in the Drigg low level waste depository. On another occasion, donning a wetsuit on a dark night, Martin swam out to a nuclear waste ship anchored in Barrow harbour, fixing industrial magnets to the keel to show how vulnerable the ship was to terrorist attack. Next day he rang the harbour master to tell him about his action and navy divers removed the magnets. Security was stepped up but Martin was never charged; he suspected the authorities were too embarrassed to take things any further. For a man who had once been a servant of the state \u2013 as a detective in the Cheshire constabulary, a military policeman along the Berlin Wall, and a scientific officer for the Met Office \u2013 a career switch to undermining the establishment had previously seemed unlikely. His parents, Brittain Forwood, a farm manager, and his wife, Nan (nee McAfee), came from wealthy backgrounds; his great-grandfather was Sir William Forwood, a Liverpool shipowner and philanthropist. Born in Borth Wen, Anglesey, Martin went to Shrewsbury school and then joined the merchant navy as an officer cadet with the Clan Line shipping company, sailing repeatedly to the Bay of Bengal. Tiring of that life, he joined the Cheshire police force in 1959 before signing up with the Royal Military Police in 1963, which immediately posted him to Berlin. He did a three-year stint patrolling both the Berlin Wall and the border fence between East and West Germany, witnessing many failed attempts by East Germans to reach the west. He also periodically guarded Spandau prison and escorted its most celebrated prisoner, Rudolf Hess, to hospital. In Berlin in 1965 he married Ann Pasterfield and a year later left the army. Back in Britain he decided to take up mushroom farming at Blackwater in Cornwall, but was unable to make a go of it and, with a young family to support, soon signed up with the Met Office. After several postings around the country over a period of 10 years, including at the chemical weapons establishment at Porton Down, Wiltshire, he was eventually sent to Cumbria. When his marriage to Ann broke down he left the Met Office and began to work on local markets as a picture framer before opening up a shop in Millom, near Barrow. When Lee, the 12-year-old son of his new partner, Janine Allis-Smith, developed leukaemia in 1980 \u2013 one of a number of children in Cumbria to do so at the same time \u2013 local anti-nuclear campaigners suspected a connection with plutonium releases from Sellafield and formed a group that eventually became Cumbrians Opposed to Radioactive Environment (Core). Martin and Janine volunteered to help the group and began a long battle to get British Nuclear Fuels to stop discharging millions of gallons of liquid waste laced with plutonium into the Irish Sea. The uncovering of the leukaemia cluster led to campaigns by Greenpeace, and finally persuaded the government in the late 1980s to order the discharges to be dramatically reduced. For Martin, however, the concession was too little too late. Lee had survived but Martin had since come to the conclusion that Sellafield\u2019s vast industrial complex, which employed 10,000 people but was producing nothing except spent uranium and plutonium for no useful purpose, should be shut down.

Ingraham, it should be noted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/17/lebron-james-laura-ingraham-shut-up-and-dribble-fox-news\">once dedicated an entire segment of her show</a> to mocking LeBron while making the case that he didn\u2019t possess the intelligence to comment on anything outside of the borders of a court.</p> <p>Also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason/status/1183962508484202496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1183968151278673920&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwarriorswire.usatoday.com%2F2019%2F10%2F15%2Fformer-warrior-david-west-eviscerates-jason-whitlock-over-lebron-criticism%2F\">in the fray</a> was Jason Whitlock, the Fox Sports pundit who never misses an opportunity to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason/status/905233739264868354\">mock Colin Kaepernick</a> for standing for what he believes, and who generally revels in (and profits from) being a black face spewing anti-black rhetoric.</p> <p>Now we should be clear that LeBron is not above criticism, but my own conversations with prominent voices in the athlete activism space over the last few days stresses the importance of context \u2013 and the danger of adhering to the rules of critics whose motives are in bad faith.</p> <p>Dr Harry Edwards, the Berkeley professor and civil rights activist whose seminal 1973 work Sociology of Sport remains an essential blueprint for athlete activism to this day, warns us to consider the source.</p> <p>\u201cAs a people we [African Americans] have never been perceived or respected as credible witnesses in speaking even to our own interests or experiences,\u201d Edwards told me. \u201cAnd when it comes to issues and developments off shore \u2013 that is foreign developments \u2013 we are perceived, particularly by adversarial voices and interests, to have absolutely no legitimate basis to speak out at all unless we are parroting \u2018authoritative definitions of the situation\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cSo, predictably, the detractors of those black athletes who have been speaking out against and protesting the injustice of 147 mostly unarmed black people being murdered each year under cover of the badge are now attacking those same black athletes for <em>not</em> speaking out against and protesting the China-Hong Kong debacle, a political stance if assumed by black athletes would parrot and serve the political interests of those who are so critical of their anti-injustice dispositions regarding the circumstances of African Americans.\u201d</p> <p>Even more to the point was Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, the former NBA star whose own career was cut short after he refused to stand for the national anthem while playing for the Denver Nuggets in 1996 \u2013 a protest that presaged Kaepernick\u2019s movement by a generation.</p> <p>\u201cAfrican Americans who are well informed in particular are not unaware of the hypocrisy of presidents, politicians and commentators now wanting athletes to speak for causes that ultimately promote US exceptionalism and imperialism, domestically and abroad,\u201d Abdul-Rauf told me, \u201cwhile at the same time blatantly ignoring, to the point of a deathly silence, the plight of African Americans and people of color in this country.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cUntil we see a need for international solidarity, linking our struggles with those of others the strength we desire will forever be minimal and the achievement of social justice not realized. I have a major problem with people who play these type of games thinking we are this dumb to parrot what they want us to so that it benefits them while our problems are ignored. Quit trying to tell us how, when, where and what to say if you are not willing to pay attention to our life and death pleas for fairness and equality.\u201d</p> <p>John Carlos, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics\">Black Power salute</a> on the podium at the 1968 Olympics is one of the enduring images of the athlete activist movement, told me: \u201cThey want to say players and coaches have to speak now. No, they don\u2019t have to do anything. We will no longer be your puppets. We will not let you speak through us. Freedom of speech goes both ways: you have the right to speak and the right to be silent.\u201d</p> <p>Again, LeBron\u2019s remarks are not above rebuke, even when judged by the higher standard he\u2019s opted into by stepping up as a leader for social justice causes. But conservative critics like Carlson and Whitlock and Trump and Ingraham and Ted Cruz, who denigrate athletes for speaking up against the human rights violations happening on American streets and do the same when they <em>don\u2019t</em> for issues halfway around the world, are trading in the very double standard they allege. These people only care about democracy and freedom of speech and allowing athletes to use their platforms to speak about injustice when the position taken is convenient for their agendas. If it\u2019s not, they want athletes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/17/lebron-james-laura-ingraham-shut-up-and-dribble-fox-news\">shut up and dribble</a>. And that is the essence of hypocrisy.</p>",

Dr Harry Edwards, the Berkeley professor and civil rights activist whose seminal 1973 work Sociology of Sport remains an essential blueprint for athlete activism to this day, warns us to consider the source. \u201cAs a people we [African Americans] have never been perceived or respected as credible witnesses in speaking even to our own interests or experiences,\u201d Edwards told me. \u201cAnd when it comes to issues and developments off shore \u2013 that is foreign developments \u2013 we are perceived, particularly by adversarial voices and interests, to have absolutely no legitimate basis to speak out at all unless we are parroting \u2018authoritative definitions of the situation\u2019. \u201cSo, predictably, the detractors of those black athletes who have been speaking out against and protesting the injustice of 147 mostly unarmed black people being murdered each year under cover of the badge are now attacking those same black athletes for not speaking out against and protesting the China-Hong Kong debacle, a political stance if assumed by black athletes would parrot and serve the political interests of those who are so critical of their anti-injustice dispositions regarding the circumstances of African Americans.\u201d Even more to the point was Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, the former NBA star whose own career was cut short after he refused to stand for the national anthem while playing for the Denver Nuggets in 1996 \u2013 a protest that presaged Kaepernick\u2019s movement by a generation. \u201cAfrican Americans who are well informed in particular are not unaware of the hypocrisy of presidents, politicians and commentators now wanting athletes to speak for causes that ultimately promote US exceptionalism and imperialism, domestically and abroad,\u201d Abdul-Rauf told me, \u201cwhile at the same time blatantly ignoring, to the point of a deathly silence, the plight of African Americans and people of color in this country.\u201d He continued: \u201cUntil we see a need for international solidarity, linking our struggles with those of others the strength we desire will forever be minimal and the achievement of social justice not realized. I have a major problem with people who play these type of games thinking we are this dumb to parrot what they want us to so that it benefits them while our problems are ignored. Quit trying to tell us how, when, where and what to say if you are not willing to pay attention to our life and death pleas for fairness and equality.\u201d John Carlos, whose Black Power salute on the podium at the 1968 Olympics is one of the enduring images of the athlete activist movement, told me: \u201cThey want to say players and coaches have to speak now. No, they don\u2019t have to do anything. We will no longer be your puppets. We will not let you speak through us. Freedom of speech goes both ways: you have the right to speak and the right to be silent.\u201d Again, LeBron\u2019s remarks are not above rebuke, even when judged by the higher standard he\u2019s opted into by stepping up as a leader for social justice causes. But conservative critics like Carlson and Whitlock and Trump and Ingraham and Ted Cruz, who denigrate athletes for speaking up against the human rights violations happening on American streets and do the same when they don\u2019t for issues halfway around the world, are trading in the very double standard they allege. These people only care about democracy and freedom of speech and allowing athletes to use their platforms to speak about injustice when the position taken is convenient for their agendas. If it\u2019s not, they want athletes to shut up and dribble. And that is the essence of hypocrisy.",

      "bodyText": "The French government has insisted it will not seek to ban Muslim women who wear headscarves from volunteering to help on school trips after outrage when mothers accompanying pupils were told to remove theirs. One mother said pupils were distressed and traumatised when a far-right politician told her to take off her headscarf in a regional parliament in eastern France, where she was helping out on a primary school outing for her son\u2019s class. The incident has reignited a long-running row over French secularism and whether politicians can decide how Muslim mothers should dress when volunteering to take part in school activities. There is no law banning mothers in headscarves from accompanying school trips; indeed, France\u2019s state council ruled in 2013 that mothers were free to wear whatever they wanted on outings. However, there is growing pressure from the right in France for a ban on mothers in headscarves taking part in school activities. Some argue French law already bans girls from wearing headscarves inside state schools and mothers should be made to comply with the same strict neutrality rules imposed on French state workers, such as teachers, who cannot wear religious symbols in the classroom. One mother, identified only as Fatima E, spoke out about her experience of being told to remove her veil in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 regional parliament building by Julien Odoul from Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party. A fierce row had broken out in the chamber when the regional parliament speaker, the Socialist Marie-Guite Dufay, replied to Odoul, saying that neither French law nor the rules of the chamber banned a member of the public wearing a headscarf. Fatima, who was pictured comforting her distressed 10-year-old son in the public gallery, told the Collective Against Islamophobia in France: \u201cI felt rejected in a way I never had been before.\u201d She was a regular volunteer on school outings, and her son\u2019s teacher had asked her to come on the trip. \u201cI heard someone say \u2018in the name of secularism\u2019 and I heard people start shouting and getting angry,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only thing I saw was the children\u2019s distress.

Is it you they\u2019re telling to take off your headscarf?\u2019\u201d She said of the politicians who told her to uncover her head: \u201cThey have destroyed all the work I was doing indirectly with this class, where children of immigrant roots often had an attitude of thinking France was against them.\u201d In a separate incident, a nursery school visit to a fire station in Creil, north of Paris, failed to go ahead on Monday when a firefighter told a mother accompanying the trip that she had to remove her headscarf. The fire service later said it was a mistake and the officer apologised. The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, told parliament mothers were free to dress as they pleased and there was no need for new legislation on what should be worn on school trips. He said he would fight \u201cto defend secularism\u201d, which meant protecting people\u2019s religious freedoms. But there are divisions within Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist La R\u00e9publique En Marche party. The education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said last month he would rather avoid having mothers in hijab as volunteers on school outings. He said although he accepted mothers could legally wear what they pleased, \u201cthe headscarf itself is not desirable\u201d because of \u201cwhat it says about the status of women, what it says about our values\u201d. When one spokeswoman from Macron\u2019s party said she would support a rightwing proposal to ban mothers in headscarves attending school trips, others within the party replied with a #NotInMyName campaign against any ban. A senate committee is seeking to discuss potential legislation on mothers\u2019 dress codes later this month. This week, 90 personalities, including actors and writers, signed an open letter in Le Monde calling for Macron to publicly condemn the request for the mother asked to remove her headscarf in the regional parliament. They called for Macron \u201cto say with force that Muslim women, whether they wear a headscarf or not, and Muslims in general have a place in our society \u2013 and to refuse our fellow Muslim citizens being monitored, stigmatised or denounced for the practice of their religion\u201d.",

As a football fan it\u2019s been easy to see modern footballers as overpaid prima donnas. However, to see the way the English players conducted themselves on Monday night in the presence of neanderthals was so impressive and inspiring (and I don\u2019t use that word easily). The continued head in sand mentality has to stop. Hopefully this might start a change\u201d \u2013 Gareth Aherne.</p> <p>\u201cThe England players have rightly received huge plaudits for their strong and dignified response to racism in Bulgaria. Would it be fair to say that one of the many hurdles football faces next is for players to condemn racist acts by their teammates or club colleagues just as strongly? Rather than, say, dismissing it as b@nter by multi-linguists or ringing up the nearest T-shirt print shop\u201d \u2013 Tim.</p> <p>\u201cTwice in the last couple of months I have been forced to acknowledge quality writing from The Fiver when you have written about racism (yesterday\u2019s Fiver).

However, to see the way the English players conducted themselves on Monday night in the presence of neanderthals was so impressive and inspiring (and I don\u2019t use that word easily). The continued head in sand mentality has to stop. Hopefully this might start a change\u201d \u2013 Gareth Aherne. \u201cThe England players have rightly received huge plaudits for their strong and dignified response to racism in Bulgaria. Would it be fair to say that one of the many hurdles football faces next is for players to condemn racist acts by their teammates or club colleagues just as strongly? Rather than, say, dismissing it as b@nter by multi-linguists or ringing up the nearest T-shirt print shop\u201d \u2013 Tim. \u201cTwice in the last couple of months I have been forced to acknowledge quality writing from The Fiver when you have written about racism (yesterday\u2019s Fiver). What\u2019s going on? Any chance you can spread that quality to the normal fare that is served up daily?\u201d \u2013 Jeremy Humphries. \u201cAs a regular and enthusiastic reader of The Fiver during the period covering Mike Hall\u2019s absence (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), I though he might appreciate a summary of all the interesting and amusing bits that he missed: \u201d \u2013 Clive Jerram. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winners of our letters o\u2019the day are \u2026 Gareth Aherne and Clive Jerram, who win copies of Per Mertesacker: Big Friendly German. We\u2019ve more to give away all week. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS North Korea\u2019s 0-0 World Cup qualifying draw with South Korea \u2013 played in front of no fans or foreign media \u2013 was a footballing feast of \u201cattacks and counterattacks\u201d, according to a report in the North Korean propaganda bugle KCNA. Bulgarian bizzies have detained six people in connection with the racist abuse of England players with more arrests likely. Lazio have been ordered to close four sections of their stadium for their Big Vase game against the Queen\u2019s Celtic because of racist behaviour by fans during a group match against Rennes. David de Gea may miss Manchester United\u2019s defeat by Liverpool after suffering groin-gah in Spain\u2019s 1-1 draw with Sweden. Nasty Leeds forward Eddie Nketiah scored a hat-trick and missed a penalty on a busy night as England U-21s beat Austria U-21s 5-1 in a Euro qualifier. USA! USA!! USA!!! boss Gregg Berhalter is in serious danger of being bundled aboard the good ship Do One after overseeing the nation\u2019s first loss to Canada (yes, Canada!) in 34 years. \u201cWe didn\u2019t match what Canada was bringing,\u201d he howled after the shambolic 2-0 defeat. And Trent-Alexander Arnold has been waxing lyrical about the Guinness Book of World Records after his 12 Premier League assists last season meant he was now part of it. \u201cI always used to read it as a kid because they\u2019re fun to read, to see the different records and what people are up to all around the world,\u201d gushed the Liverpool right-back. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievably proud moment for me and all of my family.\u201d RECOMMENDED BUYING You can get your hands on some of David Squires\u2019 favourite cartoons of his from down the years at our Print Shop. STILL WANT MORE? So: Bulgaria bad, England good? Actually this is not as black and white as it seems, writes Marina Hyde. Paltry fines and spineless words helped create the poison in Sofia, reckons Barney Ronay. A story of a 44-year-old with no previous professional football experience making his debut in the Mexican top flight and almost scoring a goal is recalled in this week\u2019s Knowledge. Go on, take a look here. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Toni Duggan returns to Manchester City with a Women\u2019s Big Cup point to prove, reports Suzanne Wrack.

      "bodyText": "Cambridge is brilliant and my Granny Eva lives there too. It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I\u2019d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy\u2019s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge? Big cactuses and rock gardens Exploring Cambridge University Botanic Garden Cambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can\u2019t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me. Long boats and flying bats The Mathematical Bridge over the Cam From here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it\u2019s kind of cool. At the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky! Do you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about. Castles and a clock that doesn\u2019t tell the time Trinity College There are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King\u2019s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It\u2019s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn\u2019t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary\u2019s Church Steeple. Just don\u2019t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children\u2019s books. The biggest whale bones I ever saw Art at the Fitzwilliam, and whale bones at the Museum of Zoology Did I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it\u2019s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures.

It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge. Hungry by now? Chelsea Buns at Fitzbillies Aromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill\u2019s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.

Teams worked their way through El Arbolito park, which was still littered with burning tires and paving slabs that had been used as barricades. Over 12 days of often violent protests, the park had been one of the focal points for thousands of native Ecuadorians who converged on Quito from the Andes and the Amazon. The demonstrations ended late on Sunday when Ecuador\u2019s president Len\u00edn Moreno agreed to restore fuel subsidies and revoke a controversial IMF-backed austerity package. The move ended nearly two weeks of upheaval which saw violence, looting and vandalism \u2013 as well as a heavy-handed police response which left eight dead, more than 1,300 injured and nearly 1,200 arrested, according to the country\u2019s human rights defender\u2019s office. The image of Andean and Amazon peoples \u2013 many in traditional dress \u2013 celebrating the deal was a potent illustration of the strength of Ecuador\u2019s indigenous movement \u2013 and a reminder that it has repeatedly helped topple the country\u2019s presidents. But the deaths of eight protesters, including indigenous leader Inocencio Tucumbi, has made the triumph bittersweet for many. \u201cI believe that peace triumphed,\u201d said Patricia Gualinga, from the Amazonian Kichwa community of Sarayaku. \u201cBut I feel a knot in my throat about the loss of the lives of indigenous brothers. There is a lot of pain to be healed and the government should be aware of this,\u201d she said. Just days ago, downtown Quito looked like a war zone: teargas hung in the air, pitched battles between riot police and protesters played out amid blazing roadblocks as explosions reverberated across the city. While some protesters were hooded troublemakers and armed with sticks and slingshots, others were indigenous women in traditional skirts and trilbies, outraged by Moreno\u2019s decision to end fuel subsidies. That move caused the price of petrol to spike by a third and the cost of diesel to more than double \u2013 in turn, driving up food and transport costs in the country\u2019s dollarised economy. \u201cThe indigenous movement has been a powerful actor in Ecuador since the 1990s,\u201d said Mario Melo, a lawyer who heads the human rights centre at Quito\u2019s Catholic University. Indigenous protests played a central role in toppling a string of Ecuador\u2019s presidents, including Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram in 1997, Jamil Mahuad in 2000 and Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez in 2005 \u201cIt\u2019s the only movement which has the capacity to paralyse the country \u2013 and the guts to confront these economic measures,\u201d which, he said, affected the poorest. But, for all its power, the indigenous movement was unable to stop protests from being hijacked by others intent on sowing chaos. Jaime Vargas, the leader of the Ecuador\u2019s indigenous confederation Conaie, was at pains to distance his followers from masked men who attacked two TV stations and the main El Comercio newspaper, as well as journalists covering the protests. Arsonists also targeted the national auditor\u2019s building \u201cIt\u2019s extremely curious that it is the only state building which has been totally burnt out,\u201d said foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Valencia, who noted the building held case files related to charges of alleged corruption against the former president Rafael Correa. Moreno has accused \u201cdark forces\u201d directed by his predecessor ex-president Rafael Correa and Venezuela\u2019s leader Nicolas Maduro along with \u201cdrug traffickers, [and] gangs with violent foreign citizens.\u201d Interior minister Mar\u00eda Paula Romo said on Tuesday that 57 foreigners were arrested during the unrest. Correa, who governed Ecuador between 2007 and 2017 and now lives in Brussels, has denied he was behind the unrest, although he called for Moreno to step down and floated the possibility of running for vice-president in fresh elections. But the indigenous movement has little affection for Correa, who during his decade in power prohibited protests, jailed indigenous leaders and cracked down on demonstrations against oil drilling and mining on ancestral native territory. Santiago Basabe, a political scientist at the Latin American Institute of Social Sciences in Quito, said the indigenous movement had strengthened its political capital considerably. But he noted it had been \u201cabsolutely intransigent\u201d, leaving the government with no alternative options to restructure massive debts, mostly to China. Ecuador\u2019s indigenous nationalities represent just a tenth of Ecuador\u2019s population of 16 million yet they have shown they are a political force too strong to be ignored. But their triumph, said Gualinga \u201chad been paid with indigenous lives. Just as in all our history.\u201d",

The coalition of activists from the region \u2013 known colloquially as \u201cCancer Alley\u201d due to its high volume of petrochemical plants \u2013 urged Edwards in a letter, shared with the Guardian, to assist in their efforts to curb toxic emissions and block the construction of new plants in the region while also assuring the governor of their support next month. \u201cWe call on all progressives to unite behind the only candidate that can move this state forward. You can depend on our Movement. We have differences that we will have to settle and work out after the election.\u201d It states. The letter adds: \u201cBlack voters need stimulation and understanding that their votes do count in state races and there is infrastructure to solve the myriad of problems we solve.\u201d High turnout in African American communities in Louisiana is pivotal to the Democratic pathway to victory, a feat Bel Edwards pulled off during his first election victory in 2015. The governor campaigned extensively in black communities during the first primary earlier this month but did not win enough of the vote to avoid a runoff election under Louisiana\u2019s \u201cjungle primary\u201d system, which sees candidates of all parties face each other on the initial ballot. Many of the worst-affected communities in the Cancer Alley region are predominantly black, including Reserve in St John the Baptist parish, which has the highest risk of cancer due to airborne toxicity anywhere in America. Reserve is the focus of a year-long Guardian series, Cancer Town. Marchers plan to visit numerous sites over the two-week period, including St John the Baptist parish and neighboring St James parish, and will be joined next week by the national moral revival campaigner the Rev William Barber, who visited Reserve earlier in the year as part of an event co-sponsored by the Guardian. Last week Democratic presidential frontrunner senator Elizabeth Warren placed Cancer Alley and Reserve at the centre of an ambitious environmental justice platform aimed at addressing the racial inequality associated with toxic pollution in America. But the issue of pollution in the region still fails to galvanize much of the local political scene. Last weekend Larry Sorrapuru, a St John the Baptist councilman and the most vocal local political critic of air pollution issues in the parish, lost his seat following elections. Edwards\u2019 administration also has a mixed record on the issue. The state environment department, LDEQ, has repeatedly sought to downplay community concerns about air pollution, which are centered on emissions from the Pontchartrain Works facility, a synthetic rubber plant that emits the toxin chloroprene \u2013listed as a likely carcinogen by the EPA. Following mounting concern and attention, however, the Edwards administration has committed to conducting a study on cancer prevalence rates in Reserve following the publication of an independent study showing \u201chighly unusual rates\u201d near the plant. \u201cThe governor has never communicated with us,\u201d said Bobby Taylor, president of the Concerned Citizens of Saint John. \u201cBut we hope they will come in and work with us, be part of the community. \u201cThis march is about bringing as much attention as we can to this community and others on the route, because we need to bring more focus to this from local people.\u201d Taylor plans to be present throughout most of the two weeks of activism.",

King could only smile and agree.</p> <p>But we would all do well to watch King \u2013 in anything. At 48, she is in her prime.

For years, she has been turning out quietly devastating portraits \u2013 in the movies Jerry Maguire and Ray, in the TV show Southland \u2013 with little public recognition. Now she has her pick of roles. \u201cI appreciate winning the Oscar,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the ultimate goal. I should be able to use it as currency moving forward.\u201d</p> <p>King was not familiar with the original Watchmen material, nor the 2009 Zack Snyder movie (her 23-year-old son Ian is more excited about this role than any of King\u2019s previous parts). But once she read the script, she was enthused. In Damon Lindelof\u2019s adaptation, the tale\u2019s 1950s cold-war storyline is spun into a look at the rise of a white supremacist group in a parallel US. King plays Angela Abar, a cop with superhuman fighting skills and an amazing French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman-style cape: not the kind of part she usually gets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f4bc50ad0c56dacc3ae32c792b0193f0a00b1d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f4bc50ad0c56dacc3ae32c792b0193f0a00b1d3/0_0_3502_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Veiled threat \u2026 King as the superhero in Watchmen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veiled threat \u2026 King as the superhero in Watchmen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>King, who in a New York hotel room is slight and smiling, powers through the series like a wrecking ball.

Watchmen has that same compelling narrative, the story of men with bamboo torches trying to eliminate black people. In the current climate, this parallel America feels very like the real thing. One of Lindelof\u2019s triggers, says King, was Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s 2014 article for the Atlantic, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/\">The Case for Reparations</a>, addressing the unacknowledged fall-out from slavery.

With a laugh, she says: \u201cBeing black, it\u2019s part of my life. What\u2019s happened is that Trump has just emboldened people.

Even if it was unfortunate for the English [cue more laughter] it wasn\u2019t something a normal person would think of doing.

I was so anxious but Maradona said: \u2018Just stay calm, we have a game tomorrow.\u2019 Five minutes after getting in bed he was asleep! I was awake until 4 or 5am. No normal person could have slept that easily the night before a World Cup final but seeing him so calm convinced me we were going to win the World Cup.\u201d</p> <p>At Bangor, you suspect, there is more convincing to do.

Beating them removed a big obstacle.\u201d Pasculli knows what is coming next and mention of the \u201cHand of God\u201d has him convulsing with laughter. He leaps from his chair to perform an impression of Peter Shilton towering above Maradona, then looking on aghast having been \u201cpickpocketed\u201d by Argentina\u2019s diminutive No 10. \u201cOn the bench we didn\u2019t realise what he had done,\u201d Pasculli says. \u201cMaradona\u2019s reaction to the goal was a normal celebration; he just ran to the corner and the team ran after him. We didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done until he told us all at full-time. We were all laughing. Even if it was unfortunate for the English [cue more laughter] it wasn\u2019t something a normal person would think of doing. It takes someone special to think of doing that and pulling it off but his second was simply the greatest goal in the history of the World Cup. \u201cWhen [H\u00e9ctor] Enrique gave him the ball inside our half and he started dribbling we all started to rise up on the bench, a little bit after the first player, then a little more after the second, more after the third until we were all on our feet because we knew he was going for the goal. We were all going crazy on the bench, even [the coach, Carlos] Bilardo. Even the England supporters inside the stadium were applauding him. It was one of the best goals of the century.\u201d The pressure and expectation on Maradona were intense before the final but, in the sanctuary of their hotel room, only Pasculli felt it. \u201cOur room wasn\u2019t anything special and our beds were near to each other. I was so anxious but Maradona said: \u2018Just stay calm, we have a game tomorrow.\u2019 Five minutes after getting in bed he was asleep! I was awake until 4 or 5am. No normal person could have slept that easily the night before a World Cup final but seeing him so calm convinced me we were going to win the World Cup.\u201d At Bangor, you suspect, there is more convincing to do. In April a group of supporters formed their own club \u2013 Bangor 1876 \u2013 having had enough of the financial problems under VSM that prompted the Football Association of Wales to revoke Bangor\u2019s Uefa licence and HMRC to issue a winding-up petition in 2018, later dismissed. In May the FAW docked the club 42 points for regulation breaches. That tally was halved on appeal and the remaining 21 points were then wiped out after an appeal to the court of arbitration, but a transfer embargo prevented the club from signing players on professional contracts. Only one player stayed this summer while a remarkable 21 from Italy arrived, along with players from Portugal, Ghana and Guinea-Bissau plus one from Wales and six from England. \u201cThis is not about Italians coming here to work,\u201d Serafino says. \u201cWe have had former players and Welsh players contacting us to come back since we took over. People are thinking about Bangor again as a stable club and they can see we are serious about the future. We know it is going to be difficult but we will gain the confidence of the people by working hard day after day. We plan to bring back the academy and have a community project that benefits the whole city. We will return the club to where it should be.\u201d",

Wilson is one of the most pro-Brexit figures in the parliamentary party.</p> \n<p>It comes as fellow DUP figures entered Downing Street for a third round of talks in three days. The EU and UK are seeking ways to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland as part of a withdrawal agreement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"73f497f7-48ef-4d47-95b2-af2d926d1a48\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Counties and customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.<br></p>\n    <p>Britain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border.

      "bodyText": "A key member of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist party has spelled out a list of concerns that could scupper Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for an agreement that might allow the UK to leave the EU. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, told the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, that there must be consent from both unionists and nationalists in the Northern Ireland assembly in any new arrangements. The East Antrim MP, who was questioning the minister as part of the Brexit committee, voiced suspicions that the government was planning to keep Northern Ireland in the the EU customs union for practical purposes, and raised the issue of compensation for businesses in the province that could lose out as a result of EU regulations. Support from DUP MPs could be crucial for the government to sign off a Brexit deal by Saturday. Wilson is one of the most pro-Brexit figures in the parliamentary party. It comes as fellow DUP figures entered Downing Street for a third round of talks in three days. The EU and UK are seeking ways to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland as part of a withdrawal agreement. Wilson told Barclay that any customs deal affecting Northern Ireland would need the consent of the assembly and must be subject to a cross-community vote. Without such consent, he said, the government would be in breach of the Good Friday agreement, which is also known as the Belfast agreement. \u201cAll I really want to hear from you today is that the terms of the Belfast agreement, which everyone seems to want to defend, will be the terms on which consent for opting into arrangements which diminish the powers of the NI assembly, which will treat NI differently to rest of UK. \u201cThat consent must be sought on the basis of the Belfast agreement,\u201d he said. Barclay said the government had a \u201ccommitment to find solutions which were compatible to the Good Friday agreement\u201d. Wilson asked if Barclay was trying to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union for \u201cpractical purposes\u201d. He added: \u201cI hope that first of all the government is not contemplating that.\u201d Wilson quoted figures that claimed EU rules would cost businesses within the six counties \u00a3500m but compensation could not be paid to them because of EU rules. Barclay said the government wanted a new deal for Northern Ireland. A DUP spokesman said reports it was looking for \u201cbillions not millions\u201d as a sweetener in a new post-Brexit pact were false. \u201cThis is categorically untrue and nonsense,\u201d he said. Brexit talks are on a knife-edge with the legal text of a deal thrashed out in Brussels on Tuesday being finalised. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, spoke to Johnson by phone on Wednesday morning. He remains cautiously optimistic but warned issues remained to potentially block an agreement. He told Sky News: \u201cI am convinced all parties are serious about getting an agreement this week or by the end of the month. There is a pathway to a possible deal, but there are many issues that still need to be fully resolved, particularly around consent and also some issues around customs and VAT. \u201cI spoke to the prime minister this morning and I\u2019ve been in contact with the [European] commission. I do think we are making progress but there are issues to be resolved and hopefully that can be done today,\u201d he said. Any threat to collapse a deal will have echoes of December 2017, when the DUP torpedoed the signing off of the first phase of Brexit negotiations just as Theresa May was sitting down to lunch with the European commission president, Jean Claude-Juncker. Johnson has consulted the party throughout his Brexit talks and officials held three hours of talks over the past two days with Downing Street officials. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, had a second 90-minute meeting in Downing Street on Tuesday night but remained tight-lipped as they left. However, a spokesman indicated they would not back what was on the table, with \u201cfurther work\u201d needed in Brussels. \u201cWe respect the fact negotiations are ongoing therefore cannot give a detailed commentary but it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is needed.\u201d Talks in Brussels between UK negotiators led by David Frost and the EU\u2019s article 50 taskforce broke up at 1.30am on Tuesday, breaching the midnight deadline set by Barnier earlier in the day. Talks resumed on Wednesday morning, fuelling speculation that political agreement had been reached on the main points and the detailed legally operable text remains to be agreed. It is understood Ireland has not yet received the final text, indicating work on it was continuing into the morning. Johnson is expected to brief his cabinet at 2.30pm, with a flurry of work needed across the Conservative party to win the support of Eurosceptics as well as the DUP. Hardline Eurosceptics in the European Research Group, including the veteran Bill Cash and Steve Baker, have indicated they are prepared to back the deal, as has the group\u2019s former chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg. However, there appears to be a split in the group, with the former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson declaring he could not back a deal if it involved a return to May\u2019s customs partnership for Northern Ireland. This would involve the region remaining legally part of the UK customs arrangements but in practice following those of the EU, thus avoiding the need for checks on the Irish border.",

Speaking to Austrian media on Tuesday night after an informal meeting with municipal leaders in his home town of Griffen, southern Austria, Handke complained that journalists had bombarded him with questions about his political views without trying to engage with his writing. \u201cI\u2019m standing at my garden gate and there are 50 journalists \u2013 and all of them just ask me questions like you do, and from not a single person who comes to me I hear they have read any of my works or know what I have written,\u201d Handke told the Austrian broadcaster ORF. \u201cIt\u2019s only questions like how does the world react.

Leave me in peace and don\u2019t ask me questions like that.\u201d According to ORF, the playwright and novelist said he would never talk to journalists again. The exchange came after he was asked about criticism from Sa\u0161a Stani\u0161i\u0107, a Bosnian-German novelist who won the German Book prize on Monday night. \u201cI had the good fortune to escape what Peter Handke failed to describe in his texts\u201d, Stani\u0161i\u0107 said in his acceptance speech. \u201cI am able to stand here in front of your because of a reality that this person failed to accept.\u201d Other writers, including Salman Rushdie and Hari Kunzru, have criticised the Nobel committee for the award of this year\u2019s prize to Handke. In an article in the New York Times, Aleksandar Hemon, a Bosnian-American novelist, called Handke \u201cthe Bob Dylan of genocide apologists\u201d. The Swedish Academy has been contacted repeatedly for a response to the criticism but has yet to respond. Handke, whose best-known works include the novel The Goalkeeper\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, the play Offending the Audience and his screenplay for Wim Wenders\u2019 Wings of Desire, was for long one of the most celebrated Austrian writers of the postwar era, alongside Thomas Bernhard and Elfriede Jelinek. But during the Yugoslav war of the 1990s, Handke, who has Slovene roots on his maternal side, developed a strongly pro-Serbian stance, resulting in his 1996 book A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia, in which he painted Serbia as the true victim of the conflict. In 2006, he spoke at the funeral of the Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, declaring: \u201cI don\u2019t know the truth. But I look. I listen. I feel. I remember. This is why I am here today, close to Yugoslavia, close to Serbia, close to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap Inflation across the UK is rising at the slowest rate in almost three years, in a boost to households. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 1.7% year-on-year in September, unchanged from August, and below the Bank of England\u2019s target. This should mean that working age benefits rise next year, ending a four-year austerity freeze that has cost the lowest-earning families hundreds of pounds a year. House price growth has picked up, despite fresh falls in London and the South East. The pound has briefly hit a new five-month high against the US dollar, as Brexit deal rumours fuel volatility. Worries about the American economy have risen, after US retail sales fell for the first time in seven months. The IMF has warned that corporate debt is a ticking timebomb, which could be detonated by the next downturn. Investors fear the US-China trade conflict could escalate soon, after the House of Representatives passed legislation to protect human rights in Hong Kong. Here\u2019s some alarming lunchtime reading (or late-breakfast reading, if you\u2019re in America): Low interest rates are encouraging companies to take on a level of debt that risks becoming a $19tn (\u00a315tn) timebomb in the event of another global recession, the International Monetary Fund has said. In its half-yearly update on the state of the world\u2019s financial markets, the IMF said that almost 40% of the corporate debt in eight leading countries \u2013 the US, China, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 would be impossible to service if there was a downturn half as serious as that of a decade ago. The IMF noted that the stimulus provided by central banks in both developed and developing countries had the side-effect of encouraging firms to borrow more, even though many would have trouble paying it back. Officials at the Washington-based organisation fear that the buildup of debt makes the global financial system highly vulnerable and are telling member states not to repeat the mistake of the early 2000s, when warning signs of a possible market meltdown were ignored... More here: Ouch. Over in America, retail sales have fallen for the first time in seven months, declining by 0.3% in September. This could be a sign that the trade war with China is causing more damage to the US economy, and that the slump in factory demand is spreading to consumers. CNBC has the details: The Commerce Department said on Wednesday retail sales dropped 0.3% last month as households cut back spending on motor vehicles, building materials, hobbies, and online purchases. That was the first and biggest drop since February. Data for August was revised up to show retail sales gaining 0.6% instead of 0.4% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would climb 0.3% in September Newsflash: Sterling has hit its highest level since May, on reports of progress in the Brexit negotiations...before quickly reversing! The pound jumped over $1.28 after RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly reported that the DUP party have accepted the latest proposals regarding consent. That relates to plans for a customs border down the Irish Sea, and whether the Northern Ireland Assembly would have a veto. This suggestion cheered the markets, sending sterling rocketing....until DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was nonsense..... ...sending the pound back down to earth: Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has everything you need to know: Some good news: The husband and wife team who bought Thomas Cook\u2019s network of high street travel agencies out of liquidation have offered jobs to nearly 2,000 of the company\u2019s former workforce. John and Irene Hays are reopening 186 Thomas Cook sites, having beaten two US private equity companies in the race to buy the asset earlier this month. Back to house prices.... and Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton says that younger, first-time buyers are keeping the market moving: \u201cGrowth may be almost static nationwide but it would be even worse were it not for the UK\u2019s army of first-time buyers who are putting a floor under prices with their can-do attitude. \u201cDespite a nuclear winter\u2019s worth of uncertainty, it\u2019s the younger generation who are still forging ahead as if nothing was wrong. They have the longest time horizon and we know that they have continued to transact in huge numbers lately. Figures released yesterday showed that first-time buyers hit their highest level since the financial crisis in August, as low interest rates keep mortgage repayment costs down . My colleague Richard Partington points out that the government\u2019s benefit freeze has cost poorer households nearly \u00a3600 a year each, on average: Households squeezed by the government\u2019s benefits freeze are set to receive the first cash increase in payments in five years, despite the austerity policy costing lower-income families \u00a3580 each year since 2015. According to the Resolution Foundation, working-age benefits \u2013 including child benefit, universal credit, non-disability tax credits and jobseeker\u2019s allowance \u2013 are poised to rise with inflation by 1.7% next April. It would mark the first cash rise since George Osborne launched the benefits freeze in 2015. However, the government has yet to confirm its spending, tax and benefits plans for the year ahead, when the freeze was due to end. The assessment comes after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said inflation remained unchanged in September, with the consumer price index (CPI) holding steady at 1.7%. The inflation reading for September is used by the government to uprate the value of benefits payments each year, as well as state pensions and business rates. According to the latest snapshot from the ONS, inflation stayed at 1.7% as sliding fuel prices were offset by increases in the cost of furniture, household appliances and the cost of booking a hotel room... More here: The IFS points out that freezing benefits payments at 2015 levels has cut the welfare bill by several billion pounds a year. That put struggling families in the front line of the austerity crunch: And even if working benefits do rise by 1.7%, based on today\u2019s inflation reading, that only matches the rising cost of living. In contrast, total wages rose by 4% in the year to July - which would be used for pensions uprating under the triple-lock system. September\u2019s inflation data is traditionally used to set welfare payments. So this morning\u2019s CPI figures should mean that benefits rise by 1.7% next April, assuming the government ends the long austerity freeze. That freeze has capped payments in cash terms, meaning they\u2019ve actually fallen when inflation is taken into account, hurting the poorest families in the UK. The TUC is urging the government to end the freeze: ONS Head of Inflation Mike Hardie sums up this morning\u2019s data: \u201cInflation remained unchanged into September at its lowest rate since late 2016. Motor fuel and second-hand car prices fell, but were offset by price increases for furniture, household appliances and hotel rooms. \u201cAnnual growth in UK house prices showed a moderate pick-up in August although it remains below the increases seen throughout 2018. Wales saw the strongest growth with prices continuing to fall in London and the South East\u201d. Despite recent house price falls in London, it\u2019s still desperately difficult to get onto the housing ladder, or shimmy up the steps. That\u2019s because real wages have only just started growing faster than house prices, meaning property is very unaffordable. The Resolution Foundation have the details, including that London house prices have risen six times faster than earnings in the capital, since 2011. Inflation is also looking subdued in the eurozone. New data today shows that prices are only rising by 0.8% in the last year, the weakest since 2016, down from 1% in August. Good news for households, but a headache for the European Central Bank as it launched another stimulus programme. This could force the ECB to keep easing monetary policy, despite opposition from more hawkish members of its governing council. Howard Archer of EY Item Club predicts house price growth will remain weak, despite bouncing back from a near eight-year low in August. He writes: Despite the August pick-up in house prices reported by the Land Registry, we strongly suspect that house prices will remain soft in the near term with the economy largely struggling and the outlook highly uncertain. Indeed, both the Nationwide and Halifax reported softer house prices in September. Consequently, we expect house prices to only rise around 1.0% over 2019. Should the UK leave the EU with a \u201cdeal\u201d on 31 October - or early next year - we believe reduced uncertainty could see house prices rise by around 2% in 2020. Housing market activity \u2013 and possibly to a lesser extent prices \u2013 could be given a lift in 2020 if the government cuts Stamp Duty significantly in the Budget later this year However, the economy still looks set for a challenging 2020 even if there is a Brexit deal so that the upside for house prices is likely to be limited Uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is hurting house prices, says Jamie Durham, economist at PwC: \u201cWage growth and relatively low unemployment are continuing to support the housing market. But continued uncertainty in the market, related to Brexit among other factors, is likely to be dampening both supply and demand. This is particularly the case in the capital and will likely continue to affect price growth over the coming months.\u201d UK house price inflation has picked up...but not in and around the capital. Average house prices in the UK increased by 1.3% in the year to August 2019, the ONS reports, up from the seven-year low of 0.8% a month ago. That\u2019s still relatively weak by recent standards. As this chart shows, there has been a general slowdown in UK house price growth since 2016 (and a certain referendum....). The average UK house price was \u00a3235,000 in August 2019, \u00a33,000 higher than August 2018 London has led the slowdown -- with prices dropping for several months. Prices fell by 1.4% over the year to August 2019, followed by the South East where prices fell by 0.6% over the year. But there\u2019s solid growth in the North East (3.3%) and the North West (3.1%). There\u2019s still a substantial North-South divide, though, with the average London property costing \u00a3473,000. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is concerned by this week\u2019s economic data: \u201cLow inflation alongside falling employment is a worrying sign the economy is weakening. \u201cThe government needs an urgent plan to protect growth by speeding up higher public sector investment. \u201cAnd MPs must stop the prime minister from forcing through the hardest possible Brexit, which would harm jobs, rights and livelihoods.\u201d A handy reminder of which inflation rates matter: UK inflation has now stuck at its lowest level since December 2016 for two months in a row. It rose sharply in the months following the EU referendum, as the slump in the pound hit import costs. That impact has now faded, slowing the rise in the cost of living The ONS has also found that raw material prices are down year-on-year, by 2.8%. This is pulling down \u2018factory gate inflation\u2019 too. It hit a three-year low last month, meaning manufacturers aren\u2019t raising their prices as fast. At 1.7%, Britain\u2019s headline inflation rate is below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% -- meaning less pressure to consider raising interest rates. But in the current political climate, the BoE is leaning towards cutting borrowing costs - especially if there is another Brexit delay. Sam Cooper, vice president of Market Risk Solutions at Silicon Valley Bank, explains: \u201cWhile the below target reading will provide a welcome distraction for participants searching for some Brexit respite, direction will continue to be driven by political developments. After unemployment data disappointed yesterday, today\u2019s inflation miss could bolster the case for a dovish mantra from the BoE as they navigate uncertain waters. Participants with sterling exposure will likely spend the days chained to their desk as headlines continue to fuel volatility.\u201d September\u2019s subdued inflation is good news for workers -- it means real wages are still growing. Yesterday we learned that average earnings, including bonuses, rose by 3.8% per year in the 12 months to August. That\u2019s down from 4.0% the previous month, though, suggesting the labour market is cooling. Unemployment rose, lifting the jobless rate from 3.8% to 3.9%. Snap reaction The retail prices index (a broader measure of inflation) was also weaker than expected - dropping from 2.6% in August to 2.4% in September. Newsflash: UK inflation remained subdued in September. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 1.7% year-on-year, matching August, and below the 1.8% expected. The Office for National Statistics says; The largest downward contributions to change in the CPIH 12-month inflation rate, between August and September 2019, came from motor fuels, second-hand cars, and electricity, gas and other fuels. These downward movements were offset by upward movements from furniture, household appliances, hotel overnight stays, and from recreation and culture items. More to follow.... The US-driven trade conflict is giving the global economy depression. So warns Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who says America\u2019s move away from free trade is the more important geopolitical issue driving markets (followed by Brexit). He cites yesterday\u2019s gloomy economic forecasts from the IMF, which now expects the weakest growth in a decade, adding: It\u2019s worth pointing out, as an aside, that the IMF isn\u2019t in the business of scaremongering: As late as July 2008 they weren\u2019t forecasting a 2009 recession in any of the world\u2019s biggest economies. Indeed, today\u2019s forecast of 3% global growth this year, and 3.4% next year, compares to a forecast in July 2008 of 4.1% that year and 3.9% in 2009. Speaking of Brexit.... Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has warned of chaos at the ports if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The National Audit Office says, in a timely warning, that there could be freight delays, more crime and fewer checks on migrants entering the country. Losing control, rather than taking it back..... Sterling has taken a bit of a bath this morning, as traders fret that a last-minute Brexit deal isn\u2019t going to happen. The pound has dropped by almost a cent, back below $1.27, having hit a five-month high of $1.2798 on Tuesday Boris Johnson is struggling to persuade the Northern Ireland unionist DUP party to support his proposal of a customs border in the Irish Sea. EU and UK officials are still talking, but one British insider says there is \u201cmore work still to do\u201d. But not much time, with an European Council summit starting tomorrow. Online fashion company ASOS is bucking the trend this morning, with its shares surging 16% in early trading after reporting financial results. That\u2019s quite a jump, especially as ASOS had a shocking year. Pre-tax profits slumped 68% in the 12 months to 31 August, following serious problems at warehouses in Germany and the US that messed up trading. The company admits it overreached itself, by trying to pull off major expansion in the US and Europe at the same time. With a dollop of mea culpa, it tells shareholders: Accordingly we lost focus on several of our core competencies, notably product, presentation and customer engagement. But sales are still up 13%, despite these hitches, and CEO Nick Beighton claims to be in a \u201cmore positive position\u201d for this financial year. European stock markets have made a lacklustre start to trading too, with the Stoxx 600 index down 0.25%. There\u2019s another problem with the US-China trade \u2018deal\u2019 announced on Friday. Beijing has, apparently, pledged to buy $50bn of US farm products - a major increase on the $20bn traded in 2017. So to achieve it, China would have to drop tariffs on US agricultural goods. Sources have told Bloomberg that Beijing wants the US to roll back some of its own tariffs in return, and won\u2019t act otherwise.... China\u2019s stock market has lost some ground overnight. The Shanghai Composite Index is down 0.4% in late trading, amid worries that the \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal could be unravelling. Other Asia-Pacific markets are up, though, taking their cue from Wall Street (where the S&amp;P 500 gained 1% on Tuesday). The row between Beijing and Washington over Hong Kong is threatening to derail the trade war talks, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group: US stock futures headed south in the overnight trading session, as tensions with China started rising again amid the US House passed a bill on Hong Kong, which requires a review of the situation in the city on annual basis to keep its special status in place. Needless to say that Beijing didn\u2019t like the US sticking its nose into its internal affairs at all, and threatened to retaliate. Before that, Chinese officials had said that they would buy massive amounts of US farm products, only if the US removed the tariffs on its exports. Here, we are talking about roughly $40/50 billion US dollar worth of US farm products, versus $20 billion purchased in 2017, before the trade relations between the two countries deteriorated. But that dream of Trump\u2019s could turn out to be fiction. As such, the optimism regarding a possible trade deal between the US and China has been shot down within a couple of days after the Washington negotiations. It looks like trouble is brewing again on the US-China trade front. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s lots of jitteriness in the markets today, as optimism of a breakthrough in the US-China trade war fade...and Brexit heads towards a climax. Last weekend, Donald Trump claimed to have pulled off \u201cone of the biggest deals that\u2019s been made in a long time, with China.\u201d But it\u2019s now clear that the \u2018deal\u2019 doesn\u2019t really exist -- nothing\u2019s been signed yet, and thorny issues such as China\u2019s habit of forcing US companies to hand over technology secrets haven\u2019t been addressed at all. Such details might not matter to a president hungry for success. But they do matter to investors, especially as tensions between Washington and Beijing are on the rise again today. Overnight, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that aims to defend civil rights in Hong Kong. The bill would end the territory\u2019s special trading status with America, unless the US was happy that it respected human rights and the rule of law. China is deeply unhappy; overnight, it\u2019s threatened to retaliate if the bill is also passed by the Senate, and made into law. Any retaliation would escalate tensions between the two countries, and surely undermine efforts to actually end the trade war. In an early warning shot, Beijing has fixed the yuan at its lowest level in a month, at 7.0746 yuan to the dollar. Anxiety over the trade situation is likely to pull the US stock market down today. It had rallied on Tuesday, after strong results from UnitedHealth Group and JPMorgan Chase calmed recession fears.

Broadband speed reports released by companies such as Ookla, M-Lab and Akamai show how each country fares for broadband, with Australia lagging behind. According to the latest Ookla report for September, Australia ranks at 61 in the world for fixed broadband. The result is often seized upon by people unhappy with the speeds they can get on the Coalition\u2019s multi-technology mix NBN, but NBN Co said the results cannot be relied upon and has devised another measure to make the rankings a more \u201cfair\u201d representation of Australia\u2019s broadband. NBN Co commissioned research firm Alpha Beta to analyse the data behind speed tests and come up with a method of ranking broadband that is a more like-for-like comparison with other countries around the world. Rue launched the report at Broadband World Forum in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Alpha Beta argues in its report that speed tests are not representative of the whole country\u2019s internet access because they only account for people who use the speed tests.

      "body": "<p>They warn of danger and yet lighthouses in fiction rarely seem to keep characters safe. Work in one and suffer loneliness or worse. Set foot in one in any capacity and immediately feel your options narrowing. There may be only one way in but there will be two ways out, one of which you don\u2019t want to think about. They rise out of the land \u2013 and the sea \u2013 with the undeniable power of a symbol, a prophecy.</p> <p>In 1998, a friend working in publishing asked me to read a novel that had recently been published in France, <a href=\"https://www.confingopublishing.uk/product-page/pharricide-uk-postage-free\">Pharricide by Vincent de Swarte</a>, and write a report on it. I fell immediately and deeply in love with it and wrote in my report that not only should the UK publisher obtain the rights, but they should let me translate it. They didn\u2019t obtain the rights and so I spent the next 20 years trying to find a publisher willing to take it on. Finally, I struck lucky with Confingo Publishing, my translation appearing earlier this year \u2013 too late for De Swarte, who sadly died in 2006 aged only 42.</p> <p>Pharricide tells the story of amateur taxidermist Geoffroy Lefayen, who embarks on a six-month stint as solo lighthouse keeper at Cordouan off the French Atlantic coast. As he unpacks his knives, he prays that not a soul comes to the lighthouse during the time that he\u2019s there.</p> <p>Below are 10 similar landmark stories.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alice-thompson/pharos/\">Pharos by Alice Thompson</a><br></strong>All of Scottish author Thompson\u2019s novels feature details from surrealist paintings on their covers \u2013 by Ernst, Delvaux, Magritte, De Chirico and Conroy Maddox \u2013 apart from this one, her third, but it could easily have done. A ghost story about a haunted lighthouse and island, it has a dreamlike atmosphere similar to that in her later novel Burnt Island. Characters are always noticing other characters walking across the beach towards them, as if out of nowhere. Stephen King is a fan.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/the-lighthouse-alison-moore-review\">The Lighthouse by Alison Moore</a><br></strong>The key lighthouse in this Booker-shortlisted novel is a small silver case that once contained a phial of perfume owned by the main character\u2019s mother. Futh carries the little silver lighthouse everywhere. Were it to be lost or stolen, one imagines, the consequences would be dire. There is another lighthouse, in Futh\u2019s childhood, and there\u2019s one on the cover, which appears black, but only because it is a negative image of a white lighthouse. The owner of a black lighthouse telephoned the publishers to express righteous anger that permission had not been sought to photograph her lighthouse. It fell to me, as the book\u2019s editor, to call her back. I enjoyed making that call.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/titles/tom-fletcher/the-thing-on-the-shore/9781782061960/\">The Thing on the Shore by Tom Fletcher</a><br></strong>If a lighthouse is a symbol, it may be a phallic one, as Helen Dunmore concedes in <a href=\"https://granta.com/To-the-Lighthouse/\">her lovely Granta piece</a> about Virginia Woolf\u2019s To the Lighthouse. Here, however, Whitehaven lighthouse \u2013 painted red and white with a green \u201ceye\u201d \u2013 is closely associated with the main character Arthur\u2019s mother. A novel that reads as if HP Lovecraft had moved to West Cumbria in 2011.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://chaserjay.wordpress.com/2014/11/14/a-taste-of-agnes-owens-the-lighthouse/\">The Lighthouse by Agnes Owens</a><br></strong>In this short story, a beach is full of threats and dangers. Megan wants to go to the lighthouse, but her younger brother Bobby does not. She warns him that a monster might get him if he doesn\u2019t comply. His understanding of \u201cmonster\u201d is unusual and we worry about the man in the grey tracksuit, even the woman walking her dog. The absent parents may be neglectful. The man in the grey tracksuit says it\u2019s not safe: they might get hit by a golf ball. Megan repeats part of the warning to Bobby before heading off. A pitiless story well told.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/dec/14/fiction.features2\">In the Cut by Susanna Moore</a><br></strong>There\u2019s a little lighthouse in this New York-set thriller first published in 1995. We don\u2019t see much of it, but it\u2019s important. A creative writing teacher witnesses a sex act involving a woman who later winds up dead. On page four we read that \u201csome of [her students] admitted that before completing the Virginia Woolf assignment they\u2019d smoked a little dope and it had helped\u201d. One of the best novels I\u2019ve read in years \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.weidenfeldandnicolson.co.uk/titles/susanna-moore/in-the-cut/9781474613606/\">about to be reissued</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cc6dac381f3ad0c8c250164c49eae94d61cd502\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc6dac381f3ad0c8c250164c49eae94d61cd502/0_387_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flamborough Head lighthouse in Yorkshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portentous prospect \u2026 Flamborough Head lighthouse in Yorkshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McLoughlin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6. <a href=\"http://www.centipedepress.com/horror/writingmadness.html\">The Wreck of the Aurora by Patrick McGrath</a><br></strong>In this vivid and powerful short story, first published in ST Joshi\u2019s anthology A Mountain Walked, the building of a lighthouse on a \u201chunk of basalt\u201d protruding from the Pacific Ocean is described in terms that remind one of the construction of a pyramid. This lighthouse will become synonymous with death when one night its keeper locks his companions in their rooms and turns off the power. Years later a woman visits the rock to try to understand why the keeper \u2013 her father \u2013 killed the light.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/29/crime.pdjames\">The Lighthouse by PD James</a><br></strong>James\u2019s long-serving detective Adam Dalgliesh, making his 13th appearance, is a poet as well as a policeman.

      "bodyText": "They warn of danger and yet lighthouses in fiction rarely seem to keep characters safe. Work in one and suffer loneliness or worse. Set foot in one in any capacity and immediately feel your options narrowing. There may be only one way in but there will be two ways out, one of which you don\u2019t want to think about. They rise out of the land \u2013 and the sea \u2013 with the undeniable power of a symbol, a prophecy. In 1998, a friend working in publishing asked me to read a novel that had recently been published in France, Pharricide by Vincent de Swarte, and write a report on it. I fell immediately and deeply in love with it and wrote in my report that not only should the UK publisher obtain the rights, but they should let me translate it. They didn\u2019t obtain the rights and so I spent the next 20 years trying to find a publisher willing to take it on. Finally, I struck lucky with Confingo Publishing, my translation appearing earlier this year \u2013 too late for De Swarte, who sadly died in 2006 aged only 42. Pharricide tells the story of amateur taxidermist Geoffroy Lefayen, who embarks on a six-month stint as solo lighthouse keeper at Cordouan off the French Atlantic coast. As he unpacks his knives, he prays that not a soul comes to the lighthouse during the time that he\u2019s there. Below are 10 similar landmark stories. 1. Pharos by Alice Thompson All of Scottish author Thompson\u2019s novels feature details from surrealist paintings on their covers \u2013 by Ernst, Delvaux, Magritte, De Chirico and Conroy Maddox \u2013 apart from this one, her third, but it could easily have done. A ghost story about a haunted lighthouse and island, it has a dreamlike atmosphere similar to that in her later novel Burnt Island. Characters are always noticing other characters walking across the beach towards them, as if out of nowhere. Stephen King is a fan. 2. The Lighthouse by Alison Moore The key lighthouse in this Booker-shortlisted novel is a small silver case that once contained a phial of perfume owned by the main character\u2019s mother. Futh carries the little silver lighthouse everywhere. Were it to be lost or stolen, one imagines, the consequences would be dire. There is another lighthouse, in Futh\u2019s childhood, and there\u2019s one on the cover, which appears black, but only because it is a negative image of a white lighthouse. The owner of a black lighthouse telephoned the publishers to express righteous anger that permission had not been sought to photograph her lighthouse. It fell to me, as the book\u2019s editor, to call her back. I enjoyed making that call. 3. The Thing on the Shore by Tom Fletcher If a lighthouse is a symbol, it may be a phallic one, as Helen Dunmore concedes in her lovely Granta piece about Virginia Woolf\u2019s To the Lighthouse. Here, however, Whitehaven lighthouse \u2013 painted red and white with a green \u201ceye\u201d \u2013 is closely associated with the main character Arthur\u2019s mother. A novel that reads as if HP Lovecraft had moved to West Cumbria in 2011. 4. The Lighthouse by Agnes Owens In this short story, a beach is full of threats and dangers. Megan wants to go to the lighthouse, but her younger brother Bobby does not. She warns him that a monster might get him if he doesn\u2019t comply. His understanding of \u201cmonster\u201d is unusual and we worry about the man in the grey tracksuit, even the woman walking her dog. The absent parents may be neglectful. The man in the grey tracksuit says it\u2019s not safe: they might get hit by a golf ball. Megan repeats part of the warning to Bobby before heading off. A pitiless story well told. 5. In the Cut by Susanna Moore There\u2019s a little lighthouse in this New York-set thriller first published in 1995. We don\u2019t see much of it, but it\u2019s important. A creative writing teacher witnesses a sex act involving a woman who later winds up dead. On page four we read that \u201csome of [her students] admitted that before completing the Virginia Woolf assignment they\u2019d smoked a little dope and it had helped\u201d. One of the best novels I\u2019ve read in years \u2013 and about to be reissued. 6. The Wreck of the Aurora by Patrick McGrath In this vivid and powerful short story, first published in ST Joshi\u2019s anthology A Mountain Walked, the building of a lighthouse on a \u201chunk of basalt\u201d protruding from the Pacific Ocean is described in terms that remind one of the construction of a pyramid. This lighthouse will become synonymous with death when one night its keeper locks his companions in their rooms and turns off the power. Years later a woman visits the rock to try to understand why the keeper \u2013 her father \u2013 killed the light. 7. The Lighthouse by PD James James\u2019s long-serving detective Adam Dalgliesh, making his 13th appearance, is a poet as well as a policeman. If poetry depends on concision and the avoidance of cliche, it\u2019s a little ironic that he ends up in this long book alongside a character sporting \u201clarge hazel eyes\u201d and \u201can aquiline nose\u201d. There has been a death, possibly a murder, on an island off the Cornish coast where the prime minister is hoping to organise a meeting of minds. It\u2019s hard to remain undistracted by the thought of one\u2019s actual PM being helicoptered out to the same island and ideally staying there. 8. To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf To the Lighthouse is partly about power and largely about portraying consciousness, but as a reading experience it can feel like an exercise in eternally delayed gratification. It has been acclaimed as a masterpiece since its appearance in 1927. But it\u2019s not exactly long on action, and the young boy James is not the only one who wants to get to the sodding lighthouse. You start to wonder if Woolf will have the bottle actually to postpone arrival beyond the end of the novel. No spoilers here. 9. Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer To the Lighthouse with guns. All the action Woolf left out ended up in this first part of VanderMeer\u2019s Southern Reach trilogy, published in 2014. Four female scientists are transported into an abandoned landscape, Area X, where they face treachery and constant danger. A distant lighthouse represents the possibility of escape. Essentially the record of a really, really bad trip, this is much, much better than the film. 10. The Lighthouse by Edgar Allan Poe Soloing in a lighthouse designed to be looked after by three men, the purported writer of this brief account opens a logbook on the first day of January 1796 by confiding his wish to be alone. By day two he is in ecstasy. Could this fragment of an unfinished story, the diary of a lighthouse keeper, written in 1849 and now available online, have inspired Pharricide? \u2022 Pharricide by Vincent de Swarte (translated by Nicholas Royle) is published by Confingo.",

      "bodyText": "Profits at Asos have plunged by nearly 70% in a tumultuous year during which the former stock market darling\u2019s shares plummeted and the online fashion retailer grappled with IT chaos at its overseas warehouses. Sales rose by 13% to \u00a32.7bn in the year to 31 August, but pretax profits fell by 68% to \u00a333.1m. Major IT problems at Asos\u2019s warehouses, which hurt sales and drove up costs, forced the retailer to issue two profit warnings in the past year. It did not provide a forecast for the current year. The 19-year-old company, which caters for fashion-hungry twentysomethings, hit a high point in November 2017 when it overtook Marks &amp; Spencer with a market value of \u00a34.89bn. For years, the online fashion trailblazer seemed unstoppable and its shares reached a peak of \u00a377.30 in March 2018. Since then, they have lost more than half their value, as Asos was dogged by the warehouse issues and admitted it was not immune to the consumer slowdown. The company said it had been wrongfooted by the extent of discounting undertaken by rivals, especially during the Black Friday shopping season last year, when its 20% off promotions failed to match competitors. Meanwhile, its online rival Boohoo has flourished, with a near-40% surge in quarterly sales. Boohoo\u2019s brands include PrettyLittleThing, Nasty Gal and MissPap, and it recently bought the online businesses of Karen Millen and Coast out of administration. Asos\u2019s sales in the UK, which rose by 15%, were unaffected by the problems in Germany and the US. The company\u2019s warehouse in Berlin struggled with a switch from processing orders manually to automated systems, while its new Atlanta site, opened in February, failed to keep up with customer orders and ran out of stock. Sales in the EU rose by 12% over the year while US sales grew by 9%. More than 60% of the company\u2019s revenue comes from outside the UK. Nick Beighton, the chief executive, said: \u201cClearly last year did not go as well as we planned.

He was broke and couldn\u2019t afford his medication.</p> <p>When he doesn\u2019t take his meds, \u201cit sort of throws off my day-to-day function to the point where I can\u2019t complete a sentence,\u201d he says. \u201cMy condition just gets worse and I go into a downward spiral where I need to go into care sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>These suspensions are becoming increasingly common and will be considered by the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, who is examining the impact of digital technology on social safety nets around the world.</p> <h2>\u2018People are left without anywhere to turn\u2019</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s welfare system is often touted by its politicians <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/what-they-said-on-day-2-of-the-campaign\">as the most efficient</a><a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/what-they-said-on-day-2-of-the-campaign\"> and the envy of the world</a>.</p> <p>Bureaucrats and politicians alike have embraced technology and automation with open arms. As part of a sweeping digitisation push slated to finish in 2022, benefits claims are now conducted online. Since 2013, welfare recipients have been pushed away from Centrelink shop fronts and on to the MyGov online portal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab75f49c7e0508e6cfe8934d8545a458c6a4a199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab75f49c7e0508e6cfe8934d8545a458c6a4a199/349_0_4045_2429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The text warning people their payments are suspended.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The text warning welfare recipients their payments are suspended.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony McDonough</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The centre-right coalition government is already facing legal action over its Robodebt scheme, which critics say uses a flawed algorithm to accuse benefits recipients of owing a welfare debt. But there have been other, less-remarked-upon changes, too.</p> <p>Last year, the government overhauled the way it sanctions welfare recipients accused of gaming the system. In a briefing to the privately run job service agencies that administer the new policies, an <a href=\"https://nesa.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ty-Emerson-Targeted-Compliance-Framework.pdf\">official summed up the changes</a>: \u201cProcesses will be automated as much as possible to simplify administration.\u201d</p> <p>Welfare advocates say the consequences have been disastrous. In the space of a year, the new policy has increased the number of welfare payment suspensions to 2.7m.</p> <p>In 12 months, welfare payments were stopped an extra 1m times.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shifting of decision-making that is increasing the amount of automatic suspensions,\u201d says the policy analyst Simone Casey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-07T05:37:46/embed.html\" data-alt=\"graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2019-08-07T05:37:46/embed.html\">graph</a> </figure>  <p>Under the most recent changes, the government has prioritised welfare suspensions over sanctions, in which a person has their payments docked for doing the wrong thing. These penalties, which used to be applied manually by a staff member, have dropped significantly. Instead, a recipient\u2019s money is cut off automatically until they satisfy their job agency consultant that they are committed to looking for work.</p> <p>Casey, who used to engage with the government regularly in her work as a policy analyst adviser to not-for-profit job agencies, says that over time consultants have been handed less decision-making power over how to penalise \u2013 or not \u2013 the welfare recipients they are employed to help.</p> <p>Consultants have less discretion when a welfare recipient does not turn up to an appointment or misses another compulsory activity. They enter a code into a system that automatically triggers a payment suspension.</p> <p>The same goes when the welfare recipient fails to report their income or confirm they met their job search requirements via digital channels.</p> <p>Money is stopped first, and questions are asked later. The idea is that this will encourage people to follow the rules.</p> <p>\u201cIn some cases it\u2019s left single parents without money for food for their children over a weekend because they haven\u2019t logged in and reported their attendance,\u201d says Adrianne Walters, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so the computer says, \u2018No payments\u2019. And then that person is left without anywhere to turn until their employment service provider opens up again on the Monday.\u201d</p> <p>The National Social Security Rights Network represents community legal centres who take calls daily from welfare recipients that feel wronged by the system.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more people call up because of automation,\u201d says Jai Manoharachandran, a policy officer at the network.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck, every little bit counts. And the idea that you might have to try and stretch your income for a few days before you get back-paid, it\u2019s incredibly stressful for clients. They often don\u2019t understand why their payments have been suspended.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4328f9b3f6ac6432ba16bbeba03648df48482a1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4328f9b3f6ac6432ba16bbeba03648df48482a1a/0_234_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Johnson at her home in Perth\u2019s south-eastern suburbs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Johnson at her home in Perth\u2019s south-eastern suburbs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony McDonough/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rebecca Johnson, 39, lives in Perth, in Western Australia, with her 21-year-old son. He has autism and also receives government benefits. She says she \u201chonestly can\u2019t remember\u201d how many times her payments have been suspended.</p> <p>Since the new policies were introduced, about 50,000 suspension notifications now go out to welfare recipients across the country each week.</p> <p>When they contact their job agency, the consultant decides whether or not they had a fair reason for missing their appointment. If not, they are given \u201cdemerit point\u201d, which can lead to harsher penalties.</p> <p>But analysis of government statistics by the Guardian shows about 75% of the time, benefits recipients who had their payments suspended under the new system were not at fault. The data shows payments were suspended 2.7m times in 12 months, but only <a href=\"https://docs.employment.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/tcf_public_data_report_-_full_year_2018-19_0.pdf\">654,ooo demerits were handed out</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/15/parentsnext-80-of-recipients-who-had-payments-suspended-not-at-fault-data-shows\">ParentsNext: 80% of recipients who had payments suspended not at fault, data shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Guardian has tracked the new system since it was rolled out, finding that the homeless and single parents are disproportionately impacted. In six months, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/14/coalition-stopped-welfare-payments-to-55000-homeless-or-at-risk-jobseekers-in-six-months\">55,000 homeless people received a suspension</a>; yet there are only about 60,000 homeless people receiving welfare at any given time.</p> <p>Meanwhile, across a controversial welfare-to-work program for single parents with children under five, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/15/parentsnext-80-of-recipients-who-had-payments-suspended-not-at-fault-data-shows\">85% had their payments suspended automatically</a> but were later cleared of wrongdoing. The overwhelming majority were single mothers.</p> <p>On one occasion, Johnson says she had her welfare cut after she was given four phone appointments with her job agency over 10 days.</p> <p>\u201cI was at work and they just kept changing them with no contact,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no contact as to what was really going on. Just I kept getting these text messages saying that you\u2019ve got appointment on this day, you got an appointment on this day.\u201d</p> <p>The last text in the chain, shown to the Guardian, says: \u201cYour payment has been suspended for not attending your provider appointment. To restore payment you need to attend a provider appointment.\u201d</p> <p>The government says payments are turned back on once people re-engage with the system. But observers say it doesn\u2019t always work like this in practice.</p> <p>Manoharachandran tells the story of one client who was already broke when her welfare payments were suspended.</p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have money for the train to go to her job service provider,\u201d they say. \u201cShe had no money for food or other essentials. So basically, she needed to get the suspension lifted as soon as possible. She ended up riding the train without a ticket and picking up a $200 fine.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then when she got to the provider, they initially told her they couldn\u2019t see her that day and she\u2019d have to come back the next day to re-engage and get that suspension lifted. She didn\u2019t even have the money to get home. She\u2019d already incurred a $200 fine getting there.\u201d</p> <p>For Johnson, the suspensions mean stress and hoop-jumping at best. Other times, it\u2019s much worse. \u201cYou virtually have no money left,\u201d she says of living on Australia\u2019s unemployment benefit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/23/one-of-the-worst-how-newstart-compares-to-unemployment-payments-in-rest-of-the-world\">which is among the lowest in the OECD</a>.</p> <p>The last time her payments were suspended, she had no money for the weekend. And it wasn\u2019t even her fault: a system glitch with the digital app meant she could not report her income to Centrelink.</p> <p>\u201cYou try and do the right things, you still get punished,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I see it.</p> <h2> \u2018The system is geared to be very aggressive\u2019</h2> <p>The most vocal critic of this system has been Rachel Siewert, a senator with the Australian Greens.</p> <p>\u201cThe system is geared to be very aggressive towards job seekers, and people looking for work,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is what we predicted would happen given the way the system is set up.\u201d</p> <p>Over time, people receiving benefits in Australia have been given more responsibilities. Increasingly, this involves using technology \u2013 an online portal or smartphone app \u2013 to regularly report information back to the government.</p> <p>The government has also established a trial for welfare recipients engaging with job agencies. In time, it hopes a large proportion of them will not go into an office for help and will instead deal with their consultant using an online platform.</p> <p>Siewert is not convinced it will work. \u201cI\u2019m not having a go at technology but that it can make it harder,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve also got certain groups of people that don\u2019t have the same digital skills.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying older all older people don\u2019t understand technology, but many of them don\u2019t. They\u2019re finding themselves unemployed, later in their career, they may have been involved in an industry that didn\u2019t have to become particularly technically literate, and they are also being alienated through the approach.\u201d</p> <p>The same goes for Johnson\u2019s son, whose autism means he struggles to navigate the increasingly digital system. He sometimes forgets to report his income to Centrelink. That does not trigger a phone call asking him what happened, just a payment suspension.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/oct/15/zombie-debt-benefits-overpayment-poverty\">Zombie debts are hounding struggling Americans.

Despite the huge increase in welfare payment suspensions, it says most people end up having their payments restored before they are delayed.</p> <p>Moreover, the new system has one clear benefit in its eyes.

Walters, of the Human Rights Law Centre, points to a study by researchers from the University of York that found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/22/benefit-sanctions-found-to-be-ineffective-and-damaging\">welfare penalties were ineffective</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s that starting point, you\u2019ve got a program that is causing the stress to Australian families,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you automate that programme, we automate the decision-making, you essentially turbo-charge those impacts.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s phone and email are full of messages telling her about her suspensions. She argues she should at least have a phone conversation with someone before her income is stopped.</p> <p>But she\u2019s used to getting those notifications now. What does she think when she gets the news?</p> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know I probably just, \u2018Again?\u2019 There\u2019s always something,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s never-ending. \u2018What have I done this time?\u2019 Or just another drama to deal with. \u2018I don\u2019t have time for this crap.\u2019 That\u2019s what I feel like.\u201d</p>",

Bureaucrats and politicians alike have embraced technology and automation with open arms. As part of a sweeping digitisation push slated to finish in 2022, benefits claims are now conducted online. Since 2013, welfare recipients have been pushed away from Centrelink shop fronts and on to the MyGov online portal. The centre-right coalition government is already facing legal action over its Robodebt scheme, which critics say uses a flawed algorithm to accuse benefits recipients of owing a welfare debt. But there have been other, less-remarked-upon changes, too. Last year, the government overhauled the way it sanctions welfare recipients accused of gaming the system. In a briefing to the privately run job service agencies that administer the new policies, an official summed up the changes: \u201cProcesses will be automated as much as possible to simplify administration.\u201d Welfare advocates say the consequences have been disastrous. In the space of a year, the new policy has increased the number of welfare payment suspensions to 2.7m. In 12 months, welfare payments were stopped an extra 1m times. \u201cThere\u2019s a shifting of decision-making that is increasing the amount of automatic suspensions,\u201d says the policy analyst Simone Casey. Under the most recent changes, the government has prioritised welfare suspensions over sanctions, in which a person has their payments docked for doing the wrong thing. These penalties, which used to be applied manually by a staff member, have dropped significantly. Instead, a recipient\u2019s money is cut off automatically until they satisfy their job agency consultant that they are committed to looking for work. Casey, who used to engage with the government regularly in her work as a policy analyst adviser to not-for-profit job agencies, says that over time consultants have been handed less decision-making power over how to penalise \u2013 or not \u2013 the welfare recipients they are employed to help. Consultants have less discretion when a welfare recipient does not turn up to an appointment or misses another compulsory activity. They enter a code into a system that automatically triggers a payment suspension. The same goes when the welfare recipient fails to report their income or confirm they met their job search requirements via digital channels. Money is stopped first, and questions are asked later. The idea is that this will encourage people to follow the rules. \u201cIn some cases it\u2019s left single parents without money for food for their children over a weekend because they haven\u2019t logged in and reported their attendance,\u201d says Adrianne Walters, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre. \u201cAnd so the computer says, \u2018No payments\u2019. And then that person is left without anywhere to turn until their employment service provider opens up again on the Monday.\u201d The National Social Security Rights Network represents community legal centres who take calls daily from welfare recipients that feel wronged by the system. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more people call up because of automation,\u201d says Jai Manoharachandran, a policy officer at the network. \u201cWhen you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck, every little bit counts. And the idea that you might have to try and stretch your income for a few days before you get back-paid, it\u2019s incredibly stressful for clients. They often don\u2019t understand why their payments have been suspended.\u201d Rebecca Johnson, 39, lives in Perth, in Western Australia, with her 21-year-old son. He has autism and also receives government benefits. She says she \u201chonestly can\u2019t remember\u201d how many times her payments have been suspended. Since the new policies were introduced, about 50,000 suspension notifications now go out to welfare recipients across the country each week. When they contact their job agency, the consultant decides whether or not they had a fair reason for missing their appointment. If not, they are given \u201cdemerit point\u201d, which can lead to harsher penalties. But analysis of government statistics by the Guardian shows about 75% of the time, benefits recipients who had their payments suspended under the new system were not at fault. The data shows payments were suspended 2.7m times in 12 months, but only 654,ooo demerits were handed out. The Guardian has tracked the new system since it was rolled out, finding that the homeless and single parents are disproportionately impacted. In six months, 55,000 homeless people received a suspension; yet there are only about 60,000 homeless people receiving welfare at any given time. Meanwhile, across a controversial welfare-to-work program for single parents with children under five, 85% had their payments suspended automatically but were later cleared of wrongdoing. The overwhelming majority were single mothers. On one occasion, Johnson says she had her welfare cut after she was given four phone appointments with her job agency over 10 days. \u201cI was at work and they just kept changing them with no contact,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no contact as to what was really going on. Just I kept getting these text messages saying that you\u2019ve got appointment on this day, you got an appointment on this day.\u201d The last text in the chain, shown to the Guardian, says: \u201cYour payment has been suspended for not attending your provider appointment. To restore payment you need to attend a provider appointment.\u201d The government says payments are turned back on once people re-engage with the system. But observers say it doesn\u2019t always work like this in practice. Manoharachandran tells the story of one client who was already broke when her welfare payments were suspended. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have money for the train to go to her job service provider,\u201d they say. \u201cShe had no money for food or other essentials. So basically, she needed to get the suspension lifted as soon as possible. She ended up riding the train without a ticket and picking up a $200 fine. \u201cAnd then when she got to the provider, they initially told her they couldn\u2019t see her that day and she\u2019d have to come back the next day to re-engage and get that suspension lifted. She didn\u2019t even have the money to get home. She\u2019d already incurred a $200 fine getting there.\u201d For Johnson, the suspensions mean stress and hoop-jumping at best. Other times, it\u2019s much worse. \u201cYou virtually have no money left,\u201d she says of living on Australia\u2019s unemployment benefit, which is among the lowest in the OECD. The last time her payments were suspended, she had no money for the weekend. And it wasn\u2019t even her fault: a system glitch with the digital app meant she could not report her income to Centrelink. \u201cYou try and do the right things, you still get punished,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I see it. \u2018The system is geared to be very aggressive\u2019 The most vocal critic of this system has been Rachel Siewert, a senator with the Australian Greens. \u201cThe system is geared to be very aggressive towards job seekers, and people looking for work,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is what we predicted would happen given the way the system is set up.\u201d Over time, people receiving benefits in Australia have been given more responsibilities. Increasingly, this involves using technology \u2013 an online portal or smartphone app \u2013 to regularly report information back to the government. The government has also established a trial for welfare recipients engaging with job agencies. In time, it hopes a large proportion of them will not go into an office for help and will instead deal with their consultant using an online platform. Siewert is not convinced it will work. \u201cI\u2019m not having a go at technology but that it can make it harder,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve also got certain groups of people that don\u2019t have the same digital skills. \u201cI\u2019m not saying older all older people don\u2019t understand technology, but many of them don\u2019t. They\u2019re finding themselves unemployed, later in their career, they may have been involved in an industry that didn\u2019t have to become particularly technically literate, and they are also being alienated through the approach.\u201d The same goes for Johnson\u2019s son, whose autism means he struggles to navigate the increasingly digital system. He sometimes forgets to report his income to Centrelink. That does not trigger a phone call asking him what happened, just a payment suspension. \u201cI have to remind him so we don\u2019t get paid for a day or two later until you report,\u201d Johnson says. The government is convinced the new system is working. Despite the huge increase in welfare payment suspensions, it says most people end up having their payments restored before they are delayed. Moreover, the new system has one clear benefit in its eyes. It is expected to save a few hundred million dollars. Critics say the true cost is felt by people engaging with the system. Walters, of the Human Rights Law Centre, points to a study by researchers from the University of York that found welfare penalties were ineffective. \u201cThat\u2019s that starting point, you\u2019ve got a program that is causing the stress to Australian families,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you automate that programme, we automate the decision-making, you essentially turbo-charge those impacts.\u201d Johnson\u2019s phone and email are full of messages telling her about her suspensions. She argues she should at least have a phone conversation with someone before her income is stopped. But she\u2019s used to getting those notifications now. What does she think when she gets the news? \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know I probably just, \u2018Again?\u2019 There\u2019s always something,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s never-ending. \u2018What have I done this time?\u2019 Or just another drama to deal with. \u2018I don\u2019t have time for this crap.\u2019 That\u2019s what I feel like.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There are some words that are impossible to say without sounding fancy. \u201cCaviar\u201d is one of them. It\u2019s the hallmark of fine dining; the crown jewel of a canape; one of the last few foods that, in a world of lobster baps and truffle mash, remain flashy. When the Sous Chef website looked at the UK\u2019s two- and three-Michelin-starred restaurants this month, it <a href=\"https://www.souschef.co.uk/blogs/the-bureau-of-taste/the-uk-s-most-michelin-ingredients\" title=\"\">found that caviar featured on 72% of the menus</a>.</p> <p>Yet there is no denying caviar has an image problem. Until just a few decades ago, fishermen would haul beluga sturgeon out of the Caspian and Black seas, cut out the \u201croe sacks\u201d that held their eggs, and throw the fish back in to die. As a result, sturgeon became critically endangered. The international trade in wild sturgeon from the region has been banned since 2006, and although there are a growing number of sturgeon farms around the world that attempt to make the process more sustainable, the methods used to extract the eggs, and the morality of dedicating valuable resources toward producing this symbol of luxury, mean the ethics of caviar remain vague.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like shark-fin soup, where you have desperate fishermen catching sharks, cutting off their fins and throwing them back,\u201d says Chris King, executive chef of the Langham hotel in London. \u201cThere\u2019s a moral question to caviar, of course, but sturgeon can be farmed. It <em>is</em> farmed.\u201d Serving the caviar he sources for the Langham is, he says, no more or less ethically troublesome than serving quality beef or farmed Scottish salmon. What matters to King is that he buys the best and serves it in such a way that his diners \u201cunderstand what the fuss is about. Most people don\u2019t have it often. It\u2019s important they get a good chunk, and it\u2019s served in an elegant way.\u201d</p> <p>Yet attitudes towards sourcing and serving caviar are shifting. Although the Langham still offers it in those gleaming round tins, to be eaten by the spoonful, it is rarely called for nowadays; gone, too, is the demand for blinis with a dollop of creme fraiche. \u201cThese days, I sell caviar much more in dishes where it is an element, such as our roasted scallops with caviar,\u201d King says. \u201cTastes are changing, and people are asking if tins and blinis are really the way to appreciate caviar, with all its nuances of texture and taste.\u201d</p> <p>Charles Smith, head chef at the Lords of the Manor hotel in Gloucestershire, says he values caviar \u201cmore for the flavour profile than the prestige around it\u201d. He likes to dish it up alongside native lobster, whose sweet meat pairs perfectly with the eggs\u2019 saltiness. \u201cThere will always be those people coming into the hotel and wanting a tin of caviar for the aesthetics of it, but to me it\u2019s an ingredient,\u201d he says. Gary Robinson, executive chef at Balmoral hotel in Edinburgh, takes a similar line: \u201cWe would only ever use caviar where a dish is enhanced by its taste and texture \u2013 never for opulence or show.\u201d</p> <p>In the past, Smith has traded directly with a small producer in Germany: \u201cI know these guys; they look after their fish around the clock, provide the right nutrition, environment and so on. I feel comfortable serving this caviar, where I might not with a mainstream supplier.\u201d</p> <p>So far, so above board. Yet even sustainable caviar can slip into murky waters. While some aquafarms harvest the roe alongside the flesh at the end of the sturgeon\u2019s life, others extract the eggs while the fish are still alive, around every two years.

      "bodyText": "There are some words that are impossible to say without sounding fancy. \u201cCaviar\u201d is one of them. It\u2019s the hallmark of fine dining; the crown jewel of a canape; one of the last few foods that, in a world of lobster baps and truffle mash, remain flashy. When the Sous Chef website looked at the UK\u2019s two- and three-Michelin-starred restaurants this month, it found that caviar featured on 72% of the menus. Yet there is no denying caviar has an image problem. Until just a few decades ago, fishermen would haul beluga sturgeon out of the Caspian and Black seas, cut out the \u201croe sacks\u201d that held their eggs, and throw the fish back in to die. As a result, sturgeon became critically endangered. The international trade in wild sturgeon from the region has been banned since 2006, and although there are a growing number of sturgeon farms around the world that attempt to make the process more sustainable, the methods used to extract the eggs, and the morality of dedicating valuable resources toward producing this symbol of luxury, mean the ethics of caviar remain vague. \u201cIt\u2019s not like shark-fin soup, where you have desperate fishermen catching sharks, cutting off their fins and throwing them back,\u201d says Chris King, executive chef of the Langham hotel in London. \u201cThere\u2019s a moral question to caviar, of course, but sturgeon can be farmed. It is farmed.\u201d Serving the caviar he sources for the Langham is, he says, no more or less ethically troublesome than serving quality beef or farmed Scottish salmon. What matters to King is that he buys the best and serves it in such a way that his diners \u201cunderstand what the fuss is about. Most people don\u2019t have it often. It\u2019s important they get a good chunk, and it\u2019s served in an elegant way.\u201d Yet attitudes towards sourcing and serving caviar are shifting. Although the Langham still offers it in those gleaming round tins, to be eaten by the spoonful, it is rarely called for nowadays; gone, too, is the demand for blinis with a dollop of creme fraiche. \u201cThese days, I sell caviar much more in dishes where it is an element, such as our roasted scallops with caviar,\u201d King says. \u201cTastes are changing, and people are asking if tins and blinis are really the way to appreciate caviar, with all its nuances of texture and taste.\u201d Charles Smith, head chef at the Lords of the Manor hotel in Gloucestershire, says he values caviar \u201cmore for the flavour profile than the prestige around it\u201d. He likes to dish it up alongside native lobster, whose sweet meat pairs perfectly with the eggs\u2019 saltiness. \u201cThere will always be those people coming into the hotel and wanting a tin of caviar for the aesthetics of it, but to me it\u2019s an ingredient,\u201d he says. Gary Robinson, executive chef at Balmoral hotel in Edinburgh, takes a similar line: \u201cWe would only ever use caviar where a dish is enhanced by its taste and texture \u2013 never for opulence or show.\u201d In the past, Smith has traded directly with a small producer in Germany: \u201cI know these guys; they look after their fish around the clock, provide the right nutrition, environment and so on. I feel comfortable serving this caviar, where I might not with a mainstream supplier.\u201d So far, so above board. Yet even sustainable caviar can slip into murky waters. While some aquafarms harvest the roe alongside the flesh at the end of the sturgeon\u2019s life, others extract the eggs while the fish are still alive, around every two years. This would be fine were sturgeon like salmon, trout or other fish that can be \u201cmilked\u201d without too much trouble \u2013 but they aren\u2019t. \u201cThey are prehistoric fish, dating back 250m years, and they haven\u2019t changed much,\u201d says Harry Ferguson, operations director of Exmoor Caviar farm in Devon. \u201cTheir roe sack isn\u2019t like a bag from which the eggs spill out. You have to make at least a two-inch incision and massage the roe out.\u201d In its favour, this is better than killing wild sturgeon \u2013 and those farms that do produce caviar this way claim to make it as painless as possible. As well as the ethical questions about egg extraction, there\u2019s also the issue of \u201cfish laundering\u201d, as Dr Krzysztof Wojtas at Compassion in Wild Farming (CIWF), points out. \u201cMackerel, sardines and other foraging fish are landed in Africa or South Asia, and processed for carnivorous fish food. By farming for caviar, you are using food that could feed the many to make a high-value product for the few,\u201d he says.

Yet just as farming has reduced salmon from a delicacy to a common sandwich filling, with the consequences of overstocking ranging from fish-lice infestations to pollution of the surrounding waters with faeces and chemicals, so CIWF fears the same could happen with sturgeon.

      "bodyText": "Fundraising figures for the third quarter confirm that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have taken a commanding lead in stockpiling funds for the critical and expensive winter campaign season before the first Democratic nomination voting in Iowa in early February 2020. Figures released after last night\u2019s Democratic debate in Ohio showed that Sanders currently has $33.7m cash on hand, Warren had $25.7m, while the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg has stockpiled $23.3m for his election campaigns. The trio have funds at least twice that of former vice-president Joe Biden, who has been spending money faster and raising less over the past three months, latest figures showed. The Biden campaign has just $8.9m cash on hand, raising new questions about the candidate\u2019s durability as a frontrunner. Biden is not alone in struggling for cash. California Senator Kamala Harris had only $10.5m at the ready. The New Jersey senator Cory Booker holds $4.2m, while the former Obama administration housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro had just $672,000 cash on hand, and the Ohio representative Tim Ryan had $158,000. Warren and Sanders\u2019 commanding war chests will afford them the luxury of spending large amounts on advertising to boost campaigning in early voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Their pattern is one of raising money from thousands of small donors \u2013 as opposed to Biden\u2019s strategy of tapping larger political supporters at small private fundraising events that take him off the road. Biden has also been spending heavily \u2013 the $17.6m he spent over the past three months was more than the $15.7m he took in, according to fundraising figures submitted to the Federal Election Commission. Steve Westly, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Democratic donor, said: \u201cThe reality is this is quickly boiling down to a two-person race \u2013 and that\u2019s between Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.\u201d Sanders\u2019 hefty $21.5m in spending between July and the end of September topped the tables, while Warren\u2019s $18.6m in spending during that period allowed her to support a staff of 500. Warren came under sustained attack from her Democratic rivals during Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate, a reflection of the threat her ascendant candidacy poses to the crowded field of hopefuls competing to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 US election. Twelve Democratic candidates took to the stage in Westerville, Ohio, for the largest presidential primary debate in modern US history, and the first since the launch of an impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden. The debate opened with a display of unity over the inquiry, with the Democrats unloading on the \u201ccriminal in the White House\u201d and \u201cthe most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had\u201d. Biden, who has been dragged into the impeachment maelstrom by Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims that he and his son were involved in wrongdoing in Ukraine, defended his conduct. \u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said, arguing that Trump\u2019s baseless attacks revealed the president\u2019s fear of running against him in a general election. Biden and Warren later clashed in tense moments during the fierce debate, the first since she surged into a virtual tie with the former vice-president in many Democratic opinion polls. And Warren found herself the target of barbs from other candidates, mainly moderates, over her leftwing positions on healthcare, taxes and regulating technology giants. The debate took place at Otterbein University in Westerville, near Columbus. Trump won Ohio by 8.5 percentage points in 2016, the widest margin of any \u201cswing\u201d state. The margin of victory in traditional battleground states is typically much closer, as it was in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three midwestern states that delivered Trump the White House. Younger Democratic candidates, including Buttigieg, 37, and Yang, 44, have argued it is time for new leadership in a Democratic party driven by the diverse grassroots energy of younger activists. Sanders\u2019 health problems highlighted his age and that of the other top White House contenders \u2013 Biden is 76 and Warren is 70, while Trump is 73 \u2013 in a race featuring a debate about a generational change in leadership. Addressing the question of age, Warren vowed to \u201coutwork and out-organize and outlast\u201d Trump or \u201cwhoever the Republicans get stuck with\u201d as a candidate for the November 2020 election.

On the first occasion, 10 days ago, he \u201cordered and drank five beers on his own\u201d, the owner, Chris Westerbeek, told the local broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.rtvdrenthe.nl/nieuws/153029/Vader-met-zes-kinderen-zit-jaren-in-kelder-Ruinerwold-familie-wachtte-op-einde-der-tijden\">RTV Drenthe</a>.</p> \n<p>When the man reappeared last Sunday, he \u201clooked confused\u201d, Westerbeek said. \u201cHe was unkempt, with long tangled hair.

The five adult siblings, said to be aged between 18 and 25, and an ailing older man they said was their father, were receiving medical treatment after police discovered them at the farm near the village of Ruinerwold, in the north-eastern province of Drenthe. It was unclear whether the family was, as Dutch media reported, \u201cwaiting for the end of time\u201d. Recent posts on social media by one of the children suggested they may instead have been held in the farmhouse against their will. \u201cWe found six people in a small space in the house which could be locked, not a cellar. It is unclear if they were there voluntarily,\u201d police said in a statement. \u201cThey may have been there for nine years. They say they are a family, a father and five children.\u201d The statement said none of the six people were registered with the local authorities. Their mother had apparently died before the family moved to the farm, said the local mayor, Roger de Groot, adding that he had \u201cnever seen anything like this\u201d. Officials would not confirm local media reports that the family was waiting for the end of days. \u201cWe understand everyone has lots of questions,\u201d the police statement added. \u201cSo do we. We will investigate properly and carefully.\u201d A 58-year-old man who was renting the farm but was not the father of the children has been arrested, police confirmed, but they would not reveal his identity. Dutch media identified him as Joseph B, an Austrian odd-job man who had a small workshop on an industrial estate in the nearby town of Meppel. The Austrian foreign ministry has confirmed an Austrian citizen from Vienna was being held in relation to the case, but said he did not want contact with officials. The ministry did not know the grounds for his arrest, it said. One neighbour told the Telegraaf newspaper that the man, who was seen daily driving an old Volvo car, was \u201cvery sharp \u2026 You only needed to go near the place and he\u2019d send you packing. He watched everything through binoculars\u201d. Dutch media said the oldest of the children, a 25-year-old named only as Jan, had a Facebook account and began posting updates in June for the first time in nine years. \u201cStarted a new job at Creconat,\u201d De Telegraaf newspaper quoted it as saying. The firm, affiliated to another company in Meppel, was raided by police on Monday and belonged to the Austrian man, the paper said. According to the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper, the son also wrote on LinkedIn that his parents had run a successful business until his mother died in 2004. The group was discovered after Jan visited a local bar, the Kastelein cafe. On the first occasion, 10 days ago, he \u201cordered and drank five beers on his own\u201d, the owner, Chris Westerbeek, told the local broadcaster RTV Drenthe. When the man reappeared last Sunday, he \u201clooked confused\u201d, Westerbeek said. \u201cHe was unkempt, with long tangled hair. We got talking. He said he had run away and needed urgent help, and that he had never been to school. Then we called the police.\u201d RTV Drenthe said police had found a hidden staircase leading to the family\u2019s hiding place behind a cupboard in the living room. The father was bedridden having suffered a stroke some years ago, it said. Dutch media reported the family appeared to have had little or no contact with the outside world and lived a largely self-sufficient life, apparently growing their own vegetables and keeping a goat and geese. The farmhouse\u2019s owners, Klaas Rooze and Alida ten Oever, said the tenant had always paid his rent on time and they were flabbergasted by the news. \u201cWe knew absolutely nothing of this,\u201d Ten Oever said. \u201cWe rented the house for years to one man and now we learn someone was living there with children. We have no idea who it can be.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Robyn Moser still remembers the bidding wars for mansions when Calgary\u2019s oil economy roared. In her best years \u2013 the decade before a 2014 crash in petroleum prices \u2013 Moser would sell more than 75 luxury homes, including estates with spectacular views of the Rocky Mountains. Last year she sold just 40 properties \u2013 and all at reduced prices. \u201cWhen people list their home, what we say is: what\u2019s your hurt price?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then we need to go lower from there.\u201d Canadians go to the polls on 21 October in a federal election still considered too close to call. A CBC poll tracker shows the opposition Conservatives holding a slim lead over the ruling Liberals \u2013 though neither is projected to win a majority government. But the same poll tracker projects a Tory landslide in Alberta, where the Conservatives hold a nearly 45-point lead over Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals. Albertans have long been wary of the Trudeau name \u2013 Justin\u2019s father Pierre forced the province to sell petroleum at a discount to the rest of Canada \u2013 but they did give the younger Trudeau the benefit of the doubt in 2015. In the last federal election, the Liberals took four of the province\u2019s 34 seats. But even then, the provincial economy was starting to slow down. The drop in oil and gas prices the previous year sent unemployment soaring to north of 10%. The local economy has stayed sluggish ever since \u2013 and many Albertans hold the prime minister responsible, accusing him of showing indifference to their plight and pandering to other parts of the country. \u201cI think the federal government has a specific hate on\u201d for Alberta, Moser said. \u201cWe have a federal government that wants to choke the Alberta economy for its own political reasons.\u201d Meanwhile, the province\u2019s oil sands \u2013 some of the largest petroleum deposits in the world \u2013 have come under attack from environmentalists who argue that extraction of the carbon-heavy fuel is incompatible with fighting climate change Trudeau has tried to play both sides of the climate issue. He promises to make Canada a climate leader and marched in recent climate protests. But his government has also purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline, to ensure the completion of a project to carry Alberta oil to the west coast despite intense opposition from Indigenous groups and the government of neighbouring British Columbia. Little of that impresses Albertans, who complain that the Trans Mountain project remains in limbo and and point to a pair of recently approved bills increasing environmental controls on megaprojects and banning tanker traffic off the west coast. Trudeau\u2019s stated ambition to \u201cphase out\u201d the oil sands and transition away from fossil fuels has reinforced the antipathy. \u201cIf he had said, \u2018I wish we could phase out the auto sector faster because of the emissions it creates\u2019 and then put forward two bills to essentially make that happen \u2026 the entire country would have been lit on fire on,\u201d said the Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner, who represents a Calgary electoral district. The economic downturn is especially dramatic in Calgary\u2019s downtown, where the vacancy rate in office towers still tops 20%. Total income in Alberta crashed by 20% between 2014 and 2016, while 130,000 jobs were lost in a province of 4.3 million, according to Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary. In the boom years, Alberta\u2019s prosperity attracted workers from across Canada and high school dropouts earned C$100,000 in boomtowns such as the oil sands hub Fort McMurray. Lloyd George moved to Alberta from Nova Scotia in 2001 with little more than ambition and two suitcases. Nearly 20 years later, he runs an oil supply company, providing specialty pipes for petroleum projects. He\u2019s staying profitable, he says, though business would be \u201cdouble or triple\u201d with a better economy \u2013 and more pipelines. \u201cIt\u2019s been four years of kicking someone while they\u2019re down,\u201d he said of the Trudeau government\u2019s treatment. \u201cWe\u2019re in an abusive relationship and we can\u2019t leave because there\u2019s nowhere else to go.\u201d Long the malcontents of the Canadian confederation, Albertans complain the province\u2019s oil bounty is spread to other provinces through equalisation payments. Trudeau\u2019s home province has been the largest recipient of such payments \u2013 a fact not lost on Albertans, who note that Quebec opposes pipelines, even as tankers transport oil down the St Lawrence River. Amid the perceptions of antipathy from the federal government, some in the province have even revived the idea of separating from Canada. \u201cI\u2019d support it,\u201d George said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll hate it every step of the way.\u201d Elsewhere in Canada, the environment has emerged as a key issue for voters, but in Alberta \u2013 a region whose economy depends on fossil fuels, voters seem indifferent to the climate crisis, despite the wildfires that tore through Fort McMurray in 2016, and record floods which inundated Calgary in 2013.

The microbes in the soil don\u2019t think so. They munch it all up and release energy in the process. Do these microbes have names? Do they play squash? I don\u2019t think so. But the energy they release does slowly charge a super-capacitor. When this is full, it releases enough electricity to operate a digital camera \u2026 which has just made Pete the world\u2019s first plant to take a selfie. Or a photograph of any kind, I imagine? Yes, I expect so. What\u2019s it like? Well \u2026 it\u2019s a blurry picture of some leaves (see above). But Pete\u2019s doing his best! London Zoo encouraged visitors over the past few months to come and cheer him on. Come on, Pete! Respire! Deposit that biomatter! That kind of thing? Yes, that kind of thing. Is Pete doing any interviews? He\u2019s played it cool so far. Very wise. Too much fame too fast can damage anyone. Although the technology specialist at the Zoological Society of London, Al Davies, is very proud of him. I\u2019m not surprised! \u201cSeeing Pete\u2019s first selfie was an incredible moment for the ZSL team,\u201d Davies says. \u201cPlugging into plants unlocks the potential to deploy sensors, monitoring platforms, camera traps or other electronics that require power and must operate for extended periods of time \u2013 all remotely and without interference.\u201d Why would you want to do that? It allows scientists to record data in remote and shady places without having to replace batteries all the time. Lazy scientists, you mean? That\u2019s right. Although it is valuable work that can help us to understand climate change and habitat loss, and thereby protect plants, fungi, animals and other organisms. So Pete\u2019s a humanitarian? Or a plantitarian, I guess. Do say: \u201cCan I follow Pete on Instagram?\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cIn reality, Pete spends hours posing for those \u2018spontaneous\u2019 snapshots.\u201d",

He added the only optimism to emerge from the meeting was a promise by Trump to see if the issue could be addressed another way. Another family spokesman said: \u201cIt struck us that this meeting was hastily arranged by nincompoops on the run and in particular O\u2019Brien who appeared to be extremely uptight and aggressive and did not come across at all well at a meeting which required sensitivity.\u201d",

That is a situation where a team might look to its coach to conjure an inspired substitution or a tactical masterstroke. But the response to Alphonso Davies\u2019 63rd minute goal was a string of sideways passes, possession without purpose, as the US chased the game with as much cutting edge as a preschooler\u2019s pair of plastic safety scissors. Canada continued to look quicker, more coherent and more dangerous and added a second on the break through Lucas Cavallini in stoppage time.</p> <p>As well as seeking to end a 17-match winless streak against their neighbours, Canada were on the hunt for Fifa ranking points in order to rise above El Salvador, the world\u2019s 72nd best team.

A misguided belief, if so. Berhalter does not have a vintage crop of players at his disposal. And the US Soccer Federation poured pressure on itself, and the 46-year-old, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/02/former-usa-defender-gregg-berhalter-appointed-to-coach-mens-national-team\">by taking a year to appoint a permanent coach</a> following the World Cup qualifying debacle, then choosing a low-profile figure who made his name as a tactician at a blue-collar MLS club.</p> <p>Expectations remain high, even as the talent pool has grown more shallow. All the more important, then, that Berhalter lives up to his reputation as the method man - the clear-headed coach who devised a system that squeezed the best out of his players at the Columbus Crew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GrantWahl/status/1184283160969973760\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The man who will make the decision on Gregg Berhalter\u2019s future as USMNT coach (Earnie Stewart) is very likely to soon report to ...

A below-par Pulisic, whether through illness, injury or rust from his lack of minutes at Chelsea, would present a grave problem for an American side that has few good attacking ideas without him. Still, key man off the field and 1-0 down with half an hour to play? That is a situation where a team might look to its coach to conjure an inspired substitution or a tactical masterstroke. But the response to Alphonso Davies\u2019 63rd minute goal was a string of sideways passes, possession without purpose, as the US chased the game with as much cutting edge as a preschooler\u2019s pair of plastic safety scissors. Canada continued to look quicker, more coherent and more dangerous and added a second on the break through Lucas Cavallini in stoppage time. As well as seeking to end a 17-match winless streak against their neighbours, Canada were on the hunt for Fifa ranking points in order to rise above El Salvador, the world\u2019s 72nd best team. The top six Concacaf nations in Fifa\u2019s rankings next June will go into the Hexagonal World Cup qualifying round, which delivers three automatic berths for a trip to Qatar. The Americans, meanwhile, looked like they felt it would be uncool to get too worked up about a Concacaf Nations League group fixture. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with the desire that we displayed tonight,\u201d Berhalter told reporters. That is a jarring admission. Spirit used to be a given whenever a US side took the field \u2013 at least until the dog days of the J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann regime. Did the team think they could glide past an improving Canada on skill alone? A misguided belief, if so. Berhalter does not have a vintage crop of players at his disposal. And the US Soccer Federation poured pressure on itself, and the 46-year-old, by taking a year to appoint a permanent coach following the World Cup qualifying debacle, then choosing a low-profile figure who made his name as a tactician at a blue-collar MLS club. Expectations remain high, even as the talent pool has grown more shallow. All the more important, then, that Berhalter lives up to his reputation as the method man - the clear-headed coach who devised a system that squeezed the best out of his players at the Columbus Crew. The start of World Cup qualifying is still 11 months away, but another poor performance and result when Canada face the US in Orlando next month would see concern escalate into alarm. Ten months is not a long tenure \u2013 and is less time than it took to complete the hiring process \u2013 but patience is rightly in short supply among the fanbase, who have had enough of being told that the team is in learning mode and that setbacks are growing pains. Suppressing doubts about Klinsmann and hanging on until after the start of the qualifying cycle before replacing him failed to work out last time. How long are Berhalter\u2019s bosses prepared to wait for him to mould a team that is assertive, rather than aspirational? They are unlikely to be in a hurry.",

      "body": "<p>If you live in Glasgow, you are more likely to die young. Men die a full seven years earlier than their counterparts in other UK cities. Until recently, the causes of this excess mortality remained a mystery.</p> <p>\u201cDeep-fried Mars bars,\u201d some have speculated. \u201cThe weather,\u201d others suggested. For years, those reasons were as good as any. In 2012, the Economist <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2012/08/25/no-city-for-old-men\">described it thus</a>: \u201cIt is as if a malign vapour rises from the Clyde at night and settles in the lungs of sleeping Glaswegians.\u201d</p> <p>The phenomenon has become known as the Glasgow effect. But David Walsh, a public health programme manager at the Glasgow Centre for Population Health, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20223487\">who led a study on the excess deaths in 2010</a>, wasn\u2019t satisfied with how the term was being used. \u201cIt turned into a Scooby-Doo mystery but it\u2019s not an exciting thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about people dying young, it\u2019s about grief.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have to understand what sort of shape Glasgow was in. They thought the best approach was to start afresh</p> <footer> <cite>David Walsh, Glasgow Centre for Population Health</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He wanted to work out why Glaswegians have a 30% higher risk of dying prematurely \u2013 that is, before the age of 65 \u2013 than those living in similar postindustrial British cities. In 2016 his team published a report looking at 40 hypotheses \u2013 from vitamin D deficiency to obesity and sectarianism. \u201cThe most important reason is high levels of poverty, full stop,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cThere\u2019s one in three children who are classed as living in poverty at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>But even with deprivation accounted for, mortality rates in Glasgow remained inexplicable. Deaths in each income group are about 15% higher than in Manchester or Liverpool. In particular, deaths from \u201cdiseases of despair\u201d \u2013 drug overdoses, suicides and alcohol-related deaths \u2013 are high. In the mid-2000s, after adjusting for sex, age and deprivation, there was almost a 70% higher mortality rate for suicide in Glasgow than in the two English cities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f02d745ac71098049931c8dcfd08ffa5687c59b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f02d745ac71098049931c8dcfd08ffa5687c59b3/319_161_2076_1245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Glasgow, deaths from \u201cdiseases of despair\u201d are particularly high.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Glasgow, deaths from \u201cdiseases of despair\u201d are particularly high.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Leslie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walsh\u2019s report strongly suggested a theory: that radical urban planning decisions from the 1950s onwards had made not just the physical but the mental health of Glasgow\u2019s population more vulnerable to the consequences of deindustrialisation and poverty.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/feb/25/city-stress-mental-health-rural-kind\">Studies have consistently linked city living with poorer mental health</a>. For example, growing up in an urban environment is correlated with twice the risk of developing schizophrenia as growing up in the countryside. And the unintended legacy of some urban planning exacerbates the already considerable challenges of living in a city \u2013 something 68% of the world\u2019s population will be doing by 2050, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html\">according to UN </a><a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html\">projections</a>. </p> <p>Are these urban dwellers doomed to poor mental health, or can planners design cities that will keep us healthy and happy? Can we learn from what happened in Glasgow? </p> <h2>New Towns, new problems</h2> <p>Postwar Glasgow was severely overcrowded. The 1945 Bruce report proposed solving this by housing people in high-rises on the periphery, while the following year\u2019s Clyde Valley report suggested encouraging workers and their families to move to new towns. In the end, the council did a combination of both: New Towns like East Kilbride and Cumbernauld are now among the most populous towns in Scotland; many of those who stayed in Glasgow were relocated to large housing estates such as Drumchapel, Easterhouse and Castlemilk.</p> <p>This rapid change in the city\u2019s makeup was soon recognised as disastrous. Relocating workers and their families to new towns was described in mid-1960s parliamentary discussions as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/10/glasgow-effect-die-young-high-risk-premature-death\">\u201cskimming the cream\u201d</a>. In an internal review in 1971, the Scottish Office noted that the manner of population reduction was \u201cdestined within a decade or so to produce a seriously unbalanced population with a very high proportion [in central Glasgow] of the old, the very poor and the almost unemployable\u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e816f802d29f1a805c1495173e1fa7f4bdf7732f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e816f802d29f1a805c1495173e1fa7f4bdf7732f/0_370_4490_2694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Housing estate in Drumchapel, Glasgow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Housing estate in Drumchapel, Glasgow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Housing estate in Drumchapel, Glasgow. Photograph: Alamy</p></li> </ul> <p>Although the government was soon aware of the consequences, these were not necessarily intentional, says Walsh. \u201cYou have to understand what sort of shape Glasgow was in, in terms of the really lousy living conditions, the levels of overcrowded housing and all the rest of it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey thought the best approach was to just start afresh.\u201d</p> <p>Anna left the tenements for a high-rise in Glasgow\u2019s Sighthill estate, where she has lived on and off since the mid-60s. She was a teenager when she moved with her mother and sister to a brand-new fourth-floor flat, picked from a bowler hat. It had two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a glass partition in the hallway. \u201cIt was like Buckingham Palace,\u201d remembers Anna. She is now 71, dressed in jeans and a denim shirt, with a blonde bob and a raspy cough that doubles as a laugh.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re more likely to have violence, you\u2019re more likely to have conflict; even sexual abuse is much higher in households where there are drinkers</p> <footer> <cite>Carol Craig, author and researcher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sighthill\u2019s 10 20-storey tower blocks were meant to herald the future. Set in parkland, with a view over the city, they would house more than 7,000 people drawn from the tenements and the slums.</p> <p>Until then, the family had lived in a tenement building in nearby Roystonhill. \u201cI slept with my mammy and my sister in a recess,\u201d she says. The toilet was shared. </p> <p>But when the tenements went, something else went, too. \u201cThere were communities which had a social fabric, if you like, which were then broken up by these processes,\u201d says Walsh.</p> <p>Anna recalls the change. \u201cWhen we were in the tenements, you\u2019d shout up to the window: \u2018Mammy, I want a piece of jam!\u2019 Before you knew it there was a dozen of them being thrown out of the window.\u201d In the tower block, she did not let her own children play unsupervised. Neighbours only spoke if they took the same lift. Her daughter was threatened with a bread knife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc06e5f37eced69f54ad57f8bb78e53c8e1b7c33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc06e5f37eced69f54ad57f8bb78e53c8e1b7c33/0_0_5155_3470/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tenements in the Gorbals, Glasgow, in 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tenements in the Gorbals, Glasgow, in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Newell Smith/THE OBSERVER</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Tenements in the Gorbals, Glasgow, in 1968. Photograph: David Newell Smith/The Observer</p></li> </ul> <p>By the 2000s, the tower blocks were infamous for deprivation, violence and drugs. Many residents had moved out, including Anna and her family. Empty flats were used to rehouse asylum seekers. Fractures within the community were worsening. Glasgow Housing Association eventually decided to condemn the buildings, and the towers were demolished over eight years; the last one came down in 2016. </p> <p>But the roots of Glasgow\u2019s excess mortality stretch back further \u2013 to the Industrial Revolution, argues Carol Craig, who has written two books on the subject. In Glasgow, then called the Second City of the Empire, factories and the docks needed workers. Overcrowding coupled with a culture of drinking produced an explosive situation.</p> <p>Faced with the prospect of returning to a cramped tenement, many men preferred to visit the pub; there were few other public meeting places. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to have violence, you\u2019re more likely to have conflict; even sexual abuse is much higher in households where there are drinkers,\u201d Craig says.</p> <p>Being exposed in childhood to stressful events like domestic violence, parental abandonment, abuse, or drug and alcohol addictions is thought to be linked to poor mental and physical wellbeing in later life. The higher a person\u2019s number of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), the more likely they are to suffer from mental illness or addiction. In turn they are more likely to expose their children to similar types of experiences, she says: \u201cACEs tend to cascade through the generations.\u201d</p> <h2>High-rise brought low</h2> <p>In the early 20th century, cities were meant to show us how to live. Modern urban planning would make people in the world\u2019s cities healthier and happier. In 1933, the influential Swiss-French architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/11/le-corbusier-india-architecture-1965\">Le Corbusier</a> published his blueprint for the ideal city. In contrast with the past, he said, the city would now be designed to benefit its residents \u201con both the spiritual and material planes\u201d.</p> <p>In his \u201cRadiant City\u201d, industrial, commercial and residential zones would be segregated to allow workers to escape pollution; homes would be surrounded by open green spaces to allow residents to meet; wide roads would be set out in a grid system; and high-rise blocks would help clear the slums, overcrowded and unsanitary places where the inhabitants were, as the architect put it, \u201cincapable of initiating ameliorations\u201d.</p> <p>Glasgow enthusiastically adopted these new buildings. In 1954 a delegation of councillors and planners visited Marseilles to see the Le Corbusier-designed Unit\u00e9 d\u2019Habitation, an 18-storey block of flats and amenities resting on concrete stilts. Glasgow soon had the highest number of high-rise dwellings in the UK outside London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1277cb6559a447cd72be3658dddc091d0f9f304e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1277cb6559a447cd72be3658dddc091d0f9f304e/0_80_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"La Cite Radieuse (the radiant housing project), designed by Swiss-born architect Charles Edouard Jeanneret Gris, alias Le Corbusier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">La Cite Radieuse (the radiant housing project), designed by Swiss-born architect Charles Edouard Jeanneret Gris, alias Le Corbusier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boris Horvat/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Le Corbusier\u2019s \u2018Radiant City\u2019 project in Marseille. Photograph: Boris Horvat/AFP/Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>Since Le Corbusier, we have learned more about how the design of buildings can affect behaviour. In an <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001391657300500404\">oft-cited study from 1973</a>, the psychologist Andrew Baum looked at how the design of two student dormitories changed how the residents interacted. In the first design, all the students shared common lounge and bathroom facilities along a corridor. In the second, smaller groups of four to six each shared bathrooms and lounges. </p> <p>Baum found that the first design was a \u201csocially overloaded environment\u201d that did not allow residents to regulate who they interacted with and when. Being faced with too many people, at times not of their choosing, led students to experience stress; they became less helpful and more antisocial than those in the second design as the year went on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mental health is almost uniformly worse in cities \u2026 that\u2019s just what the data shows</p> <footer> <cite>Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, psychiatrist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the most famous example of buildings\u2019 effects on their inhabitants still referenced today is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/22/pruitt-igoe-high-rise-urban-america-history-cities\">Pruitt\u2013Igoe housing complex in St Louis, USA</a>: 33 towers of 11 storeys each, inspired by Le Corbusier and designed by the modernist Minoru Yamasaki. Finished in 1956, it was initially seen as a miracle solution to inner-city living. Less than 20 years later, the social problems the blocks seemed to have spawned were deemed so irreparable that the local authorities imploded the buildings.</p> <p>The architect Oscar Newman toured Pruitt\u2013Igoe in 1971, a year before demolition started. He argued that the design of a building affected the extent to which residents contributed to its upkeep. If people feel responsible for both keeping an area clean and controlling who uses it, it is likely to be safer. He <a href=\"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/hbo-show-me-a-hero-tv-show-public-housing\">called this sense of ownership over a territory \u201cdefensible space\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe larger the number of people who share a communal space, the more difficult it is for people to identify it as theirs or to feel they have a right to control or determine the activity taking place within it,\u201d Newman wrote. Pruitt\u2013Igoe was not designed to accommodate defensible space, he argued. \u201cLandings shared by only two families were well maintained, whereas corridors shared by 20 families \u2026 were a disaster \u2013 they evoked no feelings of identity or control.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e06c2fb0207d1d87a888364cfdb3143aca602b83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e06c2fb0207d1d87a888364cfdb3143aca602b83/0_215_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of the Pruitt-Igoe public housing development in St. Louis, Missouri, being demolished by dynamite charges in 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of the Pruitt-Igoe public housing development in St. Louis, Missouri, being demolished by dynamite charges in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Waters/ASSOCIATED PRESS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Part of the Pruitt-Igoe public housing development in St. Louis, Missouri, being demolished by dynamite charges in 1972.

Children, on the other hand, are often most affected: these common areas \u2013 communal corridors, or landings, or the nearby park \u2013 are usually spaces for play.</p> <p>During his inauguration as rector of Glasgow University in 1972, the Clydeside trade unionist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/11/jimmy-reid-obituary\">Jimmy Reid</a> argued powerfully that working-class communities left behind by economic advancement were being stored out of sight. \u201cWhen you think of some of the high flats around us,\u201d he said, \u201cit can hardly be an accident that they are as near as one could get to an architectural representation of a filing cabinet.\u201d</p> <h2>Newts in the city</h2> <p>Inequality is at its most conspicuous in cities: the very poor and the very rich live side-by-side yet separately. Relative social status is more likely to be the first measure by which we judge people in places where communities are more transient and inequality starker. This has been shown to have an impact on our psychological wellbeing.</p> <p>In their book The Inner Level, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/sep/18/kate-pickett-richard-wilkinson-mental-wellbeing-inequality-the-spirit-level\">epidemiologists Kate Pickett and Richard G Wilkinson</a> argue that inequality not only creates social rupture by highlighting people\u2019s differences but also encourages competition, contributing to increased social anxiety. They cite a 2004 paper by two psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles \u2013 Sally Dickerson and Margaret Kemeny \u2013 who analysed 208 studies to find that tasks involving some threat of social evaluation affected stress hormones the most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/sep/18/kate-pickett-richard-wilkinson-mental-wellbeing-inequality-the-spirit-level\">Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson: \u2018Inequality strikes at our health and happiness\u2019 | Dawn Foster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pickett and Wilkinson argue that this type of stress harms our psychological health: \u201cThe more unequal countries had three times as much mental illness as the more equal ones.\u201d This affects people of all social classes. In high-inequality countries, such as the USA and the UK, even the richest 10% of people suffer more anxiety than any group in low-inequality countries except the poorest 10%.</p> <p>Research has also shown that living in a city can alter our brain\u2019s architecture, making it more vulnerable to this type of social stress. In 2011, a team led by psychiatrist Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg of Heidelberg University\u2019s Central Institute of Mental Health <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110622/full/474429a.html\">looked at the implications of urban living on brain biology</a>, scanning the brains of students while they were given arithmetic tasks and simultaneously subjected to criticism on headphones.</p> <p>The results of the test, designed to simulate social stress, were stark: the participants who lived in a city demonstrated a greater neurophysiological reaction, with the amygdala, an area of the brain which processes emotion, activated more strongly. Those who\u2019d grown up in cities also displayed a stronger response in their perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, which regulates the amygdala and is associated with stress and negative emotion, than those brought up in towns or the countryside.</p> <p>Meyer-Lindenberg\u2019s previous work on risk mechanisms in schizophrenia focused on genes. But these are only thought to account for a 20% increased chance of developing the illness at most \u2013 and growing up in a city is associated with double the risk. His research has shown that stressful experiences in early life correlate with reduced volume of grey matter in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, a factor often seen in people with schizophrenia.</p> <p>\u201cMental health is almost uniformly worse in cities \u2026 that\u2019s just what the data shows,\u201d Meyer-Lindenberg says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really a bright side to this.\u201d</p> <p>Lack of agency \u2013 the feeling that we don\u2019t have control over a situation \u2013 is one of the core mechanisms determining how strongly social stress is experienced, says Meyer-Lindenberg, adding: \u201cPeople who are in leadership positions tend to cope better with a given amount of stress.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you can see children, it\u2019s probably a healthy and happy city</p> <footer> <cite>Liz Zeidler, Happy City Initiative</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a city, and particularly if you are poor, you are far more dependent on other people and the urban infrastructure, whether waiting impatiently for a bus or a lift, wondering who you\u2019ll have to share a lift with in your high-rise complex, or hoping the local council will not choose your neighbourhood for redevelopment.</p> <p>Cities can also of course be liberating. \u201cThe flip side of being more stressful is that they may be more stimulating,\u201d Meyer-Lindenberg says. \u201cThis tighter community that you have in a village, say, can be very oppressive if you don\u2019t feel like you belong, if you\u2019re an outsider of some sort.\u201d</p> <p>Inequality has been shown to lower trust in others and damage social capital \u2013 the networks between people which allow societies to function effectively. People are so worried about security that they\u2019re mentally building walls around themselves, says Liz Zeidler, chief executive of the Happy City Initiative, a research centre based in Bristol. \u201cWe need to be doing the opposite: we need to be creating more and more spaces where people can connect, learn across their differences.\u201d</p> <p>Happy City has designed a way to measure the local conditions shown to improve well-being. Its Thriving Places Index looks at housing, education, inequality, green space, safety and community cohesion.</p> <p>Perhaps a good measure for the happiness of a place, Zeidler says, is the status of the \u201cindicative species\u201d, an idea borrowed from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/01/secrets-worlds-happiest-cities-commute-property-prices\">the author and urbanist Charles Montgomery</a>. For ponds, she says, it might be that the presence of a certain type of newt tells you whether or not the water is healthy. In cities, the newts are children: \u201cIf you can see children, it\u2019s probably a healthy and happy city.\u201d</p> <p>The way a city is laid out can foster this environment, she says, by \u201cclosing of streets, making it more pedestrianised, more green spaces, having more what urban planners would call \u2018bumping spaces\u2019, where you can literally bump into people. Slowing places down is really good for everybody\u2019s wellbeing and, obviously, you then see more children on the streets.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The city will get what it invites\u2019</h2> <p>Without looking at the car swinging towards him, the urban planner Christopher Martin crosses the road. Thankfully, the car slows down. Martin continues, blithely, discussing the priority of pedestrians and rule 170 of the Highway Code. </p> <p>The Dutch traffic engineer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2008/feb/02/mainsection.obituaries\">Hans Monderman</a> used to perform a similar trick in the early 2000s. He would walk, usually with a journalist in tow, backwards, eyes closed, into a four-way crossing with no traffic lights or signs.

Perhaps the manicured parks of the type preferred by urban planners may not actually be that effective at improving our wellbeing.</p> <p>In 2012, Emily Cutts realised the importance of these kinds of green spaces when the meadow overlooked by her second-floor flat in west Glasgow was threatened with development. Once used as an informal football pitch by locals, the meadow had mostly been frequented by dog walkers and drug addicts since the council, who wanted to sell the land, removed the goalposts. Now it finally looked as if a plan to build 90 deluxe flats might pass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c440823b86ce22266c3f99dd01c0bc8075ea4f3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c440823b86ce22266c3f99dd01c0bc8075ea4f3e/0_52_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Kelvin Meadow, Glasgow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North Kelvin Meadow, Glasgow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Leslie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The community garden in North Kelvin Meadow, Glasgow.

Over the next few years, the community organised petitions, events and a three-month vigil in St George\u2019s Square in the city centre. Eventually the Scottish government stepped in. On 21 December 2016, it was determined that the meadow would remain undeveloped. It is known locally as the Children\u2019s Wood and is managed by a charity.</p> <p>But why did Cutts and her fellow campaigners fight so passionately for this dingy meadow? Her neighbourhood, about 10 minutes north of the Botanic Gardens, already had plenty of green space. Was it simply a case of not wanting development on her doorstep?</p> <p>When I meet Cutts in the community garden, she is deep in discussion with the gardener, Christine, about the possibility of using a wormery to transform dog faeces into compost for the trees. There are raised beds for planting, a bathtub with upturned earth for children to dig and an \u201cedible\u201d teepee (pea shoot tendrils will soon be climbing up the twigs). It was planted by a 12-year-old boy who, Cutts tells me, is regularly excluded from school.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Reclaiming the land for community is definitely the way forward.

She has an MSc in positive psychology. It was while working as Carol Craig\u2019s researcher, compiling and presenting research on how to improve wellbeing, that she grew to understand the meadow\u2019s potential to make her community healthier and happier.</p> <p>Today, more than 20 schools and nurseries from the local area use the meadow. During my visit, Kelvinside Academy is having a forestry lesson. Children are playing around the thin birch trees, tying ropes around them, swinging friends vigorously in hammocks that look like laughing body bags, and digging in the earth. They learn to use knives for woodland tasks.</p> <p>Cutts collaborated with a researcher at the University of Glasgow on a series of tests comparing the attention spans of children who spent their lunchtime in the meadow with those who stayed indoors or played in the school\u2019s concrete playground. The attention of children exposed to nature was \u201csignificantly better\u201d.</p> <p>Attention restorative theories argue that nature can have an impact on our attention span by engaging our indirect attention; this allows the type of attention we use for more challenging cognitive tasks, such as mathematical problems, to recuperate. The team also performed a similar experiment looking at children\u2019s creativity in art. \u201cChildren who came here used more colours, used more texture, made more depth to their pictures than those who hadn\u2019t played outside,\u201d says Cutts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"00cd64f98c1d26ff5a5a4d31a9fa713301f3d24c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00cd64f98c1d26ff5a5a4d31a9fa713301f3d24c/0_134_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Play area at the Children\u2019s Wood, Glasgow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Play area at the Children\u2019s Wood, Glasgow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Leslie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Play area at the Children\u2019s Wood, Glasgow.

Those who had been Scouts or Guides, and had repeated contact with nature over a long period of time \u201cwhere they\u2019re learning a whole variety of skills including being outdoors and appreciation of nature\u201d, were less vulnerable to mental ill-health.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/16/bad-buildings-damage-mental-health-research-anxiety-depression\">Could bad buildings damage your mental health?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Children\u2019s Wood charity runs a regular youth club where they bring young people to help with the gardening.

She prescribes visits to the Children\u2019s Wood, in addition to other treatments, due to the benefits of \u201cpeer support, getting out of your house, talking to others, getting more engaged in your community, watching things grown, nurturing other things, nurturing oneself and self-care\u201d.

Until recently, the causes of this excess mortality remained a mystery. \u201cDeep-fried Mars bars,\u201d some have speculated. \u201cThe weather,\u201d others suggested. For years, those reasons were as good as any. In 2012, the Economist described it thus: \u201cIt is as if a malign vapour rises from the Clyde at night and settles in the lungs of sleeping Glaswegians.\u201d The phenomenon has become known as the Glasgow effect. But David Walsh, a public health programme manager at the Glasgow Centre for Population Health, who led a study on the excess deaths in 2010, wasn\u2019t satisfied with how the term was being used. \u201cIt turned into a Scooby-Doo mystery but it\u2019s not an exciting thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about people dying young, it\u2019s about grief.\u201d He wanted to work out why Glaswegians have a 30% higher risk of dying prematurely \u2013 that is, before the age of 65 \u2013 than those living in similar postindustrial British cities. In 2016 his team published a report looking at 40 hypotheses \u2013 from vitamin D deficiency to obesity and sectarianism. \u201cThe most important reason is high levels of poverty, full stop,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cThere\u2019s one in three children who are classed as living in poverty at the moment.\u201d But even with deprivation accounted for, mortality rates in Glasgow remained inexplicable. Deaths in each income group are about 15% higher than in Manchester or Liverpool. In particular, deaths from \u201cdiseases of despair\u201d \u2013 drug overdoses, suicides and alcohol-related deaths \u2013 are high. In the mid-2000s, after adjusting for sex, age and deprivation, there was almost a 70% higher mortality rate for suicide in Glasgow than in the two English cities. Walsh\u2019s report strongly suggested a theory: that radical urban planning decisions from the 1950s onwards had made not just the physical but the mental health of Glasgow\u2019s population more vulnerable to the consequences of deindustrialisation and poverty. Studies have consistently linked city living with poorer mental health. For example, growing up in an urban environment is correlated with twice the risk of developing schizophrenia as growing up in the countryside. And the unintended legacy of some urban planning exacerbates the already considerable challenges of living in a city \u2013 something 68% of the world\u2019s population will be doing by 2050, according to UN projections. Are these urban dwellers doomed to poor mental health, or can planners design cities that will keep us healthy and happy? Can we learn from what happened in Glasgow? New Towns, new problems Postwar Glasgow was severely overcrowded. The 1945 Bruce report proposed solving this by housing people in high-rises on the periphery, while the following year\u2019s Clyde Valley report suggested encouraging workers and their families to move to new towns. In the end, the council did a combination of both: New Towns like East Kilbride and Cumbernauld are now among the most populous towns in Scotland; many of those who stayed in Glasgow were relocated to large housing estates such as Drumchapel, Easterhouse and Castlemilk. This rapid change in the city\u2019s makeup was soon recognised as disastrous. Relocating workers and their families to new towns was described in mid-1960s parliamentary discussions as \u201cskimming the cream\u201d. In an internal review in 1971, the Scottish Office noted that the manner of population reduction was \u201cdestined within a decade or so to produce a seriously unbalanced population with a very high proportion [in central Glasgow] of the old, the very poor and the almost unemployable\u2026\u201d Housing estate in Drumchapel, Glasgow. Photograph: Alamy Although the government was soon aware of the consequences, these were not necessarily intentional, says Walsh. \u201cYou have to understand what sort of shape Glasgow was in, in terms of the really lousy living conditions, the levels of overcrowded housing and all the rest of it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey thought the best approach was to just start afresh.\u201d Anna left the tenements for a high-rise in Glasgow\u2019s Sighthill estate, where she has lived on and off since the mid-60s. She was a teenager when she moved with her mother and sister to a brand-new fourth-floor flat, picked from a bowler hat. It had two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a glass partition in the hallway. \u201cIt was like Buckingham Palace,\u201d remembers Anna. She is now 71, dressed in jeans and a denim shirt, with a blonde bob and a raspy cough that doubles as a laugh. Sighthill\u2019s 10 20-storey tower blocks were meant to herald the future. Set in parkland, with a view over the city, they would house more than 7,000 people drawn from the tenements and the slums. Until then, the family had lived in a tenement building in nearby Roystonhill. \u201cI slept with my mammy and my sister in a recess,\u201d she says. The toilet was shared. But when the tenements went, something else went, too. \u201cThere were communities which had a social fabric, if you like, which were then broken up by these processes,\u201d says Walsh. Anna recalls the change. \u201cWhen we were in the tenements, you\u2019d shout up to the window: \u2018Mammy, I want a piece of jam!\u2019 Before you knew it there was a dozen of them being thrown out of the window.\u201d In the tower block, she did not let her own children play unsupervised. Neighbours only spoke if they took the same lift. Her daughter was threatened with a bread knife. Tenements in the Gorbals, Glasgow, in 1968. Photograph: David Newell Smith/The Observer By the 2000s, the tower blocks were infamous for deprivation, violence and drugs. Many residents had moved out, including Anna and her family. Empty flats were used to rehouse asylum seekers. Fractures within the community were worsening. Glasgow Housing Association eventually decided to condemn the buildings, and the towers were demolished over eight years; the last one came down in 2016. But the roots of Glasgow\u2019s excess mortality stretch back further \u2013 to the Industrial Revolution, argues Carol Craig, who has written two books on the subject. In Glasgow, then called the Second City of the Empire, factories and the docks needed workers. Overcrowding coupled with a culture of drinking produced an explosive situation. Faced with the prospect of returning to a cramped tenement, many men preferred to visit the pub; there were few other public meeting places. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to have violence, you\u2019re more likely to have conflict; even sexual abuse is much higher in households where there are drinkers,\u201d Craig says. Being exposed in childhood to stressful events like domestic violence, parental abandonment, abuse, or drug and alcohol addictions is thought to be linked to poor mental and physical wellbeing in later life. The higher a person\u2019s number of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), the more likely they are to suffer from mental illness or addiction. In turn they are more likely to expose their children to similar types of experiences, she says: \u201cACEs tend to cascade through the generations.\u201d High-rise brought low In the early 20th century, cities were meant to show us how to live. Modern urban planning would make people in the world\u2019s cities healthier and happier. In 1933, the influential Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier published his blueprint for the ideal city. In contrast with the past, he said, the city would now be designed to benefit its residents \u201con both the spiritual and material planes\u201d. In his \u201cRadiant City\u201d, industrial, commercial and residential zones would be segregated to allow workers to escape pollution; homes would be surrounded by open green spaces to allow residents to meet; wide roads would be set out in a grid system; and high-rise blocks would help clear the slums, overcrowded and unsanitary places where the inhabitants were, as the architect put it, \u201cincapable of initiating ameliorations\u201d. Glasgow enthusiastically adopted these new buildings. In 1954 a delegation of councillors and planners visited Marseilles to see the Le Corbusier-designed Unit\u00e9 d\u2019Habitation, an 18-storey block of flats and amenities resting on concrete stilts. Glasgow soon had the highest number of high-rise dwellings in the UK outside London. Le Corbusier\u2019s \u2018Radiant City\u2019 project in Marseille. Photograph: Boris Horvat/AFP/Getty Images Since Le Corbusier, we have learned more about how the design of buildings can affect behaviour. In an oft-cited study from 1973, the psychologist Andrew Baum looked at how the design of two student dormitories changed how the residents interacted. In the first design, all the students shared common lounge and bathroom facilities along a corridor. In the second, smaller groups of four to six each shared bathrooms and lounges. Baum found that the first design was a \u201csocially overloaded environment\u201d that did not allow residents to regulate who they interacted with and when. Being faced with too many people, at times not of their choosing, led students to experience stress; they became less helpful and more antisocial than those in the second design as the year went on. Perhaps the most famous example of buildings\u2019 effects on their inhabitants still referenced today is the Pruitt\u2013Igoe housing complex in St Louis, USA: 33 towers of 11 storeys each, inspired by Le Corbusier and designed by the modernist Minoru Yamasaki. Finished in 1956, it was initially seen as a miracle solution to inner-city living. Less than 20 years later, the social problems the blocks seemed to have spawned were deemed so irreparable that the local authorities imploded the buildings. The architect Oscar Newman toured Pruitt\u2013Igoe in 1971, a year before demolition started. He argued that the design of a building affected the extent to which residents contributed to its upkeep. If people feel responsible for both keeping an area clean and controlling who uses it, it is likely to be safer. He called this sense of ownership over a territory \u201cdefensible space\u201d. \u201cThe larger the number of people who share a communal space, the more difficult it is for people to identify it as theirs or to feel they have a right to control or determine the activity taking place within it,\u201d Newman wrote. Pruitt\u2013Igoe was not designed to accommodate defensible space, he argued. \u201cLandings shared by only two families were well maintained, whereas corridors shared by 20 families \u2026 were a disaster \u2013 they evoked no feelings of identity or control.\u201d Part of the Pruitt-Igoe public housing development in St. Louis, Missouri, being demolished by dynamite charges in 1972. Photograph: Fred Waters/AP Tower blocks with wealthier residents are less likely to have issues with defensible space: they can pay for cleaners and security guards. Children, on the other hand, are often most affected: these common areas \u2013 communal corridors, or landings, or the nearby park \u2013 are usually spaces for play. During his inauguration as rector of Glasgow University in 1972, the Clydeside trade unionist Jimmy Reid argued powerfully that working-class communities left behind by economic advancement were being stored out of sight. \u201cWhen you think of some of the high flats around us,\u201d he said, \u201cit can hardly be an accident that they are as near as one could get to an architectural representation of a filing cabinet.\u201d Newts in the city Inequality is at its most conspicuous in cities: the very poor and the very rich live side-by-side yet separately. Relative social status is more likely to be the first measure by which we judge people in places where communities are more transient and inequality starker. This has been shown to have an impact on our psychological wellbeing. In their book The Inner Level, epidemiologists Kate Pickett and Richard G Wilkinson argue that inequality not only creates social rupture by highlighting people\u2019s differences but also encourages competition, contributing to increased social anxiety. They cite a 2004 paper by two psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles \u2013 Sally Dickerson and Margaret Kemeny \u2013 who analysed 208 studies to find that tasks involving some threat of social evaluation affected stress hormones the most. Pickett and Wilkinson argue that this type of stress harms our psychological health: \u201cThe more unequal countries had three times as much mental illness as the more equal ones.\u201d This affects people of all social classes. In high-inequality countries, such as the USA and the UK, even the richest 10% of people suffer more anxiety than any group in low-inequality countries except the poorest 10%. Research has also shown that living in a city can alter our brain\u2019s architecture, making it more vulnerable to this type of social stress. In 2011, a team led by psychiatrist Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg of Heidelberg University\u2019s Central Institute of Mental Health looked at the implications of urban living on brain biology, scanning the brains of students while they were given arithmetic tasks and simultaneously subjected to criticism on headphones. The results of the test, designed to simulate social stress, were stark: the participants who lived in a city demonstrated a greater neurophysiological reaction, with the amygdala, an area of the brain which processes emotion, activated more strongly. Those who\u2019d grown up in cities also displayed a stronger response in their perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, which regulates the amygdala and is associated with stress and negative emotion, than those brought up in towns or the countryside. Meyer-Lindenberg\u2019s previous work on risk mechanisms in schizophrenia focused on genes. But these are only thought to account for a 20% increased chance of developing the illness at most \u2013 and growing up in a city is associated with double the risk. His research has shown that stressful experiences in early life correlate with reduced volume of grey matter in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, a factor often seen in people with schizophrenia. \u201cMental health is almost uniformly worse in cities \u2026 that\u2019s just what the data shows,\u201d Meyer-Lindenberg says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really a bright side to this.\u201d Lack of agency \u2013 the feeling that we don\u2019t have control over a situation \u2013 is one of the core mechanisms determining how strongly social stress is experienced, says Meyer-Lindenberg, adding: \u201cPeople who are in leadership positions tend to cope better with a given amount of stress.\u201d In a city, and particularly if you are poor, you are far more dependent on other people and the urban infrastructure, whether waiting impatiently for a bus or a lift, wondering who you\u2019ll have to share a lift with in your high-rise complex, or hoping the local council will not choose your neighbourhood for redevelopment. Cities can also of course be liberating. \u201cThe flip side of being more stressful is that they may be more stimulating,\u201d Meyer-Lindenberg says. \u201cThis tighter community that you have in a village, say, can be very oppressive if you don\u2019t feel like you belong, if you\u2019re an outsider of some sort.\u201d Inequality has been shown to lower trust in others and damage social capital \u2013 the networks between people which allow societies to function effectively. People are so worried about security that they\u2019re mentally building walls around themselves, says Liz Zeidler, chief executive of the Happy City Initiative, a research centre based in Bristol. \u201cWe need to be doing the opposite: we need to be creating more and more spaces where people can connect, learn across their differences.\u201d Happy City has designed a way to measure the local conditions shown to improve well-being. Its Thriving Places Index looks at housing, education, inequality, green space, safety and community cohesion. Perhaps a good measure for the happiness of a place, Zeidler says, is the status of the \u201cindicative species\u201d, an idea borrowed from the author and urbanist Charles Montgomery. For ponds, she says, it might be that the presence of a certain type of newt tells you whether or not the water is healthy. In cities, the newts are children: \u201cIf you can see children, it\u2019s probably a healthy and happy city.\u201d The way a city is laid out can foster this environment, she says, by \u201cclosing of streets, making it more pedestrianised, more green spaces, having more what urban planners would call \u2018bumping spaces\u2019, where you can literally bump into people. Slowing places down is really good for everybody\u2019s wellbeing and, obviously, you then see more children on the streets.\u201d \u2018The city will get what it invites\u2019 Without looking at the car swinging towards him, the urban planner Christopher Martin crosses the road. Thankfully, the car slows down. Martin continues, blithely, discussing the priority of pedestrians and rule 170 of the Highway Code. The Dutch traffic engineer Hans Monderman used to perform a similar trick in the early 2000s. He would walk, usually with a journalist in tow, backwards, eyes closed, into a four-way crossing with no traffic lights or signs. Monderman believed roads were safer without traffic signs; in order to navigate unfamiliar routes, cars would slow down. The common sense of the drivers would act as a more powerful safety guard than any sign. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to get people to interact with each other \u2013 be human beings,\u201d Martin says as we continue to walk up Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow. View looking west along Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow. Photograph: Alamy Sauchiehall Street is the first area to be worked on as part of the Avenues, a \u00a3115m project to form an integrated network of pedestrian and cycle routes on 17 roads and surrounding areas in the city centre between the Clyde and Glasgow\u2019s infamous motorway, which forms a near noose around the area. Glasgow\u2019s central grid is mostly made of four-lane roads. When you walk across the city, the roads, some at a steep incline, others stretching towards a grey horizon, seem solely taken up with cars and buses. \u201cThe city will get what it invites,\u201d says Martin. Now parts of these roads will be given over to those walking and biking, and to trees and benches. City planners the world over have a history of favouring the needs of cars. In 1955 Robert Moses, New York City parks commissioner, was planning to build a four-lane road through Washington Square Park. Some of the residents demurred, including the journalist Jane Jacobs. In 1958, three years into what would become a successful 14-year fight to save Greenwich Village, she wrote an article in Fortune magazine that eventually formed the basis of her book The Death and Life of American Cities. To keep downtown activities \u201ccompact and concentrated\u201d, Jacobs advocated removing cars: \u201cThe whole point is to make the streets more surprising, more compact, more variegated, and busier than before \u2013 not less so.\u201d She argued against grand schemes that sought to demolish and redevelop, instead saying that cities should grow in line with what people want and how they use the spaces that already exist: \u201cThere is no logic that can be superimposed on the city; people make it, and it is to them, not buildings, that we must fit our plans.\u201d Giving priority to cars has distorted cities\u2019 proportions, Martin says: \u201cIf you build at the scale of cars, you get wide roads, you get wide streets, you get cities which stretch out because cars are fast and cars are big.\u201d Taking space away from cars gives the public realm back to the people. \u201cIt\u2019s very antisocial being sat in a metal box by yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cThe rise of urban loneliness and mental health [issues] to do with that disconnection is vast.\u201d In Glasgow, Sauchiehall Street is being used as a proof of concept, while the other \u201cAvenues\u201d will be implemented over the next eight years. The way forward If designed well, cities can be good for us. \u201cIf you look at urban dwellers epidemiologically,\u201d says Meyer-Lindenberg, \u201cthey tend to be richer, better educated, [with] better access to healthcare. And they also tend to be somatically healthier.\u201d They also tend to have a smaller carbon footprint. \u201cYou can\u2019t raze cities to the ground and rebuild them,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to find ways to maximise people\u2019s wellbeing.\u201d Meyer-Lindenberg is currently tracking how different parts of the city affect our mental wellbeing, using a technique called ecological momentary assessment, in which participants repeatedly report on the environment around them in real time. Various studies have suggested that nature \u2013 be that a tree or a park \u2013 has an important impact on people\u2019s mental health. The app he is currently designing will allow people to plan their routes through the city in order to maximise their exposure to nature. \u201cThe most beneficial nature is the one that looks like the kind of nature that humans would have encountered during their early evolution,\u201d he surmises. Perhaps the manicured parks of the type preferred by urban planners may not actually be that effective at improving our wellbeing. In 2012, Emily Cutts realised the importance of these kinds of green spaces when the meadow overlooked by her second-floor flat in west Glasgow was threatened with development. Once used as an informal football pitch by locals, the meadow had mostly been frequented by dog walkers and drug addicts since the council, who wanted to sell the land, removed the goalposts. Now it finally looked as if a plan to build 90 deluxe flats might pass. The community garden in North Kelvin Meadow, Glasgow. Photograph: Chris Leslie Cutts decided that the only way to save the meadow was to launch a campaign. Over the next few years, the community organised petitions, events and a three-month vigil in St George\u2019s Square in the city centre. Eventually the Scottish government stepped in. On 21 December 2016, it was determined that the meadow would remain undeveloped. It is known locally as the Children\u2019s Wood and is managed by a charity. But why did Cutts and her fellow campaigners fight so passionately for this dingy meadow? Her neighbourhood, about 10 minutes north of the Botanic Gardens, already had plenty of green space. Was it simply a case of not wanting development on her doorstep? When I meet Cutts in the community garden, she is deep in discussion with the gardener, Christine, about the possibility of using a wormery to transform dog faeces into compost for the trees. There are raised beds for planting, a bathtub with upturned earth for children to dig and an \u201cedible\u201d teepee (pea shoot tendrils will soon be climbing up the twigs). It was planted by a 12-year-old boy who, Cutts tells me, is regularly excluded from school. Cutts is slight with long blonde hair, a soft Glaswegian accent and an eager countenance. She has an MSc in positive psychology. It was while working as Carol Craig\u2019s researcher, compiling and presenting research on how to improve wellbeing, that she grew to understand the meadow\u2019s potential to make her community healthier and happier. Today, more than 20 schools and nurseries from the local area use the meadow. During my visit, Kelvinside Academy is having a forestry lesson. Children are playing around the thin birch trees, tying ropes around them, swinging friends vigorously in hammocks that look like laughing body bags, and digging in the earth. They learn to use knives for woodland tasks. Cutts collaborated with a researcher at the University of Glasgow on a series of tests comparing the attention spans of children who spent their lunchtime in the meadow with those who stayed indoors or played in the school\u2019s concrete playground. The attention of children exposed to nature was \u201csignificantly better\u201d. Attention restorative theories argue that nature can have an impact on our attention span by engaging our indirect attention; this allows the type of attention we use for more challenging cognitive tasks, such as mathematical problems, to recuperate. The team also performed a similar experiment looking at children\u2019s creativity in art. \u201cChildren who came here used more colours, used more texture, made more depth to their pictures than those who hadn\u2019t played outside,\u201d says Cutts. Play area at the Children\u2019s Wood, Glasgow. Photograph: Chris Leslie Richard Mitchell, a professor in the Social and Public Health Sciences Unit at the University of Glasgow, has also been looking at how exposure to nature affects stress in deprived communities. Despite previous research showing a beneficial impact, his own findings have shown it to be slight. \u201cThese are all very deprived communities with a whole range of other problems going on, and the detrimental impact of life in poverty and other stressful situations is not outweighed by access to green space,\u201d he says. \u201cI think what we have to understand is that at a population level it may not have an absolutely spectacular impact straight away, [but] it is important.\u201d Further study, however, showed that one aspect of exposure to nature \u201chad pretty strong protective effects on mental health in adulthood\u201d, Mitchell says. Those who had been Scouts or Guides, and had repeated contact with nature over a long period of time \u201cwhere they\u2019re learning a whole variety of skills including being outdoors and appreciation of nature\u201d, were less vulnerable to mental ill-health. The Children\u2019s Wood charity runs a regular youth club where they bring young people to help with the gardening. Many of the children come from deprived families. \u201cThat\u2019s what always interests us about the space,\u201d says Cutts. \u201cIt\u2019s bang right in the centre of inequality \u2013 there\u2019s so much poverty and there\u2019s a lot of affluence around. So, we feel it\u2019s sort of a level playing field and everybody is welcome.\u201d Unlike in parks, which can be anonymous, here you have \u201ca committed community who are involved in the space\u201d, she says. We go up the road together to visit a GP at home who works in Possilpark, one of the poorest districts in the city. She prescribes visits to the Children\u2019s Wood, in addition to other treatments, due to the benefits of \u201cpeer support, getting out of your house, talking to others, getting more engaged in your community, watching things grown, nurturing other things, nurturing oneself and self-care\u201d. She says that when her patients talk about the wood, it is one of the few times she sees them smile. Over 60% of Glasgow\u2019s population live within 500 metres of a derelict site. A 2013 study found that vacant land and deprivation were linked to poor mental and physical health. It recommended that the city council grant the more than 700 hectares (1,730 acres) available to highly deprived communities to be used for community good. \u201cReclaiming the land for community is definitely the way forward,\u201d Cutts says as we both look over the meadow in the drizzling rain. \u201cYou can tell there\u2019s a need but it\u2019s not happening all over and it could be.\u201d In the evening, Cutts shows me the youth programme where 40 or so children are learning how to trampoline. As I wait for the bus, I see some of the children leaving, mostly boys who are about 13 or 14, jostling and pushing each other playfully in the middle of the wide road. They are the newts in the city. This is an edited version of an article first published by Wellcome on Mosaic and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence.

The Leipzig party statement said: \u2018We all need a free exchange of ideas about how we should continue Socialism in our nation.\u2019 The message was read over the state-controlled Leipzig radio, during prayer services in four city churches, and over loudspeakers during the demonstration, witnesses said.</p> <p>Last night in East Berlin\u2019s Gethsemane Church, where thousands of protesters have gathered and taken refuge in recent weeks, Bishop Gottfried Forck urged a crowd of 3,000 people to speak their minds, but warned against taking part in \u2018unauthorised street demonstrations\u2019.

At both Nato and the European Commission there is no mistaking the misgivings and the growing concern about the pace of change in the East and there is significantly less euphoria than earlier this summer.</p> <p>Of course there are those who revel in the ideological defeat sustained by the \u2018Communist\u2019 world and who openly proclaim the West\u2019s final \u2018victory\u2019 over the East as a fitting culmination to the 40-year-old confrontation which began with the onset of Cold War in 1948. But this is not the language employed by the more perceptive strategists at NATO headquarters; the talk is more about the danger that the Warsaw Pact may disintegrate before the West has decided what its response should be.</p> <p>To some extent this simply reflects apprehension that if the Warsaw Pact breaks up, the last remaining rationale for Nato\u2019s own existence disappears as well. This partly explains why its secretary general, Mr Manfred Woerner, has tried to make out a case for Nato\u2019s future role being to \u2018contain\u2019 even a post-Communist and heavily disarmed Russia which, nonetheless, would remain a significant geo-political power.</p> <p>Of course the Cold War Tweedledum has always depended on the continued existence of Tweedledee. Hence the extravagance of some western \u2018Soviet threat\u2019 theorists who are now reduced to basing their case for continued western military preparedness on the danger that an unduly rapid break-up of the Soviet Union itself might destabilise the alliance by encouraging similarly centripetal tendencies in the West.</p> <p>No one in their right mind can dispute the obvious dangers that accompany the traumas in East Germany, Hungary, Poland and parts of the Soviet Union. The threat that a frightened bureaucracy might unleash a European \u2018Tiananmen Square\u2019 existed long before Mr Honecker\u2019s thinly veiled warning this week to the democracy movement in the GDR.</p> <p>Quite apart from the risk of an eventual lurch back to violent repression, no one should underestimate the growing economic and social tensions which are to be found as much in those east European countries which have embarked on the road of market liberalisation as in those still clinging to the decaying remnants of a Stalinist command economy.</p> <p>That is why Mr Lech Walesa\u2019s recent warning of the possibility of civil war sent so many shivers down the spine of European Community governments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4ff337172c27ead1d57cc0254d45f6413ef0c1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4ff337172c27ead1d57cc0254d45f6413ef0c1b/0_44_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikhail Gorbachev, Erich Honecker and other Eastern Bloc head of states, 7 October 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mikhail Gorbachev, Erich Honecker and other Eastern Bloc head of states, 7 October 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: U. Baumgarten via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Solidarity chief was complaining about the accelerating rate of price increases in Poland \u2013 something which goes to the heart of the liberalising strategy being urged on the east Europeans by the West. However the involvement of the European Commission in the economic reform programmes of the authorities in Budapest and Warsaw already goes far beyond the proffering of food aid and economic advice.</p> <p>The Commission, also acting on behalf not just of the west Europeans but of the 24 OECD western industrialised nations, is also helping the Polish and Hungarian governments prepare the wholesale restructuring of their agriculture and industry, using resources created in part by the sale at market prices of surplus EC foodstocks to carry this through.</p> <p>If this strategy goes wrong or if it leads to confrontation with Polish or Hungarian workers in the months and years ahead, the political blame may fall as much on the European Community as on the authorities in Budapest or Prague.</p> <p>But whatever their doubts about economic restructuring, all the signs are that the Hungarians and the Poles want to move politically closer to the European Community. And they are unlikely to be alone in this ambition.</p> <p>The secession-minded Slovene in Yugoslavia have hinted that they would love to march hand in hand with their Austrian neighbours into the EC, while similar noises off are coming from the Baltic states which are, at the same time, planning to cut their economies adrift from the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Meanwhile influential socialist opposition thinkers, such as Boris Kagarlitsky in the Soviet Union and some leaders of the Polish Socialist Party, increasingly talk of a \u2018third camp\u2019 strategy between Stalinism and free market capitalism. But they envisage this in terms of democratic planning of the ecology and the environment at a pan-European rather than a purely national level.</p> <p>The Commission\u2019s President, Mr Jacques Delors, does not disguise his alarm at the pace of these developments. Quite apart from the nightmare proportions of the economic and political problems the aspirant east European member states would bring with them to Brussels, he knows that other west European EFTA countries (notably Austria and Norway) are also edging closer to the 12.</p> <p>The conventional wisdom in Brussels is that a new enlargement to absorb the admittedly rich and relatively successful EFTA countries could kill the Community\u2019s own integration plans stone dead. Officials find unthinkable the prospect of also having to integrate east European economies which are bound to remain crisis ridden for years to come.</p> <p>The belief that enlargement is the enemy of European integration is, on the historical evidence, suspect. It is true that the original six EC member states were far more homogeneous economically and politically than the present 12.

      "bodyText": "70,000 march in Leipzig to demand changes by Michael Simmons in Berlin 10 October 1989 Up to 70,000 people marched through Leipzig last night demanding reforms. A huge police and paramilitary deployment watched, but did not intervene. Before the march, officials of the Leipzig Communist Party leadership promised publicly they would push for a free exchange of ideas between citizens and the government, Lutheran church sources said. \u2018Several thousand\u2019 demonstrators had also gathered in front of an East Berlin church, West German radio reported. Protesters marched through Leipzig shouting: \u2018We need freedom\u2019, \u2018Democracy\u2019, and \u2018No violence\u2019, said witnesses. A number of paramilitary troopers who had been called in chatted with protesters. Mr Christoph Wonneberger, pastor for the Lukas church in Leipzig, said there were \u2018at least\u2019 70,000 demonstrators and he was surprised by the apparent restraint of police and paramilitary troops. Some demonstrators \u2018began conversations with paramilitary troops\u2019 after the crowd started dispersing by mid-evening, Mr Wonneberger said. The Leipzig party statement said: \u2018We all need a free exchange of ideas about how we should continue Socialism in our nation.\u2019 The message was read over the state-controlled Leipzig radio, during prayer services in four city churches, and over loudspeakers during the demonstration, witnesses said. Last night in East Berlin\u2019s Gethsemane Church, where thousands of protesters have gathered and taken refuge in recent weeks, Bishop Gottfried Forck urged a crowd of 3,000 people to speak their minds, but warned against taking part in \u2018unauthorised street demonstrations\u2019. He also implored the Communist leadership to take steps towards a democratic future. Many of the hundreds of demonstrators arrested over the weekend have already been sentenced to up to six months\u2019 imprisonment. Frontier guards at the Checkpoint Charlie and Friedrichstrasse crossing points into East Berlin yesterday physically barred the way to journalists and to many would-be tourists to prevent them even reaching passport control desks. In Dresden, after a weekend of violence, church leaders are seeking a dialogue with the civic authorities. This could make or break the career of the supposed reformist, Mr Hans Modrow, the city\u2019s Communist Party secretary. East German commentators, giving way to the defensive tendencies associated with the leadership, yesterday labelled demonstrators \u2018marauding mobs of troublemakers\u2019. However, evidence accumulates that the opposition is growing. Details were released yesterday of the inaugural meeting of a Social Democratic Party. This will anger the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED), since it is itself the result of an amalgamation of the old Communist Party and the then Social Democrats. The SDP meeting was attended by delegates from all over East Germany and appointed a 15-man executive, to be led by a 35-year-old historian, Mr Ibrahim Bohme, who used to be in the SED. The New Forum yesterday called on all East Germans to take steps to replace the country\u2019s leadership. Several hundred trade unionists at the old-established Berlin engineering works, Bergmann-Borsig, have called on the country\u2019s trade union leader, Mr Harry Tisch, to open a dialogue on changes they say are \u2018urgently necessary\u2019 in all areas of society. The most radical change in the East bloc since the second world war: Hungarian Communist Party says its farewells to the old Stalinist dogmas by Ian Traynor in Budapest 11 October 1989 The leadership elections for Hungary\u2018s new Socialist Party ranked as a victory for the moderate middle ground of the party leader, Mr Rezso Nyers, against the more radical reformist wing in personal power terms, but in political philosophy terms the party\u2019s ditching of Communism as its guiding ideology is arguably the most radical statement from the ruling class in Eastern Europe since Stalin stamped his will on the region after the second world war. The new programme, rule book, and historical statement overwhelmingly endorsed by the emergency party congress that ended in the small hours of yesterday morning waved a not too fond farewell to the central dogmas, honed in Moscow, that have governed the region for the past 40 years. No more dictatorship of the proletariat, no more dictatorship of the Politburo either. The latter, formally known as democratic centralism, is replaced by a commitment to freedom of opinion and expression within the new party. Mr Gorbachev has gone this far, too, with his advocacy of \u2018socialist pluralism\u2019, but the key difference is that the Hungarians have abjured any right to a \u2018leading role\u2019 and committed themselves to a multi-party political system. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full. Commentary: Shivers down the spine of Europe by John Palmer 11 October 1989 The speed and unpredictability of events in eastern Europe are causing almost as many hairs to grey in Brussels as in Berlin or Prague. At both Nato and the European Commission there is no mistaking the misgivings and the growing concern about the pace of change in the East and there is significantly less euphoria than earlier this summer. Of course there are those who revel in the ideological defeat sustained by the \u2018Communist\u2019 world and who openly proclaim the West\u2019s final \u2018victory\u2019 over the East as a fitting culmination to the 40-year-old confrontation which began with the onset of Cold War in 1948. But this is not the language employed by the more perceptive strategists at NATO headquarters; the talk is more about the danger that the Warsaw Pact may disintegrate before the West has decided what its response should be. To some extent this simply reflects apprehension that if the Warsaw Pact breaks up, the last remaining rationale for Nato\u2019s own existence disappears as well. This partly explains why its secretary general, Mr Manfred Woerner, has tried to make out a case for Nato\u2019s future role being to \u2018contain\u2019 even a post-Communist and heavily disarmed Russia which, nonetheless, would remain a significant geo-political power. Of course the Cold War Tweedledum has always depended on the continued existence of Tweedledee. Hence the extravagance of some western \u2018Soviet threat\u2019 theorists who are now reduced to basing their case for continued western military preparedness on the danger that an unduly rapid break-up of the Soviet Union itself might destabilise the alliance by encouraging similarly centripetal tendencies in the West. No one in their right mind can dispute the obvious dangers that accompany the traumas in East Germany, Hungary, Poland and parts of the Soviet Union. The threat that a frightened bureaucracy might unleash a European \u2018Tiananmen Square\u2019 existed long before Mr Honecker\u2019s thinly veiled warning this week to the democracy movement in the GDR. Quite apart from the risk of an eventual lurch back to violent repression, no one should underestimate the growing economic and social tensions which are to be found as much in those east European countries which have embarked on the road of market liberalisation as in those still clinging to the decaying remnants of a Stalinist command economy. That is why Mr Lech Walesa\u2019s recent warning of the possibility of civil war sent so many shivers down the spine of European Community governments. The Solidarity chief was complaining about the accelerating rate of price increases in Poland \u2013 something which goes to the heart of the liberalising strategy being urged on the east Europeans by the West. However the involvement of the European Commission in the economic reform programmes of the authorities in Budapest and Warsaw already goes far beyond the proffering of food aid and economic advice. The Commission, also acting on behalf not just of the west Europeans but of the 24 OECD western industrialised nations, is also helping the Polish and Hungarian governments prepare the wholesale restructuring of their agriculture and industry, using resources created in part by the sale at market prices of surplus EC foodstocks to carry this through. If this strategy goes wrong or if it leads to confrontation with Polish or Hungarian workers in the months and years ahead, the political blame may fall as much on the European Community as on the authorities in Budapest or Prague. But whatever their doubts about economic restructuring, all the signs are that the Hungarians and the Poles want to move politically closer to the European Community. And they are unlikely to be alone in this ambition. The secession-minded Slovene in Yugoslavia have hinted that they would love to march hand in hand with their Austrian neighbours into the EC, while similar noises off are coming from the Baltic states which are, at the same time, planning to cut their economies adrift from the Soviet Union. Meanwhile influential socialist opposition thinkers, such as Boris Kagarlitsky in the Soviet Union and some leaders of the Polish Socialist Party, increasingly talk of a \u2018third camp\u2019 strategy between Stalinism and free market capitalism. But they envisage this in terms of democratic planning of the ecology and the environment at a pan-European rather than a purely national level. The Commission\u2019s President, Mr Jacques Delors, does not disguise his alarm at the pace of these developments. Quite apart from the nightmare proportions of the economic and political problems the aspirant east European member states would bring with them to Brussels, he knows that other west European EFTA countries (notably Austria and Norway) are also edging closer to the 12. The conventional wisdom in Brussels is that a new enlargement to absorb the admittedly rich and relatively successful EFTA countries could kill the Community\u2019s own integration plans stone dead. Officials find unthinkable the prospect of also having to integrate east European economies which are bound to remain crisis ridden for years to come. The belief that enlargement is the enemy of European integration is, on the historical evidence, suspect. It is true that the original six EC member states were far more homogeneous economically and politically than the present 12. But the admission of Britain, Denmark and Ireland did force the development of more serious regional and social policies in the EC. The accession of the three Mediterranean countries since then helped trigger the long overdue reform of the Common Agricultural Policy \u2013 and directly stimulated the Single European Act and its modest reforms of the Community\u2019s decision making processes. The simple fact is that any further enlargement of the Community \u2013 even one involving relatively unproblematic west European countries such as Norway \u2013 would make further reform of the EC institutions imperative. And such a reform could only really be in the direction of greater \u2018federalism\u2019 given the supranational character of the economic, political and social challenges facing Europe. It is not so much that the EC would extend its authority into areas which are presently the unchallenged preserve of national and (in some countries) regional government. But an enlarged Community would still have to be given greater authority where developments in the real world are continuing to overtake the scope of national states. Mr Delors recognises that if the European Community itself is not the best instrument for a wider and increasing pan-European grouping, some other body will have to be created for just this purpose. But until now no one has dared even sketch out what such a pan-European framework might look like and whether it would subsume interested east Europeans as well as the EC and the six EFTA states. Neither has anyone dared speculate about how far this body would need to have some supranational authority to be of any use. Until the present explosion of opposition to the regime in the GDR, it was just possible to imagine that there was time enough to work out some long-term and gradualist goals for a wider European reunification. What is now happening on the streets of Dresden, Leipzig and East Berlin is dramatically foreshortening that time. East Germans oust Honecker 19 October 1989 by Anna Tomforde in Bonn East Germany yesterday moved to put an end to the most traumatic and agonising crisis in its recent history by replacing Mr Erich Honecker, the country\u2019s ageing leader, with Mr Egon Krenz, the youngest member of the Politburo. But Mr Krenz, aged 52, who was one of the first to applaud the crushing of the democracy movement in China, and even went to Beijing to offer his congratulations, has a reputation as a hardliner. Bulgarian dissidents win temporary green light by Denise Searle and Mike Power in Sofia 23 October 1989 A breath of political fresh air is blowing through the Bulgarian capital as the opposition has won a green light to pursue its activities for the first time in 40 years. Under the protection of a large contingent of foreign diplomats and journalists here for an East-West environmental conference, Bulgaria\u2019s fledgling dissident movement has organised mass meetings and open-air rallies, held press conferences and issued policy statements. Such activities are still small compared with protests in other East European countries, but their scale has taken the authorities and even the dissidents themselves by surprise. Bulgaria\u2019s greens, Ecoglasnost, had by last night collected more than 5,000 signatures after nine consecutive days of campaigning on the streets of central Sofia. A leading member of Ecoglasnost, Beyan Kiurianov, said: \u2018It seems we are being tolerated .. while journalists and diplomats from 35 countries are in Sofia. We must speak out while we have the chance.\u2019 Ecoglasnost is protesting against the siting of a nuclear power station on the Danube island of Belene which they say is on an earthquake zone, and also against a project to divert the Mesta River which flows into northern Greece. Reform closes in on Prague By Ian Traynor in Prague 9 November 1989 The Czechoslovak leadership has hoped against hope these past couple of years that President Gorbachev would not last. Now it finds the East Berlin-Prague axis, linking Eastern Europe\u2019s two strongest economies against perestroika, is suddenly in shreds. A deepening and less than splendid isolation is settling over the country. Its fundamentalist leaders are pursuing an unrelenting campaign of repression against their critics while radical changes are afoot all around. The Czechs and Slovaks could watch the cataclysmic events of the past six months in Poland and Hungary with no real inclination to emulate their poverty-stricken neighbours. \u2018East Germany is different, unlike Poland, where the motive for change was empty shelves,\u2019 says Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the head of the editorial board of the main underground newspaper. \u2018People here regard the GDR with a certain respect and events there now show that the people can overthrow the leadership. The East Berlin-Prague axis is now lost. The leaders here cannot make an axis with Ceausescu or Tirana. These are completely different political cultures.\u2019 E Berlin breaks with 40 years of history by Michael Simmons 9 November 1989 Forty years of history were dramatically swept aside yesterday with the announcement that the ruling East German Communist Party is apparently willing to contest free elections. The fact that the party is now looking at defeat as a distinct possibility represents the most emphatic break yet with the whole trajectory of the country\u2019s post-war history. It had kept power with the help of a ubiquitous state security network, and it was apparently unwilling to take serious notice of the rising tide of popular discontent inside the country or of the meteorological changes outside the country, where reform and change were being swept along by the prevailing wind. Mr Honecker\u2019s closest allies in his last few months were the most notable \u2018conservatives\u2019 of the Warsaw Pact - the Czechoslovak leader, Mr Milos Jakes, and the Romanian leader, President Nicolae Ceausescu. The Soviet Union under President Gorbachev, backed up by Hungary and Poland, has ditched the Brezhnev era \u2018of stagnation\u2019 once and for all. The East German population who know this all too well from their daily consumption of the West German media have needed no telling that the old men at the top of the GDR belonged very much to that era, if not to the era of Stalin that had gone before. Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Romania are still in the Brezhnev era and will, overtly or covertly, feel that much more isolated as East Germany, until so recently a dependable friend who more or less spoke their language, has moved into a new and palpably different phase. But even in Bulgaria, as the past two weeks have shown, and in Czechoslovakia, there is the sort of underlying discontent, surfacing from time to time in street demonstrations, which Mr Honecker and company chose to ignore.

The decision by the Home Office\u2019s immigration department has been branded \u201cinhumane\u201d and prompted warnings it will worsen the NHS\u2019s already serious shortage of doctors. Dr Chan, who is 38 and does not want to reveal his first name or exact Asian country of origin, worked at Moorfields eye hospital, in London, between September 2017 and August this year.

      "bodyText": "The Brexit secretary has indicated Boris Johnson will send a letter to the EU seeking an extension if there is no agreement by Saturday. Pressed by the Brexit select committee as to whether the prime minister would obey the Benn act, Stephen Barclay said the government \u201cwill abide by that text\u201d. He also denied knowledge of any plan to send a second letter to Brussels asking officials to ignore the first because the government did not want an extension. The legislation passed by MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit requires the prime minister to ask the EU to extend article 50 beyond 31 October should a deal not be agreed by 19 October. UK negotiators resumed talks on Wednesday morning after wrapping up their previous session in the early hours as they search for an agreement ready for a meeting of EU leaders on Thursday. If Johnson fails to achieve a deal by the weekend, he will clash with MPs, who will demand he complies with the Benn act and asks for an extension, something he has repeatedly ruled out. Hilary Benn, the chair of the committee, asked Barclay: \u201cCan you confirm if there is no agreement reached which is approved by parliament on Saturday that by the end of the day the PM will write the letter?\u201d Barclay replied: \u201cI can confirm as the PM has repeatedly set out that firstly the government will comply with the law. And secondly, the government will comply with undertakings given to the court in respect of the law.\u201d Benn pointed out the undertaking given to the court was that Johnson would send a letter if specific conditions were not satisfied. Barclay said: \u201cI can confirm the government will abide by that text.\u201d The government told a Scottish court earlier this month the prime minister accepted he would have no choice but to send a letter. However, there have been repeated briefings from No 10 that claimed ministers have found a way to bypass the law. Ministers have indicated the government could send a second letter asking the EU to ignore the first asking for an extension.

Robert Buckland, the justice secretary and lord chancellor, told another select committee he was committed to \u201cupholding the rule of law\u201d as its \u201cguardian in cabinet\u201d, promising this was a role he took extremely seriously. His comments suggest he would not tolerate any move by Downing Street to disobey the law by refusing to stay within the strictures of the Benn act. Buckland also dismissed calls from some Conservatives for a politically appointed judiciary following the supreme court\u2019s ruling against Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament. \u201cThe day we end with US-style confirmation hearings would be a very black day for our constitution.

When cooked, she says, \u201cits flavour is unlike that of any other bean, subtly recalling chestnuts\u201d. Outside their summer season, dried, as used by Anna, one of the nonnas in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pasta-Grannies-Secrets-Italys-Cooks/dp/1784882887/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=pasta+grannies&amp;qid=1570118505&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">the new Pasta Grannies book</a>, and Norman in his book Polpo, are a \u201cwholly satisfactory substitute\u201d. Contaldo recommends tinned in his Pasta Perfecto!, though, \u201ctime permitting\u201d, you could use dried \u201cif you prefer\u201d; Galletto\u2019s recipe, \u201calla montanara\u201d, deploys dried \u201clarge white beans, called fagioli di Spagna in Italian\u201d, and, I assume, butter beans in English.</p> <p>Happily, I find fresh, candy-spotted borlotti without too much trouble, and can confirm that they are truly worth tracking down (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/allotment/2009/aug/04/gardens-gardeningadvice\" title=\"\">or planting for next year</a>): plump and nutty, they\u2019re a quite superior product to the dried kind. However, as the season draws to a close, they\u2019re not the most practical recommendation. Tinned work just fine, especially if you\u2019re in a hurry (Contaldo\u2019s recipe can be on the table in half an hour), but dried are a better alternative, simply because you can flavour them as you like during cooking, and use the cooking water to make a really beany broth, of which more later. If you do use tinned, loosen the water in the tin with chicken or vegetable stock.</p> <p>Norman cooks his beans with onion, garlic and rosemary, while nonna Anna and Galletto pop in carrot and celery. The sharpness of garlic doesn\u2019t feel quite right here for some reason, but the other vegetables are a great pairing with the earthiness of the beans, giving them a fuller, more rounded flavour.</p> <p>Both Hazan and Contaldo mash some of the cooked beans into the broth to thicken it, which seems an eminently sensible idea, making the whole dish even more emphatically beany \u2013 on which note, though Galletto\u2019s butter beans work just fine, we find they lack the flavour of the borlotti \u2013 even Hazan\u2019s suggested kidney beans would probably be a more interesting option. So often relegated to a supporting role, beans should be the star ingredient in this dish.</p> <h2>The base</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"984704001bd6b70d55eab2c125f4a186a09c2242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/984704001bd6b70d55eab2c125f4a186a09c2242/0_456_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gennaro Contaldo\u2019s recipe for fagioli \u2018can be on the table in half an hour\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gennaro Contaldo\u2019s recipe for fagioli \u2018can be on the table in half an hour\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Infusing the beans alone is not enough; all the recipes I try include a soffrito, or a base of fried onion, often with carrot and celery, too, sometimes with garlic and, in the case of Galletto, red chilli as well, which is then combined with the beans and their broth. Some, including Contaldo and Anna, add pancetta and crumbled sausage, and some such as Galletto use prosciutto \u2013 this dish is pretty delicious without meat, but if you do eat it, a little pork fat is rarely a bad thing for flavour. Pancetta is the easiest way to achieve this, but for a more substantial, almost rag\u00f9-like soup, Anna\u2019s sausage version is a winner with my testers. Otherwise, I\u2019m going to keep the soffrito fairly simple by adding more in the way of onion, celery and carrot to give the dish a breadth of texture as well as taste: chilli, garlic, celery leaves and so on are entirely up to you.</p> <h2>The liquid</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6828780031dc7c43876edc960862d8a47225007d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6828780031dc7c43876edc960862d8a47225007d/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Peasant food of the most warming and comforting kind\u2019: Russell Norman\u2019s fagioli.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Peasant food of the most warming and comforting kind\u2019: Russell Norman\u2019s pasta e fagioli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tomatoes are very much optional \u2013 they play no part at all in Contaldo\u2019s recipe \u2013 but, simmered down until they become one with the beans, they do add a pleasant dose of umami.

It\u2019s also one of those recipes with as many versions as there are cooks, differing not only, Gennaro Contaldo observes, from region to region, \u201cbut also among families\u201d. Such hearty, starchy dishes were once an important part of everyday diets all over Europe, beans being both easy to grow and to store \u2013 indeed, the rather austere rule of St Benedict allotted monks a pint of beans and a pound of bread a day \u2013 and though these days we all have access to more exotic fare, it\u2019s hard to deny their attractions as a thrifty, satisfying stomach-filler. But if you don\u2019t have a treasured recipe handed down from your nonna, what\u2019s the best way to enjoy pasta e fagioli? The beans Perhaps unsurprisingly, this universally popular dish can be made with a number of different beans \u2013 Marcella Hazan calls borlotti, \u201cbrightly marbled in white and pink\u201d, the \u201cclassic\u201d variety in her Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, recommending the fresh sort when in season. When cooked, she says, \u201cits flavour is unlike that of any other bean, subtly recalling chestnuts\u201d. Outside their summer season, dried, as used by Anna, one of the nonnas in the new Pasta Grannies book, and Norman in his book Polpo, are a \u201cwholly satisfactory substitute\u201d. Contaldo recommends tinned in his Pasta Perfecto!, though, \u201ctime permitting\u201d, you could use dried \u201cif you prefer\u201d; Galletto\u2019s recipe, \u201calla montanara\u201d, deploys dried \u201clarge white beans, called fagioli di Spagna in Italian\u201d, and, I assume, butter beans in English. Happily, I find fresh, candy-spotted borlotti without too much trouble, and can confirm that they are truly worth tracking down (or planting for next year): plump and nutty, they\u2019re a quite superior product to the dried kind. However, as the season draws to a close, they\u2019re not the most practical recommendation.

Indeed, if you\u2019re really keen on them, try Norman\u2019s version, which stirs in a rich, long-simmered tomato sauce to create a creamily robust tomato and bean soup that is surely the very definition of a cockle-warmer, whatever that is in Italian.

Mash these with a little of their cooking water to make a paste, then stir into the soup with all the whole beans and enough of the cooking water to make a thick soup. Let the soup simmer gently while you cook the pasta in salted boiling water in another pot until al dente. Stir the drained pasta into the soup along with the butter, cover, take off the heat and leave to sit for five minutes. Season to taste and serve with a sprinkling of cheese. \u2022 Pasta and beans: up there with beans on toast for comfort, or too much of a good thing starch-wise?

There is truth in that, but as Daniel Sonabend\u2019s lively account of an overlooked episode in political history reveals, it also had its vicious side. Britain\u2019s home-grown fascists, who had never quite ceased activity during the war, even after scores of them were interned under Defence Regulation 18B in 1940, were quick to rebuild their networks and resume street activity. It wasn\u2019t long before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/oswald-mosley\" title=\"\">Oswald Mosley</a>, the former leader of the British Union of Fascists, reappeared with a new party, the Union Movement. It continued the old tactic of trying to stir up resentment against Jews in working-class neighbourhoods, by holding rallies at such places as Ridley Road market in Dalston, east London, then still the centre of a large Jewish community.</p> <p>The fascists believed their ideas would fall on fertile ground: Britain suffered crippling shortages, with rationing even harsher than it had been during the war years, while antisemitism remained widespread. Distorted press reports reinforced the stereotype of the Jewish black marketeer, while prejudice against Jews \u2013 not overwhelming, but more common, and more openly expressed, than many today would care to remember \u2013 was further exacerbated by conflict in Palestine between British Mandate forces and Zionist militants fighting to establish a new state. In summer 1947, the killing of two sergeants in Palestine by the Irgun was the trigger for widespread antisemitic riots across Britain, targeting Jewish homes and businesses in Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow.</p> <p>Against this background, a small circle of Jewish demobbed soldiers decided to take matters into their own hands and physically prevent fascist groups from spreading their message. The 43 Group, as it came to be known (the origins of the name are murky, but according to Sonabend it either refers to the number of people present at its founding, or the address at which the name was chosen), was somewhere between a community defence organisation and a private spy agency. Its members carried out surveillance operations on the far right, disrupted their meetings and rallies by heckling or pelting the speakers, and \u2013 most controversially \u2013 assaulted fascist activists, either in street scuffles or in targeted beatings under cover of darkness. The group only lasted a few years, formed in 1946 and disbanded in 1950 shortly after Mosley\u2019s Union Movement disintegrated. But it made a lasting impact: Sonabend estimates that as many as 2,000 people passed through its ranks, including a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vidal-sassoon\" title=\"\">Vidal Sassoon</a>, future celebrity hairdresser, and set the template for antifascist action in postwar Britain. When the far right made its reappearance in the 1960s, this time with Caribbean, African and Asian communities as its primary target, it was confronted by activists whose tactics were similar to those of the 43 Group \u2013 a tradition that continues today.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The book has\u00a0the\u00a0elements of a political thriller, with stakeouts and subterfuge taking place on suburban streets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Through interviews with veterans, and material from antifascist and Jewish community archives, Sonabend vividly reconstructs this story. It has the elements of a political thriller, with stakeouts, sabotage and subterfuge taking place on suburban streets, in West End nightclubs and Lyons\u2019 Corner Houses. Sonabend, a London-based historian, gets a little bogged down in detail (after a while, one anecdote of a punch-up starts to sound much the same as another) but he provides enough political and social context to convince us why these events matter, and what their resonances might be today. The fascist agitators are both threatening and pompous, with the genocidal implications of their ideas \u2013 purity of race and nation, a culture of violence, absolute submission to authority \u2013 jarring with the pettiness of their immediate circumstances. People like this are a joke until, suddenly, they\u2019re not.</p> <p>Sonabend evokes a fearful and insecure mood among Jewish communities in Britain at the end of the war. People who had fought against Hitler were returning home to face not only growing awareness of the Holocaust, but the possibility that the hatred that underpinned it had survived on their doorstep. (In 1945, for instance, hundreds of residents of Hampstead in north-west London signed a petition opposing the local resettlement of Jewish refugees.) For some, the 43 Group\u2019s physical resistance to fascism was not just about defence, it was a way of regaining lost pride. \u201cIf it achieved nothing else,\u201d one veteran said, \u201cit gave Jewish ex-servicemen the sense of pride that we are a people, that we can defend ourselves, and we\u2019re not just running away.\u201d For others the fight was not so much about Jewish identity as a wider antiracist struggle: the 43 Group\u2019s newspaper reported on lynching in the US, segregation in South Africa and political persecution elsewhere in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2361780a931e372f15da38bd5ff5e06438076a7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2361780a931e372f15da38bd5ff5e06438076a7a/265_864_1940_1164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hecklers arrested in Ridley Road, east London, in 1947.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hecklers arrested in Ridley Road, east London, in 1947.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Author\u2019s collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mainstream Jewish community organisations kept their distance or were openly hostile to the 43 Group, and those associated with it felt they could not rely on the state for protection.

That, they can all agree, is racist. Also monkey noises. Definitely racist. Even the Daily Express put \u201cEngland Stand Up To Racist Fans\u201d on their front page on Tuesday. Unfortunately, it\u2019s all the many other notorious Express front pages that will end up having had rather more influence on our own shores, where racism has not been kicked out, and is not yet a distant dream. Still, other countries are worse, so what does it matter?</p> \n<p>It matters, of course, to people who endure racism here. Football reflects society, not the other way around. After the repulsive behaviour of some Bulgarian fans in Sofia, Gareth Southgate reported ruefully of his conversations with England\u2019s black players: \u201cSadly, because of their experiences in our own country, they are hardened to racism. I don\u2019t know what that says about our society but that\u2019s the reality.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet again, you have to salute Southgate, who always confronts the more complex aspects of a situation, however tempting it must be to ignore them when some of the worst extremes were on show. What an extraordinary leader he is, for a generation of players that inspire in so many different ways. (Very incidentally, it should always be remembered that he is in position completely by accident. All the FA people who were paid to find expensive failures \u2013 sporting and moral \u2013 to be England manager only alighted by default on the caretaker when their other terrible choices had flamed out. To say the understudy turned out to be the very best of them doesn\u2019t begin to cover it).</p> \n<p>So yes, Southgate isn\u2019t selectively blind, but many more seem to see the extreme events in Sofia as grounds for full complacency. This feels somewhat premature for a country where the prime minister has been accused on multiple occasions of using racist language, where the Windrush scandal has changed precisely nothing, and where ethnic minorities have faced significant rises in levels of abuse and discrimination since the Brexit referendum.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4a0b571dcc9b9bb571a78b4385166768b392549\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4a0b571dcc9b9bb571a78b4385166768b392549/184_246_3403_2041/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raheem Sterling applauds England fans after the game in Sofia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raheem Sterling applauds England fans after the game in Sofia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Much has been made of the fact that in Sofia, a small section of England fans were singing \u201cWho put the ball in the racists\u2019 net?

On Monday night\u2019s TV footage it was being sung at a volume absolutely indistinguishable from the rest of God Save the Queen, a song it has unofficially colonised.

It has a knock-on effect with other small but influential minorities. How could it not? If you act like the big man laying down a challenge, some will take you at your word. If there is drunken aggression \u2013 as there was in Prague only last Friday \u2013 bottles thrown at the police, arrests, footage of it all on the TV news, then an always\u2011aggressive atmosphere of travelling xenophobia has been created by a small but sadly significant section of England\u2019s fanbase. Their reputation precedes them. And a local Small Minority, scarcely in need of an excuse, may consider themselves challenged.</p> \n<p>Still, other people are worse, so it doesn\u2019t matter. As long as Nazi salutes are kept out, and people don\u2019t take too close a look at some of the stuff you hear lower down the leagues, and fine, say, Millwall a whole \u00a310,000 for racist chanting during an FA Cup tie, and completely ignore the wider points Sterling continues to make about the demonisation of young black men, and so on \u2026 well, haven\u2019t we done well. We are top of the league of anti\u2011racism. Two world wars and only one banana thrown last season \u2013 print that on a flag and inform some native you\u2019re hanging it over their bar.</p>",

I don\u2019t know what that says about our society but that\u2019s the reality.\u201d Yet again, you have to salute Southgate, who always confronts the more complex aspects of a situation, however tempting it must be to ignore them when some of the worst extremes were on show. What an extraordinary leader he is, for a generation of players that inspire in so many different ways. (Very incidentally, it should always be remembered that he is in position completely by accident. All the FA people who were paid to find expensive failures \u2013 sporting and moral \u2013 to be England manager only alighted by default on the caretaker when their other terrible choices had flamed out. To say the understudy turned out to be the very best of them doesn\u2019t begin to cover it). So yes, Southgate isn\u2019t selectively blind, but many more seem to see the extreme events in Sofia as grounds for full complacency. This feels somewhat premature for a country where the prime minister has been accused on multiple occasions of using racist language, where the Windrush scandal has changed precisely nothing, and where ethnic minorities have faced significant rises in levels of abuse and discrimination since the Brexit referendum. Much has been made of the fact that in Sofia, a small section of England fans were singing \u201cWho put the ball in the racists\u2019 net? Raheem fucking Sterling!\u201d Perhaps this and the actual Nazi salutes means we don\u2019t have to talk about the fact that for a much, much larger section of England fans, \u201cNo Surrender\u201d IS now the fourth line of the national anthem, every time. The singing of \u201cNo Surrender\u201d has got louder and louder over the past few years, a full 21 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, along with \u201cfuck the pope\u201d and various other things which ought to be historical relics, but very much aren\u2019t. On Monday night\u2019s TV footage it was being sung at a volume absolutely indistinguishable from the rest of God Save the Queen, a song it has unofficially colonised. Just as bars in host cities are unofficially colonised by a section of England fans, who regard international fixtures as a sort of war-effect minibreak. Obviously, obviously, it is a small minority \u2013 though apparently, not obviously enough that you don\u2019t have to make that very clear every time you mention it in case someone not in the minority takes it upon themselves to claim needless offence. But small minorities can be influential, and the decision of England\u2019s long-notorious Small Minority to arrive in cities and literally plant their flags while singing xenophobic and sectarian songs, for the sheer toxically bonding provocation of it, is \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 not encased in a vacuum. It has a knock-on effect with other small but influential minorities. How could it not? If you act like the big man laying down a challenge, some will take you at your word. If there is drunken aggression \u2013 as there was in Prague only last Friday \u2013 bottles thrown at the police, arrests, footage of it all on the TV news, then an always\u2011aggressive atmosphere of travelling xenophobia has been created by a small but sadly significant section of England\u2019s fanbase. Their reputation precedes them. And a local Small Minority, scarcely in need of an excuse, may consider themselves challenged. Still, other people are worse, so it doesn\u2019t matter. As long as Nazi salutes are kept out, and people don\u2019t take too close a look at some of the stuff you hear lower down the leagues, and fine, say, Millwall a whole \u00a310,000 for racist chanting during an FA Cup tie, and completely ignore the wider points Sterling continues to make about the demonisation of young black men, and so on \u2026 well, haven\u2019t we done well. We are top of the league of anti\u2011racism. Two world wars and only one banana thrown last season \u2013 print that on a flag and inform some native you\u2019re hanging it over their bar.",

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies.

Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died.

With Trump\u2019s sudden decision to pull troops out, and the fast-moving events that ensued, Russia is losing no time moving in to fill the void. The Russia-Iran axis is empowered as never before, and that\u2019s been facilitated not just by Trump\u2019s recklessness and his \u201cAmerica first\u201d doctrine, but by the division, confusion and inward-looking state of all our western democracies. The resemblance with the 1930s screams out at you.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s true that Europeans are currently scrambling to cobble together sanctions against Turkey for its military onslaught against Kurdish-held lands inside Syria, but not much continental unity is on offer. Whatever pressure some capitals may muster looks unlikely to shape events.

With Trump\u2019s sellout of allies in Syria, US security guarantees to Europe as we\u2019ve known them are fast evaporating before our eyes. Trump\u2019s move has given new meaning to what we already knew about his overall disdain for Nato. Be sure that little of this will have been lost on authoritarian leaders who believe their global time has come and that all they need to do is seize opportunities and pick up the spoils of a disintegrating western-led international order. To taste a bit of that thinking, read Putin-propagandist <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/putin-russia-kremlin-vladislav-surkov-grey-cardinal-moscow-a8773661.html\" title=\"\">Vladislav Surkov\u2019s writings earlier this year</a> about Russia\u2019s role in the world as a model for nationalism and expansion based on brute force.</p> \n<p>No less daunting is the human toll \u2013 another shattering of the body of human rights conventions that Europe is meant to be one of the guardians of, but finds itself entirely powerless to salvage. Predictions are that Isis will try to regroup in the general mayhem. But already on display is how the Turkish, Syrian and Russian forces vying for control are leaving countless massacred civilians in their wake. We\u2019ve by now had ample evidence of the extremes to which state-sponsored mass atrocities can lead in this near-decade of war in Syria. If anyone still held any doubts as to their deliberate nature, documented reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/02/doctors-global-appeal-stop-syria-bombing-hospitals-idlib\" title=\"\">Russia\u2019s systematic bombing of hospitals</a> will have perhaps dispelled them once and for all.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/this-is-europe-sign-up-guardian-email-updates\">This is Europe: stay close with the Guardian\u2019s email updates</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This multilayered disaster in the Middle East will have dire consequences for European security (the terrorist threat), our domestic politics (the far right is entirely in tune with Assad and Putin, and is already gloating) and our societies at large. That\u2019s because Assad\u2019s Russia-backed victory in Syria will register as a decisive chapter in an era of fear, fragmentation and disinformation. That Brexit is playing out against this backdrop is almost a coincidental sideshow \u2013 however symbolic of the deeper trends at work. These days Europeans rightly scrutinise Spain and Catalonia, and ponder the outcome of elections in Poland and Hungary (has populism peaked, or is it still on the march?), but right now that feels narrow-minded, given the magnitude of what is unfolding not far from us.</p> \n<p>Historical analogies only go so far, but what\u2019s different now is that we\u2019re not just having to think about the domestic realities of demagoguery, xenophobia and homegrown illiberalism.

      "bodyText": "These past few days have been a watershed for Europe. I\u2019m not thinking about Brexit, but about Syria \u2013 which increasingly looks like our 21st-century Spanish civil war. Western and European defeat in Syria (by which I mean political and moral, not just military defeat) has parallels with the 1930s when democracies were unable or unwilling to stand up to authoritarians when it mattered, or even to play any kind of meaningful role in preventing a catastrophe that would soon enough engulf them, too. Events in north-eastern Syria are obviously tragic, if not lethal, for the tens of thousands of people caught up in them locally. But they will also have an impact on Europe in more ways than we perhaps care to acknowledge. Donald Trump himself has said as much, casually pointing out that Islamic State-connected foreign fighters now on the loose would make their way back to Europe. He made clear that that is a problem Europe would have to handle alone. As bad as that prospect is, it is only one part of a wider picture that should make Europeans feel desolate: at a crucial moment in history, the Russia-Iran authoritarian axis is now fully victorious on Europe\u2019s doorstep. Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces, aided by Russian and Iranian military involvement, are now pushing north to retake territory that the anti-Isis western-led coalition and its Kurdish ground troops had managed in recent years to keep out of the Syrian dictator\u2019s and his enablers\u2019 reach. With Trump\u2019s sudden decision to pull troops out, and the fast-moving events that ensued, Russia is losing no time moving in to fill the void. The Russia-Iran axis is empowered as never before, and that\u2019s been facilitated not just by Trump\u2019s recklessness and his \u201cAmerica first\u201d doctrine, but by the division, confusion and inward-looking state of all our western democracies. The resemblance with the 1930s screams out at you. It\u2019s true that Europeans are currently scrambling to cobble together sanctions against Turkey for its military onslaught against Kurdish-held lands inside Syria, but not much continental unity is on offer. Whatever pressure some capitals may muster looks unlikely to shape events. Nor do European governments seem in any position to effectively weigh on Russia as it wreaks yet more havoc in their vicinity. Essentially, Europe is the bystander in a nightmare it didn\u2019t see coming, nor had the means to avert. If you think Syria is just a distant quarrel that we Europeans can easily turn our gaze away from, think again. The 2015 refugee crisis, in which Syria\u2019s killing fields played no small role (with, at its core, a dictator\u2019s strategy of turning his army against his own country\u2019s population to hold on to power, producing mass movements of people) surely proved how badly European politics and our continent\u2019s cohesion can be affected by chaos and full-on violence in its neighbourhood. Nor is the authoritarian axis just a handful of strongmen (Vladimir Putin, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan) playing power games across a limited geopolitical chessboard. The victory they are in the process of clinching sends a much larger message about how fast an entire world system can come undone \u2013 a world in which Europeans could still hope that some principles, such as a basic observance of alliances, might still bear a degree of importance. It may not be too soon to draw a few lessons from what\u2019s unfolding. With Trump\u2019s sellout of allies in Syria, US security guarantees to Europe as we\u2019ve known them are fast evaporating before our eyes. Trump\u2019s move has given new meaning to what we already knew about his overall disdain for Nato. Be sure that little of this will have been lost on authoritarian leaders who believe their global time has come and that all they need to do is seize opportunities and pick up the spoils of a disintegrating western-led international order. To taste a bit of that thinking, read Putin-propagandist Vladislav Surkov\u2019s writings earlier this year about Russia\u2019s role in the world as a model for nationalism and expansion based on brute force. No less daunting is the human toll \u2013 another shattering of the body of human rights conventions that Europe is meant to be one of the guardians of, but finds itself entirely powerless to salvage. Predictions are that Isis will try to regroup in the general mayhem. But already on display is how the Turkish, Syrian and Russian forces vying for control are leaving countless massacred civilians in their wake. We\u2019ve by now had ample evidence of the extremes to which state-sponsored mass atrocities can lead in this near-decade of war in Syria. If anyone still held any doubts as to their deliberate nature, documented reports of Russia\u2019s systematic bombing of hospitals will have perhaps dispelled them once and for all. This multilayered disaster in the Middle East will have dire consequences for European security (the terrorist threat), our domestic politics (the far right is entirely in tune with Assad and Putin, and is already gloating) and our societies at large. That\u2019s because Assad\u2019s Russia-backed victory in Syria will register as a decisive chapter in an era of fear, fragmentation and disinformation. That Brexit is playing out against this backdrop is almost a coincidental sideshow \u2013 however symbolic of the deeper trends at work. These days Europeans rightly scrutinise Spain and Catalonia, and ponder the outcome of elections in Poland and Hungary (has populism peaked, or is it still on the march?), but right now that feels narrow-minded, given the magnitude of what is unfolding not far from us. Historical analogies only go so far, but what\u2019s different now is that we\u2019re not just having to think about the domestic realities of demagoguery, xenophobia and homegrown illiberalism. We in Europe have to break out of our navel-gazing and see the bigger picture: what\u2019s happening is no less than an ideological battle between democracy and authoritarianism in which our fate is intimately connected to those who find themselves in the crosshairs of Syria\u2019s tragedy. In that sense, Syria is indeed the Spanish civil war of our times. Just as it was in the 1930s when totalitarianism was on the rise, it would be delusional to think that what we\u2019ve done and haven\u2019t done about it won\u2019t come back to haunt us. \u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de is a Guardian columnist and leader writer",

The next-generation suits were made for the Artemis programme, which aims to land the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024. Speaking at Nasa\u2019s headquarters, the administrator, Jim Bridenstine, and spacesuit engineers presented the first closeup look at the suits. A bulky, mostly white prototype with blue and red arms was demonstrated by Kristine Davis, a spacesuit engineer at the Johnson Space Center. The garment, known as the exploration extravehicular mobility unit (xEMU), is designed for exploring the lunar surface, specifically the south pole \u2013 the target for Nasa\u2019s next crewed lunar landing. \u201cKristine is wearing a spacesuit that will fit all of our astronauts when we go to the moon,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cThese are our spacesuits for the Artemis generation.\u201d The suit is more flexible than previous generation suits, allowing astronauts to squat to pick up rocks and move more easily.

      "bodyText": "The extremely welcome announcement last month that dual Grand National winner Tiger Roll is on target to try and win an unprecedented third straight win in the world\u2019s most famous race next April ensures racing will potentially have its biggest single day in living memory, one that may stand comparison with the spring afternoon over 40 years ago when Red Rum completed his hat-trick of victories. The unequivocal statement from the horse\u2019s trainer, Gordon Elliott, put paid to concerns that the horse would duck the challenge, which had been prompted by comments from Tiger Roll\u2019s owner Michael O\u2019Leary and his brother Eddie, the Gigginstown Stud racing manager. The O\u2019Learys warned the National hero may not be risked and, further, that he may not line up unless shown leniency by the race\u2019s weights compiler, who can, for this one race in the jumps season, adjust what the top-weighted runners have to carry in relation to others in the 40-strong field. Tinkering with the National weights was introduced by the previous chief handicapper Phil Smith but the practice has been used less in recent years after the adjustments to the fences over the years and which, from 2013, have radically altered the Aintree spectacle. Indeed, the respected ratings organisation Timeform categorically state in their new \u2018Chasers &amp; Hurdlers\u2019 annual, out this week, that comparisons between Tiger Roll and Red Rum are \u201cnot useful\u201d because the \u201cfences are a far cry from those of yesteryear\u201d, repeating their well-rehearsed argument that since 2013 the National has taken on the defining aspects of other conventional long-distance staying chases. This year\u2019s Aintree meeting still featured three deaths, including Up For Review at the first fence in this year\u2019s National, and, featured, as Timeform point out, \u201ca particularly grim sight for ITV viewers as Forest Des Aigles suffered an untreatable fracture approaching the final fence in the Topham Trophy\u201d. Horse welfare has become an increasingly hot topic and is the burning issue that takes up the bulk of the annual\u2019s introduction and a number of Timeform\u2019s traditionally long essays on the leading combatants in the latest jumps season. Timeform urge the British Horseracing Authority to be more pro-active on the issue. Equine welfare is the BHA\u2019s main priority and an industry-wide welfare strategy is expected by the year end with the way racing\u2019s welfare standards are communicated a key part of the planned report. Racehorse fatalities for 2018 were the highest for four years but, as Timeform point out, the \u201cfatality rates are extremely low \u2026 and hardly warranted the headlines and attendant bad publicity generated by the BHA\u2019s press release which should have given more emphasis to put the increase into some kind of perspective\u201d. The long-term trend, they point out, has seen fatality rates fall to the current five-year average of 0.2%. \u201cThe BHA pledged to \u2018stay ahead of public opinion\u2019 in the wake of the latest increase, chief executive Nick Rust being acutely aware of the power of social media,\u201d state Timeform, who conclude: \u201cIf the BHA feels and acts as if public opinion is snapping at its heels, it runs the risk of being chased into a corner form which it cannot escape.

It comes one month after Volkswagen settled a class action for between $87m and $127m with owners of some of the 100,000 cars that were affected by the emissions test cheating and subsequent global recall in Australia. Volkswagen has been fined more than \u20ac30bn ($49bn) worldwide since the scandal first came to light in 2015. This month, a class action with 470,000 owners of Volkswagen, Skoda, Audi and Seat began in Germany. The ACCC has been pursuing Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft (VWAG) and its Australian subsidiary Volkswagen Group Australia through the courts since 2016 over \u201cfalse or misleading conduct\u201d involving the use of software which prompted diesel vehicles to produce lower-emissions fuels under test conditions. About 11 million cars worldwide were sold as producing significantly lower emissions than they did under normal driving conditions. Related proceedings against Audi AG and Audi Australia, subsidiaries of VWAG, were filed by the ACCC in 2017. Volkswagen made no admissions in the agreed facts with regard to environmental or health impacts caused by higher emissions, and no admissions regarding the knowledge of its board. It accepted the $75m penalty, which is three times higher than the record $26.5m penalty in an ACCC case levied against training college Empower Institute last month. But federal court justice Lindsay Foster rejected the statement, saying, according to a report in the Australian Financial Review: \u201cI don\u2019t accept the submission, it\u2019s outrageous.\u201d Foster questioned the imputation that the top layers of the corporation would not have known about the emissions software. The ACCC declined to comment on the hearing beyond confirming it had submitted a statement of agreed facts and proposed orders to the federal court. \u201cThe proposed orders include a penalty of $75m but it is ultimately for the court to decide the appropriateness of the penalty,\u201d a spokeswoman said.

      "body": "<h2>1) New Zealand</h2> <p>Normal service has been resumed. After the surreal scenes of the All Blacks not being No 1 (Wales were, then Ireland!) they enter the quarter\u2011finals back at the top of the rankings, rated by the bookies as twice as likely to win the tournament as the second favourites. Don\u2019t be so sure. It goes without saying they remain the best when on form, but that cancelled game might well be more of a hindrance to them than anyone, given that their last meaningful fixture will have been four weeks before their quarter\u2011final against Ireland. At least Italy would have been semi-meaningful. These All Blacks are not invincible at the best of times. <strong>Current world ranking: 1</strong></p> <h2>2) England</h2> <p>The same concerns apply to England. Nobody should be under any illusion that the cancelled game will help them. Their draw had been perfect, a series of Tests neatly escalating in difficulty. But when the fourth rung was removed, quite a leap was created to a quarter-final with Australia. Otherwise, England are in good shape. Defence remains a big question-mark, but defence is so 2007. Only Wales seem to bother with it these days. In attack, England are as threatening as anyone. Off-the-cuff counterattacking remains the speciality of the All Blacks, but England have developed a variety of ways to undo defences, including at the start of games when everyone is fresh and there are no excuses. <strong>Current world ranking: 3</strong></p> <h2>3) South Africa</h2> <p>In these curious times in which New Zealand are not necessarily miles ahead, a lot of people \u2013 uncomfortable with the idea of Wales, Ireland or, God forbid, England as likely candidates \u2013 have ventured South Africa as their tip. They won the Rugby Championship this year, after all (although no team has ever won that and the World Cup in the same year). They certainly boast as formidable a tight five as any, a pleasing blend of spark and ice at half-back, and Cheslin Kolbe. Oh, Cheslin Kolbe. Defensively, though, the 2007 vintage this is not. <strong>Current world ranking: 5</strong></p> <h2>4) Wales</h2> <p>Which brings us to the defensive masters. We have long been told that defences win these competitions \u2014 in which case, hand the gong to Wales now. There is a sense, though, that things have changed. Wales have embarked on quite the campaign of late, gathering a grand slam, a record winning run and the kudos of being No 1 in the world \u2014 and they\u2019ve done it with scarcely a whiff of the sort of try to quicken the pulses back home. They\u2019ve done it with scarcely a try full stop, registering 10 of them in that grand-slam campaign \u2013 the same as Italy. But they\u2019re still here, they\u2019re still winning. <strong>Current world ranking: 2</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"899c810fbdbbfbb928ae8c7880ffe813f2071090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/899c810fbdbbfbb928ae8c7880ffe813f2071090/0_82_2820_1692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wales\u2019 centre Owen Watkin dodges a tackle by Uruguay prop Mateo Sanguinetti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wales\u2019 centre Owen Watkin dodges a tackle by Uruguay prop Mateo Sanguinetti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) Japan</h2> <p>Japan, meanwhile, are doing so much more than win rugby matches. They are dismantling all received wisdom about how this game should be played and by whom. The hateful notion of tiers one, two and three has been exploded. As successive members of the old guard are dispatched, what should really terrify rugby\u2019s establishment is that this team hail from a country of 125 million whose economy is the third largest in the world. If rugby can bite even modestly into Japan\u2019s national consciousness, everything changes. A new centre of gravity could emerge to rival the current black hole that is England and France. America next. <strong>Current world ranking: 7</strong></p> <h2>6) Ireland</h2> <p>The world rankings have received a lot of ridicule of late, never more so than when Ireland attained top spot on the eve of this competition, despite a string of recent indignities to embarrass 2018\u2019s grand slam winners. The truth is, though, the rankings are very tight now with no one having to do much to top them \u2013 and that feels about right. Here Ireland are, sixth on our list (fourth on World Rugby\u2019s), but they are genuinely capable of winning this thing, given a realistic upturn in form. Rugby has never had so much competition among its top teams. <strong>Current world ranking: 4</strong></p> <h2>7) Australia</h2> <p>And here we have Australia, World Cup finalists last time and twice champions. They too, it should not be particularly contentious to assert, are capable of winning this with a run of form. There is something by-the-seat-of-the-pants about this lot, but they will be relishing a crack at England, who seem so highly regarded after their humiliation by this side four years ago. Barely a few weeks ago Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/10/against-all-odds-wallabies-restore-pride-against-all-blacks\" title=\"\">put nearly 50</a> on none other than the All Blacks. They are a long way from favourites, but an Australian triumph cannot be ruled out either. <strong>Current world ranking: 6</strong></p> <h2>8) France</h2> <p>Dare we say the same of France? No, we dare not say anything about the French. This vintage is no different from any other \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/08/france-players-told-to-kick-coaches-out-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">mutiny in the air</a>, players sent home under suspicious circumstances, captains dropped, games won and nearly lost, chaos all round. And yet our eighth-ranked team are thrice finalists. Some of the rugby they have played has been devastating \u2013 and not just to themselves. They will look on Wales in the quarter-finals and shrug. Win there, and neither Japan nor South Africa would quite daunt them. They will not win the tournament, surely \u2026 but, well, you get the drift. They <em>could</em>. <strong>Current world ranking: 8</strong></p> <h2>9) Scotland</h2> <p>A sobering few days, but let\u2019s be clear: no team in the top 10 would have reacted any differently to the prospect of elimination without playing. They would sit comfortably in this top eight, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/22/rugby-world-cup-ireland-scotland-match-report\" title=\"\">that no-show against Ireland</a> will, and should, haunt them. <strong>Current world ranking: 9</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a77bdf9e9e5a6e1b06873bf9d3c4fa2b4d9a4a48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a77bdf9e9e5a6e1b06873bf9d3c4fa2b4d9a4a48/0_261_5349_3209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Harrisescapes the attentions of Japan\u2019s Ryohei Yamanaka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Harris escapes the attentions of Japan\u2019s Ryohei Yamanaka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10) Fiji</h2> <p>Fiji too would be worthy quarter\u2011finalists. They have produced an astonishing array of attacking talents \u2014 and that\u2019s not counting all those they\u2019ve supplied to other countries. Wins against Australia or Wales would not have flattered them. Defeat by Uruguay is borderline unfathomable. <strong>Current world ranking: 11</strong></p> <h2>11) Argentina</h2> <p>Semi-finalists last time out, and here they are in 11th. This business of fielding the same team at international level as domestic isn\u2019t working. They could have picked some overseas players but with what message to those who stay at home? A dilemma. <strong>Current world ranking: 10</strong></p> <h2>12) Tonga</h2> <p>Better and better with each game \u2013 oh, what would a level playing field do for these Island teams? They finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-tonga-usa-match-report\" title=\"\">clinched that win against USA</a>, after a whisker away against France. There are 110,000 people in Tonga. That\u2019s the population of Chesterfield. <strong>Current world ranking: 13</strong></p> <h2>13) Georgia</h2> <p>Europe\u2019s answer to the Pacific Islanders, but a natural affinity for the muscular gets them only so far without the flair. Still, the same questions apply: what might they become with regular exposure? There\u2019s no sign of any solution to that conundrum. <strong>Current world ranking: 14</strong></p> <h2>14) Uruguay</h2> <p>Authors of the second biggest upset in World Cup history. Uruguay\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/25/uruguay-shock-fiji-to-pull-off-historic-victory-in-classic-encounter\" title=\"\">overturning of a 30-point handicap</a> with the bookies against Fiji is second only to Japan\u2019s 42-point handicap against South Africa four years ago. Against Wales, they flirted for a while with equalling the latter upset. Incredible. <strong>Current world ranking: 18</strong></p> <h2>15) Italy</h2> <p>No scope for them to progress or regress. Isolated in the middle of their pool, way below the top two, way above the bottom, third was all they were ever going to get, even with a bonus two points against the All Blacks. <strong>Current world ranking: 12</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d33f3cc47110ecc4b6171f03078e8e7b9a6427a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d33f3cc47110ecc4b6171f03078e8e7b9a6427a/0_75_2230_1338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sergio Parisse and Jayden Hayward challenge Willie Le Roux in Fukuroi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sergio Parisse and Jayden Hayward challenge Willie Le Roux in Fukuroi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark R Cristino/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>16) USA</h2> <p>Disappointing. Partly because expectations were high. USA had been rising steadily through the teens in those rankings, but they were flat in their opener against England and never quite discovered themselves.

      "bodyText": "1) New Zealand Normal service has been resumed. After the surreal scenes of the All Blacks not being No 1 (Wales were, then Ireland!) they enter the quarter\u2011finals back at the top of the rankings, rated by the bookies as twice as likely to win the tournament as the second favourites. Don\u2019t be so sure. It goes without saying they remain the best when on form, but that cancelled game might well be more of a hindrance to them than anyone, given that their last meaningful fixture will have been four weeks before their quarter\u2011final against Ireland. At least Italy would have been semi-meaningful. These All Blacks are not invincible at the best of times. Current world ranking: 1 2) England The same concerns apply to England. Nobody should be under any illusion that the cancelled game will help them. Their draw had been perfect, a series of Tests neatly escalating in difficulty. But when the fourth rung was removed, quite a leap was created to a quarter-final with Australia. Otherwise, England are in good shape. Defence remains a big question-mark, but defence is so 2007. Only Wales seem to bother with it these days. In attack, England are as threatening as anyone. Off-the-cuff counterattacking remains the speciality of the All Blacks, but England have developed a variety of ways to undo defences, including at the start of games when everyone is fresh and there are no excuses. Current world ranking: 3 3) South Africa In these curious times in which New Zealand are not necessarily miles ahead, a lot of people \u2013 uncomfortable with the idea of Wales, Ireland or, God forbid, England as likely candidates \u2013 have ventured South Africa as their tip. They won the Rugby Championship this year, after all (although no team has ever won that and the World Cup in the same year). They certainly boast as formidable a tight five as any, a pleasing blend of spark and ice at half-back, and Cheslin Kolbe. Oh, Cheslin Kolbe. Defensively, though, the 2007 vintage this is not. Current world ranking: 5 4) Wales Which brings us to the defensive masters. We have long been told that defences win these competitions \u2014 in which case, hand the gong to Wales now. There is a sense, though, that things have changed. Wales have embarked on quite the campaign of late, gathering a grand slam, a record winning run and the kudos of being No 1 in the world \u2014 and they\u2019ve done it with scarcely a whiff of the sort of try to quicken the pulses back home. They\u2019ve done it with scarcely a try full stop, registering 10 of them in that grand-slam campaign \u2013 the same as Italy. But they\u2019re still here, they\u2019re still winning. Current world ranking: 2 5) Japan Japan, meanwhile, are doing so much more than win rugby matches. They are dismantling all received wisdom about how this game should be played and by whom. The hateful notion of tiers one, two and three has been exploded. As successive members of the old guard are dispatched, what should really terrify rugby\u2019s establishment is that this team hail from a country of 125 million whose economy is the third largest in the world. If rugby can bite even modestly into Japan\u2019s national consciousness, everything changes. A new centre of gravity could emerge to rival the current black hole that is England and France. America next. Current world ranking: 7 6) Ireland The world rankings have received a lot of ridicule of late, never more so than when Ireland attained top spot on the eve of this competition, despite a string of recent indignities to embarrass 2018\u2019s grand slam winners. The truth is, though, the rankings are very tight now with no one having to do much to top them \u2013 and that feels about right. Here Ireland are, sixth on our list (fourth on World Rugby\u2019s), but they are genuinely capable of winning this thing, given a realistic upturn in form. Rugby has never had so much competition among its top teams. Current world ranking: 4 7) Australia And here we have Australia, World Cup finalists last time and twice champions. They too, it should not be particularly contentious to assert, are capable of winning this with a run of form. There is something by-the-seat-of-the-pants about this lot, but they will be relishing a crack at England, who seem so highly regarded after their humiliation by this side four years ago. Barely a few weeks ago Australia put nearly 50 on none other than the All Blacks. They are a long way from favourites, but an Australian triumph cannot be ruled out either. Current world ranking: 6 8) France Dare we say the same of France? No, we dare not say anything about the French. This vintage is no different from any other \u2013 mutiny in the air, players sent home under suspicious circumstances, captains dropped, games won and nearly lost, chaos all round. And yet our eighth-ranked team are thrice finalists. Some of the rugby they have played has been devastating \u2013 and not just to themselves. They will look on Wales in the quarter-finals and shrug. Win there, and neither Japan nor South Africa would quite daunt them. They will not win the tournament, surely \u2026 but, well, you get the drift. They could. Current world ranking: 8 9) Scotland A sobering few days, but let\u2019s be clear: no team in the top 10 would have reacted any differently to the prospect of elimination without playing. They would sit comfortably in this top eight, but that no-show against Ireland will, and should, haunt them. Current world ranking: 9 10) Fiji Fiji too would be worthy quarter\u2011finalists. They have produced an astonishing array of attacking talents \u2014 and that\u2019s not counting all those they\u2019ve supplied to other countries. Wins against Australia or Wales would not have flattered them. Defeat by Uruguay is borderline unfathomable. Current world ranking: 11 11) Argentina Semi-finalists last time out, and here they are in 11th. This business of fielding the same team at international level as domestic isn\u2019t working. They could have picked some overseas players but with what message to those who stay at home? A dilemma. Current world ranking: 10 12) Tonga Better and better with each game \u2013 oh, what would a level playing field do for these Island teams? They finally clinched that win against USA, after a whisker away against France. There are 110,000 people in Tonga. That\u2019s the population of Chesterfield. Current world ranking: 13 13) Georgia Europe\u2019s answer to the Pacific Islanders, but a natural affinity for the muscular gets them only so far without the flair. Still, the same questions apply: what might they become with regular exposure? There\u2019s no sign of any solution to that conundrum. Current world ranking: 14 14) Uruguay Authors of the second biggest upset in World Cup history. Uruguay\u2019s overturning of a 30-point handicap with the bookies against Fiji is second only to Japan\u2019s 42-point handicap against South Africa four years ago. Against Wales, they flirted for a while with equalling the latter upset. Incredible. Current world ranking: 18 15) Italy No scope for them to progress or regress. Isolated in the middle of their pool, way below the top two, way above the bottom, third was all they were ever going to get, even with a bonus two points against the All Blacks. Current world ranking: 12 16) USA Disappointing. Partly because expectations were high. USA had been rising steadily through the teens in those rankings, but they were flat in their opener against England and never quite discovered themselves. A Japan-USA final in 2043, anyone? Current world ranking: 17 17) Samoa They will always, along with Fiji and Tonga, hold the moral high ground, such are the gifts they have bestowed on a rugby world that gives so little in return. Alas, here they gave their fair share of gifts to the opposition too. Current world ranking: 15 18) Russia They snuck in through the back door and found themselves opening the tournament against the hosts in Tokyo. Won a lot of friends with a feisty display in defeat, including the tournament\u2019s opening try, but that was it for them and tries. Current world ranking: 20 19) Namibia At one point their very participation was in doubt, World Rugby concerned about the integrity of Namibia\u2019s governing body. No doubting that of Phil Davies and his happy band. They troubled teams rated far higher. A great shame their final game against Canada was cancelled. Current world ranking: 23 20) Canada The decline of Canada is one of World Rugby\u2019s more perplexing dilemmas. The former quarter-finalists should not have fallen so low. Much hope is invested in America\u2019s new domestic league and this will hopefully help revive them, but too soon for this World Cup. Current world ranking: 22",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s not easy to be a happy environmentalist, but Rob Hopkins might have found a way. In 2005, together with a group of friends in Totnes, Devon, he co-founded what became known as the Transition movement. It seeks to make the world a sustainable place to live, not through protest or resistance, but simply by looking at where you live and making it sustainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult, actually,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In Totnes, they connected neighbours to share unused gardens. They planted fruit and nut trees in public spaces and bought their own mill. They are now building 27 sustainable homes. And Totnes is just one of the 992 initiatives all over the world that now make up the movement.</p> <p>In his new book, From What Is to What If, Hopkins looks around this wide network, and elsewhere, at the sometimes brilliant, sometimes eccentric, but always imaginative ideas people have come up with. Sometimes Hopkins can be <em>too</em> imaginative \u2013 for instance his summaries of psychology, education and brain science seem wishfully simplistic. In person, however, he is not dogmatic or excitable. Tall and bespectacled, he speaks softly and kindly. Besides, in the most important ways, he is right. We <em>can</em> feel optimistic if we are willing to imagine new ways of doing things not every single one of them needs to work. \u201cPart of the beauty of Transition,\u201d Hopkins writes, \u201cis that it\u2019s all an experiment. I don\u2019t know how to do it. Neither do you.\u201d</p> <p>Here are some of the projects he champions.</p> <h2><strong>Make your own pop-up village green</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7927737859bc456030f8f544025ea1df4c93db27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7927737859bc456030f8f544025ea1df4c93db27/0_27_1564_1016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Transition Town Tooting in action.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transition Town Tooting\u2019s food festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryony Williams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The south London suburb of Tooting has many fine qualities, but it is not an area of outstanding natural beauty. Nor does it have an obvious central square for public events in the summer. So one Sunday in July 2017, with \u00a31,743 raised by crowdfunding, a group of local people took stalls, turf and flowers to the bus turning circle on Tooting Broadway and made it their village green for the day. They called the event the <a href=\"http://transitiontowntooting.blogspot.com/2017/07/all-welcome-at-tooting-twirl-this.html\" title=\"\">Tooting Twirl</a>.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"http://transitiontowntooting.blogspot.com\" title=\"\">Transition Town Tooting</a> is a particularly imaginative group,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cVery artistic and playful.\u201d Before the Twirl, they staged the <a href=\"http://www.swlondoner.co.uk/wheely-good-fun-unconventional-tour-de-tooting-cycle-gearing-across-sw17-promoting-green-living/\" title=\"\">Tour de Tooting</a> in 2016, a parade of home-decorated bicycles. They also run a community garden, a repair cafe and the annual Foodival, where people contribute locally grown produce, which a group of chefs from Tooting\u2019s restaurants turn into a variety of dishes, served up the following day at a public feast.</p> <h2><strong>Turn your road into a playground</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a903613f119c82d7865195990925a28e340c48fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a903613f119c82d7865195990925a28e340c48fb/0_218_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freedom of the street ...

Bristol\u2019s Playing Out project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Turner/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hopkins makes some tenuous claims about brain development to justify letting children play in the street when one ordinary fact would do: they clearly love it. And thanks to the work of a community interest company called <a href=\"https://playingout.net/about/what-is-playing-out/\" title=\"\">Playing Out</a>, street play is now quite easy to realise, especially in Bristol, where the council has designed a simple process allowing residents to apply to close their road to traffic for short periods.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to have two parents with hi-vis jackets and you have to let everyone on the street know,\u201d Hopkins says. And that\u2019s about it. Organisers often provide a few boxes of chalk or balls or bits of string. Then, given the freedom of the street, the children do the rest. Meanwhile, everyone apart from the two supervisors gets free babysitting. Some neighbours like the chalk to be cleaned away afterwards, but it\u2019s not generally a divisive event. It can be quite convivial, in fact. Perhaps more than anything else in the book, it\u2019s something you could quite easily start tomorrow.</p> <h2><strong>Tune back into nature</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca58368f5d48adc7065a078a2323504cbe2ea34d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca58368f5d48adc7065a078a2323504cbe2ea34d/0_0_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Dawn chorus (in the rain), at Norfolk Wildlife Trust\u2019s Foxley Wood reserve, Norfolk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getting up and out for the dawn chorus is a great way to reconnect with nature.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy not to hear the birdsong that surrounds us, even in cities; but Hopkins believes that with a little practice you can learn to notice it again and enjoy life a little more as a result. From the fanzine <a href=\"https://www.caughtbytheriver.net/\" title=\"\">Caught by the River</a>, he found out about people who seek out the experience and decided to join them for <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/dawn-chorus-day\" title=\"\">Dawn Chorus Day</a> in May last year. It wasn\u2019t the easiest decision, because it meant getting out of bed at 4am.</p> <p>Dawn Chorus Day began in Birmingham at some mistily remembered moment in the 1980s, and has since been held on the first Sunday in May each year. \u201cI thought: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to get up early and listen to some birds,\u201d Hopkins says. It wasn\u2019t the easiest decision, because it meant getting out of bed at 4am. \u201cBut actually it was magical. It was like going to the Royal Philharmonic.\u201d For a long time afterwards, he noticed birdsong more keenly, wherever he was. \u201cIt really brought me back into the world so much more than I was before \u2026 I do it once a year now and it kind of lasts me through.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Play!</strong></h2> <p>When a Transition group wants to imagine the future of its community, Hopkins recommends not holding a meeting, exactly, but playing a game. Called <a href=\"https://www.robhopkins.net/\" title=\"\">Transition Town Anywhere</a>, it was devised for the Transition network conference, and involves building a model of the town you want from spare boxes and other odds and ends.</p> <p>\u201cOur cardboard-and-string shops, banks, doctors\u2019 surgeries and bike repair workshops took on a reality,\u201d Hopkins says in the book, \u201cand that reality assumed a deep significance. People were proud of what they had created.\u201d Today, some of them have reason to be even prouder. When they first played Transition Town Anywhere, Hopkins and his group devised the Yeast Collective, a combined bakery and brewery. \u201cAs I write this,\u201d he says, \u201cthe brewery has been up and running for five years, and is shortly to move into a shared space with an amazing sourdough bakery.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Give prisoners something meaningful to do</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee78208ba4f7261b666dd50d5fd9c55c6d30b7d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee78208ba4f7261b666dd50d5fd9c55c6d30b7d9/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sense of purpose ... prisoners learn new skills at the Landworks project in Devon.

Hopkins visited <a href=\"https://www.landworks.org.uk\" title=\"\">LandWorks</a>, another Devon charity, which operates a market garden for offenders and potential offenders on a two-acre patch of land in a former quarry. The project\u2019s \u201ctrainees\u201d, as they are called, spend six-months developing skills in growing, landscaping, pottery, woodwork, construction and design, and cook and eat together.</p> <p>The project gives prisoners a sense of purpose and belonging. LandWorks claims its reoffending rate is just 4%, far lower than the <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/government/collections/proven-reoffending-statistics\">UK national average of 29.3%</a>. The charity\u2019s approach could easily be copied just about anywhere. When Hopkins visited, one of the staff told him that a few days previously he had seen a couple parked in a car outside the site. The staff member asked if he could help them. \u201cThe guy said: \u2018I came here four years ago. I was just showing my girlfriend.\u2019 It had been such a profound shift for him.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Turn your city into a park</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b374c009872356611e903fed0324e75ef576a324\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b374c009872356611e903fed0324e75ef576a324/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thames path, Putney ... almost half of London is green and blue space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thames path, Putney ... almost half of London is green and blue space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most beautiful \u2018what if\u2019 questions,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhat if London was a national park?\u201d And as you may have heard, <a href=\"http://www.nationalparkcity.london\" title=\"\">this actually happened in July</a>, when the mayor of London, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/futurelondon/cleanair/london-worlds-first-national-park-city-a4195376.html\" title=\"\">Sadiq Khan</a>, signed the charter to declare it the world\u2019s first \u201cNational Park City\u201d. To some extent, this is just a branding exercise, intended to encourage people to protect and enjoy the capital\u2019s green spaces. In another sense, the way people see the city is the most important thing of all.</p> <p>The vision came from Daniel Raven-Ellison, a geography teacher and devoted walker, who calculated that 49.5% of London was already green and blue space. Besides organising a free <a href=\"http://www.nationalparkcity.london\" title=\"\">National Park City festival</a>, it is now \u201cthe mayor\u2019s ambition\u201d to reach at least 50% and to \u201cincrease tree canopy cover by 10%\u201d by 2050. If it becomes normal to see this giant city as a natural environment as much as a built one, that will be the biggest change of all. \u201cIt\u2019s an overarching narrative that opens up so many possibilities,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cI love it. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Make your own museum</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24f126b86d1da0c7332ed5f4fc6d2fec18644fd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24f126b86d1da0c7332ed5f4fc6d2fec18644fd5/0_143_3957_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derby\u2019s old silk mill, which is being relaunched as the Museum of Making.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derby\u2019s old silk mill, which is being relaunched as the Museum of Making.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A-Plus Image Bank/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The old silk mill in Derby, built by <a href=\"http://www.derwentvalleymills.org/derwent-valley-mills-history/derwent-valley-mills-key-figures/key-figures-thomas-john-henry-lombe/\" title=\"\">the Lombe brothers</a> in the 1720s, was arguably the first factory in the world. In 1974, it became the Derby Industrial Museum, but by the 2010s it needed a fresh start. The project was entrusted to Hannah Fox, whose brief, says Hopkins, was: \u201cHere\u2019s the keys and a very small budget.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not easy to be a happy environmentalist, but Rob Hopkins might have found a way. In 2005, together with a group of friends in Totnes, Devon, he co-founded what became known as the Transition movement. It seeks to make the world a sustainable place to live, not through protest or resistance, but simply by looking at where you live and making it sustainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult, actually,\u201d he says. In Totnes, they connected neighbours to share unused gardens. They planted fruit and nut trees in public spaces and bought their own mill. They are now building 27 sustainable homes. And Totnes is just one of the 992 initiatives all over the world that now make up the movement. In his new book, From What Is to What If, Hopkins looks around this wide network, and elsewhere, at the sometimes brilliant, sometimes eccentric, but always imaginative ideas people have come up with. Sometimes Hopkins can be too imaginative \u2013 for instance his summaries of psychology, education and brain science seem wishfully simplistic. In person, however, he is not dogmatic or excitable. Tall and bespectacled, he speaks softly and kindly. Besides, in the most important ways, he is right. We can feel optimistic if we are willing to imagine new ways of doing things not every single one of them needs to work. \u201cPart of the beauty of Transition,\u201d Hopkins writes, \u201cis that it\u2019s all an experiment. I don\u2019t know how to do it. Neither do you.\u201d Here are some of the projects he champions. Make your own pop-up village green The south London suburb of Tooting has many fine qualities, but it is not an area of outstanding natural beauty. Nor does it have an obvious central square for public events in the summer. So one Sunday in July 2017, with \u00a31,743 raised by crowdfunding, a group of local people took stalls, turf and flowers to the bus turning circle on Tooting Broadway and made it their village green for the day. They called the event the Tooting Twirl. \u201cTransition Town Tooting is a particularly imaginative group,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cVery artistic and playful.\u201d Before the Twirl, they staged the Tour de Tooting in 2016, a parade of home-decorated bicycles. They also run a community garden, a repair cafe and the annual Foodival, where people contribute locally grown produce, which a group of chefs from Tooting\u2019s restaurants turn into a variety of dishes, served up the following day at a public feast. Turn your road into a playground Hopkins makes some tenuous claims about brain development to justify letting children play in the street when one ordinary fact would do: they clearly love it. And thanks to the work of a community interest company called Playing Out, street play is now quite easy to realise, especially in Bristol, where the council has designed a simple process allowing residents to apply to close their road to traffic for short periods. \u201cYou need to have two parents with hi-vis jackets and you have to let everyone on the street know,\u201d Hopkins says. And that\u2019s about it. Organisers often provide a few boxes of chalk or balls or bits of string. Then, given the freedom of the street, the children do the rest. Meanwhile, everyone apart from the two supervisors gets free babysitting. Some neighbours like the chalk to be cleaned away afterwards, but it\u2019s not generally a divisive event. It can be quite convivial, in fact. Perhaps more than anything else in the book, it\u2019s something you could quite easily start tomorrow. Tune back into nature It\u2019s easy not to hear the birdsong that surrounds us, even in cities; but Hopkins believes that with a little practice you can learn to notice it again and enjoy life a little more as a result. From the fanzine Caught by the River, he found out about people who seek out the experience and decided to join them for Dawn Chorus Day in May last year. It wasn\u2019t the easiest decision, because it meant getting out of bed at 4am. Dawn Chorus Day began in Birmingham at some mistily remembered moment in the 1980s, and has since been held on the first Sunday in May each year. \u201cI thought: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to get up early and listen to some birds,\u201d Hopkins says. It wasn\u2019t the easiest decision, because it meant getting out of bed at 4am. \u201cBut actually it was magical. It was like going to the Royal Philharmonic.\u201d For a long time afterwards, he noticed birdsong more keenly, wherever he was. \u201cIt really brought me back into the world so much more than I was before \u2026 I do it once a year now and it kind of lasts me through.\u201d Play! When a Transition group wants to imagine the future of its community, Hopkins recommends not holding a meeting, exactly, but playing a game. Called Transition Town Anywhere, it was devised for the Transition network conference, and involves building a model of the town you want from spare boxes and other odds and ends. \u201cOur cardboard-and-string shops, banks, doctors\u2019 surgeries and bike repair workshops took on a reality,\u201d Hopkins says in the book, \u201cand that reality assumed a deep significance. People were proud of what they had created.\u201d Today, some of them have reason to be even prouder. When they first played Transition Town Anywhere, Hopkins and his group devised the Yeast Collective, a combined bakery and brewery. \u201cAs I write this,\u201d he says, \u201cthe brewery has been up and running for five years, and is shortly to move into a shared space with an amazing sourdough bakery.\u201d Give prisoners something meaningful to do One of the biggest problems for people in prison, or at risk of going to prison, is finding something \u2013 besides crime \u2013 to do. Hopkins visited LandWorks, another Devon charity, which operates a market garden for offenders and potential offenders on a two-acre patch of land in a former quarry. The project\u2019s \u201ctrainees\u201d, as they are called, spend six-months developing skills in growing, landscaping, pottery, woodwork, construction and design, and cook and eat together. The project gives prisoners a sense of purpose and belonging. LandWorks claims its reoffending rate is just 4%, far lower than the UK national average of 29.3%. The charity\u2019s approach could easily be copied just about anywhere. When Hopkins visited, one of the staff told him that a few days previously he had seen a couple parked in a car outside the site. The staff member asked if he could help them. \u201cThe guy said: \u2018I came here four years ago. I was just showing my girlfriend.\u2019 It had been such a profound shift for him.\u201d Turn your city into a park \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most beautiful \u2018what if\u2019 questions,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhat if London was a national park?\u201d And as you may have heard, this actually happened in July, when the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, signed the charter to declare it the world\u2019s first \u201cNational Park City\u201d. To some extent, this is just a branding exercise, intended to encourage people to protect and enjoy the capital\u2019s green spaces. In another sense, the way people see the city is the most important thing of all. The vision came from Daniel Raven-Ellison, a geography teacher and devoted walker, who calculated that 49.5% of London was already green and blue space. Besides organising a free National Park City festival, it is now \u201cthe mayor\u2019s ambition\u201d to reach at least 50% and to \u201cincrease tree canopy cover by 10%\u201d by 2050. If it becomes normal to see this giant city as a natural environment as much as a built one, that will be the biggest change of all. \u201cIt\u2019s an overarching narrative that opens up so many possibilities,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cI love it. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Make your own museum The old silk mill in Derby, built by the Lombe brothers in the 1720s, was arguably the first factory in the world. In 1974, it became the Derby Industrial Museum, but by the 2010s it needed a fresh start. The project was entrusted to Hannah Fox, whose brief, says Hopkins, was: \u201cHere\u2019s the keys and a very small budget. See what you can do.\u201d Next summer the silk mill will be relaunched as the Museum of Making, designed and made by the residents of Derby. Fox began by building a workshop on the site and inviting local people, with some expert help, to create a prototype museum, right down to the cafe furniture, exhibition cases and displays. With this design, they were able to secure funding for the project. Once the main renovations are complete, the plan is for local people to finish the fit-out. In the meantime, a mobile \u201cMakory\u201d tours the area, offering a preview of the attractions in the new museum, and Derby hosts an annual Maker Faire, gathering people who enjoy making things to display and share their skills. This community-led approach has been so well received in Derby that it is now a normal way for the city\u2019s other museums and galleries to begin new projects. Hopkins dreams of seeing it spread further still, perhaps even into hospitals and schools. Be like Li\u00e8ge \u201cI\u2019ve spent 12 or 13 years working with different Transition groups all across Europe with this vision of the future in my head,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cNormally, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s saying: \u2018It could be like this.

      "body": "<p>In defiance of the NCAA, California governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 206 into law last month, better known as the Fair Pay to Play Act. Backed by Bernie Sanders and NBA superstar LeBron James, the bill allows college athletes in the state to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/15/sb-206-college-sports\">profit from their image and likeness</a>.</p> <p>The bill comes one year after the NCAA, the largest governing body for college sports in the United States, reportedly amassed $1.1bn in revenue. Most of this money comes from the men\u2019s basketball March Madness tournament, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/ncca-march-madness-tournament-basketball.html\">CNBC</a>, and a large portion also comes from college football bowl games. Although the Fair Pay to Play Act would not force the NCAA to pay athletes for any of those tournament, it will allow them to do paid public appearances, sign endorsement deals, offer private lessons and sell their memorabilia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/15/sb-206-college-sports\">Will a California bill give players a slice of college sports' $14bn pie?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The act is a sign of progress but it will only apply to a select few: while high-profile football and basketball players from successful programs are marketable, most student athletes are not famous enough to warrant endorsement deals or a market in signed memorabilia. However, when it comes to college athletics, there is a far larger issue that is being ignored: its actual price tag and who funds its existence.</p> <p>The notion that all college sports teams across the United States are generating millions of dollars for their respective schools and every NCAA athlete is being exploited is unfounded. Except for some elite football and men\u2019s basketball programs, expenses tend to outstrip revenues, and the burden is largely placed on non-athletes, driving up the cost of their degrees.</p> <p>The cost of college athletics varies greatly from school to school and oftentimes depends on which one of the three NCAA Divisions a school is in. The elite Division I teams (except for Ivy League schools) are allowed to offer full athletic scholarships to players, Division II teams primarily offer their athletes partial scholarships while Division III teams cannot offer athletic scholarships at all, according to <a href=\"https://blog.prepscholar.com/what-are-ncaa-divisions-1-vs-2-vs-3\">Prep Scholar</a>.</p> <p>The NCAA reported in 2016 that the average Division I school lost <a href=\"https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/2017DIRES_Division_I_Financial_PPT_%20web_version_20180125.pdf\">$12.6m</a> annually on athletics if they don\u2019t have a football team, and $14.4m if they do. In Division II, the annual loss per school as of 2014 was <a href=\"http://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/2015%20Division%20II%20RE%20report.pdf\">$5.1m</a> if they had a football team and $4.1m if they did not. For Division III, football schools lost <a href=\"http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/division-ii-athletics-expenses\">$3.1m</a> on athletics while those without football experienced a $1.6m loss.</p> <p>Largely, student fees and hiked tuition subsidize these costs at smaller private universities, although taxpayers contribute at state government-operated public colleges. Even so, a 2010 Washington Post report revealed that nine public colleges in Virginia charged each student <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/24/AR2010102403002.html\">more than $1,000 annually</a> in fees to fund their athletic department.</p> <p>The alternative to hiking fees is to cut sports teams entirely, which is exactly what Bacone College and Malone University have done in recent years. </p> <p>Malone, a small private Christian school in Ohio with approximately 1,600 students, decided to cut the school\u2019s Division II football team to make additional funding available for academics. The school\u2019s official website <a href=\"https://malonepioneers.com/news/2019/2/1/malone-eliminates-intercollegiate-football-as-part-of-restructuring.aspx\">reports</a> they will save approximately $1m annually by cutting football.

      "bodyText": "In defiance of the NCAA, California governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 206 into law last month, better known as the Fair Pay to Play Act. Backed by Bernie Sanders and NBA superstar LeBron James, the bill allows college athletes in the state to profit from their image and likeness. The bill comes one year after the NCAA, the largest governing body for college sports in the United States, reportedly amassed $1.1bn in revenue. Most of this money comes from the men\u2019s basketball March Madness tournament, according to CNBC, and a large portion also comes from college football bowl games. Although the Fair Pay to Play Act would not force the NCAA to pay athletes for any of those tournament, it will allow them to do paid public appearances, sign endorsement deals, offer private lessons and sell their memorabilia. The act is a sign of progress but it will only apply to a select few: while high-profile football and basketball players from successful programs are marketable, most student athletes are not famous enough to warrant endorsement deals or a market in signed memorabilia. However, when it comes to college athletics, there is a far larger issue that is being ignored: its actual price tag and who funds its existence. The notion that all college sports teams across the United States are generating millions of dollars for their respective schools and every NCAA athlete is being exploited is unfounded. Except for some elite football and men\u2019s basketball programs, expenses tend to outstrip revenues, and the burden is largely placed on non-athletes, driving up the cost of their degrees. The cost of college athletics varies greatly from school to school and oftentimes depends on which one of the three NCAA Divisions a school is in. The elite Division I teams (except for Ivy League schools) are allowed to offer full athletic scholarships to players, Division II teams primarily offer their athletes partial scholarships while Division III teams cannot offer athletic scholarships at all, according to Prep Scholar. The NCAA reported in 2016 that the average Division I school lost $12.6m annually on athletics if they don\u2019t have a football team, and $14.4m if they do. In Division II, the annual loss per school as of 2014 was $5.1m if they had a football team and $4.1m if they did not. For Division III, football schools lost $3.1m on athletics while those without football experienced a $1.6m loss. Largely, student fees and hiked tuition subsidize these costs at smaller private universities, although taxpayers contribute at state government-operated public colleges. Even so, a 2010 Washington Post report revealed that nine public colleges in Virginia charged each student more than $1,000 annually in fees to fund their athletic department. The alternative to hiking fees is to cut sports teams entirely, which is exactly what Bacone College and Malone University have done in recent years. Malone, a small private Christian school in Ohio with approximately 1,600 students, decided to cut the school\u2019s Division II football team to make additional funding available for academics. The school\u2019s official website reports they will save approximately $1m annually by cutting football. Recently, the school added cybersecurity and criminal and restorative justice programs. Meanwhile, when Ferlin Clark became the president of Oklahoma\u2019s Bacone College in 2018, he cut his school\u2019s NAIA (a smaller NCAA alternative) football and rodeo programs to help erase $2m in debt and redirect funds towards the classroom. Clark, who did not reply to requests from the Guardian for this story, explained his rationale to KTUL in 2018. \u201cI think the core of it is we became a sports institute rather than an academic institution, and we had 16 athletic programs rather than 13 academic programs, so we needed to realign who we really are,\u201d he said. Although financial woes forced Malone University and Bacone College to admit athletics drained resources, they are in the minority. At other schools like the University of Houston and UC Santa Cruz, students have voted in recent years in favor of increasing their own tuition fees to subsidize their athletic departments Oftentimes, colleges mislead on the fiscal burden sports present because schools include subsidies to their athletic department as revenue on their financial reports. In 2018 USA Today Sports compiled financial reports from 230 public colleges\u2019 athletic departments and in their explanation of the revenue column, they noted student fees, tuition and state funds were being counted. On financial reports, this makes it appear as though the athletic departments are self-sufficient or even making money for their respective schools when they are not. Still, college sports are not going away anytime soon. In 2019, there were five new college football programs established and in 2020, there will be four more, none of which will be Division I, according to Next College Student Athlete. Even though elite college athletes could soon be profiting from their efforts, there is no foreseeable legislation to help out the millions of non-athlete students caught in this unrelated \u2013 yet far more prevalent \u2013 issue.",

The death of <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/895667/a-year-after-jharkhand-girl-died-of-starvation-aadhaar-tragedies-are-on-the-rise\">Santoshi Kumari</a>, whose family\u2019s ration card was cancelled because it was not linked to Aadhaar, shocked the country in 2017.

Residents in Lurgumi Kalan village in Mahuadanr, also in Jharkhand, went without rations for two months this summer because there was no connection, according to researchers at the campaign group Right To Food (RTF).</p> <p>Rice was distributed to the village only after one resident, <a href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jun/07/man-dies-of-starvation-in-jharkhand-as-ration-not-disbursed-for-three-months-1986974.html\">64-year-old </a><a href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jun/07/man-dies-of-starvation-in-jharkhand-as-ration-not-disbursed-for-three-months-1986974.html\">Ramcharan Munda</a>, died. Munda, who lived with his family in abject poverty in a small mud hut, had not eaten for two and a half days, activists found. Residents and the dealer had reportedly asked the administration on multiple times to revert to an offline system but this did not happen.</p> <p>Government officials issued a notice stating that if fingerprint scans failed, people should not be denied rations. But Ashrafi Nand Prasad, a state coordinator for RTF, said this message had not filtered down in many areas. \u201cThe local ration shop owners were not doing that,\u201d he said. Like Manjhi, people were simply turned away with nothing.</p> <p>Access to other benefits linked to Aadhaar, such as pensions and wages offered through a government scheme that guarantees 100 days\u2019 work, is equally chaotic. Researchers at the Indian School of Business found that 68% of total payments made under the work scheme in Jharkhand, which were processed through Aadhaar, were misdirected. Such errors, along with delays in payments, are common and have discouraged some from finding work through the scheme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a61baa70fbaba34c9d7eace6350b9e04c49f33f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a61baa70fbaba34c9d7eace6350b9e04c49f33f1/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finger scanning at a registration centre in Delhi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman goes through the process of finger scanning at a registration centre in Delhi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saumya Khandelwal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPayments were always an issue and they were getting delayed even before Aadhaar, but one could see improvements happening for sure,\u201d said Siraj Dutta, who works on social policy in Jharkhand. \u201cWith Aadhaar, everything went crazy and new problems came up.\u201d</p> <p>Shrimati Devi, 70, who lives in Dumka, Jamma, said she had not received her 1,000-rupeesa-month pension for months. She eventually discovered that it was being paid to someone else\u2019s bank account. Government staff told her to speak to the bank and the bank told her to speak to the individual who was receiving her money.</p> <p>\u201cWe have tried many times, now we are hopeless,\u201d said her daughter, Suma Devi. \u201cIn our family no one is in a government job, so [the pension] was very helpful,\u201d she said, adding that the family was dependent on precarious private-sector work.</p> <p>Corruption and poor management have proved huge problems in the welfare system. Research by economists Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Reetika Khera estimated that 85% of the grains meant for poorer families in Jharkhand did not reach consumers in the financial year 2004-05. But this figure was already improving prior to the introduction of Aadhaar, and had fallen to 44% by 2011-12.</p> <p>The problem of duplicate or fake cards, which Aadhaar promised to target, was actually \u201cextremely negligible\u201d, said Dutta.<strong> </strong>Corruption was happening elsewhere: grains were going missing before they reached the ration shop and dealers were fudging their records to suggest they had given plenty to customers, when actually some grains were held back.</p> <p>After Aadhaar was rolled out, the Jharkhand government claimed it had wiped out around 1m fake ration cards. Campaigners say many of those were genuine cards held by people who hadn\u2019t successfully obtained an Aadhaar number and linked this to their card. A<a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/860857/aadhaar-disruption-in-jharkhands-poorest-regions-hundreds-of-people-are-being-denied-foodgrains\"> survey conducted</a> by RTF found that of a sample of 135 cancelled ration cards, only two were declared fake and three deemed to be duplicates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7967251c2aabebe290422551dc17087bd10e5adf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7967251c2aabebe290422551dc17087bd10e5adf/0_96_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest in Kolkata in 2017 over Aadhaar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest in Kolkata in 2017 against the government\u2019s decision to link free lunch meals for children at state-run schools with the national Aadhaar biometric cards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some were cancelled for not linking to Aadhaar or because the individual had died, though the majority, 96, were scrapped without any explanation.</p> <p>People whose cards are cancelled can face hurdles in getting back into the welfare system, partly because the number of recipients for some support is dictated by a quota set by the central government. In Jharkhand, 86% of rural households are eligible to receive subsidised grain, but this figure is based on a 2011 socio-economic caste census and the population has grown considerably since then. </p> <p>Some states have chosen to supplement funds from central government to ensure vulnerable families are not left out Not Jharkhand, however, where some families are turned away or face long delays. </p> <p>Alabati Devi\u2019s family are now getting the right support, although Kapi said they did not officially have the correct ration cards. Things changed after activists raised awareness of Manjhi\u2019s death through the media.</p> <p>\u201cBecause a lot of these [problems] are affecting the poor, who don\u2019t have a voice in the system, a lot of it is going unnoticed and unchallenged,\u201d said Khera.</p> <p>She expressed concern about other families in Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha \u2013 India\u2019s poorest states. \u201cWhere is the dignity in all this?

Residents in Lurgumi Kalan village in Mahuadanr, also in Jharkhand, went without rations for two months this summer because there was no connection, according to researchers at the campaign group Right To Food (RTF). Rice was distributed to the village only after one resident, 64-year-old Ramcharan Munda, died. Munda, who lived with his family in abject poverty in a small mud hut, had not eaten for two and a half days, activists found. Residents and the dealer had reportedly asked the administration on multiple times to revert to an offline system but this did not happen. Government officials issued a notice stating that if fingerprint scans failed, people should not be denied rations. But Ashrafi Nand Prasad, a state coordinator for RTF, said this message had not filtered down in many areas. \u201cThe local ration shop owners were not doing that,\u201d he said. Like Manjhi, people were simply turned away with nothing. Access to other benefits linked to Aadhaar, such as pensions and wages offered through a government scheme that guarantees 100 days\u2019 work, is equally chaotic. Researchers at the Indian School of Business found that 68% of total payments made under the work scheme in Jharkhand, which were processed through Aadhaar, were misdirected. Such errors, along with delays in payments, are common and have discouraged some from finding work through the scheme. \u201cPayments were always an issue and they were getting delayed even before Aadhaar, but one could see improvements happening for sure,\u201d said Siraj Dutta, who works on social policy in Jharkhand. \u201cWith Aadhaar, everything went crazy and new problems came up.\u201d Shrimati Devi, 70, who lives in Dumka, Jamma, said she had not received her 1,000-rupeesa-month pension for months. She eventually discovered that it was being paid to someone else\u2019s bank account. Government staff told her to speak to the bank and the bank told her to speak to the individual who was receiving her money. \u201cWe have tried many times, now we are hopeless,\u201d said her daughter, Suma Devi. \u201cIn our family no one is in a government job, so [the pension] was very helpful,\u201d she said, adding that the family was dependent on precarious private-sector work. Corruption and poor management have proved huge problems in the welfare system. Research by economists Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Reetika Khera estimated that 85% of the grains meant for poorer families in Jharkhand did not reach consumers in the financial year 2004-05. But this figure was already improving prior to the introduction of Aadhaar, and had fallen to 44% by 2011-12. The problem of duplicate or fake cards, which Aadhaar promised to target, was actually \u201cextremely negligible\u201d, said Dutta. Corruption was happening elsewhere: grains were going missing before they reached the ration shop and dealers were fudging their records to suggest they had given plenty to customers, when actually some grains were held back. After Aadhaar was rolled out, the Jharkhand government claimed it had wiped out around 1m fake ration cards. Campaigners say many of those were genuine cards held by people who hadn\u2019t successfully obtained an Aadhaar number and linked this to their card. A survey conducted by RTF found that of a sample of 135 cancelled ration cards, only two were declared fake and three deemed to be duplicates. Some were cancelled for not linking to Aadhaar or because the individual had died, though the majority, 96, were scrapped without any explanation. People whose cards are cancelled can face hurdles in getting back into the welfare system, partly because the number of recipients for some support is dictated by a quota set by the central government. In Jharkhand, 86% of rural households are eligible to receive subsidised grain, but this figure is based on a 2011 socio-economic caste census and the population has grown considerably since then. Some states have chosen to supplement funds from central government to ensure vulnerable families are not left out Not Jharkhand, however, where some families are turned away or face long delays. Alabati Devi\u2019s family are now getting the right support, although Kapi said they did not officially have the correct ration cards. Things changed after activists raised awareness of Manjhi\u2019s death through the media. \u201cBecause a lot of these [problems] are affecting the poor, who don\u2019t have a voice in the system, a lot of it is going unnoticed and unchallenged,\u201d said Khera. She expressed concern about other families in Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha \u2013 India\u2019s poorest states. \u201cWhere is the dignity in all this? These programmes have been put in place to allow people to live a life of dignity, and you are reducing them to beggars.\u201d Additional reporting by Mohammad Sartaj Alam",

      "bodyText": "Labor is fond of declaring right at the moment that the Morrison government has no plan to kickstart the ailing economy. This isn\u2019t quite right. The government does have a plan. The plan is this: 1. Hope the post-election tax cuts, coupled with record low interest rates, boost private spending. 2. Have infrastructure spending provide another fillip to economic activity. 3. Hope the benefits of all this show up in the next set of national accounts and, if they don\u2019t, there\u2019s always the midyear economic update to prime the pump, modestly and calmly and decorously of course, lest anyone be accused of latent communism. The problem with the government\u2019s plan (apart from the obvious risk that its actions to date are massively underdone) is the bubbling uncertainty as it waits to see, dataset by dataset, if its approach proves to be the correct one. Uncertainty abounds in politics, but it is never comfortable. While that uncertainty persists \u2013 the lingering concern that these guys may not, in fact, be the smartest boys in the room just because Scott Morrison won an upset election in May \u2013 so does the external chatter from respectable voices about the desirability of more fiscal stimulus. Overnight, the International Monetary Fund downgraded Australia\u2019s economic growth forecasts (again) by 0.4% to 1.7% in 2019 and noted monetary policy could not be \u201cthe only game in town\u201d. Cuts to interest rates, it said, \u201cshould be coupled with fiscal support where fiscal space is available\u201d. This analysis echoes observations Australia\u2019s central bank has been making for some time. Minutes from the latest meeting of the Reserve Bank also noted delicately \u201cthere had not yet been evidence of a pick-up in household spending following the recent reductions in the cash rate and receipt of the tax offset payments\u201d \u2013 although the observation is softened by an observation that it might be too early to detect signs of pickup. Josh Frydenberg has been rolling out his plan, and courting additional stimulus, without calling it stimulus, which is slightly Pythonesque. But while asking the states to bring forward smaller-scale infrastructure spending to boost the economy, envisaging perhaps a commuter carpark-led recovery, the treasurer also points to capacity constraints as a reason why Project Stimulus But Don\u2019t Say Stimulus can\u2019t transform things with electrifying speed.

The prime minister told the chamber the government\u2019s strategy was to remain calm, stable and secure, and talk about Labor. Well, the first part of that approach was stated, the second part was implicit, because the majority of question time on Wednesday was trained on Labor\u2019s ill considered and reckless economic stimulus unleashed on the unwitting populace during the global financial crisis, which was capital T terrible. The prime minister somehow omitted the central fact that reckless and ill-considered spending helped keep Australia out of recession, which I suspect at least some Australians are grateful for, given what happened everywhere else, and what has happened to politics in the great democracies of the world as a direct consequence of that downturn, with the landscape littered with demagogues and extremists and populist charlatans gadding about in the cloak of prime ministers and presidents. Defamation also seemed a somewhat risky course given the government may have to turn on the fiscal tap itself in the event things get worse, although Morrison and Frydenberg will of course present their own pump priming, should that prove necessary, as tight and targeted and enlightened rather than profligate. So let\u2019s cut to the chase on the government\u2019s plan. This will all be fine if it\u2019s fine.

Our in-depth series including Our Wide Brown Land, Great Barrier Reef In Crisis, the New Normal: How Climate Change is Making Droughts Worse, Murray Darling: When the River Runs Dry, the carbon clock, our fact-checks, political analysis and commentary have all been informed by a determination to neither sensationalise nor recoil from the facts. Our readers tell us through their attention, their responses and their support that this is reporting they value. We now have three dedicated environment reporters in Australia, who work with colleagues around the globe. But we do not see environment reporting as separate. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our lifetimes, and informs all our journalism, across business, science, politics, lifestyle and culture. We have considered the language we use and decided to call this an emergency and a crisis, because that is what the science tells us it is. We are also auditing the environmental impact of our own operations. As Prof Ross Garnaut has set out, Australia has the potential to be a superpower of the post-carbon world economy if we could just set aside the self-defeating culture war and look to the future with imagination. But the solutions require complicated change, and understanding change requires careful, fact-based reporting, to inform and to counter the misinformation and well-funded PR campaigns designed to prolong the dangerous and unsustainable status quo. Guardian Australia will provide that reporting, because only a properly informed debate can help us avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis and steer us out of this cul-de sac and towards a low-carbon future. Your ongoing support is vital for us to deliver the best environmental reporting in Australia. Thank you to our supporters for helping to make this possible.

Tough economic times often result in the so-called \u201clipstick effect\u201d \u2013 when shoppers reduce spending on expensive designer items but splurge on cheaper luxuries instead \u2013 and the report says sales are 16% higher than last year. John Lewis\u2019s trading director, Simon Coble, said the report helped it to adapt its ranges and \u201cremain relevant to customers\u2019 lives\u201d. This year, the study revealed greater concern about the environment, especially single-use plastic. Travel mugs and reusable water bottles are now considered standard issue and shoppers are experimenting with collapsible coffee cups, reusable beeswax sandwich wrappers and travel cutlery. Sales of carry-around knives and forks, to use instead of plastic versions, are up 176%. The decision to ban plastic straws and drink stirrers from sale in England next year has pushed sales of reusable versions up more than 1500%, with shoppers buying cheaper stainless steel ones or splashing out on silver, which come in a carry case and cost \u00a38. In a possible sign that the political turmoil is taking its toll on the population, John Lewis said sales of Lego sets aimed at adults were up by a quarter. The toymaker has released a mindfulness book called Build Yourself Happy: The Joy of Lego Play and construction projects range from the Central Perk caf\u00e9 from the sitcom Friends to a Vestas wind turbine. Many of the products that are on their way out have fallen foul to advances in technology. Sales of landline phones have nearly halved in five years while camcorders are practically a \u201cnon-existent\u201d market, it said. Sales of mantel clocks are in freefall, usurped by smartphones and voice controlled speakers. The store has also stopped selling drones after sales plummeted in the wake of the drone attack that disrupted Gatwick airport last Christmas.",

Researchers found the squeeze on household budgets from universal credit meant many parents struggled to buy warm clothes and nutritious food for their children, as well as being unable to afford birthdays, toys and school trips. Parents said the financial pressures provoked rows with partners, stress and depression. Many cut out eating or buying clothes to try to ensure their children did not go hungry, while others switched off the heating. The research, carried out by the Child Poverty Action group (CPAG) for Tower Hamlets council in east London, found the stress and indignity triggered by universal credit was exacerbated by the complexity of the online benefits system and the frequently erratic payment system. CPAG\u2019s chief executive, Alison Garnham, said: \u201cAs a society we believe it\u2019s right to have a social security system that protects people from poverty and helps them to get better prospects.

It has the highest level of child poverty in London at 43%, as well as the second highest level of unemployment, and high rates of long-term illness. Universal credit has been in place there since 2017. The notorious five-week wait for a first universal credit payment pushed many families into debt and food bank use to survive the loss of income. While a quarter took up the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 offer of an advance payment, almost as many got through by not paying rent, leading to rent arrears. It found that some claimants, especially older people and those with poor English struggled with the system. Some had relied on their children to set up and manage their claim.

One woman had \u00a3135 twice wrongly deducted because the DWP system had wrongly recorded that she was supposedly in receipt of maternity allowance \u2013 five years after she was pregnant. When claimants contacted universal credit service call centres to resolve errors they encountered long call waiting times, and frequently rude and unhelpful staff. One respondent, re-interviewed six months later, said the service had hugely improved \u2013 \u201cthe on-hold times are now only around 10 minutes\u201d. Tower Hamlets council said it had uncovered 539 universal credit payment errors generated by the DWP in a year. A council benefits official told researchers that had a local authority service created a similar volume of wrong payments the service would have been put in special measures. Despite being alerted to these errors, totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds, the DWP told Tower Hamlets it would not correct them unless the claimants themselves notified the department, meaning that residents continued to be either under-paid or over-paid benefits. One council official said: \u201cWe have this scenario where it is like phoning the fire brigade and saying, \u2018look, I can see out the window, there\u2019s a block of flats on fire there\u2019, and they [the DWP] go \u2018yes, we can see it as well but we are waiting for the resident to tell us\u2019\u201d.

A DWP spokesperson said its survey of 12,000 people nationally found more than 80% of claimants were satisfied with universal credit: \u201cThis report is based on the experience of fewer than 300 claimants, when more than 17,000 people are receiving universal credit in Tower Hamlets. \u201cNobody should struggle to claim the benefits they need, and we have a wide range of support in place to help people, including our Help to Claim service delivered by Citizens Advice.\u201d",

Last year I reported on a seller who lost \u00a34,300 after selling four gold coins to a buyer who claimed they were not as described returning five silver coins, before issuing a successful chargeback via his bank.</p> <p>PayPal would not cover the loss under its \u201cseller protection\u201d because of the same clause that has left you out of pocket. PayPal markets its \u201cseller protection\u201d as a \u201ccommitment to building trust and safety in our network\u201d, but its exclusion of claims for \u201citems significantly not as described (and items collected in person)\u201d is a gift to scammers.</p> <p>I\u2019ve reported a myriad of complaints about eBay policies skewed in favour of buyers, but in this case, even though eBay did the right thing, you were still defrauded because of PayPal\u2019s terms and conditions. PayPal, which protects buyers when items are mis-sold, failed to answer why it has not amended the policy to deter such scams, but it did contest the chargeback. Luckily, the buyer\u2019s bank rejected the claim.</p> <p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

PayPal says its seller protection does not cover \u201cnot as described\u201d claims, something I now find is a well-known loophole to fraudsters. Why is it endorsing this fraud and not making customers aware that at any point a buyer can make a false claim and PayPal will uphold it? In addition, they now have the gall to chase me for the money as my account is in arrears due to the fraudulent claim. LS, Rochdale It is staggering that PayPal still allows this gaping loophole in its much-vaunted seller protection. Last year I reported on a seller who lost \u00a34,300 after selling four gold coins to a buyer who claimed they were not as described returning five silver coins, before issuing a successful chargeback via his bank. PayPal would not cover the loss under its \u201cseller protection\u201d because of the same clause that has left you out of pocket. PayPal markets its \u201cseller protection\u201d as a \u201ccommitment to building trust and safety in our network\u201d, but its exclusion of claims for \u201citems significantly not as described (and items collected in person)\u201d is a gift to scammers. I\u2019ve reported a myriad of complaints about eBay policies skewed in favour of buyers, but in this case, even though eBay did the right thing, you were still defrauded because of PayPal\u2019s terms and conditions. PayPal, which protects buyers when items are mis-sold, failed to answer why it has not amended the policy to deter such scams, but it did contest the chargeback. Luckily, the buyer\u2019s bank rejected the claim. If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Why would she, when a working-class childhood ended at 14? Already she had been sacked as a maid, for scrubbing a piano down with water; been nanny to a boy who announced: \u201cYou must do everything I say or else I\u2019ll shoot you\u201d; lived in a boarding house with Hitler\u2019s portrait on the wall; embarked on the first of her four doomed marriages; and taken a lover who sent identical \u201cdear Kitten\u201d letters to all his mistresses.</p> <p>Ah, those men.

That\u2019s the kind of life I could thrive in.\u201d</p> <p>Little wonder, then, that when a literary magazine accepts her first poems for publication, Ditlevsen\u2019s imagination is fired not by the Woolfian dream of financial security and a room of one\u2019s own, but by the eligibility of its ageing editor: \u201cIf he\u2019s single, I have nothing against marrying him.

The English title <em>Dependency</em> is equally apt; within a few chapters, Ditlevsen, divorced from the literary editor (because yes, reader, she did marry him), has escaped the pressures of a second doomed union and new motherhood and stumbled into the arms of her next husband, a quietly deranged doctor who fulfils her needs as no man has done before.</p> <p>To Ditlevsen the opioid Demerol, a shot of which he gives her as an alternative to foreplay, has a name that \u201csounds like birdsong\u201d. Immediately, the mental and physical bliss it offers is infinitely more intense than the escapist rush she gets from writing. \u201cI smiled thankfully at him,\u201d she writes, \u201cand the fluid went into my blood, lifting me up to the only level where I wanted to exist.

But the government said he wouldn\u2019t have the power to do that, to stop someone coming. They\u2019re misleading there? They\u2019ve said this scenario couldn\u2019t happen under the legislation but today it has. So they were wrong?</p> <p><strong>SB: </strong>No, Patricia, I think what was argued at the time was that the powers in terms of being able to reject were clearly not strong enough. And that was the argument at the time.<br></p> <p><strong>PK: </strong>No, that was not the argument ...<br></p> <p><strong>SB: </strong>Well, you can go away and have a look if you like ...</p> <p><strong>PK:</strong> I remember very well what was said.</p> <p><strong>SB:</strong> I\u2019m telling you ...<br></p> <p><strong>PK:</strong> Murderers, paedophiles would be able to come to Australia. Peter Dutton has been able to stop somebody ...</p> <p><strong>SB:</strong> And of course about the lack of necessity about this piece of legislation or reform. There are 132 people who have come to Australia under this legislation who aren\u2019t in hospital. </p> <p>They\u2019re not here with acute medical conditions that necessitated coming into an Australian hospital circumstance. We had provisions already for providing healthcare and health treatment for individuals who needed it, and this legislation was demonstrably unnecessary, and the consequence of it is that it has created a pathway.</p> <p><strong>PK:</strong> But the minister has the ability to refuse, as he has today, this Iranian father, he\u2019s refused his entry to Australia. So he has this power, doesn\u2019t he?<br></p> <p><strong>SB:</strong> In limited circumstances. Obviously others who\u2019ve come here have come under this power and under this provision ...</p> <p><strong>PK:</strong> But there\u2019s no evidence that they\u2019re murderers or they\u2019re paedophiles, is there?<br></p> <p><strong>SB:</strong> Let\u2019s understand, the overall argument ...<br></p> <p><strong>PK:</strong>You\u2019re shifting this conversation to the medical priority. I\u2019m talking about their status.</p> <p><strong>SB:</strong> You are \u2013 focusing on one of the arguments about it ...</p> <p><strong>PK: </strong>That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking about it.</p> <p><strong>SB: </strong>The core argument was that it was open a channel to Australia to undermined our border protection regime ...</p> <p><strong>PK: </strong>Wasn\u2019t the government misleading about this given the evidence today?</p> <p><strong>SB: </strong>No, we are not. That was one argument at the time. The bigger argument at the time was it was putting another hole in the border protection regime we had built. It was unnecessary to do so because you can get health services and we did have the power, where necessary, to bring people to Australia when ready. The way this is being used to date is to set up a circumstance where you do have more than 132 people who have come, who aren\u2019t in a hospital but they were brought here as a result of this medivac law.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T05:32:49.877Z\">at 6.32am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da6a8618f083d8b3b9dcc1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T05:19:51.517Z\">6.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Simon Birmingham\u2019s </strong>explanation is one thing.

And as we go into Myefo the forecast will be considered at that time as they are... I know the leader of the opposition isn\u2019t terribly familiar with the processes of budgets, having never served in those portfolios when he was in government, but I\u2019m sure he is becoming familiar with them now in his new role. I am asked about the government\u2019s plan. </p> <p>And one of the things that occurred after the 18 May this year was the huge sigh of relief of those whose jobs and investments and businesses depended on strong and capable financial and economic management. </p> <p>The sense of fear on behalf of the Australian people about the Australian economy, if it were to fall into the hands of the Labor party, was absolutely palpable, and so Australians were looking for a stable and secure plan. </p> <p>A plan that we had set out in the budget, a plan which for the first time coming back into surplus in 12 years. A budget surplus that has been established as a result of the hard work of Australians out there each and every day, of 1.4 million Australians coming into work, of having the lowest level of welfare... </p> <p>... I am happy to talk about the plan that was endorsed by the Australian people and was set out in the budget, which was for lower taxes, allowing Australians to keep more of what they own. A plan that was opposed by the Labor party at the last election, violently opposed by the Labor party, and instead wanted to put forward $387bn in higher taxes to impose on the Australian economy at the worst possible time because the global circumstance that Australia faces today were of no mystery to the Australian government and the Liberal and National parties. But they were obviously a complete mystery to the Labor party because they thought the best thing to do was to apply $387bn in higher taxes. Investments in infrastructure, skills, expanding other trade capabilities, reduction in business regulation and making it easier to reduce regulation on how people can be employed. </p> <p>And when do we have to wait to hear what Labor\u2019s policies are? As I was referring in a previous question, the leader of the opposition has said that we will know about Labor\u2019s policies before the next election is some time before the end of 2021... what their tax policies are. But the Australian people know what our policies are, Mr Speaker, and they voted for them and we will keep implementing them.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a784717cb224e4a9dfccc09006acc3aad2506818\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a784717cb224e4a9dfccc09006acc3aad2506818/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese during question time\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese during question time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T04:14:45.573Z\">at 5.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da691718f08b13ca7c7b5ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T03:42:39.212Z\">4.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If it is any indication of how this question time is going, a member of the public who resembles Hulk Hogan and is sitting in the gallery has managed to capture the attention of a vast bulk of the MPs sitting in the chamber.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T03:46:51.643Z\">at 4.46am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da691198f083d8b3b9dcbaa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T03:40:29.552Z\">4.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg </strong>is yelling about something, but again no one is listening.</p> <p>I do not get paid enough for this.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T03:40:52.604Z\">at 4.40am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da68fcc8f08b13ca7c7b5a4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T03:39:26.462Z\">4.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> to <strong>Scott Morrison:</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When global factors help our economy, the prime minister takes credit.

So those opposite, when times are better they think they will go on forever, and you can never assume that things will go on well forever under a Labor party because they always know how to wreck the economy and wreck the budget with reckless spending and policies of panic and crisis. </p> <p>We will take a calm and methodical measure to the nation\u2019s finances to make sure we can be there to provide the resilience for those services and the future.</p> </blockquote> <p>*the budget is balanced, and forecast to be in surplus, but it is not in surplus just now</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T03:45:51.330Z\">at 4.45am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da68ed98f08b13ca7c7b594\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T03:33:40.049Z\">4.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>to<strong> Josh Frydenberg:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The treasurer said a moment ago that drought funding was the number one call on the budget.

We have been fashioning budgets for years to deal with the increasing uncertainty in the global economic climate. </p> <p>He will also be familiar with the real impact on the economy of the terrible drought that is now impacting on the Australian economy. And this is why, Mr Speaker, over successive budgets now we have been putting in place the types of resilience measures that support our economy in times like these. </p> <p>And the uncertainty of the times reflected in the IMF forecast revisions overnight, which obviously applies to a whole host of economies all around the world, that is just a fact, that is just a fact, the truth remains that while things are tough Australia\u2019s economy is growing only second to the United States of all G7 nations. (Once again, we are not part of the G7.)</p> <p>There is a lot of work to do, but in uncertain times, I\u2019d tell you what it calls for. </p> <p>It calls for lower taxes, which is what we are doing, Mr Speaker. It calls us for reducing the cost of doing business in this country, and amplifying procedures in the industrial areas, to engage in reforms and our skill sector, to ensure that we are expanding our trade borders all around the world as we have been doing now over the last six years. It calls us to invest $100bn in infrastructure as we are doing, and that is just for infrastructure, with some almost $10bn invested just this year alone, Mr Speaker. </p> <p>And it calls on us to invest $200bn in the future to recapitalise in our defence industries, as we heard yesterday in south-western Sydney, $250,000 worth of value added is provided by Quickstep, an Australian company, into every joint strike fighter that will be flown by every country that purchased them around the world. </p> <p>These are our investment decisions to address these uncertain times. Those opposite think the answer is higher taxes, and they think higher taxes will have no impact on the economy, and the leader of the opposition was asked today whether he thought Labor\u2019s high taxes would have had an impact on the economy, and he said no! </p> <p>He said I don\u2019t think they would. He said the answer was no, in response to the tax increases they have proposed when it comes to the housing tax.

These new numbers absolutely torpedo what was left of the Morrison Government\u2019s economic credibility. The Australian economy is floundering and the IMF is slashing its forecasts for Australia because Morrison and Frydenberg don\u2019t have a plan to turn things around. For months now Josh Frydenberg has been pretending that the economy here is strong and that the policy settings are right, but what the IMF proves is that neither of those things are true.</p> <p>The IMF is ringing the alarm bells on the Australian economy but Morrison and Frydenberg are too out of touch to hear them. What we need to see from the Government is a plan to turn around an economy which is floundering on their watch. The Australian economy is floundering and people are struggling, and the Morrison Government is just sitting on its hands doing nothing. They don\u2019t have a clue what to do here and so they\u2019re doing nothing. They can\u2019t continue to leave all of the heavy lifting to the Reserve Bank. The IMF makes the point in their report that there\u2019s been too much emphasis on interest rate cuts and not enough fiscal policy or budget changes from governments, including our own. Morrison and Frydenberg need to listen to the alarm bells which are being rung by the IMF.</p> <p> The IMF has slashed their expectations for growth in this economy under this Liberal Government. What we need to see is a plan to turn things around. The absence of a plan so far is costing Australia in terms of economic growth and jobs. We have the slowest economic growth in this country that we\u2019ve had in 10 years since the Global Financial Crisis; household debt is at record highs; almost two million Australians are looking for work or for more work; productivity and living standards are in decline; business investment is the lowest it\u2019s been since the early 1990s recession. Wherever you look in this economy there is weakness which is being left unattended by a Morrison Government without a plan. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T02:59:36.730Z\">at 3.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da6810a8f084862358fed89\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T02:33:04.869Z\">3.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We are getting close to question time ...

GetUp targeted six Coalition Liberal MPs. <strong>P</strong><strong>eter Dutton, Greg Hunt, Tony Abbott, Kevin Andrews</strong> and <strong>Christian Porter</strong>. Tony Abbott lost his seat, and many people say that GetUp had little influence on that because he was responsible for his own unpopularity. Do you bear responsibility, then, for the fact that your millions didn\u2019t unseat any of the other MPs and, in fact, there\u2019s an argument that people have put that GetUp\u2019s presence, for example, in Dixon, had the opposite effect. It boosted Peter Dutton\u2019s popularity?</p> <p><strong>Paul Oosting:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Firstly, that\u2019s not right. Peter Dutton faced a much smaller swing than other parts of Queensland. </p> <p>And whilst it\u2019s true to say, it\u2019s undoubtedly a fact, that we\u2019re sitting here today having not achieved our objectives in the election campaign, and we\u2019ve been reflecting on that and how we can work differently going forward, I\u2019m proud of the campaign that we ran together. </p> <p>We all fed in what our priorities should be, what the issues we should work on, where the energies go on, and we chose the hard right faction of the Coalition. Many of those are in what are traditionally deemed to be safe seats. With where things were going or where we thought they would go. </p> <p>How we do things differently if we had the opportunity again. But we have come out of it with real strengths as we outlined in the speech. </p> <p>We have a lot to be proud of in the 10,000 people, almost half of whom have stepped up into politics for the very first time, who have really broadened and deepened this movement, and they\u2019re more passionate than ever to keep getting involved and not waiting for that. </p> <p>Getting involved right now, we have to find a solution to the major crises that are facing our country \u2013 unemployment and the climate crisis. The IPCC says that we have 12 years left to address climate change. </p> <p>Three of the years will occur under this government, so we have to move on from the election that occurred five months ago and continue to try to find ways to look at the issues our members care about.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T03:00:54.469Z\">at 4.00am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5da677498f083d8b3b9dcb05\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-16T01:50:19.158Z\">2.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I guess this is never getting old:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SenRaffCiccone/status/1184284006172348416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fantastic.

The IMF, like the RBA, want governments to stimulate their economies. Slashing interest rates is not enough. With a decade of low growth forecast across the globe, monetary bodies want to see spending.</p> <p>In a statement sent out very early this morning, Chalmers said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The IMF has called on countries, including Australia, to provide fiscal stimulus and invest in infrastructure to support their economy and improve productivity.</p> <p>According to the IMF, \u201cMonetary policy cannot be the only game in town and should be coupled with fiscal support where fiscal space is available.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s updated forecasts make a mockery of Josh Frydenberg\u2019s claims that the Morrison Government has the right policy settings. </p> <p>Collapsing confidence and weak growth are the inevitable consequence of a Liberal-National Government which has a political strategy but not an economic policy.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/11/josh-frydenberg-steers-clear-of-the-s-word-while-asking-states-to-boost-economy\">We saw signs most obviously last week</a>, that the government is attempting to respond, without being explicit about it. Frydenberg\u2019s meeting with the nation\u2019s treasurers was all about bringing forward lower-tier infrastructure projects, which was essentially a stimulus program, without mentioning the word stimulus. That\u2019s because the government is locked on to delivering its budget operating surplus next year. Which means, for the short term at least, it is steering clear of \u201cstimulus\u201d \u2013 because you shouldn\u2019t have to stimulate a surplus economy.</p> <p>But the warnings are getting louder.

      "bodyText": "And on that note, we will call it a night. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers and the Guardian brains trust for all they did to keep me standing today. The struggle was very, very real. We will be back bright and early tomorrow morning for the last day of sitting this week. Go switch off. And please \u2013 take care of you. And a little bit more: The liberal democracies are open societies, that is our strength and vulnerability. We cannot make threats to our democratic institutions by adopting the tactics of authoritarian regimes that undermines our fundamental values and beliefs. Our role in this place is to stand up and defend those beliefs, and to remind successive generations of the price that\u2019s being paid to build the democratic, democratic institutions that we enjoy today ... Freedom is right and freedom works. The success of the Australian economy over the last three decades is no accident of resourcing damage or geography. It\u2019s overwhelmingly a testament to the benefits of economic freedom. The opening up of the Australian economy to market forces has not been easy. Along the way, there have been winners and losers, but the benefits are overwhelmingly positive. We are bigger, stronger and more resilient to external shocks ... When it comes to climate change, policymakers have to act on the basis of the best science available. We rely on the intelligence agencies to give us the best advice on security threats. And, of course, final decisions always rest with us as the elected representatives. The same model should apply to climate matters and almost everything else infringing on our health and natural and the natural world. A bit more from that speech: Politics is a noble calling, a vocation that puts the community and its aspirations before our own. And this parliament, as I said, in my main stage, is still the pinnacle of the Australian achievement. Liberal democracy with the rule of law, independent judiciary ... All of these things have helped us sustain our prosperity and social harmony. Institutions matter. Respected tradition and conventions matters, particularly in this age of disruption, technological, political and cultural. My brand of liberalism seeks to conserve the best of the past while adapting to the future. It is constructive progress and not change for change\u2019s sake. And how rapidly the world around us is changing. Trust in established institutions such as politics, business, the churches, the media has been weakened ... There\u2019s a reheated romance in some quarters with old-fashioned socialism, and one person\u2019s push for diversity and inclusion is another person\u2019s divisive identity politics. We complain about a lack of privacy and, in the same breath, gladly surrender so much of our personal information to vast platforms and networks ... And these platforms have also created new possibilities for control and intimidation of citizens. Information is being fragmented and weaponised, the broadcast media is increasingly polarised and politicised. And the proliferation of media outlets means the people can select the news and facts to suit their own preconceptions and biases. The universities here, the two bastions of free speech, are under attack from within and from outside. The scientific method is under attack, even as we benefit daily from the fruits of rigorous, evidence-based inquiry. If we cannot even agree on basic facts, how can we have a civilised discourse? Look at the climate change debate.. Arthur Sinodinos: But the best part of my job has been to meet so many of my fellow Australians from different parts of this great continent. Whatever race, colour or creed, we\u2019re bound together by our good fortune in being born here, for making the brave decision to forsake ancestral home and settle down [in] the best country in the world. For me, Australia is an immigrant nation. It\u2019s in our DNA. So too our unique Indigenous heritage with over 65,000 years of ongoing relationship with the land ... And we owe it to ourselves and to the world to make the most of our stewardship of this place. We are and should always be a beacon of hope to the rest of the world. For me, the Australian way is to live and let live, engage in fair play and leave no one behind. We have a special obligation to the minorities in our midst. These are the quiet Australians who need our help most. It includes Indigenous Australians, who seek more control over policies implemented in their name, disabled Australia, who want to be defined by the potential and not their disability, and those other marginalised Australians looking for gainful employment, and social acceptance. The test of being an Australian is not genealogy. But whether we adhere to timeless values that make our democracy work. You may remember that yesterday the Senate ordered David Coleman to table the review into refugee resettlement. It\u2019s a yeah, nah, from the government. Arthur Sinodinos is now delivering his valedictory speech. And a bit of how Mike Bowers saw question time. I will pay this Just before Sarah Henderson\u2019s speech, Sarah Hanson-Young saw this motion passed in the Senate: That the Senate: 1. Notes: a. The NSW Government plans to water down environmental rules to fast-track approvals for new dams and pipelines. b. The Murray-Darling River is in environmental collapse and bypassing environmental protections will do more harm. c. Plans to override environmental protections will have negative impacts on downstream communities and the health of the River system. d. Building dams will not make it rain. 2. Calls on the Federal Government to rule out giving any public funding to dam and water infrastructure projects that circumvent environmental assessment and don\u2019t abide by proper environmental protections. Sarah Henderson is making her first speech in the Senate, after being picked to take over from Mitch Fifield. She says it is \u201cabsolutely wonderful to be back\u201d Case in point, Josh Frydenberg is off to talk to some of those very international world bodies, which we did not elect, to talk about the need for ... GLOBAL COOPERATION. From 16 to 20 October, I will travel to Washington DC to attend the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meetings. I will hold discussions with Australia\u2019s regional neighbours, significant trade and investment partners, G7 economies and leaders of international financial institutions. These meetings will be used to discuss the challenges and opportunities flowing from the current conditions in the global economy. I will also participate in ministerial meetings of the IMF, World Bank and G20 in conjunction with central bank governors, covering issues such as financial stability, global financial architecture, international taxation and risks to the global economic outlook. Australia has a seat at the top table when it comes to global economic matters. I will ensure Australia\u2019s economic interests are protected and our successes recognised, while reaffirming our commitment to an open, free, rules-based trading system. Our strong, growing economy is an example of the benefits of free trade and investment. Australia has seen 28 consecutive years of economic growth and we are one of only 10 countries in the world to have a triple-A credit rating from all three major ratings agencies. Free trade equals more jobs, more investment and higher economic growth. I will send the clear message that this has been the lesson for the Australian economy in the past and that this will guide us in the future. Driving a strong and relevant agenda through international institutions is essential for Australia to ensure they remain capable of addressing new global challenges. I look forward to representing Australia\u2019s interests in this forum and emphasising the need for global cooperation. Dave Sharma was just asked by Patricia Karvelas on Afternoon Briefing about the prime minister\u2019s Lowy speech (where he invoked \u201cnegative globalism\u201d), and this is what he had to say: I was there for the speech and I think the point he was making, and this is a view I\u2019d share, is that global institutions are basically creations of the state system and they respect the views of state bodies. They don\u2019t have any independent legitimacy from that. We don\u2019t elect the UN secretary general or the head of the UNCF. They need to reflect that legitimacy. The best way to get global bodies to help us address these challenges is to helping to coordinate and bring states together. It is not by seeking to harangue states. ... Except, no, that is not correct. The World Trade Organisation is one of those international bodies who we turn to to navigate trade disputes, we sign up to UN conventions, we belong to the International Labour Organisation, to decide if labour laws meet international obligations. We fought for a seat on the UN security council \u2013 the list goes on. So you can\u2019t suddenly decide that the bodies we voluntarily signed up to, do not have independent legitimacy, when we turn to those very bodies to maintain rules-based order. According to the Hansard, this is what Josh Frydenberg said about the drought\u2019s impact on the budget: There is no doubt we face some domestic challenges to the economy, not least of which is the number one call on the budget, which is the drought. And the terrible drought that I saw firsthand. I was with the member for Maranoa in Inverell, Warrick and Stanthorpe and which itself has taken at least a quarter of a percentage point straight off GDP as well as requiring a significant call on budget to provide income support and infrastructure support and the like. Mr Speaker, the member for Rankin will look for every single opportunity to talk down the Australian economy. Every single opportunity to put at risk Australian jobs, Mr Speaker. The member for Rankin, just a matter of five months ago was the co-author, co-architect with the member for McMahon, in $387bn of higher taxes. The leader of the opposition went on Sky TV today and was asked would his tax impost on the Australian people have an impact on the economy, he said no. The reality is from the 1 July this year, Labor\u2019s retiree text, superannuation tax, tax on family businesses, would have all taken an effect. A look at the budget papers, just for accuracy sake, shows the drought funding, if you take it as the $7bn, puts 16 budget items ahead of it. The top five \u201ccalls\u201d on the budget are the revenues paid to the states, the pension, public hospitals, aged care services and the family tax benefit. The Senate just voted on a Greens motion calling for a climate emergency to be declared. Labor, Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie supported it, tying it (which means it was negatived, as the status quo prevails) This is also an interesting exchange - Simon Birmingham explaining to Patricia Karvelas about how Peter Dutton using the medevac legislation to stop someone coming to Australia on national security grounds, which is the exact thing he said couldn\u2019t be done, is not proof the government was misleading about medevac. PK: On another issue, Peter Dutton has tabled a statement on his decision to refuse a transfer under the medevac policy. But the government said he wouldn\u2019t have the power to do that, to stop someone coming. They\u2019re misleading there? They\u2019ve said this scenario couldn\u2019t happen under the legislation but today it has. So they were wrong? SB: No, Patricia, I think what was argued at the time was that the powers in terms of being able to reject were clearly not strong enough. And that was the argument at the time. PK: No, that was not the argument ... SB: Well, you can go away and have a look if you like ... PK: I remember very well what was said. SB: I\u2019m telling you ... PK: Murderers, paedophiles would be able to come to Australia. Peter Dutton has been able to stop somebody ... SB: And of course about the lack of necessity about this piece of legislation or reform. There are 132 people who have come to Australia under this legislation who aren\u2019t in hospital. They\u2019re not here with acute medical conditions that necessitated coming into an Australian hospital circumstance. We had provisions already for providing healthcare and health treatment for individuals who needed it, and this legislation was demonstrably unnecessary, and the consequence of it is that it has created a pathway. PK: But the minister has the ability to refuse, as he has today, this Iranian father, he\u2019s refused his entry to Australia. So he has this power, doesn\u2019t he? SB: In limited circumstances. Obviously others who\u2019ve come here have come under this power and under this provision ... PK: But there\u2019s no evidence that they\u2019re murderers or they\u2019re paedophiles, is there? SB: Let\u2019s understand, the overall argument ... PK:You\u2019re shifting this conversation to the medical priority. I\u2019m talking about their status. SB: You are \u2013 focusing on one of the arguments about it ... PK: That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking about it. SB: The core argument was that it was open a channel to Australia to undermined our border protection regime ... PK: Wasn\u2019t the government misleading about this given the evidence today? SB: No, we are not. That was one argument at the time. The bigger argument at the time was it was putting another hole in the border protection regime we had built. It was unnecessary to do so because you can get health services and we did have the power, where necessary, to bring people to Australia when ready. The way this is being used to date is to set up a circumstance where you do have more than 132 people who have come, who aren\u2019t in a hospital but they were brought here as a result of this medivac law. Simon Birmingham\u2019s explanation is one thing. But that is not what the treasurer said. Simon Birmingham is on Afternoon Briefing with Patricia Karvelas. She asks about Josh Frydenberg\u2019s claim that drought was \u201cthe number one call on the budget\u201d - the drought. Frydenberg: There is no doubt we face domestic challenges to the economy, not least of which is the number one call on the budget, the drought. Speaking to Birmingham, Karvelas asks: You mentioned the drought and there were lots of dramatic drought theatrics in the lower house. I know you\u2019re a senator. But the treasurer Josh Frydenberg talked about the drought being the number one policy of the government. But it\u2019s not, is it? Birmingham: In terms of the policy transactions that have been undertaken and since Scott Morrison became the prime minister there has been a continuity in measures to support farmers, to support communities and build resilience and a lot of different investment ... PK: Sure, but it is not number one budget item, is it, welfare, pensions ... Birmingham: If you go by totality of spending then that\u2019s a different equation. If you\u2019re looking at the number of different policy measures and responses that have been accumulated in a short period of time, I think I the number of different responses to the drought would be right up there. PK: OK. But shouldn\u2019t the government be clear about that? It\u2019s not its number one item at all? Birmingham: I wasn\u2019t there to hear the exact words the treasurer used ... .. but if you\u2019re looking at the priorities the government set, a number of policies delivered, drought response is right up there. Because we\u2019ve been focused on not just how you help farmers but also how you help communities and how you build resilience. Speaking of matters of public importance, I missed this in Anthony Albanese\u2019s speech in the MPI yesterday: In a speech to the Lowy Institute, he [Scott Morrison] spoke about \u2018negative globalism\u2019 as if Australia has not had a bipartisan position for 50 years of supporting global institutions that we voluntarily signed up for. We have been taking our place in the world. But he\u2019s prepared to press buttons of nationalism out there in order to try to criticise us. He went to the UN as well and said that our emissions were going down, but we know that all the records say that they\u2019re actually going up and they\u2019ll go up every year until 2030. While he was there, he attacked children for being concerned about the scientifically proven facts of climate change \u2013 about caring for the planet that they, after all, will be on for longer than those of us who are no longer young people. He\u2019s like a Scooby Doo villain who\u2019s sure he would\u2019ve gotten away with it if it weren\u2019t for those meddling kids! That\u2019s his attitude. He says we\u2019re on track to meet our Paris targets. We know that that\u2019s not the case. When he was in the United States he skipped the UN summit on climate change, even though he was there, to visit smart drive-through technology at McDonald\u2019s, of all places. Not even there could he follow through. The fact is that, during his visit, Scott Morrison proclaimed, \u2018We\u2019re making jobs great again.\u2019 As much as we used to mock the former member for Warringah for his slogans, at least they were original. Arthur Sinodinos will be delivering his valedictory speech to the Senate chamber within the hour. This is also being termed \u201coperation wildebeest\u201d in some quarters (as in, carving the weak from the herd). The matter of public importance is now being held in the chamber \u2013 it is also on the IMF report. The government side of the chamber exits very, very quickly, but Anthony Albanese takes a moment to pay tribute to the portrait of Nova Peris, who was the first Indigenous woman to serve in federal parliament. It is a wonderful portrait and the first in the Parliament House historic memorials collection to be painted by an Indigenous artist, Dr Jandamarra Cadd. Peris was painted as she appeared while delivering her first speech to the Senate, her feet bare, and firmly on the ground, representing her Indigenous ancestors who walked before her. Even Scott Morrison can\u2019t do this any more. Question time ends. Meanwhile, Christian Porter starts shuddering and is unsure why. Vince Connelly, having apparently attended the cut-price Kenneth Branagh school of theatrical delivery, stands for the next dixer \u2013 and actually does some stretches. I am not exaggerating. It\u2019s like watching Ned Flanders prepare to deliver Hamlet\u2019s monologue. And we are done with this part, but the torture continues with question time to also continue. Tony Pasin and Vince Connelly both made beelines for the frontbench in this division. We are at the side-swapping part of this farce, which is fun, if only to see which backbencher takes the opportunity to sidle up next to a minister. We have had eight \u201cflounderings\u201d today. I think there were four or five in the motion speech alone. It may be too late, Mathias. The book draft is in. Fun fact, I just learned that flounder is to struggle walking, either in water or mud, while founder is to sink to the bottom. The motion: MEMBER I seek leave to move the following motion \u2014 That the House: notes that: a) the International Monetary Fund has slashed its growth forecast for the Australian economy for this year by almost 20 per cent; b) the downgrade to Australia\u2019s growth forecast by the International Monetary Fund is four times worse than the downgrade to advanced economies; c) the Government has consistently ignored growing evidence that the Australian economy is floundering, including: d) the slowest economic growth in a decade; the worst wages growth on record; a record 1.9 million Australians being unemployed or underemployed; a decline in GDP per capita last year, with flat growth in the last quarter; record levels of household debt; consumer confidence at a four-year low; business confidence well below average; and sluggish productivity growth; e) the International Monetary Fund has called on countries, including Australia, to provide fiscal support, saying \u201cMonetary policy cannot be the only game in town and should be coupled with fiscal support where fiscal space is available\u201d; and f) the Government has no plan to address Australia\u2019s floundering economy and continues to ignore calls from the Reserve Bank of Australia and the International Monetary Fund to provide fiscal support, including by investing in infrastructure; and g) therefore, calls on the Prime Minister to be straight with the Australian people about Australia\u2019s floundering economy and develop a plan to stimulate economic growth, including by bringing forward infrastructure investment across the nation including in regional and rural Australia. Anthony Albanese is now moving to suspend standing orders to acknowledge the IMF report and the slowing economy. This will fail, because Labor does not have the numbers in the House, but it does mean he can enter Labor\u2019s talking points on this into the Hansard. Alan Tudge is now talking about pipelines. My split ends have never looked so interesting. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Australia\u2019s growth forecast is being repeatedly slashed. Why can\u2019t the prime minister give a straight answer and admit this basic fact, why does the prime minister have no plan to deal with the floundering economy he presides over? Morrison: Again, in early answers to questions I have acknowledged the revisions in the forecast. And as we go into Myefo the forecast will be considered at that time as they are... I know the leader of the opposition isn\u2019t terribly familiar with the processes of budgets, having never served in those portfolios when he was in government, but I\u2019m sure he is becoming familiar with them now in his new role. I am asked about the government\u2019s plan. And one of the things that occurred after the 18 May this year was the huge sigh of relief of those whose jobs and investments and businesses depended on strong and capable financial and economic management. The sense of fear on behalf of the Australian people about the Australian economy, if it were to fall into the hands of the Labor party, was absolutely palpable, and so Australians were looking for a stable and secure plan. A plan that we had set out in the budget, a plan which for the first time coming back into surplus in 12 years. A budget surplus that has been established as a result of the hard work of Australians out there each and every day, of 1.4 million Australians coming into work, of having the lowest level of welfare... ... I am happy to talk about the plan that was endorsed by the Australian people and was set out in the budget, which was for lower taxes, allowing Australians to keep more of what they own. A plan that was opposed by the Labor party at the last election, violently opposed by the Labor party, and instead wanted to put forward $387bn in higher taxes to impose on the Australian economy at the worst possible time because the global circumstance that Australia faces today were of no mystery to the Australian government and the Liberal and National parties. But they were obviously a complete mystery to the Labor party because they thought the best thing to do was to apply $387bn in higher taxes. Investments in infrastructure, skills, expanding other trade capabilities, reduction in business regulation and making it easier to reduce regulation on how people can be employed. And when do we have to wait to hear what Labor\u2019s policies are? As I was referring in a previous question, the leader of the opposition has said that we will know about Labor\u2019s policies before the next election is some time before the end of 2021... what their tax policies are. But the Australian people know what our policies are, Mr Speaker, and they voted for them and we will keep implementing them. If it is any indication of how this question time is going, a member of the public who resembles Hulk Hogan and is sitting in the gallery has managed to capture the attention of a vast bulk of the MPs sitting in the chamber. Josh Frydenberg is yelling about something, but again no one is listening. I do not get paid enough for this. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: When global factors help our economy, the prime minister takes credit. But when global factors hinder our economy the prime minister says it is not his doing. When will the prime minister be honest about the floundering economy and admit he doesn\u2019t have a plan to deal with it? Morrison: From Wayne Swan\u2019s [protege], they are rich words indeed. The Australian government, and this government, when we see the global conditions that face the economy, I\u2019ll tell you what we do. What we don\u2019t do is what the former treasurer did, for whom the member previously worked, was we would not go out there and assume those conditions to exist for ever. I will ignore the interjections, Mr Speaker. Now, Mr Speaker, when Labor were budgeting and there were resource prices of $180, what they did in their budget was they assumed those good times on those resources prices would be there for ever. And on the basis of that, a treasurer under Labor came here and said for four years of surpluses I announced tonight. The difference between how Labor budgets and Liberals budget, when times are good we don\u2019t always assume they will be that way globally. We actually factor that in with conservative forecasts. So that is why in the last three years we have seen an improvement on the original budget outcome because of the conservative estimates that have been built into the budget. We have overachieved each and every year. And the reason we do that is that we do not take the global environment for granted. And when the global environment takes a downturn, that equally has an impact, but in our budget we have been taking that into account for many years that that was a prospect, and that was the budget that we took to the election and that is what is in surplus now*. So those opposite, when times are better they think they will go on forever, and you can never assume that things will go on well forever under a Labor party because they always know how to wreck the economy and wreck the budget with reckless spending and policies of panic and crisis. We will take a calm and methodical measure to the nation\u2019s finances to make sure we can be there to provide the resilience for those services and the future. *the budget is balanced, and forecast to be in surplus, but it is not in surplus just now Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: The treasurer said a moment ago that drought funding was the number one call on the budget. That is not true, is it? Frydenberg: It is true. Thank you. That sparks a war of words between Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison across the desk at each other. It seems quite intense. Albanese is now conferring with Jim Chalmers about something on a bit of paper. Frydenberg has moved on to a dixer, but no one is even pretending to listen. Except for Tim Wilson, who is just yelling \u2018shame\u2019 at random intervals. The entire chamber is treating this answer like the teacher has just left the room unsupervised for a moment. I swear to Riri, every time I look down in that chamber some face I have never seen before pops up. One of those faces sends Michael McCormack to the dispatch box. Enough said. Adam Bandt to Scott Morrison: The Bureau of Meteorology has said the Murray-Darling Basin is in record drought, the climate crisis is a significant factor. Your government is lifting pollution, which is making global warming worse, threatening farmers and communities on the land further. Prime minister, if we have always been a land of droughts and flooding rain, why are you doing everything in your power to make these extreme events worse? Doesn\u2019t every piece of thermal coal you explore and burn send another farmer to the wall? What is more important, crops or coal? Morrison: I would refer him to the speech I gave to the UN, recently, in the national statement for Australia, which set out clearly the actions Australia has taken, and our record, in particular in relation to renewable energy investments, which per capita is the highest of any country in the world today. I note the member for Melbourne shaking his head. I simply said that Australian per capita investment in renewable energy is the highest in the world today. He shook his head. If he is in denial of those facts I will leave that to him. What I know is what I set out in that national statement at the United Nations, which showed we will meet our Kyoto 2020 targets, we will beat them by 367 million tonnes. We will meet our 2030 commitments, through the combination of measures we have announced, and other factors will contribute to that, out to 2030. We agree there is a need to take action on climate change. That was not an issue of debate or division between the major parties at the last election. The issue that was at debate being contested was the scale and the level of targets that could be responsibly set for Australia into the future, and the impact that would have on the Australian economy. At the election we were able to explain clearly what the costs of those were, our targets and how we would meet them. The Labor party at the last election were unable to do that, unable to spell out what the cost would be two jobs. This was a key issue. He continues talking about what the party who is not in government is doing. Because, that is what we do now. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: My question is to the treasurer. Why does the treasurer pretend the global factors are the primary reason for our floundering economy, when the Reserve Bank and others say Australia\u2019s weak economic growth is homegrown? Frydenberg: YOU TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO TALK DOWN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY. We are back to yelling. And also describing the economy as a snowflake. Scott Morrison is now reading from a handwritten answer for this lickspittle, which is an achievement, given it covers the entire government manifesto. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the prime minister. Will the prime minister admit that since May the Reserve Bank has downgraded its growth forecast for Australia. The OECD has downgraded its growth forecast for Australia by twice as much as the G20, and the IMF has downgraded its growth forecast for Australia by four times more than other advanced economies. Why doesn\u2019t the government have a plan to turn the economy around? (Spoiler: No, he won\u2019t admit that.) Morrison: Our plan is very clear and we took it to the last election, it was endorsed by the Australian people, and that plan is anchored first and foremost not in the panicked and crisis policies of the Labor party, which if they had had the opportunity in the last election they would be now taking a wrecking ball to the Australian economy with their higher taxes and their reckless spending. No, the Australian people chose stability and certainty of keeping more of what they earn, of ensuring that those tax cuts would be delivered and that is exactly what we delivered as soon as we got back into this place. And Labor resisted it and resisted it and resisted it, and they folded as usual. They can\u2019t even keep the consistency and the opposition to good economic policy. I mean, at least Morrison has admitted that Labor voted for the tax cuts. Scott Morrison is now explaining why \u201cnow is not the time for Labor\u2019s policies\u201d. Has someone told him that we are at the very beginning of the election cycle and the only way Labor\u2019s policies would be enacted is if the government adopted them? There has been a bit of commentary around that the government still hasn\u2019t switched out of election mode \u2013 I think that is just going to get louder. Looks like someone missed the jump \u2013 Jim Chalmers gets the next question: The prime minister just stated the downgrades of the IMF apply to everyone. Why is the downgrade for Australia\u2019s growth four times worse than for other advanced economies? Josh Frydenberg: The IMF today in its global economic outlook had Australia\u2019s economic growth in 2019 at 1.7%, and in 2020 at 2.3% and, as the House knows, Australia\u2019s in its 29th consecutive year of economic growth. Mr Speaker, employment growth in Australia is at 2.5%. Do you know what it was when we came to government? 0.7%, Mr Speaker. Less than one-third of what we have inherited today. Economic participation, the number of people who are in work, is at a record high. Over 66%, Mr Speaker. The welfare dependency today is now at a 30-year low, Mr Speaker. Frydenberg did not raise his voice once in that one. *snaps* Anthony Albanese: Why has the IMF slashed Australia\u2019s economic growth forecast this calendar year? Scott Morrison: The revision by the IMF overnight reflects the uncertainty of the times in which we live, Mr Speaker, and that uncertainty extends to the global environment, which I would hope the opposition would be familiar with. We have been fashioning budgets for years to deal with the increasing uncertainty in the global economic climate. He will also be familiar with the real impact on the economy of the terrible drought that is now impacting on the Australian economy. And this is why, Mr Speaker, over successive budgets now we have been putting in place the types of resilience measures that support our economy in times like these. And the uncertainty of the times reflected in the IMF forecast revisions overnight, which obviously applies to a whole host of economies all around the world, that is just a fact, that is just a fact, the truth remains that while things are tough Australia\u2019s economy is growing only second to the United States of all G7 nations. (Once again, we are not part of the G7.) There is a lot of work to do, but in uncertain times, I\u2019d tell you what it calls for. It calls for lower taxes, which is what we are doing, Mr Speaker. It calls us for reducing the cost of doing business in this country, and amplifying procedures in the industrial areas, to engage in reforms and our skill sector, to ensure that we are expanding our trade borders all around the world as we have been doing now over the last six years. It calls us to invest $100bn in infrastructure as we are doing, and that is just for infrastructure, with some almost $10bn invested just this year alone, Mr Speaker. And it calls on us to invest $200bn in the future to recapitalise in our defence industries, as we heard yesterday in south-western Sydney, $250,000 worth of value added is provided by Quickstep, an Australian company, into every joint strike fighter that will be flown by every country that purchased them around the world. These are our investment decisions to address these uncertain times. Those opposite think the answer is higher taxes, and they think higher taxes will have no impact on the economy, and the leader of the opposition was asked today whether he thought Labor\u2019s high taxes would have had an impact on the economy, and he said no! He said I don\u2019t think they would. He said the answer was no, in response to the tax increases they have proposed when it comes to the housing tax. So, Mr Speaker, we are for lower taxes, a stronger economy and a strong budget. That exchange there is how question time is going to play out. But let\u2019s see. Tim Wilson was just building up to his big \u2018climate protesters are terrible\u2019 speech conclusion when Anthony Albanese interjected to say it was 2pm and therefore question time. Saved by the bell. Here is Katie Allen on the IMF report on the ABC: To be fair, we are in a new economic environment. Economists are telling us we should do this and that but it is difficult to know what is going to be the best thing going forward when you think about the global situation. We know that at the Australian level, we have the right plan going forward and that has actually been voted for by the Australian people and that is what they want to see, a budget that is in balance ... and delivering jobs and we\u2019re doing that. We need to be very, very careful about trade and implications there, to make sure we are building a trade portfolio and our relationships with other countries is diversified. So that when the headwinds turn and take us in the right direction, we are ready to take those opportunities and move forward. And Pat Conroy\u2019s response: This is a government intent on media releases rather than conducting real action. We have the slowest economic growth in Australia since 2001. 1.8 million Australians out of work or wanting more hours. We have productivity going backwards and for the first time in a long time, net disposable income, real disposable income fell by 1% so we have households getting poorer as we speak. What we need is urgent action by the Government to bring forward stage two of the tax cuts which we say we would support. They have announced infrastructure spending but it is often on the never-never and not now. What the bank and independent commentators say is that we need a government to play its part and stimulate the economy now. When I walk down my high street and shopping centres, there are a lot of people looking for work is not finding it and a lot of empty shops. This from Jim Chalmers this morning is probably a good indication of where we will see Labor head this question time, methinks: Last night the IMF substantially slashed their expectations for growth in the Australian economy. These new numbers absolutely torpedo what was left of the Morrison Government\u2019s economic credibility. The Australian economy is floundering and the IMF is slashing its forecasts for Australia because Morrison and Frydenberg don\u2019t have a plan to turn things around. For months now Josh Frydenberg has been pretending that the economy here is strong and that the policy settings are right, but what the IMF proves is that neither of those things are true. The IMF is ringing the alarm bells on the Australian economy but Morrison and Frydenberg are too out of touch to hear them. What we need to see from the Government is a plan to turn around an economy which is floundering on their watch. The Australian economy is floundering and people are struggling, and the Morrison Government is just sitting on its hands doing nothing. They don\u2019t have a clue what to do here and so they\u2019re doing nothing. They can\u2019t continue to leave all of the heavy lifting to the Reserve Bank. The IMF makes the point in their report that there\u2019s been too much emphasis on interest rate cuts and not enough fiscal policy or budget changes from governments, including our own. Morrison and Frydenberg need to listen to the alarm bells which are being rung by the IMF. The IMF has slashed their expectations for growth in this economy under this Liberal Government. What we need to see is a plan to turn things around. The absence of a plan so far is costing Australia in terms of economic growth and jobs. We have the slowest economic growth in this country that we\u2019ve had in 10 years since the Global Financial Crisis; household debt is at record highs; almost two million Australians are looking for work or for more work; productivity and living standards are in decline; business investment is the lowest it\u2019s been since the early 1990s recession. Wherever you look in this economy there is weakness which is being left unattended by a Morrison Government without a plan. We are getting close to question time ... I don\u2019t even need predictions today. It will all be economy, economy, economy. There is no way it can be anything else. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, has held a press conference and indicated the government may negotiate with the Labor party to win over their support for three new trade agreements. Enabling legislation for the deals was introduced to the House of Representatives today. Labor is likely to support the enabling legislation, but the unions are pushing back hard and have been lobbying MPs and the crossbench not to vote in support of the agreements because of concerns over the deals allowing more temporary workers into the country. When asked if the government was prepared to negotiate with the opposition to win over support, as has occurred with previous trade deals, Birmingham said the government would take a \u201cpractical\u201d approach. \u201cWe are practical and of course I will always speak with my Labor counterparts, I am genuine when I say that I hope that bipartisanship can be maintained in relation to trade access and opportunities,\u201d he said. As part of this, Birmingham said the government was considering the recommendations made by the joint standing committee on treaties which reported on the agreements last week. \u201cWe will engage in discussions with the opposition where necessary, and we will work through issues if need be in a sensible way, but the agreements as they stand are good agreements that are demonstrably in Australia\u2019s national interest.\u201d In response to union warnings that the agreements would undermine Australian jobs and allow an influx of temporary workers, Birmingham said the movement needed to \u201cstop misleading, stop lying\u201d. \u201cI say to the union movement very clearly there are no new labour market testing waivers created as a result of the Indonesian free trade agreement, point blank,\u201d he said. \u201cSo stop the scare campaign and recognise that this agreement has been negotiated to create more Australian jobs by giving us a better chance to sell more goods and services into Indonesia.\u201d Birmingham said he hoped the enabling legislation for the agreements could pass the Senate by the end of the year, allowing the deals to come into force early in 2020. Question: You spent $2.5m on the election campaign this year. GetUp targeted six Coalition Liberal MPs. Peter Dutton, Greg Hunt, Tony Abbott, Kevin Andrews and Christian Porter. Tony Abbott lost his seat, and many people say that GetUp had little influence on that because he was responsible for his own unpopularity. Do you bear responsibility, then, for the fact that your millions didn\u2019t unseat any of the other MPs and, in fact, there\u2019s an argument that people have put that GetUp\u2019s presence, for example, in Dixon, had the opposite effect. It boosted Peter Dutton\u2019s popularity? Paul Oosting: Firstly, that\u2019s not right. Peter Dutton faced a much smaller swing than other parts of Queensland. And whilst it\u2019s true to say, it\u2019s undoubtedly a fact, that we\u2019re sitting here today having not achieved our objectives in the election campaign, and we\u2019ve been reflecting on that and how we can work differently going forward, I\u2019m proud of the campaign that we ran together. We all fed in what our priorities should be, what the issues we should work on, where the energies go on, and we chose the hard right faction of the Coalition. Many of those are in what are traditionally deemed to be safe seats. With where things were going or where we thought they would go. How we do things differently if we had the opportunity again. But we have come out of it with real strengths as we outlined in the speech. We have a lot to be proud of in the 10,000 people, almost half of whom have stepped up into politics for the very first time, who have really broadened and deepened this movement, and they\u2019re more passionate than ever to keep getting involved and not waiting for that. Getting involved right now, we have to find a solution to the major crises that are facing our country \u2013 unemployment and the climate crisis. The IPCC says that we have 12 years left to address climate change. Three of the years will occur under this government, so we have to move on from the election that occurred five months ago and continue to try to find ways to look at the issues our members care about. I guess this is never getting old: Paul Oosting: It\u2019s fair to say that Australians have a healthy scepticism about politicians, but something else is afoot today. Not the normal, healthy suspicion that\u2019s always been part of our political culture. A much deeper anger across the whole system. A University of Canberra study showed that it crashed from 86% in 2007 to just 41% last year. And that was before the change of prime minister. We saw that first hand, actually, almost 10,000 GetUp volunteers with 37,404 hours simply talking to people, on their phones and in their doorsteps, in nearly every state, in nearly every demographic about the issues that matter, the policy options and why they should vote for change. What we found, though, was alarming. It\u2019s as if something had snapped. We were shaken by the depth of hopelessness and cynicism across the community, like politics which is something that\u2019s been tried, failed and they\u2019ve given up. People were only half joking when they asked what the prime minister\u2019s name was. They talked about their frustrations that nobody listens to them because they don\u2019t have bags of money to throw around. They despaired about the lack of any vision to tackle the big complex problems like unemployment, climate change or the drought. Politics seems now, singularly, incapable of addressing these things, and many Australians feel powerless to do anything about it. Many no longer believe politics can make anything in their lives better. GetUp\u2019s national director, Paul Oosting, is about to address the National Press Club. The ABC, which broadcasts the National Press Club address, jumped the gun a little too early, and we were all treated to a lovely shot of an empty studio chair. Given how dull this week has been from a parliamentary point of view, that rates as exciting. Leave me alone. Excellent and very well-deserved news. Eryk Bagshaw works for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. He\u2019s off to be their China correspondent very soon. The treasurer is correct to say that the IMF projects Australia\u2019s GDP growth this year will be faster than any G7 nation except the USA. But we of course are not part of the G7; we are part of the OECD, and of the 34 member nations, our growth is projected to be the 19th best. Not quite so impressive. Meanwhile, a report from Anglicare has their multiple applications for each entry-level job. From Luke Henriques-Gomes At least five people are applying for every entry-level position advertised as Australia\u2019s most disadvantaged jobseekers are forced to compete against growing numbers of underemployed people for a dwindling number of suitable jobs, a report has found. Anglicare\u2019s annual Jobs Availability Snapshot, released on Wednesday, found there were 5.49 people competing for each entry-level job, while one in seven jobseekers faced difficulties getting into work such as a disability or minimal education. Josh Frydenberg also backed Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s defence of the Snowy 2.0 project: I think it\u2019s very clear that it will have significant benefits to the Australian energy market, providing power for more than 500,000 homes. Helping to stablise the growing intermittent energy that is coming into the system - particularly wind and solar. And Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s absolutely right - that there are vested interests that want to poo-poo this project, because it may affect their own particular plans. But the reality is, Australia, over the years has not provided enough storage in our energy market. And Snowy 2.0 is a nation-building project that will be really important on the eastern sea board in stabilising the housing market.\u201d Question: Why is there so much on the balanced budget? If the economic conditions in Australia turn down further, presumably the government will stimulate the economy. And aren\u2019t you exposing yourself to the Wayne Swann problem? He promised us an iron-clad surplus, which Labor couldn\u2019t deliver for a variety of reasons. Aren\u2019t you exposing yourself and the government to the same risk? Josh Frydenberg: Surpluses are not ends in themselves. They\u2019re not trophies on a cabinet table. They\u2019re actually an indication of strong budget management and helping to build the resilience in the Australian economy so you can weather those economic shocks. I mean, if Peter Costello and John Howard hadn\u2019t paid back Labor\u2019s debt, could you imagine the trouble* that Labor would have had, more so than they even did, through that GFC? The fact that the Coalition left government under Howard and Costello with zero government debt, money in the bank and budget surpluses, gave Labor that fiscal flexibility to spend through that cycle when the shock hit. So really, a strong budget position is not mutually exclusive from having a strong economy. They come together. And the fact that we\u2019ve seen record job creation and the lowest welfare dependency in Australia in 30 years is actually an indication of good decision-making, good economic management, which is going to help to protect us into the future. *the \u2018trouble\u2019 would have been slightly higher interest payments on government debt Question: You\u2019re saying \u201cstay the course\u201d not \u201cchange the course\u201d in light of growth rates below 2%. Does that mean that you\u2019re prepared to accept growth rates below 2%? Josh Frydenberg: Let\u2019s wait until we see the September national account numbers. But we do know that the Australian economy is facing some significant headwinds. The global headwinds are real, and you\u2019ve seen that in the IMF report today, and their description of a synchronised slowdown. The impact of the drought, which has taken 0.25% straight off GDP, but has seen significant funding being required by the federal government. So we do face these challenges. But we have lower taxes, putting more money into people\u2019s pockets. We have record spending on infrastructure. We have the plan to create 80,000 new apprenticeships, and we\u2019re entering into the free-trade agreements which are also ensuring greater opportunities for Australian businesses. So that is our economic plan, and that is a plan that has also seen the budget come into balance for the first time in 11 years. Josh Frydenberg is speaking on the IMF report, downgrading Australia\u2019s growth rate from 2.1% to 1.4% It is now more important than ever that we stay the course with considered, disciplined and responsible economic management. Economic management that sees Australia in its 29th consecutive year of economic growth. With a triple A credit rating that only 10 developed nations have. With a strong labour market which has seen more than 1.4 million new jobs being created. And with the first balanced budget in 11 years. Today, the IMF has confirmed that the Australian economy will grow faster than any G7 nation, except the United States. Now, our economic plan will see the Australian economy continue to grow with lower taxes, record spending on infrastructure, providing the workforce with the skills that they need, cutting red tape and entering into new free-trade agreements, which has already seen businesses have greater access to some two billion new customers. And we will ensure a strong economy and a strong budget position, because it is critical to the resilience of the Australian economy, as we fails the global headwinds. Peter Dutton has tabled a statement on his decision to exercise his medevac discretion to refuse a transfer (as is required by the legislation): REFUSAL STATEMENT UNDER SECTION 198J OF THE MIGRATION ACT 1958 On 11 October 2019,1, PETER DUTTON, Minister for Home Affairs made a decision under section 198G(2) of the Migration Act 1958 to refuse to approve the transfer of an accompanying family member from Nauru to Australia. I made this decision because I reasonably believe the accompanying family member would expose the Australian community to a serious risk of criminal conduct and should not be transferred to Australia. The Department of Home Affairs (Department) has advised me that the accompanying family member has a history of violent and manipulative behaviour, including allegations of physical assault against his children, been investigated by Nauruan Police Force for criminal activity, engaged in military service in Iran and that the Department has been unable to verify his identity. Pursuant to section 198G(5), in deciding to refuse to approve the accompanying family member\u2019s transfer, I have had regard to the best interests of the adult transferee who it was recommended he should accompany. I have approved the transfer of a separate family member to accompany the adult transferee from Nauru to Australia. In addition, the adult transferee has other family members in Australia. Katharine Murphy has written up the latest Essential poll (yes, I know, all caveats about polls) and it has some interesting takeouts: While national politics frets about its trust crisis, the bulk of Australian voters appear reasonably sanguine with both of the major parties five months on from the federal election, with more than 60% of the Guardian Essential sample rating the performance of the Coalition and Labor as excellent, good or fair. The latest survey of 1,088 respondents shows 63% are positive about the Coalition\u2019s performance post-election and 62% say the same about Labor, although Coalition voters are more positive about the government than Labor voters are about Labor, with 93% of Coalition voters affirming the government and 83% of Labor voters affirming the opposition. Scott Morrison remains comfortably ahead of Anthony Albanese as preferred prime minister, although the Labor leader has made up ground over the past month. Morrison is preferred as prime minister by 43% of the sample to Albanese\u2019s 28%, which is a three-point improvement for the Labor leader. Josh Frydenberg is holding a press conference at 10.15am in the Senate courtyard. You can expect the official government response to the IMF report, there. Meanwhile, a report looking at federal MPs\u2019 attitudes to democractic reform is being released today. Paul Karp has had a look at the report, here: And from the statement: The report is the fifth in a series of reports developed by Democracy 2025 that examine how to strengthen democratic practice and bridge the trust divide in Australia. The director of Democracy 2025, Professor Mark Evans, will present the report at a special event at Parliament House. ... Democracy 2025 is an initiative of MoAD\u2014in partnership with the Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis at the University of Canberra\u2014that is strengthening democratic practice through research, dialogue and innovation. For more information visit www.democracy2025.gov.au. The timing of the Courier Mail article comes as the government works to woo Jacqui Lambie, the swing vote, to repeal the medevac legislation, which was passed against its will in the last minority parliament. A Senate inquiry into the laws will be handed down on Friday. But the Senate won\u2019t vote on the repeal legislation until it sits in again in November. Kristina Keneally says Peter Dutton\u2019s enacting of the security safeguard shows the legislation is working: Why did Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton claim people of bad character could be transferred to Australia under medevac when it\u2019s clear they have the powers to deny such transfers? Under medevac, the minister can refuse a transfer on security or serious character grounds and this decision does not get reviewed and cannot be overturned. In fact, before medevac, the courts were deciding medical transfers on health grounds only, not even taking into consideration security concerns. Peter Dutton is so desperate to distract from the 95,000 airplane people who have arrived on his watch, he\u2019s boasting about using a power Labor ensured was in place to keep security threats out of the country. Labor strongly supports medevac. Medevac is working. These laws should not be repealed by the government.\u201d Why is all of that interesting? Well, because the government, including Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison, have said they don\u2019t have the power to stop people under medevac. In June, in an interview with David Speers on Sky News, Dutton said: DS: You did warn, of course, at the time rapists, paedophiles, murders might come in. You know, I know you were asked about this on Sunday \u2013 have you yet established whether any have? PD: I think there are some people that have come of bad character, David. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that, and under Labor\u2019s law ... DS: Amongst this 30 \u2013 are there any rapists, murders, paedophiles? PD: Well, we\u2019ll have a look at the details in due course, and I\u2019d make this point though. The point made by the Labor party \u2013 and you heard a bit of the rhetoric in the previous interview \u2013 people of bad character can come, are able to come and, in fact, are required to come under Labor\u2019s laws that they passed. That\u2019s the reality. So, if you\u2019ve got a national security check ... DS: And you\u2019re saying there are people of bad character who have come amongst that 30? PD: I\u2019m saying there are some \u2013 there are some people of bad character who have come to our country. DS: What sort of bad character? PD: Well, I\u2019ll go into those details at the appropriate time, David, but what I\u2019m worried about now \u2013 particularly out of this court decision, and particularly out of Labor saying that they won\u2019t support us in the parliament to repeal this bad law \u2013 I am worried about many more cases coming through, and I think many of those people were believing, as the refugee advocates told them, that Labor would win the election, and that they would be here in significant numbers in big uplifts overnight, and that they\u2019d be living in Australia. The Courier Mail had this story this morning: Peter Dutton will use his powers for the first time under the medevac legislation to keep out a violent Iranian asylum seeker \u2013 accused of running a prostitution ring \u2013 after doctors ordered three family members be sent to Australia. In shock revelations, doctors approved an adult Iranian woman on Nauru to be sent to Australia for treatment and be accompanied by her brother and father, who do not need medical attention. The article mentions \u201cinterventionist\u201d doctors and Dutton having to step in on security grounds. Which actually just proves that the medevac legislation the government is attempting to repeal has the safeguards in it to allow ministers to step in and stop transfers on national security grounds. Which is outlined in this explainer from Murph: Ministerial discretion applies in three areas. First, the minister can refuse the transfer if he or she disagrees with the clinical assessment. The second grounds for refusal is if the minister reasonably suspects that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security \u201cwithin the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act\u201d. Sticking with security, the transfer can also be knocked back if Asio advises the minister that transfer of the person to Australia may be prejudicial to security \u201cand that threat cannot be mitigated\u201d. The third grounds for refusal is if the minister knows that the transferee has a substantial criminal record and the minister reasonably believes the person would expose the Australian community to a serious risk of criminal conduct. The bells are sounding off. Parliament is about to begin. Jim Chalmers was out at doors this morning to talk about the IMF downgrade. Our economic problems in Australia are still primarily home-grown. That\u2019s a point that Deloitte Access Economics has made. It\u2019s a point that the Reserve Bank has made. We\u2019ve had issues in the Australian economy for some time now which preceded the trade tensions between the Americans and the Chinese, for example. When Josh Frydenberg tries to blame international conditions for this downgrade today, remember that the Australian downgrade in these new numbers is four times bigger than the downgrade for the other advanced economies as a whole. Speaking of the drought, Sarah Martin has looked at what some of the money for drought-stricken councils is being spent on: Music festivals, cemetery upgrades, public toilets and a virtual gym are among the hundreds of projects to receive federal grants under the government\u2019s signature Drought Communities Program. As the government fends off criticism of its national drought response, a Guardian Australia analysis of $100m in grants awarded under the program in 2019 shows that while many shires have used the grant program for water infrastructure projects, much of the funding has been spent on events, the purchase of equipment and maintenance work. My colleague Josh Taylor has been reading some of the federation chamber speeches from last night, and found this one from Ed Husic criticising the government for not doing enough to combat rightwing extremism: The point is this: I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Islamist-inspired or supremacist-inspired, if it represents a threat to the Australian people it should be taken seriously. And I\u2019m telling you now, based on the briefings I\u2019ve received, we are not taking this seriously. We reckon that we\u2019re only following a few people on this issue here in this country. I have the greatest respect for what our security agencies and intelligence agencies are doing. But we also know in this day and age, with the rise of the lone wolf, we can\u2019t track these people easily. We need to take this seriously. We need to deal with it now. You\u2019ll find the rest of that on page 104 on that link Tanya Plibersek has spotted the Marshall Islands announcement: I\u2019m sure these students are hardworking and clever, but what our Pacific Island neighbours need most from Scott Morrison is serious action to combat climate change, not a student exchange program. The students will also be working on developing strategies and programs to help communities deal with the coming impacts to their environment. Which is great. What would also be great is having Australia, as a leader in the region, actually develop a proper emissions-reduction policy of its own. The department of health team won the Big Issue street soccer competition against the politician\u2019s team, 6-nil, in the final this morning. The press gallery side came fourth. Mike Bowers also tells me that Brendan O\u2019Connor also struggled with the rules. David Speers was farewelled by his Sky News colleagues overnight. Speersy has been an institution of the press gallery for the past two decades. He is moving to Melbourne to take over the Insiders reins, which he\u2019ll pick up officially early next year. While there were lots of lovely moments, the loveliest was probably when Speers paid tribute to his colleagues, particularly his long-term camera operator, Geoff Crane. The relationship between journalists and photographers and camera operators is more like a marriage. You spend more time with them in these sorts of jobs than your own partner most of the year. You see each other at your best and worse. You don\u2019t have to think because they do it for you. You turn around, and they are already there, capturing what your words can\u2019t. Journalists most definitely get the better side of the deal \u2013 we could not do our jobs without the visual artists who help hold us up. But they would be just fine without us. I couldn\u2019t do this blog without Mike Bowers (please don\u2019t tell him that, it\u2019ll upset our entire dynamic) and for many journalists, broadcast ones in particular, the cameramen and women we work with are absolute heroes. So it was lovely to see that relationship celebrated by two of the best last night. The drought response continues to be a bone of contention. Joel Fitzgibbon has put out this statement: In response to my question in Parliament yesterday, the Prime Minister said: \u201cThe Future Drought Fund is not to provide direct financial assistance payments to farmers. It\u2019s there to provide direct support for water resilience projects to plan for the future.\u201d His admission exposes his claim that he\u2019s spending $7 billion assisting drought-affected farming families. He is spending nothing like that and he should come clean. Expect more on that today, as well. Marise Payne has welcomed the release of Jock Palfreeman from a Bulgarian detention centre, but remains \u201cconcerned, however, that Mr Palfreeman continues to be denied the right to return to Australia, having being granted parole in September\u201d. Palfreeman, who was given permission to return to Australia by a court, has had his passport confiscated. Payne has officially called on the Bulgarian government to afford Palfreeman \u201cdue process, consistent with Bulgarian law\u201d. You might remember this tweet from the minister in assistance to the president of Marshall Islands, David Paul, in response to Michael McCormack\u2019s comments about criticism from our Pacific neighbours over Australia\u2019s response to climate change. Well, it turns out the government is now sending students to the Marshall Islands to study \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u201cthe impact of climate change on local communities\u201d. I kid you not. Marise Payne and Dan Tehan announced the New Colombo Plan\u2019s 2020 Mobility Program yesterday where \u201c11,196 undergraduates from 40 Australian universities to complete short-term study and work-based experiences in 36 locations across the Indo-Pacific\u201d. From their release on the cross-cultural education program: We have increased awards for Australian undergraduates to engage with Pacific nations by 15 per cent over the previous round. Fiji, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea are the most popular Pacific destinations, with the Republic of the Marshall Islands to host New Colombo Plan Mobility Program students for the first time in 2020. Over the next three years, 75 undergraduates will study the impact of climate change on local communities in the Marshall Islands and develop projects to support sustainability and resilience. Cool beans. You can read more of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s response to the Snowy 2.0 criticism on his Twitter feed. You can argue the toss over whether or not he is right \u2013 again, he was invested in this project, and so he is not exactly impartial on this. But it would have been nice to see more of this Turnbull \u2013 defending what he believes in and calling out vested interests \u2013 as prime minister. It was probably the project Malcolm Turnbull was most excited about when he was prime minister. Properly authentically excited. So it is no surprise that Turnbull would come to the defence of Snowy 2.0 in the face of reports of cost blowouts and questions about its use. Turnbull went on a bit of a tweet storm overnight. Here\u2019s a taste. You don\u2019t have to have the government talking points to know the lines on the IMF report have most definitely been released. This was Paul Fletcher on ABC this morning: Let\u2019s be clear. We have a sound economy, AAA credit rating, we have been growing, 29th year in a row, of growth, growing faster than every G7 country except the US and we have a clear plan to maintain our economic position. We have got the lowest rate of welfare dependency. Getting the budget back to in balance this year and then getting it back to surplus is the plan. We won\u2019t be spooked by international conditions. We\u2019ll stick to our plan. Question: I\u2019ll ask the question again, it\u2019s not great though, a figure of 1.7% from the body like the IMF? PF: Let us be clear, our economy is growing, it\u2019s been growing for 29 years. Question: But not fast enough? PF: [Last year] A range of countries, Singapore, Germany and the UK were in negative growth. We are in positive growth, we have been growing for 29 years. We have a clear plan to maintain the economic position, including $100bn of infrastructure, personal tax cuts and reducing welfare dependency. We want to maintain that. Let\u2019s be clear \u2013 nothing says \u201cthis is a practised line\u201d like putting \u201clet\u2019s be clear\u201d, \u201cthe reality is\u201d or \u201cthe fact of the matter is\u201d at the beginning of said practised line. Well, Jim Chalmers woke up with an extra spring in his step today, with the news Australia\u2019s economic growth rate has been downgraded by the IMF, from 2.1% to 1.7%. Those economic headwinds Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have been referring to are on their way. The IMF, like the RBA, want governments to stimulate their economies. Slashing interest rates is not enough. With a decade of low growth forecast across the globe, monetary bodies want to see spending. In a statement sent out very early this morning, Chalmers said: The IMF has called on countries, including Australia, to provide fiscal stimulus and invest in infrastructure to support their economy and improve productivity. According to the IMF, \u201cMonetary policy cannot be the only game in town and should be coupled with fiscal support where fiscal space is available.\u201d The IMF\u2019s updated forecasts make a mockery of Josh Frydenberg\u2019s claims that the Morrison Government has the right policy settings. Collapsing confidence and weak growth are the inevitable consequence of a Liberal-National Government which has a political strategy but not an economic policy. We saw signs most obviously last week, that the government is attempting to respond, without being explicit about it. Frydenberg\u2019s meeting with the nation\u2019s treasurers was all about bringing forward lower-tier infrastructure projects, which was essentially a stimulus program, without mentioning the word stimulus. That\u2019s because the government is locked on to delivering its budget operating surplus next year. Which means, for the short term at least, it is steering clear of \u201cstimulus\u201d \u2013 because you shouldn\u2019t have to stimulate a surplus economy. But the warnings are getting louder. So we are on watch and wait here. Mike Bowers is out and about \u2013 he was up early covering the press gallery versus politicians soccer match this morning, which was raising money for the Big Issue (a very good program, and I encourage you, if you can manage it, support your local Big Issue seller). I\u2019ll bring you some of that, and all the other magic he captures throughout the day. You\u2019ll also have Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and the rest of the Guardian Australia brains trust bringing you what happens in this building and beyond. I haven\u2019t had a second coffee, but I have had a ginger nut biscuit for breakfast (unfortunately not a Queensland one, which is obviously the best of all the ginger nuts) so I am as peppy as I can be under the circumstances. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

And it would also interfere with their right to a fair trial in the US, where they are under investigation by the FBI, they said in a legal memorandum filed with the district court in Connecticut. \u201cOnce the cat is out of the bag, it is impossible to put it back without the consequence of tainting a verdict,\u201d they say in the documents. \u201cThis is especially true where the cat is named \u2018Laundromat\u2019 and the charges would include money laundering.\u201d Mossack and Fonseca complain that the trailer for the film, which also stars Meryl Streep as a woman who has lost her husband in a boat accident, makes them out to be \u201cvillains profiting from the death of 20 people killed in the small town boat tour\u201d. They also complain about scenes in the film featuring the pair\u2019s fictionalised alter egos capering in suits covered in currency symbols and showing a sheikh, Russian gangsters and others saying \u201c\u2018shit\u2019 and/or other expletives in different languages\u201d when the files are exposed. \u201cThe implications and innuendo converge to cast plaintiffs in the light of mastermind criminals whose crimes include, but are not limited to, murder, bribery, money laundering and/or corruption,\u201d Mossack and Fonseca say in the court documents. The pair also complain the film lacks permission to use the logo of their firm, which a private investigator hired by them told the court it uses to promote itself on \u201cpens, clocks, speakers, hats, notebooks, notepads, letter openers, wine opening kits, stationary, letterhead, signs, invoices, labels, doors, building facades, clothing, sponsorship signs, pamphlets, [and] coffee cups\u201d. \u201cUltimately, at the hands of the defendant, the plaintiffs unwarrantedly solidify a global finance role as poster children for money laundering and tax evasion, complete with a logo that the defendant ensures will guarantee a mental association with crime and corruption,\u201d Mossack and Fonseca say in the documents. They also attacked the director, Steven Soderbergh, for using offshore film finance vehicles and his press statements that the film did not portray the pair as villains. \u201cTo claim that Mossack and Fonseca and their law firm are not villains in the movie is a cataclysmic understatement, which stands in wholly stark contrast to gist of the movie and the commentary by movie reviewers,\u201d they said in their legal memo. Netflix, which has been approached for comment, is yet to file a defence and a date for a hearing has not been set. Mossack Fonseca shut down in March last year, two years after the release of the Panama Papers thrust the affairs of their clients onto front pages around the world. The 11.5m documents in the cache named a large number of rich and powerful people, sparking investigations around the world. In addition to the Panamanian charges against Mossack and Fonseca, which they are fighting, four men associated with the firm have been charged with tax crimes in the US.",

Leaving aside the music for the moment, Elton\u2019s public and maybe even private persona can be divided into two phases: first there was the raging drugs monster, as extravagantly talented as he was costumed. Now that he\u2019s sober, there\u2019s the more conservatively dressed, happily married elder statesman of British pop, a proper establishment figure, albeit one who\u2019s still unafraid to pick fights with everyone from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/28/quotes-elton-john\" title=\"\">Keith Richards (\u201ca monkey with arthritis\u201d)</a> to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/elton-john-madonna-feud-insults-358794\" title=\"\">Madonna (\u201clooks like a fairground stripper\u201d</a>). Both eras have yielded a steady crop of outstanding Elton anecdotes, often retold by Elton himself, who, possessing the kind of self-knowledge few of his fame and wealth retain, tells his stories better than anyone else. Probably the most infamous of all is the one about the time he\u2019d been up for several days (this, clearly, was from the pre-sobriety era) when he decided something really needed to be sorted out. No, not his devastating drug addiction or his lack of sleep \u2013 the problem was the weather. So he called a chap in his office and told him to sort it out: \u201cIt\u2019s far too windy here, can you do something about it?\u201d</p> <p>Such is the wealth of material he has to choose from, this story gets only a passing mention in his outrageously enjoyable autobiography: \u201cThis is obviously the ideal moment to state once and for all that this story is a complete urban myth. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t tell you that, because the story is completely true,\u201d he writes, with a self-deprecating shrug. And then he moves on to the next tale, which might be about the night he and John Lennon refused to answer the door to Andy Warhol because, as Lennon hissed to Elton: \u201cDo you want him coming in here taking photos when you\u2019ve got icicles of coke hanging out of your nose?\u201d Or it might be about the time Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone nearly came to blows over Princess Diana at one of his dinner parties. That he has celebrity anecdotes to burn is not a surprise. But the self-mocking tone is more unexpected from a musician so grand that at his 2014 wedding party he had one table dedicated solely to the Beatles and their families. Yet while his extraordinary talent justified his personal excesses, it is his self-awareness that has counterbalanced the narcissism and made him such a likable figure. This is, after all, the man who allowed his husband, David Furnish, to make a documentary about him and call it <em>Tantrums and Tiaras</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abe45cd5ea4eff84f0e4665c51e287ab1dd87d96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abe45cd5ea4eff84f0e4665c51e287ab1dd87d96/0_0_1959_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of 12 Royal mail stamps issued as a tribute to the musical contribution of Elton John.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of 12 Royal mail stamps issued as a tribute to the musical contribution of Elton John.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Mail/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So it is entirely and pleasingly right that Elton has called his book, quite simply, <em>Me</em>: not for him any pretentious effort to dress up the navel gazing nature of memoir writing as art or courageous truth-telling. It\u2019s just Elton talking about Elton. It quickly becomes clear in <em>Me</em> that few people are more suited to the celebrity autobiography genre, given that he combines the most essential ingredients of the form. First, his life is still hilariously over the top (tabloid photos of Elton, dressed head to toe in Gucci, tootling about on his yacht with his similarly clad family have become as much of a signifier of summer to me as any number of swallows). Unlike other celebrities who act as if their position on the A-list is only provisional and they therefore mustn\u2019t break the rules of discretion among the famous, Elton cheerfully gossips about everyone from Bob Dylan (terrible at charades, FYI) to David Bowie (\u201cdon\u2019t know what [his] problem was\u201d) as if they were his neighbours in Pinner, where he grew up. He is Joan Collins mixed with Joan Rivers, and if anyone can think of a more delicious combination they are probably deeper than I am. Best of all, he remembers, if not everything, then certainly a lot \u2013 unlike that arthritic monkey, Keith Richards, whose poor ghostwriter, James Fox, \u201chad to do a little sleuthing\u201d to confirm the Rolling Stone\u2019s stories for <em>Life</em>, his 2010 memoir.</p> <p>Elton has his own ghostwriter, of course \u2013 the \u201cauto\u201d in \u201ccelebrity autobiography\u201d is always a loose concept \u2013 in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexispetridis\" title=\"\">Alexis Petridis</a>, this paper\u2019s pop critic. Petridis has a journalist\u2019s eye for the comically absurd, such as Elton\u2019s predilection for sexual voyeurism competing with his innate tidiness (\u201cThey\u2019d end up having sex on the snooker table with me shouting, \u2018Make sure you don\u2019t come on the baize!\u2019 which tended to puncture the atmosphere a bit\u201d), and he makes sure there is a laugh out loud moment on pretty much every other page. This gives a pacy originality to what could have been a by-the-numbers celebrity tale: the miserable suburban childhood, the early musical failures, the sudden meteoric success, the sex, drugs and dodgy financial advisers, the eventual redemption through marriage, parenthood and activism. The book could also have easily tipped into self-parody, with Elton as a musical Zelig figure, witnessing, in turn, the death of 1960s pop, the emergence of 70s rock, the brief burst of punk, the rise of 90s hip-hop and rap. Alongside all this is the glorious triumph of the gay rights movement in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, handily embodied by Elton himself, a pop star who once barely understood his own sexuality, but can now bring his two sons with Furnish, born by a surrogate, up on stage with him in Las Vegas, and has raised almost half a billion dollars for Aids charities. But Petridis wisely keeps the focus on the personal over the sweeping cultural: Elton\u2019s immediate reaction to the Sex Pistols, for example, was not any cliched shock of the new, but rather delight in Johnny Rotten slagging off his friend and rival, Rod Stewart, on TV.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Elton makes fun of no one more than himself.

His book is closer in spirit to David Niven\u2019s memoirs with their litany of namedrops \u2013 although Niven, as far as I know, never wrote a line like \u201cI sat around, wanking, in a dressing gown covered in my own puke.\u201d</p> <p><em>Me</em> is its own original thing because Elton makes fun of no one more than himself.

Some of his songs took as long to write as they do to listen to; in one morning he knocked off \u201cMona Lisas and Mad Hatters\u201d, \u201cAmy\u201d and \u201cRocket Man\u201d before breakfast.</p> <p>Elton has never come across as an especially warm celebrity: too sharp tongued, too ridiculous.

      "bodyText": "Handle With Care, the title of a new theatre festival in London about \u201cgeneration snowflake\u201d, is smartly ambiguous. Read as an instruction, it suggests fragility and echoes the accusations of hypersensitivity levelled against young people. But it also implies content that needs to be approached with rigour and treated seriously. \u201cIf I tell you \u2018handle with care\u2019, that can be a warning, a threat, or a really deeply generous thing,\u201d says Pablo Pakula, one of the artists featured in the festival at Camden People\u2019s theatre. The three-week programme of performance and live art will take on contested ideas such as safe spaces, freedom of speech and identity politics, explore today\u2019s polarised political landscape and unpick the millennial stereotype. Among the many criticisms hurled at millennials such as myself, our apparent tendency to take offence is second only, it seems, to our expensive passion for avocado toast. Pakula\u2019s show Yes No Black White uses a succession of projected images and texts to question what does and does not offend us \u2013 and what we then do about it. The performance, he explains, prods at \u201cpressure points and sore spots\u201d, challenging audiences to examine their own offence-taking mechanisms. Australian theatre company TomYumSim are poking fun at another popular perception of millennials: our \u201cuniqueness\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lifetime being told that we\u2019re all special and we have something special to give,\u201d says Tom Halls, one half of the company. \u201cWe totally buy into that, that\u2019s why we\u2019re artists!\u201d laughs fellow company member Simone French. \u201cBut we\u2019re taking the piss out of that idea of the specialness in us.\u201d Their show, Nothing Special, is an interactive self-help seminar that satirises millennials\u2019 desperate desire to stand out from the crowd. The festival is headlined by Eurotrash\u2019s show Trigger Warning. Styled as a budget airline safety briefing, the performance delves into the language and politics of content warnings and disclaimers, using a mixture of text, clowning and dance. It\u2019s not a polemic, explains Marcelo Dos Santos, one of the creators of the show, which will be about \u201crolling around in the complexities of it, more than coming down one way or another on the issues\u201d.

Some 18 months on, the design still feels fresh, particularly compared with some phones with massive notches.</p> <p>The 90Hz 6.55in Fluid AMOLED screen is the star of the show. It\u2019s very bright, smooth and a pleasure to use. At Full HD+, it\u2019s less pixel dense than the QHD+ screen on the 7 Pro, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to tell, and the screen is flat, not curved at the edges, which is less visually arresting, though some might prefer it in use.</p> <p>The front glass meets a polished metal band at at the sides, while the curved glass back and narrow 74.4mm width make the OnePlus 7T one of the easiest large-screen smartphones to hold, particularly when compared with the 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro.</p> <p>The back also has a new large circular lump containing a new triple camera system, which looks fairly attractive, though you can feel it with your fingers in normal use.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 6.55in FHD+ 90Hz Fluid AMOLED (402ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB of RAM</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 128 or 256GB (UFS 3.0)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> OxygenOS 10</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> 48MP + 12MP + 16MP triple rear camera, 16MP selfie camera</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> USB-C (3.1) LTE, dual sim, wifi ac, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 160.9 x 74.4 x 8.1mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 190g</p></li> </ul> <h2>Competition-beating hardware</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e795e1f7f1a9709738091dafea9aee371b604fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e795e1f7f1a9709738091dafea9aee371b604fc/502_101_3917_2351/1000.jpg\" alt=\"oneplus 7t review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The phone offers speed in all things, including seriously fast charging.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>New for the 7T is a bump to Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 855+ chip, which has 15% faster graphics and a slightly faster CPU, but is otherwise the same as the Snapdragon 855 in the 7, and many other smartphones this year.</p> <p>In the UK, the rest of the specifications have been reduced to one option: 8GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS3.0 storage, with a 256GB version available elsewhere, effectively eliminating the cheapest 6GB RAM configuration from its predecessor.</p> <p>The phone absolutely flies. Every action has a sense of immediacy that\u2019s unrivalled in the smartphone industry. Now with the 90Hz display, everything is even smoother and more enjoyable \u2013 even mundane things such as scrolling through web pages or social media posts are pleasurable.</p> <p>Battery life on the 7T is slightly worse than the 34 hours of the 7. The new 7T lasts 31 hours between charges with medium to heavy usage: 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours of browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 90 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and about 15 photos.</p> <p>That means the 7T reliably makes it from 7am on day one until 2pm on day two. There\u2019s no wireless charging, but the improved Warp Charge 30T technology sees the 7T hit full charge in 60 minutes from flat, which is half an hour less than the previous version and one of the fastest available.</p> <h2>OxygenOS 10</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee3210434fd30bc8baa5e3a3cee0ea646827e2c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee3210434fd30bc8baa5e3a3cee0ea646827e2c5/707_718_3736_2243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"oneplus 7t review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">OxygenOS continues to lead the market in refinement and performance, now based on the very latest Android 10 with better gesture control and privacy features.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The OnePlus 7T ships with Oxygen OS10, which is based on the very latest Android 10, making it one of the first smartphones on sale to use it.</p> <p>OxygenOS continues to be one of the best implementations of Android, focusing on speed and customisation. New for version 10 is a complete theming engine, which in addition to the usual wallpaper changes, allows you to customise the colours of buttons, the background, the shape of icons and dialogue boxes, the font, the ambient clock display and even the fingerprint scanner animation.</p> <p>Also new is the integration of Google\u2019s new Android 10 gesture navigation, which eschews the traditional three-button or two-button navigation system for a new gesture bar. Swipe up on the bar to go home, up and hold for recently-used apps, or left or right to jump to a previously-used app. A swipe in from the left or right sides in the lower two-thirds of the screen is now used for going back.</p> <p>Some may hate the new gestures, but the back swipe in from the side makes using a large smartphone a lot easier. You can hide the bar altogether or switch to the old-style three-button navigation bar.</p> <h2>Fingerprint scanner</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7547281d05320eebecad866a810cdeecaef5943\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7547281d05320eebecad866a810cdeecaef5943/0_153_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"oneplus 7t review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">OnePlus\u2019s market-leading optical in-screen fingerprint scanner is even faster, matching even the very best traditional capacitive sensors for speed and accuracy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>OnePlus has made its market-leading in-display optical fingerprint scanner even quicker and more accurate than it was on the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro. Given how many times you unlock your phone or authenticate in an app with your fingerprint, speed and accuracy make a huge difference to the overall experience.</p> <p>The OnePlus 7T matches the performance of traditional capacitive sensors and puts everyone else to shame.

The main 48-megapixel camera has optical image stabilisation, and is joined by a 12-megapixel 2x telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide camera.</p> <p>The combination allows you to shoot photos and video at 0.6, 1 or 2x optical zoom or up to 10x digital zoom.</p> <p>The results are very similar to the OnePlus 7 Pro, with the main camera capable of producing some great photos, full of detail, with solid low-light performance. The Night Scape low-light mode is improved too, although still can\u2019t hold a candle to Google or Apple\u2019s versions.</p> <p>The 2x telephoto camera is noticeably sharper in good lighting than the 7 Pro\u2019s 3x, but still worse than the main camera in less-than-ideal lighting. The 10x digital zoom matches the quality of competitors. The ultrawide angle camera continues to be fun and suffers from less lens distortion at the edges than others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae9b5a7a50a532943bd532e908061f41ee939090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae9b5a7a50a532943bd532e908061f41ee939090/0_119_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"oneplus 7t review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The circular camera lump is large and distinctive on the back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>New for the 7T is a class-leading macro mode that can focus at a minimum distance of 2.5cm from the ultrawide angle camera. That\u2019s about a quarter of the distance of most and produces some simply astounding, highly-detailed macro shots with a bit of practice.

      "bodyText": "The OnePlus 7T takes the best bits of the brilliant OnePlus 7 Pro and condenses them into a smaller, cheaper package. Released less than four months after the last version hit the shelves, the new \u00a3500 7T doesn\u2019t mess much with the winning formula, simply adding a better camera and market-leading 90Hz screen technology. OnePlus launches new phones every six months or so, typically with improved specifications and small tweaks to the design. While the 6T to 7 transition wasn\u2019t a particularly big step other than a new processor and faster fingerprint scanner, the 7T brings the 90Hz screen from the 7 Pro to the smaller, cheaper device. Although you probably couldn\u2019t tell unless put side by side with its predecessors, the 7T is 4mm longer, with a screen that\u2019s slightly taller, and with a smaller widow\u2019s peak notch for the selfie camera. Some 18 months on, the design still feels fresh, particularly compared with some phones with massive notches. The 90Hz 6.55in Fluid AMOLED screen is the star of the show. It\u2019s very bright, smooth and a pleasure to use. At Full HD+, it\u2019s less pixel dense than the QHD+ screen on the 7 Pro, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to tell, and the screen is flat, not curved at the edges, which is less visually arresting, though some might prefer it in use. The front glass meets a polished metal band at at the sides, while the curved glass back and narrow 74.4mm width make the OnePlus 7T one of the easiest large-screen smartphones to hold, particularly when compared with the 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro. The back also has a new large circular lump containing a new triple camera system, which looks fairly attractive, though you can feel it with your fingers in normal use. Specifications Screen: 6.55in FHD+ 90Hz Fluid AMOLED (402ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ RAM: 8GB of RAM Storage: 128 or 256GB (UFS 3.0) Operating system: OxygenOS 10 Camera: 48MP + 12MP + 16MP triple rear camera, 16MP selfie camera Connectivity: USB-C (3.1) LTE, dual sim, wifi ac, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS Dimensions: 160.9 x 74.4 x 8.1mm Weight: 190g Competition-beating hardware New for the 7T is a bump to Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 855+ chip, which has 15% faster graphics and a slightly faster CPU, but is otherwise the same as the Snapdragon 855 in the 7, and many other smartphones this year. In the UK, the rest of the specifications have been reduced to one option: 8GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS3.0 storage, with a 256GB version available elsewhere, effectively eliminating the cheapest 6GB RAM configuration from its predecessor. The phone absolutely flies. Every action has a sense of immediacy that\u2019s unrivalled in the smartphone industry. Now with the 90Hz display, everything is even smoother and more enjoyable \u2013 even mundane things such as scrolling through web pages or social media posts are pleasurable. Battery life on the 7T is slightly worse than the 34 hours of the 7. The new 7T lasts 31 hours between charges with medium to heavy usage: 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours of browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 90 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and about 15 photos. That means the 7T reliably makes it from 7am on day one until 2pm on day two. There\u2019s no wireless charging, but the improved Warp Charge 30T technology sees the 7T hit full charge in 60 minutes from flat, which is half an hour less than the previous version and one of the fastest available. OxygenOS 10 The OnePlus 7T ships with Oxygen OS10, which is based on the very latest Android 10, making it one of the first smartphones on sale to use it. OxygenOS continues to be one of the best implementations of Android, focusing on speed and customisation. New for version 10 is a complete theming engine, which in addition to the usual wallpaper changes, allows you to customise the colours of buttons, the background, the shape of icons and dialogue boxes, the font, the ambient clock display and even the fingerprint scanner animation. Also new is the integration of Google\u2019s new Android 10 gesture navigation, which eschews the traditional three-button or two-button navigation system for a new gesture bar. Swipe up on the bar to go home, up and hold for recently-used apps, or left or right to jump to a previously-used app. A swipe in from the left or right sides in the lower two-thirds of the screen is now used for going back. Some may hate the new gestures, but the back swipe in from the side makes using a large smartphone a lot easier. You can hide the bar altogether or switch to the old-style three-button navigation bar. Fingerprint scanner OnePlus has made its market-leading in-display optical fingerprint scanner even quicker and more accurate than it was on the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro. Given how many times you unlock your phone or authenticate in an app with your fingerprint, speed and accuracy make a huge difference to the overall experience. The OnePlus 7T matches the performance of traditional capacitive sensors and puts everyone else to shame. This is how it\u2019s done. Camera New for the 7T is the triple camera system on the back. The main 48-megapixel camera has optical image stabilisation, and is joined by a 12-megapixel 2x telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide camera. The combination allows you to shoot photos and video at 0.6, 1 or 2x optical zoom or up to 10x digital zoom. The results are very similar to the OnePlus 7 Pro, with the main camera capable of producing some great photos, full of detail, with solid low-light performance. The Night Scape low-light mode is improved too, although still can\u2019t hold a candle to Google or Apple\u2019s versions. The 2x telephoto camera is noticeably sharper in good lighting than the 7 Pro\u2019s 3x, but still worse than the main camera in less-than-ideal lighting. The 10x digital zoom matches the quality of competitors. The ultrawide angle camera continues to be fun and suffers from less lens distortion at the edges than others. New for the 7T is a class-leading macro mode that can focus at a minimum distance of 2.5cm from the ultrawide angle camera. That\u2019s about a quarter of the distance of most and produces some simply astounding, highly-detailed macro shots with a bit of practice. If you\u2019re at all into macro photography, you will absolutely love this feature. While generally good, the camera can be a bit unpredictable, over-exposing some scenes and often being far brighter indoors than you\u2019d expect. A little manual adjustment is often required to get the photo just right. Portrait mode lags behind competitors, matching the performance of the top phones from a few years ago. The 16-megapixel fixed focus selfie camera is pretty good, capturing a good amount of detail in varying light conditions. Video capture up to 4K at 60 frames per second was good, but not quite up to par with the best, while the 960fps slow motion was fun with bright lighting. Observations The screen comes with a pre-installed screen protector, but it creates a sharp edge over which you have to swipe The OnePlus alert slider on the side of the phone continues to be wonderful, if a little smaller this time around The included TPU case is one of the best I\u2019ve seen bundled with a phone The \u201cshelf\u201d in OxygenOS continues to be not worth using, and would be better replaced by Google\u2019s Discover feed The first 7T tested had a fault with the screen displaying colour inconsistency manifesting as a green tint to the dark greys used in dark mode in various apps Price The OnePlus 7T costs \u00a3549 in glacier blue or frosted silver shipping from 17 October. For comparison, the OnePlus 7T Pro costs \u00a3699, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs \u00a3799, the Samsung S10e costs \u00a3669, the Honor 20 Pro costs \u00a3550, the Google Pixel 3a XL costs \u00a3469, and the iPhone XR costs \u00a3629. Verdict Simply put, the OnePlus 7T is the cut-price flagship phone to beat. It offers the same super-fast performance and silky smooth 90Hz screen experience as the bar-raising OnePlus 7 Pro, but in a smaller, lighter and cheaper package. At 6.55in the screen is still large, bright and good-looking, squeezed into a more manageable body. The battery life is solid, if not class-leading. The camera is capable of capturing some great-looking photos but can\u2019t match the best in the industry. You get the class-leading in-screen fingerprint scanner, excellent OxygenOS software with at least three years of updates, and seriously fast charging. It doesn\u2019t feel quite as luxurious in the hand as the 7 Pro, nor does it have the wow factor of the its gigantic, notchless screen, but it\u2019s also significantly cheaper, even if it starts at \u00a350 more than its predecessor. At \u00a3549 the OnePlus 7T is a bargain, offering an experience that is simply unrivalled by anything remotely near it in price. Pros: the fastest performance, brilliant screen, dual sim, good camera, great macro mode, Bluetooth 5, Android 10, great software, tiny notch, super-fast in-screen fingerprint sensor, alert slider Cons: glass back but no wireless charging, no IP water resistance rating, no expandable storage, no headphone socket Other reviews Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked Samsung Galaxy S10e review: the cheaper one OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way Honor 20 Pro review: it\u2019s all about the camera Apple iPhone 11 review: an iPhone XR with a better camera Fairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy",

As such he is one of the thousands of homeless people in Glasgow who have been denied a bed for the night by the city council, according to homelessness charities, despite the council having a statutory duty to temporarily accommodate any unintentionally homeless person who presents to them.</p> <p>Section 29 of Scotland\u2019s Housing Act, which <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2001/10/contents\" title=\"\">became law in 2001</a>, obliges councils to put homeless people up short term. (In the rest of the UK, cases are still assessed on the basis of \u201cpriority need\u201d.) But housing charity Shelter claims Glasgow city council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/02/glasgow-council-facing-court-action-over-lack-of-housing-for-homeless-people\" title=\"\">broke this law 3,365 times</a> last year by denying accommodation and returning people to the street. Most often, according to caseworkers, homeless people are told there is no availability. During this period the charity estimates that <a href=\"https://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_involved/campaigning/gatekeeping_petition\" title=\"\">47 homeless people died</a> while without accommodation in the city.</p> <p>It\u2019s such a desperate situation that earlier this month Shelter Scotland announced it was <a href=\"https://scotland.shelter.org.uk/news/august_2019/the_people_vs_glasgow_city_council\" title=\"\">taking legal action</a> against the city council. \u201cWe don\u2019t take this action lightly,\u201d says Shelter Scotland\u2019s director, Graeme Brown. \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged [over five years] with senior political leaders, the executive leadership team in the council, managers, homelessness services, and with the housing regulator. And still the latest figures show the problem is getting worse.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Glasgow\u2019s health and social care partnership says staff do everything possible to find accommodation. While not commenting on individual cases, she points out that proprietors can refuse entry to people on the basis of unacceptable behaviour and the rights of staff and residents to safety. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54008fb4b97f4d58e0904f2df1dfb7030df821b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54008fb4b97f4d58e0904f2df1dfb7030df821b5/0_364_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homeless woman in Glasgow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recent figures show an 8% increase in the number of homelessness applications in Glasgow, and a rise in rough sleeping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She emphasises the \u201csignificant\u201d pressures on homelessness accommodation in the city and the partnership work the council is engaged in. \u201cWe share a common aim with Shelter and, rather than focusing on court action, we would hope they could work with the council and its partners to ensure these challenges are met.\u201d</p> <p>Shelter\u2019s action comes as Glasgow finds itself under increasing scrutiny over a persistent homelessness problem. <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/statistics/2019/06/homelessness-scotland-2018-2019/documents/homelessness-scotland-2018-19/homelessness-scotland-2018-19/govscot:document/homelessness-scotland-2018-19.pdf\" title=\"\">Recent figures show</a> an 8% increase in the number of homelessness applications in the city and a rise in rough sleeping. </p> <p>O\u2019Donnell is representative of much of Glasgow\u2019s rough sleeper population, many of whom have complex lives and difficult pasts, often involving abuse, drugs, alcohol, violence, and criminality. Not all, however, use drugs or alcohol. Annie McLeod, 24, became homeless a few years ago after escaping an abusive relationship, and initially slept rough because she didn\u2019t know she was entitled to a place to stay. The streets were highly contested territories, she says, with people competing for spaces to sleep and beg. The experience was terrifying: \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to sleep at night in case someone came up to me or wanted to do something to me,\u201d she says. When she did present to the council after an intervention from volunteer street workers, she was told there was a problem with the room available and was not allocated one until days later.</p> <p>David Wisher, who is in his 40s and has been street homeless for over a year, says he has been turned away by housing services on multiple occasions when no accommodation has been available. Instead he relies on volunteer groups and homelessness street teams. \u201cI\u2019ve always worked and I never dreamed of ending up here,\u201d he says. \u201cBut sometimes things go wrong and there\u2019s nothing you can do to prepare for it.\u201d He is proactive about seeking help and engaging with services and would like to rejoin the workforce but, he says, \u201cI can\u2019t see a way out of the situation until someone can help me get off the streets.\u201d</p> <p>Brown points out this is the first time Shelter has taken action against a local authority in this way. \u201cBut we see no other option than to bring the whole of the country\u2019s attention to the fact that one of our major city councils, with one of the biggest housing problems in the country, is failing dismally at their duty,\u201d he says. For O\u2019Donnell, the urgency of solving Glasgow\u2019s homelessness crisis couldn\u2019t be clearer. \u201cI\u2019ve sat under the railway bridge myself over the years,\u201d he says, referencing a busy city centre spot crowded with sleeping bags and people begging, which has seen a number of homeless people die on the street in recent years. \u201cI could just end up another one of them dead under that bridge.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

As such he is one of the thousands of homeless people in Glasgow who have been denied a bed for the night by the city council, according to homelessness charities, despite the council having a statutory duty to temporarily accommodate any unintentionally homeless person who presents to them. Section 29 of Scotland\u2019s Housing Act, which became law in 2001, obliges councils to put homeless people up short term. (In the rest of the UK, cases are still assessed on the basis of \u201cpriority need\u201d.) But housing charity Shelter claims Glasgow city council broke this law 3,365 times last year by denying accommodation and returning people to the street. Most often, according to caseworkers, homeless people are told there is no availability. During this period the charity estimates that 47 homeless people died while without accommodation in the city. It\u2019s such a desperate situation that earlier this month Shelter Scotland announced it was taking legal action against the city council. \u201cWe don\u2019t take this action lightly,\u201d says Shelter Scotland\u2019s director, Graeme Brown. \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged [over five years] with senior political leaders, the executive leadership team in the council, managers, homelessness services, and with the housing regulator. And still the latest figures show the problem is getting worse.\u201d A spokeswoman for Glasgow\u2019s health and social care partnership says staff do everything possible to find accommodation. While not commenting on individual cases, she points out that proprietors can refuse entry to people on the basis of unacceptable behaviour and the rights of staff and residents to safety. She emphasises the \u201csignificant\u201d pressures on homelessness accommodation in the city and the partnership work the council is engaged in. \u201cWe share a common aim with Shelter and, rather than focusing on court action, we would hope they could work with the council and its partners to ensure these challenges are met.\u201d Shelter\u2019s action comes as Glasgow finds itself under increasing scrutiny over a persistent homelessness problem. Recent figures show an 8% increase in the number of homelessness applications in the city and a rise in rough sleeping. O\u2019Donnell is representative of much of Glasgow\u2019s rough sleeper population, many of whom have complex lives and difficult pasts, often involving abuse, drugs, alcohol, violence, and criminality. Not all, however, use drugs or alcohol. Annie McLeod, 24, became homeless a few years ago after escaping an abusive relationship, and initially slept rough because she didn\u2019t know she was entitled to a place to stay. The streets were highly contested territories, she says, with people competing for spaces to sleep and beg. The experience was terrifying: \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to sleep at night in case someone came up to me or wanted to do something to me,\u201d she says. When she did present to the council after an intervention from volunteer street workers, she was told there was a problem with the room available and was not allocated one until days later. David Wisher, who is in his 40s and has been street homeless for over a year, says he has been turned away by housing services on multiple occasions when no accommodation has been available. Instead he relies on volunteer groups and homelessness street teams. \u201cI\u2019ve always worked and I never dreamed of ending up here,\u201d he says. \u201cBut sometimes things go wrong and there\u2019s nothing you can do to prepare for it.\u201d He is proactive about seeking help and engaging with services and would like to rejoin the workforce but, he says, \u201cI can\u2019t see a way out of the situation until someone can help me get off the streets.\u201d Brown points out this is the first time Shelter has taken action against a local authority in this way. \u201cBut we see no other option than to bring the whole of the country\u2019s attention to the fact that one of our major city councils, with one of the biggest housing problems in the country, is failing dismally at their duty,\u201d he says. For O\u2019Donnell, the urgency of solving Glasgow\u2019s homelessness crisis couldn\u2019t be clearer. \u201cI\u2019ve sat under the railway bridge myself over the years,\u201d he says, referencing a busy city centre spot crowded with sleeping bags and people begging, which has seen a number of homeless people die on the street in recent years. \u201cI could just end up another one of them dead under that bridge.\u201d Some names have been changed",

It is also thanks to the work of exceptional NGOs, to economic growth and to the innovation of businesses all along the supply chain. It\u2019s thanks, too, to the support of governments and international organisations. And to increased political stability in some places. But there is very bad news. More recently hunger has started to increase. Again. On World Food Day on Wednesday, 820 million people face chronic hunger. That\u2019s the equivalent of the population of the US and the EU combined. This is daily, frightening, fatiguing, persistent hunger. Day after day, 820 million people will not get enough to eat. Night after night, famished mothers and fathers put their children to bed with empty stomachs. I suspect this shocks no one these days. Just as I suspect the spectre of climate crisis evokes yawns. Yet the two are inextricably linked in a kind of existential tango happening too slowly for us to register. The increase in global hunger is in part triggered by the climate emergency. There have been more floods, more droughts, and more frequent, fiercer storms. Small farmers are being hit first and hardest as once-in-a-century extreme weather events become almost routine. At the same time food production is a major cause of climate change, whether it be the methane gas production of cows or the tearing down of forests to grow crops. So, humanity faces a profound challenge. How do we feed the world without destroying it? From next year there will only be 10 years left to achieve the sustainable development goals established by UN member states. If these goals are to be more than bureaucratic niceties and political platitudes, there must be immediate and powerful action to stop the goal of zero hunger going into reverse. The German government aims to catalyse the global response. Next June it will host an international event to push for action to boost agriculture and tackle hunger in low-income countries, while staying within the environmental boundaries that our planet can cope with. More power to them. Those who attend will need to confront the challenge of underperforming agricultural development and the weaknesses of the international system. That means getting hard cash to the smallholder farmers who are too often bypassed by funding that goes either to governments or big business. It means leveraging government and private investment all along the supply chain and learning from what works and what doesn\u2019t. The Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme, which we successfully fought for alongside President Obama, will be critical. It has resulted in a decade of experience in encouraging increased impact from the international system in exactly the way we need. In the face of the dual challenges of climate change and hunger, it is perhaps more relevant today than at its inception. Whatever happens with Brexit, the German gathering will be an opportunity for us to come together to tackle one of the great 21st-century challenges. It\u2019s a century that has stumbled to begin. It is finally taking shape, but is still a plastic thing. It will see mind-boggling technologies emerge and profound cultural shifts. But what\u2019s the point if we can\u2019t beat humanity\u2019s oldest foe, hunger? Surely it is a modest thing to suggest that next year would be an excellent time to start doing just that.",

You can also catch our latest Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here, and for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories It was another rollercoaster week, beginning with widespread predictions that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan was all but dead as No 10 admitted there was little prospect of a deal before 31 October and bitter recriminations flew. But as the government set up a Westminster Brexit showdown by calling MPs to sit in an exceptional Saturday session on 19 October, the day after this week\u2019s EU summit, the prime minister and the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, met on the Wirral. To most people\u2019s surprise, the two men emerged from more than three hours of talks agreeing that there was a \u201cpathway to a possible deal\u201d, prompting the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, to meet in Brussels. The EU subsequently agreed to enter so-called \u201ctunnel discussions\u201d on a possible deal based on Johnson\u2019s acknowledgement \u2013 a big concession from his previous position \u2013 that there could not be a customs border on the island of Ireland. With the Northern Ireland unionists of the DUP promising to be \u201cflexible\u201d and the EU talking up the prospects of a Brexit extension beyond 31 October if necessary, many \u2013 including the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, \u2013 saw the chances of a deal as promising. A weekend of talks, however, ended with Barnier saying there had been no major breakthrough. A timely deal looked \u201cimpossible\u201d, he said, warning that negotiations may have to continue as UK\u2019s Irish border plans represented an \u201cuntested\u201d risk. The British proposal takes Northern Ireland out of the EU customs union, with the UK agreeing to enforce the bloc\u2019s customs rules and tariffs on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland and a rebate system to compensate affected businesses. With Johnson edging steadily towards the numbers needed to pass a deal in the Commons as more hardline Eurosceptics and pro-deal Labour MPs indicated they could back a new agreement, momentum began to grow. Dampening expectations somewhat, Finland\u2019s prime minister, Antti Rinne, warned there was not enough time left for a formal agreement before the summit began on Thursday and Barnier said a deal this week remained \u201cdifficult, but possible\u201d. But after the EU\u2019s chief negotiator set Johnson a deadline of midnight on Tuesday to concede to EU demands and agree to a customs border in the Irish Sea if he wanted a deal by Saturday, EU and UK sources said the two sides were on the brink of success \u2013 despite misgivings in Paris and Berlin at the rush to a deal. What next It depends what happens at the summit. The prime minister has made a series of major U-turns, giving EU officials hope he will table a legal text based on the February 2018 Northern Ireland-only backstop rejected by Theresa May as a constitutional outrage. De jure, Northern Ireland would be in the UK\u2019s customs territory, but de facto it will be in Britain\u2019s, is the idea. (A similar deal was blown up by the DUP and the hardline ERG group last year, but both seem to be giving Johnson more leeway.) But Johnson could also walk out on the summit and attack Brussels for intransigence. Or the two sides could agree to further negotiations next week, opening up the possibility of a second EU summit, perhaps on 29 October, to sign off on a deal. Either way, a new extension beyond 31 October looks inevitable. Ideally, Johnson would probably like to put a deal to parliament on 19 October come what may. But France and Germany want more time, and fudge, delay and prevarication have been the watchwords throughout the Brexit process. There is no reason to doubt they will not be now.

The second season in particular has highlighted the great insularity wealth provides the Roys and their ilk. Several of the episodes have been contained to remote, inaccessible, lush locations \u2013 a Hungarian hunting lodge, an Aspen-esque ideas festival, private jets, the peak of WASPness that is Tern Haven, the yacht \u2013 and hinted at the small army of assistant, PR folk, and housekeepers who buffer their every interaction with the world. Case in point: the season finale\u2019s jarring image of Logan Roy at a highway-side coffee stop somewhere in Europe, avoiding an inconvenient automatic door while Facetiming a major shareholder (apparently no amount of billions can insulate you from the unflattering below-chin Facetime angle).</p> <p>The shareholder tentatively floats the mood of his representatives: that Logan take the hit for the cruise scandal and step down. The likelihood that this would ever happen, despite Logan seeming to consider it in public, was always close to zero; throughout the season, any move toward answering the question of his succession has only entrenched Logan deeper into his increasingly maniacal reign. But the cruise scandal was toxic enough \u2013 mysterious deaths, sexual harassment, \u201cno real person involved\u201d \u2013 that even Logan\u2019s power grip isn\u2019t immune. He\u2019s also not immune to \u201chow was your call reception?\u201d pop-ups on his cell phone, notable in how striking it is to watch Logan have even a small brush with daily inconvenience.</p> <h2>\u2018Death sentence vibes\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"484d5013ec22b723c3b2ebe5a85c2b3144503fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/484d5013ec22b723c3b2ebe5a85c2b3144503fcb/0_251_6829_4097/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succession season two finale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After a teasing glance at Cousin Greg\u2019s bumbling congressional testimony on the buried cruise mismanagement, Succession moved to the Mediterranean, where the Roys tower over lowly fishing boats in their huge yacht. (The setting is ironic \u2013 a cruise break from the cruise-line scandal \u2013 but also evocative of the several real-life media mogul yacht dramas, such as Rupert Murdoch\u2019s fall on his son\u2019s yacht in Australia.) Logan was, again, not going to go out from the company quietly, and the public demanded at least one head roll for the cruise fiasco. The Waystar Royco yacht cruise may abound in breezy linens and sunhats, but the mood was, as Tom said, \u201cdeath sentence vibes\u201d. Someone was going down, if not the company itself, a possibility heightened by the arrival of annoyed, and hostage-situation-chastened, Roman. On the up from two brutal slaps this season \u2013 Logan calling him a moron, Logan literally knocking out his tooth \u2013 Roman rebounds with the uncharacteristically sober (and probably correct) assessment that the central Asian money is bullshit. Without the option to go private, the options for the company are *Shiv throat-slice motion, Tom tumbles off waterslide*.</p> <p>The finale seems to mark a maturation of sorts for Roman \u2013 we see him offering rare honest advice to Logan, sincerely, if awkwardly; defending Gerri in the breakfast summit; expressing genuine concern for Kendall when he seems defeated by Logan\u2019s blood sacrifice. By episode\u2019s end, Logan names Roman permanent COO, solo. But given Kendall\u2019s last-second twist, does Roman\u2019s upward arc bend toward his father, his brother, or somewhere new?</p> <h2>\u2018Gobble the odd side dick\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c0b32590a2f5de0b3b0b25932e9ecbc8f2b61dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c0b32590a2f5de0b3b0b25932e9ecbc8f2b61dd/0_440_6683_4009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succession season two finale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>All is not well on the island of Shiv and Tom, after a season in which Shiv\u2019s ruthless attempt to ascend Waystar Royco has been largely despite, not alongside, her husband. Their partnership has always seemed odd and for Shiv, somewhat inexplicable in its uselessness for exploitation; one of the show\u2019s few flaws is that it has yet, in this viewer\u2019s opinion, at least, to convey why Shiv even went out with Tom in the first place, let alone remained so loyal to a husband whose tone-deaf kiss-assery elicits her eye rolls at least once an episode. I mean, Shiv asked/demanded an open marriage <em>on their wedding night \u2013</em><em> </em>a \u201cgobble the odd side dick\u201d arrangement Tom finally confronts in the finale, after backing out of their planned threesome with a yacht waitress. Their relationship seems to disintegrate further after Shiv doesn\u2019t hesitate to question tossing Tom to the cruise-ship wolves in the family summit, and Tom delivers the devastating line: \u201cI wonder if the sad I\u2019d be without you is more than the sad I am with you.\u201d (Not to be overshadowed by another Tom food powerplay \u2013 last season\u2019s finale saw him forcing Shiv\u2019s lover, Nate, to pour wine back into the bottle; this year, he eats a drumstick off Logan\u2019s plate.)</p> <p>Will Shiv and Tom\u2019s relationship survive? Will the third season offer new insight into the origins of their relationship? Shiv, seemingly humbled by the prospect of a breakup, ultimately asks Logan for Tom\u2019s protection. But with Cousin Greg now a cruise scandal turncoat, how vulnerable is Tom?</p> <h2>\u2018Someone\u2019s getting shitcanned\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"459726a654868e37d74bc288ffec92e8991bbc02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459726a654868e37d74bc288ffec92e8991bbc02/44_0_7026_4217/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succession season two finale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Someone was always going to take the fall for the cruise scandal \u2013 get \u201cshitcanned\u201d, in Roman-ese \u2013 and the blood sacrifice provided an opportunity for what Succession does best: contained scenes of characters spitballing off each other over expensive meals, using backhanded compliments and polite burns to fuck each other over. The breakfast table scene in which the Logan acolytes, including all his children, build up each other\u2019s company loyalty to throw them under the bus is among the seasons\u2019s best, up there with the dinner summit with the Pierces at Tern Haven. Besides which loyalties survived the fire (it looks like Roman and Gerri are fine; Gerri and Shiv, less so) the meeting brings up some important questions: what viral moments came out of \u201cSprinkle\u201d Greg\u2019s testimony? Does the public know about Shiv\u2019s witness intimidation? Will Connor quit his campaign? (And also, what did the New York Times say about Willa\u2019s play? Does the end of Connor\u2019s candidacy mean the end of the perpetually embarrassed Willa?) Was tearing each other apart Logan\u2019s intent in the first place?</p> <h2>Logan\u2019s No 1 boy no more</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0ce05aea0e9137911c52646c70139cc69092ee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0ce05aea0e9137911c52646c70139cc69092ee5/0_304_6822_4093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succession season two finale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The loser of the shitcan battle was, of course, Kendall, who goes from defeated and self-effacing company skull to whistleblower on his own father by episode\u2019s end. It\u2019s fitting that the night\u2019s big twist belonged to Kendall, once the heir apparent, after last season finale\u2019s shocker: Kendall\u2019s drug-fuelled, Chappaquiddick-esque car crash that killed a British waiter. Kendall has spent most of the season haunted, a wounded dog with an emotional crater so deep it drew even the concern of his sympathy-void siblings and former friend Stewy. After a season of dutifully serving his father\u2019s whims (RIP Vaulter), what turned Kendall to that crucial, Karolina panic-inducing \u201cBUT\u201d in the final press conference? Was it Naomi Pierce\u2019s cutting observation that Logan \u201cloves the broken you\u201d? Logan admitting he never thought Kendall had the killer instinct for the top job? Secret documents on the jet from Greg? Had he planned it all along? That and Logan\u2019s half-smile at Kendall\u2019s treachery are up for debate \u2013 the show-runner, Jesse Armstrong, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/succession-showrunner-talks-season-2-finale-twist-1247436\">told The Hollywood Reporter</a> that \u201cdifferent interpretations are valid\u201d. Whatever the case, Kendall\u2019s betrayal leaves the show with fertile ground for season three: retreading the son v father battle from the first season, but with new stakes, heightened ammunition, and loyalties potentially up for grabs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Like survivors of a disaster that may or may not have been caused by climate change, Labor is slowly emerging from their bunker to survey the wreckage wrought upon them. Five months on from their night of horrors the opposition is showing the first signs of regrouping after what has been a soul-destroying period as the Morrison government has resumed the treasury benches sans agenda or any real sense of purpose. In this time opposition politics have seemed to be more like muscle memory, jumping on the leak of government key messages as though they were state secrets, confecting outrage at the prime minister\u2019s faux Trumpism, goading Barnaby into saying something else ridiculous. Under their new leader Labor has ducked and weaved as the government has attempted to draw them into political alleyways on tax cuts and medevac and lately on the drug-testing of welfare recipients, recognition that they are in no state as yet to reengage in real fights. A harsh but fair assessment would be that the opposition has been such in name only, with an election postmortem ongoing and increasingly public disagreements from senior figures inside and outside the parliament on what comes next. This impression is reinforced by responses to questions in this week\u2019s Essential Report designed to get the first real take on perceptions towards Anthony Albanese\u2019s Labor. The low regard is unsurprising, just a quarter of all voters rating Labor\u2019s performance as excellent or good. Indeed, a majority of Labor voters mark the performance as fair or poor, suggesting the current stasis is not sustainable for any extended period of time. But before anything changes, the opposition needs to agree what went so horribly wrong in May and what can be done to ensure it is not repeated. At the heart of the rebuilding exercise is the critical question: was it the progressive platform or the political campaign that drove a bare majority of Australians to reject Labor at the ballot box? There is one school of thought \u2013 let\u2019s call them the Joels \u2013 that start with the premise that Labor got captured by the left and the progressive agenda was roundly rejected by mainstream Australia as a consequence. There is another group \u2013 let\u2019s call them the Waynes \u2013 who are adamant it was the campaign and not the policy that failed the party. Ahead of the release of the official election review, Labor\u2019s position on climate change has emerged as a proxy battleground for these two world views. The Joels are arguing to wind back ambitions on emissions to neutralise the attacks from the Coalition on the impact of policies on jobs. But in Wayne\u2019s world, to walk away from progressive issues such as ambitious action on climate change would be to lose the election twice \u2013 along with a generation of younger voters. This week\u2019s rebuff of the Joels by way of a largely symbolic \u201cclimate extinction\u201d motion suggests the Waynes are gaining ascendency within the opposition. But the instinct to kick the big issues down the road means the debate will be ongoing. A separate set of findings in this week\u2019s report backs in the theory it was the campaign, not the issues that were Labor\u2019s achilles heel; with Albanese\u2019s personal attributes significantly stronger than his predecessor. This reinforces the argument that Labor\u2019s campaign and, more pointedly, the Coalition\u2019s personal attacks on Bill Shorten fuelled by a third party-funded social media info-war had a significant impact on the final result. This uptake in leader approval is reflected in general satisfaction with Albanese\u2019s performance, although he has not put a dent in the prime minister\u2019s preferred PM status. These findings should give succour to those who argue that it was the execution of the platform and not the platform itself that needs the rethink. Closing tax loopholes, acting on homelessness, investing in early learning, recalibrating workplace laws, repairing the NDIS and, yes, taking decisive action on climate change, were all popular progressive policies. The majority of the public went with Labor on the journey, but too many baulked at the final hurdle, convinced the risk of change was too great and the returned Morrison government was the safe bet. The failure of 2019 was actually one of cadence. A campaign full of announcements and promises simply overwhelmed the public. It wasn\u2019t climate change or any one thing that cost the election, it was everything. To torture the metaphor, the answer is not to deny the impact of climate change on the election result, it is to make the Labor party climate resistant by recognising that leadership on this issue is a perquisite for any meaningful claim to power. The debates going on inside Labor right now are important: to lead or respond, to play big target or small, to treat the political contest as a game or a mission. How these issues resolve will determine the sort of choice Australians face in three year\u2019s time. \u2022 Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential.

In an email exchange between Labour and the CBI, seen by the Guardian, the UK\u2019s foremost business lobby group told the party it recognised that some of its analysis did not reflect the party\u2019s policy. Threatening to undermine the credibility of its warning over the costs, the admission comes after the CBI said Labour would need to spend at least \u00a3196bn to take control of the rail network, water, energy and mail companies should it be elected to power. In the leaked exchange, Labour asked questions of the lobby group\u2019s assumption that Labour would buy back the rail industry\u2019s rolling stock \u2013 the trains leased out to rail operating companies \u2013 saying this was not part of its plans. In response, the CBI\u2019s principal economist told the party: \u201cWe have assumed the rolling stock would be bought into public ownership as the trains are currently owned by the private sector and therefore full-scale nationalisation of rail would require this.

      "bodyText": "The Australian Capital Territory law to legalise cannabis possession appears to \u201cdo nothing to end the continuing operation\u201d of commonwealth offences, Christian Porter has warned. The attorney general\u2019s comments to Guardian Australia suggest Canberra cannabis users will be left in legal limbo when the laws take effect from February, contradicting the ACT government\u2019s claim that its law provides a defence to the federal offence. The Morrison government has stepped up its rhetoric against the laws. On Monday the health minister, Greg Hunt, accused the ACT government of being \u201cblind and indifferent to the health consequences\u201d of cannabis after asking it what medical evidence was considered before legalising it. In September the ACT legislative assembly passed laws allowing adult residents to possess up to 50 grams of cannabis and grow two plants, up to a total of four plants per household. Federal law prohibits cannabis possession but the ACT pushed ahead citing clauses which allow a defence for people engaged in conduct \u201cjustified or excused\u201d by a state or territory law. Porter said he was still considering the issue \u201con its merits\u201d and had received a final copy of the ACT law only on Monday. \u201cBased on a preliminary examination of the ACT legislation, it would appear it does nothing to end the continuing operation of commonwealth laws with respect to possession of a prohibited substance, which would continue to make possession of amounts of cannabis under 50g unlawful in the ACT,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cNevertheless, I shall be considering options and will of course respond directly to the ACT attorney general in due course.\u201d On Monday Hunt accused the ACT government of having \u201cno idea of the health consequences\u201d of cannabis, warning it can have \u201cdangerous psychotic effects\u201d including increasing the risk of schizophrenia. The ACT government has warned the commonwealth against interfering by passing a bill to explicitly override territory laws, as it did on euthanasia. Hunt played down the need to do so, saying there were \u201calready clear, strong federal laws\u201d in place. In the ACT the Australian federal police and its ACT policing unit enforce both federal and local laws, which could leave cannabis users at risk of arrest depending on the exercise of discretion of individual officers. An ACT policing spokesman said it was \u201cstill assessing the implications of the new legislation\u201d. In September the ACT government received advice from the commonwealth director of public prosecutions, Sarah McNaughton, which backed its view that local laws would provide a defence to the federal offence. She then withdrew her advice citing unspecified \u201clegal complexities\u201d. A spokesman for the commonwealth director of public prosecutions told Guardian Australia the advice was withdrawn \u201cfollowing communications with the attorney general\u2019s department\u201d and \u201cfurther legal consideration was given to the issues\u201d. The bill\u2019s architect, Labor MLA Michael Pettersson, has dismissed concerns that legalisation would increase cannabis use, saying the law did not legalise sale or supply and arguing it was \u201cdisingenuous to pretend\u201d cannabis was hard to access.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down the blog. Our main story is here. Carrie Lam attempted to deliver her annual policy address today in the Legislative Council, the first time the governing body had met since June, when protested surrounded the Legco building, preventing lawmakers from entering to debate the controversial extradition bill that sparked the protests that have gripped Hong Kong for months. The Hong Kong leader\u2019s speech was interrupted by pro-democracy lawmakers shouting slogans, including \u201cFive demands, not one less\u201d, which refers to their demands for an independent inquiry into police behaviour, amnesty for those arrested, democratic reforms to give Hong Kong residents universal suffrage, the withdrawal of the emergency law which allows for a ban of face masks during protests, a halt to categorising the protests as riots. Lawmakers shouted in protest, held up signs showing Lam with blood on her hands and projected writing saying \u201cFive demands, not one less\u201d onto the wall behind where Lam was speaking. Lam had to stop her speech twice due to the shouting of lawmakers, with the chair of Legco evicting six pro-democracy lawmakers before suspending the session entirely. Pro-democracy lawmaker Tanya Chan urged Carrie Lam to step down, saying: \u201c really urge her, if she cannot govern Hong Kong, if she has no determination to govern Hong Kong and she has no ability and isn\u2019t capable in administrating Hong Kong, please step down. This is the only way that we can have a good future and this is only way Hong Kong can move forward.\u201d Carrie Lam eventually delivered her speech via a televised address during which she said Hong Kong would \u201cnot tolerate\u201d the advocacy of Hong Kong independence and challenges to national sovereignty. She added that the protests have \u201cseriously damaged Hong Kong\u2019s image\u201d and the government would intensify promotion efforts to restore the faith of the outside world, but that by relying on its core values of the rule of law, respect of human rights, efficient bureaucracy, and One Country Two Systems, \u201cthe rainbow will emerge after the storm\u201d. Carrie Lam says \u2018the rainbow will emerge after the storm\u2019 Carrie Lam said the protests have \u201cseriously damaged Hong Kong\u2019s image\u201d and the government would intensify promotion efforts to restore the faith of the outside world. Lam also said with the support of China and the determination of Hong Kong people, the city would certainly be able to overcome the current difficulties. She remarked that many people have lost faith in Hong Kong and become pessimistic, but she urged them to put aside their differences to embark on a new journey. Lam said Hong Kong could rely on the strength of its core values such as the rule of law, respect of human rights, efficient bureaucracy, the One Country Two Systems, its prestigious status as a financial centre, free trade. She said with the Hong Kong people\u2019s rational and pragmatic approach, she was sure that \u201cthe rainbow will emerge after the storm.\u201d Carrie Lam has finished speaking. Carrie Lam says rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong\u2019s success and she particularly thanked police, staff at metro stations and the airport authorities who have to work to maintain services. Carrie Lam warns Hong Kong will \u201cnot tolerate\u201d advocacy of independence She said she has come up with solutions to calm the sentiment, including community dialogues and other measures. She said Hong Kong has to operate on the principle of One Country Two Systems, but will \u201cnot tolerate\u201d the advocacy of Hong Kong independence and challenges to national sovereignty. \u201cDuring this turbulent and difficult period, we must firmly stick to the One Country Two Systems policy, and we can emerge from our current impasse.\u201d Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam began her mid-term policy address by saying Hong Kong has long been seen as a civilised city, but the the past few months, \u201cconflicts became more and more widespread\u201d, sparking more than 400 protests and public assemblies. She said many of these descended into violent attacks, injuring more than 1,100 and the arrests of more than 2,200 people. She said protesters have carried out \u201corganised and calculated attacks\u201d on people who have different political opinions from themselves, including people taking the law into their own hands and doxxing. Lam said that many people were asking: \u201cWill Hong Kong return to normal? Is Hong Kong still a place where we can live safely?\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s leader has begun her annual policy speech, a major address in which the chief executive traditional outlines their policy agenda for the year. She tried to deliver the address inside the chamber but was twice drowned out by pro-democracy lawmakers who shouted her down and called on her to resign. Before she began, pro-government lawmaker Alice Mak condemned pro-democracy lawmakers, accusing them of \u201cbringing street violence into the legislation chamber. People don\u2019t want to see this kind of behaviour.\u201d The Hong Kong government has issued a statement on its website. Owing to the current circumstances, the Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam, was not able to deliver the entire Policy Address at the Legislative Council today (October 16). To allow members of the public to know in full the various initiatives in it, she will deliver the Policy Address to members of the public through video at about 12.15pm today. Members of the public can view the broadcast on TV and the Policy Address website (www.policyaddress.gov.hk). Carrie Lam\u2019s annual policy address has been delayed until 12:15 local time (about 20 minutes from now) after her speech in front of the Legco was interrupted twice by loud protests from pro-democracy legislators, who shouted at her to step down, and yelled about their \u201cfive demands\u201d. Lawmakers are scathing about Lam\u2019s decision to resort to a televised speech. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic moment, she\u2019s so terrified that she needs to hide behind a camera,\u201d says Claudia Mo. \u201cOur five demands are very clear, not one less. I really urge her, if she cannot govern Hong Kong, if she has no determination to govern Hong Kong and she has no ability and isn\u2019t capable in administrating Hong Kong, please step down. This is the only way that we can have a good future and this is only way Hong Kong can move forward.\u201d Student activist, Joshua Wong, has tweeted a picture from today\u2019s sitting of Legco, during which a lawmaker projected some words onto the wall behind Carrie Lam: \u201cFive demands, not one less\u201d. Lawmaker Charles Mok is addressing the press now: \u201cWhen 80% of the people of HK believe she does not have a mandate to lead Hong Kong, she has no right to be in the chamber of Legco to deliver a policy address. He adds that pro-democracy lawmakers will deliver a \u201cpeople\u2019s policy address\u201d. Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker has addressed the media. She says: \u201cShe is just a puppet on strings played by Beijing. Carrie Lam should be ashamed of herself, she is conducting the biggest sellout of Hong Kong.\u201d Pro-democracy lawmaker Tanya Chan, flanked by other pro-democracy lawmakers, told reporters that Carrie Lam is \u201cthe source of inciting people to take to the streets\u201d. \u201cBased on what can she rule Hong Kong?\u201d she asks. Chan played a recording of protesters screaming from being beaten during protests and said \u201cHer hands are full of blood, based on what can she be a chief executive?\u201d She is now addressing the press in English, calling on Lam to step down, saying: \u201cPlease don\u2019t let us suffer anymore, please go!\u201d The chair has suspended the Legco again and Carrie Lam has left the building for a second time after pro-democracy lawmakers once again interrupted her speech. They are now standing as a group in front of the press and chanting: \u201cFive demands, not one less\u201d and \u201cCarrie Lam! Step down!\u201d The chair has evicted four more pro-democracy lawmakers from the chamber, bringing the total number of those evicted to six, counting the two from before. The chair has also confiscated the equipment of one of the lawmakers, who used a projector to project characters onto Lam as she spoke. The lawmakers are carrying signs showing a smiling Lam holding up her hands that are covered in blood. One lawmaker has advanced to the front of the chamber and security members immediately ran to the front of the chamber to block the aisles and any access from lawmakers to Lam. Carrie Lam has re-entered the building after the chair of Legco admonished pro-democracy lawmakers and saying that people have the right to listen to Lam\u2019s speech. She is speaking now but the shouting from lawmakers is deafening, she can barely be heard above their protests. The chair of the Legco has resumed his seat and is speaking to lawmakers, who have begun chanting again. The lawmakers were shouting \u201cFive demands, not one less\u201d and their placards have the same slogan on them, this is a reference to five key requests from protesters, which are: an independent inquiry into police behaviour amnesty for those arrested democratic reforms to give Hong Kong residents universal suffrage the withdrawal of the emergency law which allows for a ban of face masks during protests a halt to categorising the protests as riots Some placards also read: \u201cReclaim the legislature, resume political reform\u201d. Things have quietened down in the Legco now, but there is still no sign of Carrie Lam. Her speech was barely able to begin before pro-democracy lawmakers shouted her down to the point that the policy address could not continue. The chair of Legco has announced the session was to be suspended due to the shouting of of pro-democracy lawmakers. Pro-democracy lawmaker Tanya Chan was ordered to leave the chamber, another, Raymond Chan, was escorted out of the chamber by security staff. Carrie Lam has left the chamber. There is no word whether the speech will resume. Carrie Lam has arrived to deliver her address but is being shouted down by pro-democracy lawmakers who are shouting criticism and waving placards. They are all dressed in black shirts with slogans written on them. Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council has not met since June. Protesters stormed its headquarters back in early July. This was early on in the protests and marked a shift in tone of the protests, from largely peaceful, enormous gatherings of citizens, number up to one million people, to more organised protests that had a tone of palpable anger. People were divided over the decision to storm the Legco, with experienced pro-democracy campaigners in the city saying the move went too far and risked turning public opinion against them. Tight security near Legco ahead of speech Images coming in from Hong Kong show serious security measures that are being taken to protect the Legco building as the council resumes sessions for the first time in months. Here\u2019s the agenda of the Legislative Council for today: Wednesday 16 October 2019 at 11am I. Papers to be laid on the Table of the Council 51 items of subsidiary legislation/instruments and 20 other papers to be laid on the Table of the Council are set out in the Appendix II. Delivery of the Policy Address by the Chief Executive The Chief Executive to deliver the Policy Address under Rule 13(1A) of the Rules of Procedure III. Government Bill Resumption of Second Reading debate under Rule 64(2) of the Rules of Procedure for the purpose of making an announcement of the withdrawal of the Bill Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 Hello and welcome to our live coverage of today\u2019s events in Hong Kong. Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam is set to deliver her annual policy address today when the Legislative Council (Legco) of Hong Kong resumes its sessions. Lam said yesterday that the Legco would launch economic measures to ease the land and housing situation, after mainland Chinese officials insisted unaffordable housing and employment issues are the \u201croot cause\u201d of Hong Kong\u2019s social unrest. She also hinted that the government of Hong Kong may introduce further measures to suppress the protests, despite huge opposition to the emergency regulations that have already been introduced. On 4 October Lam announced the government had invoked a colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance \u2013 last used 52 years ago \u2013 to pass a regulation forbidding the use of face masks, bypassing the legislature. The move sparked widespread anger and has since prompted hundreds of thousands to don masks and take to the streets in defiance of the ban. Asked whether she would consider invoking emergency powers again to introduce more measures to quell unrest, Lam said \u201cwe need very strong reasons\u201d to justify further measures, but also insisted that \u201cwe should consider every measure to end violence\u201d.",

I tell my story because it is the best weapon I have | Nadia Murad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Four years later, Dvali is living in a flat provided by the <a href=\"https://www.commonwealhousing.org.uk/static/uploads/2019/04/Amari-Main-Report-FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">Amari project</a>, which offers up to a year of supported accommodation in London for survivors of sexual exploitation. </p> <p>The project was set up in 2016 by the charity <a href=\"https://www.solacewomensaid.org/\" title=\"\">Solace Women\u2019s Aid</a>, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.commonwealhousing.org.uk\" title=\"\">Commonweal Housing</a>, in response to a lack of suitable accommodation for this group of women. Eva Markova, a specialist support worker for the Amari project, says it is the only one in the UK to give women who have been sexually exploited through trafficking or prostitution the opportunity to live alone, supported by a caseworker.</p> <p>\u201cThese women have never rented a property in the UK and they don\u2019t have independent living skills,\u201d says Markova. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the benefits system, and some women have never had bank accounts before. Sometimes I have to explain what council tax is, and why they get water bills.\u201d</p> <p>The journey to an Amari project flat can be complicated, as Dvali\u2019s case shows. When a victim of trafficking first escapes, they may be identified by either a police officer, a charity, a safeguarding team at a local authority, or by an immigration official when they go to claim asylum. If they consent, they will then be referred to both the Home Office\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/human-trafficking-victims-referral-and-assessment-forms/guidance-on-the-national-referral-mechanism-for-potential-adult-victims-of-modern-slavery-england-and-wales#what-the-national-referral-mechanism-is\" title=\"\">national referral mechanism</a> (NRM) \u2013 the framework for identifying and assisting victims of modern slavery \u2013 and the Salvation Army for support. Often, they will also be going through the asylum process and staying in temporary accommodation. If they are recognised as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/feb/14/modern-slavery-ruling-may-lead-to-more-victims-getting-leave-to-remain?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">a victim of modern slavery</a>, they can be granted up to one year and one day leave to remain in the UK. When Dvali received this decision, however, she risked being evicted from temporary accommodation.</p> <p>At the Amari project, Markova helps with ongoing immigration problems, as well as accessing council housing services, dealing with bills and emotional support. Since its inception, the Amari project has helped 20 women. Dvali is among the eight who are currently being supported in an Amari flat, while 12 have moved on to independent housing, including Aferdita Shehu from Albania. She was granted five years\u2019 leave to remain in the UK and her two children were allowed to join her. Together, they have been housed in a council flat in Lambeth, south London. Shehu says the project provided her with a home that has made her feel safe for the first time in her life. \u201cFor someone like me, who has been through a lot, it\u2019s like you are born again,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I will start to live another life and leave everything behind.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/21/british-sex-trade-women\">Let\u2019s criminalise the men buying sex, and spare the women they exploit | Sophie Walker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But demand for the project \u2013 which has 10 properties in south and east London \u2013 far outstrips supply. </p> <p>The National Crime Agency\u2019s latest report shows that <a href=\"https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/who-we-are/publications/282-national-referral-mechanism-statistics-end-of-year-summary-2018/file\" title=\"\">6,993 potential victims</a> of trafficking were referred to the NRM in 2018, a 36% increase on the 2017 total.<strong> </strong>(It stresses that these figures do not provide an analysis of the picture of modern slavery in the UK, which charities estimate to be much higher.) Nearly 2,000 of those were women who said they were trafficked for sexual exploitation.<strong> </strong></p> <p>According to the Salvation Army, the number of women trafficked for sexual exploitation receiving its help in the year to July 2018 was up 19% from 2017 figures. A <a href=\"https://issuu.com/salvationarmyuk/docs/modern_slavery_report_2018_final_lo?e=5764755/65201004\" title=\"\">total of 7,724 people were supported by the Salvation Army</a> and its partner organisations between July 2011 and June 2018. Up to half of those are women who were trafficked for sexual exploitation (other reasons include for domestic servitude and forced labour). The largest proportion of victims were in London, followed by the north-east and West Midlands. </p> <p>Cuts, changes to welfare benefit support, and the ongoing housing crisis continue to have a severe impact on vulnerable client groups, and sexually exploited women are among some of the most marginalised in society. As single women, they are often not considered a priority by local authorities for housing. The <a href=\"https://snowdropproject.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Snowdrop project</a>, based in Sheffield, helps sexually exploited women to get housing, education and therapeutic support after they have been recognised as victims of modern slavery. But there are large swaths of the country providing little support. According to Snowdrop founder, Lara Bundock, this increases the risk that victims will be trafficked again. \u201cWhere services don\u2019t exist, it\u2019s like somebody stepping off a cliff edge,\u201d she says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t likely to be much success moving forwards because life is so hard to navigate.\u201d</p> <p>Emilie Martin, operations manager for the anti-trafficking and modern slavery services at the Salvation Army, stresses the varying help that women require. \u201cNot all victims have the same needs. Some are ready and just want to move on, but there are others who need years of support because of the extent of the trauma they\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p> <p>However, only a very few suspected victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation ever get any support because most cases referred to the NRM fail. In 2018, <a href=\"https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/who-we-are/publications/282-national-referral-mechanism-statistics-end-of-year-summary-2018/file\" title=\"\">just 17% of victims</a> who applied to the NRM were officially recognised as being trafficked.</p> <p>The Home Office says that new statutory guidance is expected this autumn that will set out the roles and responsibilities of public authorities in identifying and protecting victims of modern slavery. A Home Office spokesman<strong> </strong>says: \u201cWe continue to improve the support provided through the NRM. This will ensure that the quality of care is maintained throughout the country and meeting people\u2019s needs as they recover.\u201d He adds that the new guidance will also set out the support available to victims of modern slavery and how it is accessed.</p> <p>Back in south London, Dvali is applying for indefinite leave to remain in the UK and is worried about where she\u2019ll end up after her time at the Amari project finishes. Women still find it difficult to secure housing after their tenancy with the Amari project ends; there is no guarantee that they will get put into a council flat. Many are placed in private housing, which is more precarious and more expensive than council accommodation. For now, she feels safe for the first time since her arrival in the UK. Although she has depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and struggles to get out of bed some days, Dvali knows that Markova is only a text message away.</p> <p>\u201cMy only hope now is to settle down and recover,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to carry that dead body all my life. My future is grey and I\u2019m trying to paint something to make it more colourful.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

Four years later, Dvali is living in a flat provided by the Amari project, which offers up to a year of supported accommodation in London for survivors of sexual exploitation. The project was set up in 2016 by the charity Solace Women\u2019s Aid, in partnership with Commonweal Housing, in response to a lack of suitable accommodation for this group of women. Eva Markova, a specialist support worker for the Amari project, says it is the only one in the UK to give women who have been sexually exploited through trafficking or prostitution the opportunity to live alone, supported by a caseworker. \u201cThese women have never rented a property in the UK and they don\u2019t have independent living skills,\u201d says Markova. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the benefits system, and some women have never had bank accounts before. Sometimes I have to explain what council tax is, and why they get water bills.\u201d The journey to an Amari project flat can be complicated, as Dvali\u2019s case shows. When a victim of trafficking first escapes, they may be identified by either a police officer, a charity, a safeguarding team at a local authority, or by an immigration official when they go to claim asylum. If they consent, they will then be referred to both the Home Office\u2019s national referral mechanism (NRM) \u2013 the framework for identifying and assisting victims of modern slavery \u2013 and the Salvation Army for support. Often, they will also be going through the asylum process and staying in temporary accommodation. If they are recognised as a victim of modern slavery, they can be granted up to one year and one day leave to remain in the UK. When Dvali received this decision, however, she risked being evicted from temporary accommodation. At the Amari project, Markova helps with ongoing immigration problems, as well as accessing council housing services, dealing with bills and emotional support. Since its inception, the Amari project has helped 20 women. Dvali is among the eight who are currently being supported in an Amari flat, while 12 have moved on to independent housing, including Aferdita Shehu from Albania. She was granted five years\u2019 leave to remain in the UK and her two children were allowed to join her. Together, they have been housed in a council flat in Lambeth, south London. Shehu says the project provided her with a home that has made her feel safe for the first time in her life. \u201cFor someone like me, who has been through a lot, it\u2019s like you are born again,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I will start to live another life and leave everything behind.\u201d But demand for the project \u2013 which has 10 properties in south and east London \u2013 far outstrips supply. The National Crime Agency\u2019s latest report shows that 6,993 potential victims of trafficking were referred to the NRM in 2018, a 36% increase on the 2017 total. (It stresses that these figures do not provide an analysis of the picture of modern slavery in the UK, which charities estimate to be much higher.) Nearly 2,000 of those were women who said they were trafficked for sexual exploitation. According to the Salvation Army, the number of women trafficked for sexual exploitation receiving its help in the year to July 2018 was up 19% from 2017 figures. A total of 7,724 people were supported by the Salvation Army and its partner organisations between July 2011 and June 2018. Up to half of those are women who were trafficked for sexual exploitation (other reasons include for domestic servitude and forced labour). The largest proportion of victims were in London, followed by the north-east and West Midlands. Cuts, changes to welfare benefit support, and the ongoing housing crisis continue to have a severe impact on vulnerable client groups, and sexually exploited women are among some of the most marginalised in society. As single women, they are often not considered a priority by local authorities for housing. The Snowdrop project, based in Sheffield, helps sexually exploited women to get housing, education and therapeutic support after they have been recognised as victims of modern slavery. But there are large swaths of the country providing little support. According to Snowdrop founder, Lara Bundock, this increases the risk that victims will be trafficked again. \u201cWhere services don\u2019t exist, it\u2019s like somebody stepping off a cliff edge,\u201d she says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t likely to be much success moving forwards because life is so hard to navigate.\u201d Emilie Martin, operations manager for the anti-trafficking and modern slavery services at the Salvation Army, stresses the varying help that women require. \u201cNot all victims have the same needs. Some are ready and just want to move on, but there are others who need years of support because of the extent of the trauma they\u2019ve been through.\u201d However, only a very few suspected victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation ever get any support because most cases referred to the NRM fail. In 2018, just 17% of victims who applied to the NRM were officially recognised as being trafficked. The Home Office says that new statutory guidance is expected this autumn that will set out the roles and responsibilities of public authorities in identifying and protecting victims of modern slavery. A Home Office spokesman says: \u201cWe continue to improve the support provided through the NRM. This will ensure that the quality of care is maintained throughout the country and meeting people\u2019s needs as they recover.\u201d He adds that the new guidance will also set out the support available to victims of modern slavery and how it is accessed. Back in south London, Dvali is applying for indefinite leave to remain in the UK and is worried about where she\u2019ll end up after her time at the Amari project finishes. Women still find it difficult to secure housing after their tenancy with the Amari project ends; there is no guarantee that they will get put into a council flat. Many are placed in private housing, which is more precarious and more expensive than council accommodation. For now, she feels safe for the first time since her arrival in the UK. Although she has depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and struggles to get out of bed some days, Dvali knows that Markova is only a text message away. \u201cMy only hope now is to settle down and recover,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to carry that dead body all my life. My future is grey and I\u2019m trying to paint something to make it more colourful.\u201d Some names have been changed",

Boris Johnson may be on the brink of reaching a Brexit deal with negotiating teams said to have agreed in principle that there will be a customs border down the Irish Sea. Amid the rush to find a deal for the EU27 leaders to sign off at Thursday\u2019s European council summit, a draft text may be published on Wednesday if Downing Street gives the final green light, according to senior EU and British sources. The prime minister will brief his cabinet at 4pm before addressing a meeting of the Tory 1922 Committee. We are covering all the developments live. If a deal does emerge, Johnson would probably try to pass it through parliament very quickly on a historic Saturday sitting. The PM will need almost all Conservatives, most of the former Tories from whom he withdrew the whip, and either the DUP or a bloc of about a dozen Labour MPs to get it through the Commons. Two weeks before the UK\u2019s scheduled withdrawal from the EU, the National Audit Office has concluded that a no-deal Brexit carries significant and unpredictable risks that could lead to chaos at the UK\u2019s ports, more crime and fewer checks on migrants. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; There have been rowdy scenes over the past few hours in Hong Kong where Carrie Lam, the chief executive, had to abandon an address to the legislature and deliver it by videolink instead because of fierce heckling by pro-democracy lawmakers. &gt; The largest primary debate in US history has taken place with Elizabeth Warren coming under sustained attack by Democratic rivals.

Known for her revelations about political corruption in Malta, Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb in October 2017. Police are being criticised for failing to strike a plea deal with one of three men awaiting trial, which could have unmasked other individuals behind the killing.

It was the first time that so many Democratic presidential hopefuls have shared the same stage on one night.</p> <p>But the attention was almost all focused on one candidate, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who has emerged as the frontrunner after a slow and steady rise in her support, and who has crystallized her position in recent months as the party\u2019s intellectual and ideological center of gravity.

But the unity ended there.

She was attacked by Kamala Harris, who alleged that Warren was hypocritical for, of all things, not calling on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account. She was attacked by Joe Biden for supposedly being \u201cvague\u201d on Medicare for All. She would have been attacked by Tulsi Gabbard for her lack of military experience, except Gabbard was cut off by a moderator.</p> <p>For the most part, Warren weathered these attacks with patience, grace, and an agility in her rhetoric that rivals that of a gymnast on a balance beam. She refused to take the bait repeatedly offered to her by moderators and other candidates, who attempted to goad her into saying that she would raise taxes to cover Medicare for All. This denied her opponents a video clip that they could use to discredit her; instead, she hammered home the larger point that total costs would go down under her plan. She refused to get mired in the petty point of whether Twitter should suspend Trump\u2019s account; instead, she focused on how big tech companies have too much influence over our politics to go unregulated. She wouldn\u2019t concede Andrew Yang\u2019s dubious assertion that unregulated tech giants encourage innovation; instead, she focused on the ways that monopolies in all sectors of the economy \u2013 she cited agriculture and pharmaceuticals \u2013 need to be broken up to protect consumers.</p> <p>It was a frontrunner\u2019s strategy, a deflection technique meant to avoid inconvenient commitments and stymie the attack strategies of her rivals. Warren made moral cases instead of economic ones, refusing to get bogged down in the kinds of specifics that can only be communicated poorly and haphazardly to voters within the confines of the contentious debate format. To make her case in a general election, she will have to become more willing to communicate the details of her multitudinous plans on a mass scale, more ready to get down to brass tacks on television and on the debate stage. But Tuesday\u2019s debate was her first as the object of rivals\u2019 ire \u2013 before tonight, her opponents had more or less held their fire against her. The discipline and poise she showed in this new role bodes well for her performance in a general election against the erratic and taunting Trump. He will bait her and goad her, and she will be able to calmly and convincingly remain on message.</p> <p>Other candidates, meanwhile, shifted their strategies in the wake of the new political circumstances. Buttigieg was newly combative, displaying a strategy of attacking the more progressive wing of the party that he had debuted in a series of left-punching statements made in the days before the debate. He criticized Warren on her wealth tax and on Medicare for All, which he deemed impossible; he criticized the former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke for his call to institute a nationwide buy back for automatic weapons, a prospect that Buttigieg deemed a \u201cshiny object\u201d. The message was that better things are not possible, and that Democrats, and Americans more broadly, must lower their hopes. It was hardly an inspiring assertion, especially considering that Buttigieg delivered it with sneering condescension, apparently impressed with his own callous brand of pragmatism. The combination of cynicism, contempt, and Buttigieg\u2019s extreme youth was disquieting. The South Bend mayor\u2019s debate performance conjured the image of a character in a dark teen drama, an ambitious prep school debate captain who would throw his best friend under the bus in order to secure his own admission to Princeton. In reality, Buttigieg graduated from Harvard.</p> <p>Not everyone performed so poorly. Booker and Castro made dexterous pivots into auditions for the vice-presidential slot. Booker made pleas for civility and called on the candidates to unite against Trump; Castro made a concerted effort to expand the breadth of each question to include the concerns of marginalized communities, pointing out the role of police shootings in his answer to a question about gun violence and the role of class in response to a question about abortion rights.</p> <p>Bernie Sanders, returning to the debate stage and effectively to the campaign trail after his 1 October heart attack, performed with a degree of mental acuity and physical vitality meant to convey that he is capable of continuing his run. After the debate aired, his campaign announced an endorsement from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, billed for a rally this weekend in Queens, New York. The heart attack seems to have in effect ended Sanders\u2019 meaningful bid for the presidency \u2013 at 78, the concern over his health is not only severe but also greater than it would be for other candidates, and Sanders was falling in the polls before his hospitalization. But his fundraising remains robust \u2013 he led with nearly $25m last quarter, trailed narrowly by Warren \u2013 and he will not be exiting the race soon. On the debate stage, he signaled that he would be an advocate for progressive values throughout the primary contest and beyond. Sanders\u2019 endorsement will be coveted by whoever wins the nomination, and he will have an unusual degree of power in determining that person\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Still other candidates seemed nearly ornamental. Tom Steyer, the billionaire impeachment advocate who launched a vanity run in July, essentially bought his way into the debate, where he was largely decorative.</p> <p>But the most notable irrelevancy of the night was Joe Biden. Supposedly the candidate to beat, he was remarkably quiet on the debate stage. He mostly observed when the other candidates attacked Warren and looked on absently as she parried their attacks. Over the three hours of the broadcast, the former vice-president was often silent, frequently incoherent, and never able to get through a talking point without fumbling a poorly memorized phrase or mispronouncing an unfamiliar word. It was hard to imagine him as the president. It was hard, even, to decipher what he was trying to say. Joe Biden is a bit taller than Elizabeth Warren, but standing at the lectern next to his, she looked 10 feet tall.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

To make her case in a general election, she will have to become more willing to communicate the details of her multitudinous plans on a mass scale, more ready to get down to brass tacks on television and on the debate stage. But Tuesday\u2019s debate was her first as the object of rivals\u2019 ire \u2013 before tonight, her opponents had more or less held their fire against her. The discipline and poise she showed in this new role bodes well for her performance in a general election against the erratic and taunting Trump. He will bait her and goad her, and she will be able to calmly and convincingly remain on message. Other candidates, meanwhile, shifted their strategies in the wake of the new political circumstances. Buttigieg was newly combative, displaying a strategy of attacking the more progressive wing of the party that he had debuted in a series of left-punching statements made in the days before the debate. He criticized Warren on her wealth tax and on Medicare for All, which he deemed impossible; he criticized the former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke for his call to institute a nationwide buy back for automatic weapons, a prospect that Buttigieg deemed a \u201cshiny object\u201d. The message was that better things are not possible, and that Democrats, and Americans more broadly, must lower their hopes. It was hardly an inspiring assertion, especially considering that Buttigieg delivered it with sneering condescension, apparently impressed with his own callous brand of pragmatism. The combination of cynicism, contempt, and Buttigieg\u2019s extreme youth was disquieting. The South Bend mayor\u2019s debate performance conjured the image of a character in a dark teen drama, an ambitious prep school debate captain who would throw his best friend under the bus in order to secure his own admission to Princeton. In reality, Buttigieg graduated from Harvard. Not everyone performed so poorly. Booker and Castro made dexterous pivots into auditions for the vice-presidential slot. Booker made pleas for civility and called on the candidates to unite against Trump; Castro made a concerted effort to expand the breadth of each question to include the concerns of marginalized communities, pointing out the role of police shootings in his answer to a question about gun violence and the role of class in response to a question about abortion rights. Bernie Sanders, returning to the debate stage and effectively to the campaign trail after his 1 October heart attack, performed with a degree of mental acuity and physical vitality meant to convey that he is capable of continuing his run. After the debate aired, his campaign announced an endorsement from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, billed for a rally this weekend in Queens, New York. The heart attack seems to have in effect ended Sanders\u2019 meaningful bid for the presidency \u2013 at 78, the concern over his health is not only severe but also greater than it would be for other candidates, and Sanders was falling in the polls before his hospitalization. But his fundraising remains robust \u2013 he led with nearly $25m last quarter, trailed narrowly by Warren \u2013 and he will not be exiting the race soon. On the debate stage, he signaled that he would be an advocate for progressive values throughout the primary contest and beyond. Sanders\u2019 endorsement will be coveted by whoever wins the nomination, and he will have an unusual degree of power in determining that person\u2019s agenda. Still other candidates seemed nearly ornamental. Tom Steyer, the billionaire impeachment advocate who launched a vanity run in July, essentially bought his way into the debate, where he was largely decorative. But the most notable irrelevancy of the night was Joe Biden. Supposedly the candidate to beat, he was remarkably quiet on the debate stage. He mostly observed when the other candidates attacked Warren and looked on absently as she parried their attacks. Over the three hours of the broadcast, the former vice-president was often silent, frequently incoherent, and never able to get through a talking point without fumbling a poorly memorized phrase or mispronouncing an unfamiliar word. It was hard to imagine him as the president. It was hard, even, to decipher what he was trying to say. Joe Biden is a bit taller than Elizabeth Warren, but standing at the lectern next to his, she looked 10 feet tall. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",

This was back in 1990. I was 20.</p> <p>To be 20 years old in 1990 in New York City was, as far as I was concerned, to own the world. I owned practically nothing of material value back then, but somehow this was all part of a magical transaction in which I knew I\u2019d eventually get ahead even if it seemed, for the moment, like I could barely keep up. The city was still a wild kingdom, a stone-and-steel fortress with rage burning inside. The crack epidemic was long under way and also a long way from ending. Aids was everywhere \u2013 ravaging the bodies of the visibly ill and beckoning from public service announcements that preached condoms or death. The graffiti was only beginning to come off the subway cars.</p> <p>Every man, woman and, yes, many children (including those commuting to fancy prep schools) had been mugged or knew someone who had. Every woman knew what it was like to be creepily rubbed against by some dude in a crowded space, and when this happened many of us either jammed our elbows into his abdomen or rolled our eyes and moved away.</p> <p>One time, as I walked down a mostly empty Columbus Avenue around midnight, a man walked up to me \u2013 a redheaded, bearded man perhaps 10 years my senior \u2013 reached his hand out, and shoved me just below my left collarbone. It was a fairly hard shove, and I almost lifted my arm to shove him back. Instead, the moment passed and I just looked at him in disgust and confusion as we both continued along our way. I remember feeling grateful that the situation hadn\u2019t escalated into anything worse.</p> <p>What I don\u2019t remember is connecting the incident to anything like what would now be called institutionalized misogyny. This was not systemic oppression of women. This was simply life in the big city.</p> <p>Today, the angry, ranting woman with the folding table is gone from the sidewalk. In her place are millions of angry women marching in the streets and, even more so, ranting online. We are tiny pixels coalescing into a giant portrait of rage in all its definitions.</p> <p>Twenty years after the redheaded man shoved me on Columbus Avenue, men were going down like bowling pins against the unstoppable forces of #MeToo. What could you call the fall of 2017 other than the Fall of the Fall of Man. It was a season of hurricanes and rapid soil erosion, namely the mudslide that began with Harvey Weinstein and quickly pulled more men down with it than anyone could reasonably keep up with.</p> <p>Or maybe that\u2019s the wrong metaphor. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a mudslide as much as a giant oil spill from the tanker on which contemporary western society had been carrying its assumptions about male behavior. Like fossil fuels themselves, this behavior had long been construed as a necessary evil, one for which any purported cure seemed as futile and flimsy as a reusable shopping bag. (<em>Hit him with your stiletto if he gets handsy! Make him get in touch with his feelings! Pry his eyes open and force him to read the Scum</em><em> Manifesto!</em>)</p> <p>I\u2019m not going to even try to summarize the events of that fall or list the men who went down in the spill of #MeToo. Entire books will be written about that movement, the best of which probably can\u2019t be embarked upon until enough years have passed to allow authors even a modicum of perspective. What I can tell you about the fall of 2017 is that it coincided with a downward slope of my youth that was far steeper than I had any grasp of at the time.</p> <p>The autumn of 2017 marked my second year back in New York City after being away for the better part of two decades, most of it in California. Though I\u2019d left California in 2015 in the wake of irremediable, if mercifully amicable, marital separation, it had taken nearly two years to officially get divorced, and this new status carried a sting whose effects sometimes proved paralytic. How could I have imagined that replacing the license plates on your car could feel like a death? (Somehow I\u2019d managed to keep my car registered in California until the last possible minute.) Who knew that shopping for a new health insurance policy could make you feel like you\u2019re on a plastic pool raft floating aimlessly in the Dead Sea? (OK, I guess everyone knows that.)</p> <p>I\u2019d left New York when I was nearly 30. I was now 47. Whereas my chief experience of the city was that of a young woman, I was now faced with re-entering it as a middle-aged one.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just that I had been young in New York; New York was my youth. It was the place where I\u2019d spent my entire 20s. It was the place where I figured out what kind of person I wanted to be. That\u2019s a different thing from actually figuring out how to be that person, and it took leaving New York to accomplish that task, but as they like to say in California, setting your intention is the most important phase of the journey.</p> <p>New York was the backdrop for my earliest triumphs and stupidities. It was the first and last place I ever lived where on any given night you could step outside and feel like absolutely anything could happen, that the course of your life could shift like a subway train switching from the local track to the express.</p> <p>It was the place where I had my first real job, my first grown-up boyfriend, my first martini, my first call from a debt collector, my first call from a hospital pay phone telling me someone was in serious trouble. It was the site of my earliest rough drafts and rough treatments, the ones visited upon me as well as the ones I inflicted on others. Now that I had returned, it was as if my 20s were being handed back to me in used condition. What a strange remnant to hold in your hand; what a bittersweet walk down memory\u2019s plank.</p> <p>Here I was again, a girl alone and on the town. I was my most primordial self, a girl who was rabidly ambitious in some ways but inexplicably lazy in others. I was a girl who technically hadn\u2019t been a girl for the better part of 30 years but who nonetheless felt a strange remove from the word \u201cwoman\u201d, which seemed to convey a poise and seriousness I hadn\u2019t yet attained.</p> <p>I may have been in my mid-40s, but I was still all jokes and hammy self-deprecation, still unable to accept compliments, still flirting with men by defaulting to my best Diane Keaton in Manhattan impression, even though it had been decades since I was attracted to the kind of men who were attracted to that.</p> <p>I was all the things I\u2019d been when I was young except for the young part. I had a nicer apartment, a little more money, and a little more professional recognition. I had a dog (this I\u2019d longed for in my 20s the way some women long for babies) and a car that I had to move for alternate-side street cleaning. But my days were more or less the same. I sat at my desk and drank coffee. I did my work when I could, but more often I stared into space and wondered what would become of my life. I surfed the internet at a connection speed that would have been unimaginable in 1995.</p> <p>In part because of that connection speed, the space I stared into most of the time wasn\u2019t my own physical space but some unholy rotation of social media, news media and floating junk courtesy of cyberspace. By the time Donald Trump entered office, I probably spent at least three-quarters of my waking hours with my head in this space. By the time #MeToo reached full force, my brain no longer felt connected to my body. At times, my brain no longer felt associated with my brain as I\u2019d once known it. There were moments in which I couldn\u2019t remember the names of people I\u2019d been acquainted with for years.</p> <p>In intense, animated conversations with friends and colleagues, I\u2019d find myself revving up to some sort of grand insight and then suddenly sputtering out mid-sentence, like a rollercoaster propelled halfway up a loop but unable to make it all the way around. Bunched up in my desk chair, I would stare at the computer screen for hours, hunting for words as though tracking lions on safari and practically sweating from the exertion. More than a few times I wondered if I was experiencing some form of dementia.</p> <p>I once read that there\u2019s scientific proof of a correlation between increased nostalgia and creeping senility. And since returning to New York, I\u2019d been soaking in nostalgia. Everywhere I went, my 20s played in my head like a song stuck there permanently. Every neighborhood, every subway station, in some areas every street corner, echoed with some memory from that time. There was John\u2019s pizzeria on Bleecker, where, at 21 and playing hooky from college upstate, I sat with a man \u2013 a boy, really \u2013 who both was and wasn\u2019t my boyfriend and listened to him reminisce about his old girlfriend, who, he said, was \u201csexy without being pretty, if that makes any sense\u201d.</p> <p>There, among the slabs of buildings of Midtown Sixth Avenue, were the offices of more temp jobs than I could count: banks, law firms, insurance companies, each with its own mini kitchen and passcode-protected employee restrooms. There, at 57th and Broadway is a Duane Reade pharmacy that was once Coliseum Books, a place where the feral woman had often stood and yelled: \u201cSign the petition!\u201d</p> <p>I remember being dumped on Delancey Street, kissed on Charles Street, having a strange and short-lived personal assistant job in a musty apartment on Sutton Place.</p> <p>I remember standing on the corner of Eighth Avenue and 49th Street as hail rained down like shellfire one summer night following a long, somewhat drunken dinner with an older man in a powerful position whose meal invitations I dreaded but nonetheless felt obliged to accept.</p> <p>Those meals had started out as business lunches but then migrated into semi-business dinners. During these dinners, the man would tell me certain details about his personal life, which was in a state of acute crisis. I didn\u2019t particularly want to be there but I accepted the invitations because there was in this transaction the implicit notion that he could help my career, albeit in a rather vague, abstract way. I accepted them so because not doing so felt like a kind of professional self-sabotage, as foolish and irresponsible as missing deadlines.</p> <p>At no time did the man make an ultimatum or proposition me directly. I never felt like I was being sexually harassed and obviously no one was kidnapping me from my apartment and forcibly escorting me to the Oyster Bar, where the man would sit waiting for me, smoking probably the fourth of 15 cigarettes he\u2019d smoke that night. I\u2019ll cop to a certain psychological gamesmanship on my part as well. I\u2019d occasionally bum a cigarette from him, an act that gave me a sense of distance and control but that surely read to him as an intimate gesture.</p> <p>At least a few times, after I probably had one too many glasses of wine, I became rather suggestive and flirtatious, inquiring into his personal life, seeing how much I could get him to disclose as he got drunker. I did this in part as a defense mechanism. The more we talked about him, the less we talked about me. But I also did it because I wanted to mess with his head, and I was young enough then to think that doing so would serve as some kind of tacit punishment for his behavior.</p> <p>The truth, of course (which anyone but a young twerp would have the wisdom to realize), was that messing with his head was its own reward for him. I wasn\u2019t censuring his behavior as much as reinforcing it. As for my own, I\u2019ve been cringing about it ever since.</p> <p>Looking back, it would be easy to say I behaved like this out of some instinctive subordination to the man\u2019s power. There\u2019s an element of truth to that, but there\u2019s also an angle at which the situation could be viewed as quite the opposite. From this angle, I behaved the way I did because in some ways the power imbalance between the two of us was tipped in my favor.</p> <p>I was young and the man was twice my age. He may have had professional power over me, but it was limited and in no way unilateral. In fact, thanks to the personal details I\u2019d siphoned out of him, I probably could have placed one phone call and made his life very difficult. And so I carried on with my coquettishness until somehow the meals became fewer and farther between and then finally ended, probably because he took up with someone else. I carried on this way because my life was an open horizon and his was an overstuffed attic.</p> <p>I behaved this way because I must have known on some unconscious level that, at 25, I had more of a certain kind of power than I was ever going to have in my life and that I might as well use it, even if the accompanying rush was laced with shame.</p> <p>This was the summer of 1995. Alanis Morissette\u2019s Jagged Little Pill had come out that June, and I listened to it pretty much on constant repeat through August. One night, after doing my silly routine with this man and riding the subway home in self-disgust, I sat in my room and played Jagged Little Pill and then wandered into the kitchen to talk to my roommate. I remember grumbling to her about my dinner companion, complaining about his lechery while conveniently omitting the parts when I\u2019d dramatically exhaled on my cigarette, looked him straight in the eye, and said something devastatingly witty and possibly a tiny bit dirty. (I\u2019d like to add that I winked, but that wouldn\u2019t past the truth test, since I\u2019m physically unable to wink.)</p> <p>Instead I said: \u201cGod, what a perv.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds annoying,\u201d my roommate said. \u201cBut hey, you keep showing up. You must be getting something out of it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I behaved this way because I must have known that, at 25, I had more power than I was ever going to have in my life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During the Fall of the Fall of Man, I thought a lot about the showing up I\u2019d done over the years. Every woman seemed to be taking this kind of inventory. It was like a novel everyone was reading, one with a plot that seemed easy enough to follow but whose underlying themes and messages amount to an abstruse thicket of personal projection and postmodern obfuscation.</p> <p>Like any sentient being, I\u2019d been shocked and disgusted by the Weinstein revelations and saw no reason to equivocate about the reliability of his accusers or the severity of his punishment. But as the list of perpetrators piled up and the public censure piled on, the conversation around #MeToo (lacking a specific category, each new scandal was not a story or an issue but a \u201cconversation\u201d) began to split down generational lines.</p> <p>The first incident to put this divide in notably sharp relief involved a secret Google spreadsheet called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/11/shitty-media-men-lawsuit-stephen-elliott-moira-donegan\">Shitty Media Men list</a>. This was an anonymously sourced, living document meant to warn women about certain men in the media business, mostly publishing, who were known for inappropriate sexual or sexually charged behavior.</p> <p>It included all kinds of men, from powerful editors to freelance writers, and described alleged misdeeds that ranged from \u201cweird lunch dates\u201d to inappropriate flirting to stalking to physical violence and all-out rape. And though the list was never officially published and disappeared from Google Docs almost as quickly as it emerged, enough screenshots were taken that the perpetrators became common knowledge almost immediately.</p> <p>Within hours of the list\u2019s discovery, the chief line of inquiry around it, even more so than \u201cWho started it?\u201d, was whether infractions like \u201cweird lunches\u201d should be lumped in with crimes like rape. Unsurprisingly, I found myself on the side of the oldsters who were deeply troubled not just by this \u201clumping\u201d (again, there seemed to be only one operative word, and in this case it was \u201clump\u201d) but by the idea that anonymously sourced accusations could be made against publicly named people without warning or any sort of due process.</p> <p>\u201cThis is so wrong!\u201d my same-age friends and I ranted. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do this! These millennials don\u2019t get it!\u201d We said this as we forwarded the screenshots among each other, gawking at the names we recognized.</p> <p>\u201cWeird lunch!\u201d I said to more than one person. \u201cWelcome to publishing! I\u2019m going to write a memoir about my early days in New York and call it Weird Lunch.\u201d</p> <p>And as the \u201cconversation\u201d lurched along and the narrative of the \u201cgenerational divide\u201d became the default narrative, I found myself reminded of this passage of time on a daily, even hourly, basis. When a scandal broke involving the actor and comedian Aziz Ansari, I felt that my membership on Team Older Feminist was so official that I might as well take out a charge card at Eileen Fisher and call it a day (though has anyone under 40 ever used a \u201ccharge card\u201d?)</p> <p>And so the ground began to shake around the fault line. The older feminists scolded the younger ones for not being tough enough to take care of themselves. <em>If the construction worker whistles at you, give him the finger! If the drunk guy sitting next to you at the wedding reception gets fresh, kick him in the shins!</em></p> <p>In turn, the youngsters chastised the oldsters for enabling the oppressive status quo with cool-girl posturing. <em>We shouldn\u2019t have to suppress our humanity by letting insults roll off us! We shouldn\u2019t have to risk our safety with physical violence because patriarchal norms have taught the drunk wedding guest he can act like that!</em></p> <p>Neither side was entirely wrong, of course. But both sides were talking past each other in ways that suggested there was no meeting in the middle. In the New York Times, Daphne Merkin identified a gulf between what women said publicly about #MeToo and the eye-rolling that went on in private. \u201cPublicly, they say the right things, expressing approval and joining in the chorus of voices that applaud the takedown of maleficent characters who prey on vulnerable women in the workplace,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn private it\u2019s a different story. \u2018Grow up, this is real life,\u2019 I hear these same feminist friends say.\u201d</p> <p>In the Atlantic, Caitlin Flanagan, whose tendency toward a certain impish prudery has never made her popular among young feminists, wrote that the Ansari fracas, at least the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/15/aziz-ansari-responds-to-sexual-assault-allegation\">version of it chronicled on Babe.net</a>, constituted \u201c3,000 words of revenge porn\u201d. She decried the helplessness of \u201ca whole country full of young women who don\u2019t know how to call a cab\u201d.</p> <p>On cable news, the HLN anchor Ashleigh Banfield looked straight into the camera and addressed \u201cGrace\u201d directly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you have done in my opinion is appalling,\u201d said Banfield, calling the allegations \u201creckless and hollow\u201d and charging Grace with having \u201cchiseled away at a movement that I along with all of my sisters in the workplace have been dreaming of for decades\u201d.</p> <p>This being cable news, Banfield\u2019s producers invited Katie Way to appear on the show. And this being the digital era, Way declined the offer not with a \u201cno thanks\u201d but by popping off an email that called Banfield a \u201cburgundy lipstick bad highlights second wave feminist has-been\u201d and noted that \u201cno woman my age would ever watch your network\u201d.</p> <p>As I watched all of this whiz past me on my computer screen, sharpened by the reading glasses I\u2019d lately been forced to wear, I wondered if my real problem with young feminists was how little they seemed to need us older ones. As far as I could see, they didn\u2019t even want to know us.</p> <p>At 25, I not only wanted to know people like Daphne Merkin and Ashleigh Banfield, I wanted to be them. There were hundreds of women in my imaginative orbit \u2013 some of them over 50 or possibly even 60 \u2013 whom I felt this way about. I knew none of them, but I wanted to be all of them. Together, they formed a great phalanx of wise elders whose only duty to me was to be themselves. My duty, in turn, was to watch and learn.

      "bodyText": "I remember a woman who screamed like a feral animal. She was leather tan and sinewy. Spiked bleached blonde hair, sculpted biceps, low-slung cargo pants with Doc Martens, veins bursting from her neck, eyes bugging from her drawn face. She stood on the sidewalks of New York City with a folding table covered with poster-size images from hardcore pornography: women wearing dog collars, women on leashes, women leaned over and viewed from behind, their backs crosshatched with scars. Much of the time she displayed a blowup of the famous Hustler magazine cover showing a naked woman being fed upside down into a meat grinder. \u201cThis is what your husbands are masturbating to,\u201d she shouted in a barking monotone. \u201cWake up, women! Don\u2019t be passive! Sign the petition!\u201d Most everyone turned away or just kept walking. This was back in 1990. I was 20. To be 20 years old in 1990 in New York City was, as far as I was concerned, to own the world. I owned practically nothing of material value back then, but somehow this was all part of a magical transaction in which I knew I\u2019d eventually get ahead even if it seemed, for the moment, like I could barely keep up. The city was still a wild kingdom, a stone-and-steel fortress with rage burning inside. The crack epidemic was long under way and also a long way from ending. Aids was everywhere \u2013 ravaging the bodies of the visibly ill and beckoning from public service announcements that preached condoms or death. The graffiti was only beginning to come off the subway cars. Every man, woman and, yes, many children (including those commuting to fancy prep schools) had been mugged or knew someone who had. Every woman knew what it was like to be creepily rubbed against by some dude in a crowded space, and when this happened many of us either jammed our elbows into his abdomen or rolled our eyes and moved away. One time, as I walked down a mostly empty Columbus Avenue around midnight, a man walked up to me \u2013 a redheaded, bearded man perhaps 10 years my senior \u2013 reached his hand out, and shoved me just below my left collarbone. It was a fairly hard shove, and I almost lifted my arm to shove him back. Instead, the moment passed and I just looked at him in disgust and confusion as we both continued along our way. I remember feeling grateful that the situation hadn\u2019t escalated into anything worse. What I don\u2019t remember is connecting the incident to anything like what would now be called institutionalized misogyny. This was not systemic oppression of women. This was simply life in the big city. Today, the angry, ranting woman with the folding table is gone from the sidewalk. In her place are millions of angry women marching in the streets and, even more so, ranting online. We are tiny pixels coalescing into a giant portrait of rage in all its definitions. Twenty years after the redheaded man shoved me on Columbus Avenue, men were going down like bowling pins against the unstoppable forces of #MeToo. What could you call the fall of 2017 other than the Fall of the Fall of Man. It was a season of hurricanes and rapid soil erosion, namely the mudslide that began with Harvey Weinstein and quickly pulled more men down with it than anyone could reasonably keep up with. Or maybe that\u2019s the wrong metaphor. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a mudslide as much as a giant oil spill from the tanker on which contemporary western society had been carrying its assumptions about male behavior. Like fossil fuels themselves, this behavior had long been construed as a necessary evil, one for which any purported cure seemed as futile and flimsy as a reusable shopping bag. (Hit him with your stiletto if he gets handsy! Make him get in touch with his feelings! Pry his eyes open and force him to read the Scum Manifesto!) I\u2019m not going to even try to summarize the events of that fall or list the men who went down in the spill of #MeToo. Entire books will be written about that movement, the best of which probably can\u2019t be embarked upon until enough years have passed to allow authors even a modicum of perspective. What I can tell you about the fall of 2017 is that it coincided with a downward slope of my youth that was far steeper than I had any grasp of at the time. The autumn of 2017 marked my second year back in New York City after being away for the better part of two decades, most of it in California. Though I\u2019d left California in 2015 in the wake of irremediable, if mercifully amicable, marital separation, it had taken nearly two years to officially get divorced, and this new status carried a sting whose effects sometimes proved paralytic. How could I have imagined that replacing the license plates on your car could feel like a death? (Somehow I\u2019d managed to keep my car registered in California until the last possible minute.) Who knew that shopping for a new health insurance policy could make you feel like you\u2019re on a plastic pool raft floating aimlessly in the Dead Sea? (OK, I guess everyone knows that.) I\u2019d left New York when I was nearly 30. I was now 47. Whereas my chief experience of the city was that of a young woman, I was now faced with re-entering it as a middle-aged one. It wasn\u2019t just that I had been young in New York; New York was my youth. It was the place where I\u2019d spent my entire 20s. It was the place where I figured out what kind of person I wanted to be. That\u2019s a different thing from actually figuring out how to be that person, and it took leaving New York to accomplish that task, but as they like to say in California, setting your intention is the most important phase of the journey. New York was the backdrop for my earliest triumphs and stupidities. It was the first and last place I ever lived where on any given night you could step outside and feel like absolutely anything could happen, that the course of your life could shift like a subway train switching from the local track to the express. It was the place where I had my first real job, my first grown-up boyfriend, my first martini, my first call from a debt collector, my first call from a hospital pay phone telling me someone was in serious trouble. It was the site of my earliest rough drafts and rough treatments, the ones visited upon me as well as the ones I inflicted on others. Now that I had returned, it was as if my 20s were being handed back to me in used condition. What a strange remnant to hold in your hand; what a bittersweet walk down memory\u2019s plank. Here I was again, a girl alone and on the town. I was my most primordial self, a girl who was rabidly ambitious in some ways but inexplicably lazy in others. I was a girl who technically hadn\u2019t been a girl for the better part of 30 years but who nonetheless felt a strange remove from the word \u201cwoman\u201d, which seemed to convey a poise and seriousness I hadn\u2019t yet attained. I may have been in my mid-40s, but I was still all jokes and hammy self-deprecation, still unable to accept compliments, still flirting with men by defaulting to my best Diane Keaton in Manhattan impression, even though it had been decades since I was attracted to the kind of men who were attracted to that. I was all the things I\u2019d been when I was young except for the young part. I had a nicer apartment, a little more money, and a little more professional recognition. I had a dog (this I\u2019d longed for in my 20s the way some women long for babies) and a car that I had to move for alternate-side street cleaning. But my days were more or less the same. I sat at my desk and drank coffee. I did my work when I could, but more often I stared into space and wondered what would become of my life. I surfed the internet at a connection speed that would have been unimaginable in 1995. In part because of that connection speed, the space I stared into most of the time wasn\u2019t my own physical space but some unholy rotation of social media, news media and floating junk courtesy of cyberspace. By the time Donald Trump entered office, I probably spent at least three-quarters of my waking hours with my head in this space. By the time #MeToo reached full force, my brain no longer felt connected to my body. At times, my brain no longer felt associated with my brain as I\u2019d once known it. There were moments in which I couldn\u2019t remember the names of people I\u2019d been acquainted with for years. In intense, animated conversations with friends and colleagues, I\u2019d find myself revving up to some sort of grand insight and then suddenly sputtering out mid-sentence, like a rollercoaster propelled halfway up a loop but unable to make it all the way around. Bunched up in my desk chair, I would stare at the computer screen for hours, hunting for words as though tracking lions on safari and practically sweating from the exertion. More than a few times I wondered if I was experiencing some form of dementia. I once read that there\u2019s scientific proof of a correlation between increased nostalgia and creeping senility. And since returning to New York, I\u2019d been soaking in nostalgia. Everywhere I went, my 20s played in my head like a song stuck there permanently. Every neighborhood, every subway station, in some areas every street corner, echoed with some memory from that time. There was John\u2019s pizzeria on Bleecker, where, at 21 and playing hooky from college upstate, I sat with a man \u2013 a boy, really \u2013 who both was and wasn\u2019t my boyfriend and listened to him reminisce about his old girlfriend, who, he said, was \u201csexy without being pretty, if that makes any sense\u201d. There, among the slabs of buildings of Midtown Sixth Avenue, were the offices of more temp jobs than I could count: banks, law firms, insurance companies, each with its own mini kitchen and passcode-protected employee restrooms. There, at 57th and Broadway is a Duane Reade pharmacy that was once Coliseum Books, a place where the feral woman had often stood and yelled: \u201cSign the petition!\u201d I remember being dumped on Delancey Street, kissed on Charles Street, having a strange and short-lived personal assistant job in a musty apartment on Sutton Place. I remember standing on the corner of Eighth Avenue and 49th Street as hail rained down like shellfire one summer night following a long, somewhat drunken dinner with an older man in a powerful position whose meal invitations I dreaded but nonetheless felt obliged to accept. Those meals had started out as business lunches but then migrated into semi-business dinners. During these dinners, the man would tell me certain details about his personal life, which was in a state of acute crisis. I didn\u2019t particularly want to be there but I accepted the invitations because there was in this transaction the implicit notion that he could help my career, albeit in a rather vague, abstract way. I accepted them so because not doing so felt like a kind of professional self-sabotage, as foolish and irresponsible as missing deadlines. At no time did the man make an ultimatum or proposition me directly. I never felt like I was being sexually harassed and obviously no one was kidnapping me from my apartment and forcibly escorting me to the Oyster Bar, where the man would sit waiting for me, smoking probably the fourth of 15 cigarettes he\u2019d smoke that night. I\u2019ll cop to a certain psychological gamesmanship on my part as well. I\u2019d occasionally bum a cigarette from him, an act that gave me a sense of distance and control but that surely read to him as an intimate gesture. At least a few times, after I probably had one too many glasses of wine, I became rather suggestive and flirtatious, inquiring into his personal life, seeing how much I could get him to disclose as he got drunker. I did this in part as a defense mechanism. The more we talked about him, the less we talked about me. But I also did it because I wanted to mess with his head, and I was young enough then to think that doing so would serve as some kind of tacit punishment for his behavior. The truth, of course (which anyone but a young twerp would have the wisdom to realize), was that messing with his head was its own reward for him. I wasn\u2019t censuring his behavior as much as reinforcing it. As for my own, I\u2019ve been cringing about it ever since. Looking back, it would be easy to say I behaved like this out of some instinctive subordination to the man\u2019s power. There\u2019s an element of truth to that, but there\u2019s also an angle at which the situation could be viewed as quite the opposite. From this angle, I behaved the way I did because in some ways the power imbalance between the two of us was tipped in my favor. I was young and the man was twice my age. He may have had professional power over me, but it was limited and in no way unilateral. In fact, thanks to the personal details I\u2019d siphoned out of him, I probably could have placed one phone call and made his life very difficult. And so I carried on with my coquettishness until somehow the meals became fewer and farther between and then finally ended, probably because he took up with someone else. I carried on this way because my life was an open horizon and his was an overstuffed attic. I behaved this way because I must have known on some unconscious level that, at 25, I had more of a certain kind of power than I was ever going to have in my life and that I might as well use it, even if the accompanying rush was laced with shame. This was the summer of 1995. Alanis Morissette\u2019s Jagged Little Pill had come out that June, and I listened to it pretty much on constant repeat through August. One night, after doing my silly routine with this man and riding the subway home in self-disgust, I sat in my room and played Jagged Little Pill and then wandered into the kitchen to talk to my roommate. I remember grumbling to her about my dinner companion, complaining about his lechery while conveniently omitting the parts when I\u2019d dramatically exhaled on my cigarette, looked him straight in the eye, and said something devastatingly witty and possibly a tiny bit dirty. (I\u2019d like to add that I winked, but that wouldn\u2019t past the truth test, since I\u2019m physically unable to wink.) Instead I said: \u201cGod, what a perv.\u201d \u201cSounds annoying,\u201d my roommate said. \u201cBut hey, you keep showing up. You must be getting something out of it.\u201d During the Fall of the Fall of Man, I thought a lot about the showing up I\u2019d done over the years. Every woman seemed to be taking this kind of inventory. It was like a novel everyone was reading, one with a plot that seemed easy enough to follow but whose underlying themes and messages amount to an abstruse thicket of personal projection and postmodern obfuscation. Like any sentient being, I\u2019d been shocked and disgusted by the Weinstein revelations and saw no reason to equivocate about the reliability of his accusers or the severity of his punishment. But as the list of perpetrators piled up and the public censure piled on, the conversation around #MeToo (lacking a specific category, each new scandal was not a story or an issue but a \u201cconversation\u201d) began to split down generational lines. The first incident to put this divide in notably sharp relief involved a secret Google spreadsheet called the Shitty Media Men list. This was an anonymously sourced, living document meant to warn women about certain men in the media business, mostly publishing, who were known for inappropriate sexual or sexually charged behavior. It included all kinds of men, from powerful editors to freelance writers, and described alleged misdeeds that ranged from \u201cweird lunch dates\u201d to inappropriate flirting to stalking to physical violence and all-out rape. And though the list was never officially published and disappeared from Google Docs almost as quickly as it emerged, enough screenshots were taken that the perpetrators became common knowledge almost immediately. Within hours of the list\u2019s discovery, the chief line of inquiry around it, even more so than \u201cWho started it?\u201d, was whether infractions like \u201cweird lunches\u201d should be lumped in with crimes like rape. Unsurprisingly, I found myself on the side of the oldsters who were deeply troubled not just by this \u201clumping\u201d (again, there seemed to be only one operative word, and in this case it was \u201clump\u201d) but by the idea that anonymously sourced accusations could be made against publicly named people without warning or any sort of due process. \u201cThis is so wrong!\u201d my same-age friends and I ranted. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do this! These millennials don\u2019t get it!\u201d We said this as we forwarded the screenshots among each other, gawking at the names we recognized. \u201cWeird lunch!\u201d I said to more than one person. \u201cWelcome to publishing! I\u2019m going to write a memoir about my early days in New York and call it Weird Lunch.\u201d And as the \u201cconversation\u201d lurched along and the narrative of the \u201cgenerational divide\u201d became the default narrative, I found myself reminded of this passage of time on a daily, even hourly, basis. When a scandal broke involving the actor and comedian Aziz Ansari, I felt that my membership on Team Older Feminist was so official that I might as well take out a charge card at Eileen Fisher and call it a day (though has anyone under 40 ever used a \u201ccharge card\u201d?) And so the ground began to shake around the fault line. The older feminists scolded the younger ones for not being tough enough to take care of themselves. If the construction worker whistles at you, give him the finger! If the drunk guy sitting next to you at the wedding reception gets fresh, kick him in the shins! In turn, the youngsters chastised the oldsters for enabling the oppressive status quo with cool-girl posturing. We shouldn\u2019t have to suppress our humanity by letting insults roll off us! We shouldn\u2019t have to risk our safety with physical violence because patriarchal norms have taught the drunk wedding guest he can act like that! Neither side was entirely wrong, of course. But both sides were talking past each other in ways that suggested there was no meeting in the middle. In the New York Times, Daphne Merkin identified a gulf between what women said publicly about #MeToo and the eye-rolling that went on in private. \u201cPublicly, they say the right things, expressing approval and joining in the chorus of voices that applaud the takedown of maleficent characters who prey on vulnerable women in the workplace,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn private it\u2019s a different story. \u2018Grow up, this is real life,\u2019 I hear these same feminist friends say.\u201d In the Atlantic, Caitlin Flanagan, whose tendency toward a certain impish prudery has never made her popular among young feminists, wrote that the Ansari fracas, at least the version of it chronicled on Babe.net, constituted \u201c3,000 words of revenge porn\u201d. She decried the helplessness of \u201ca whole country full of young women who don\u2019t know how to call a cab\u201d. On cable news, the HLN anchor Ashleigh Banfield looked straight into the camera and addressed \u201cGrace\u201d directly. \u201cWhat you have done in my opinion is appalling,\u201d said Banfield, calling the allegations \u201creckless and hollow\u201d and charging Grace with having \u201cchiseled away at a movement that I along with all of my sisters in the workplace have been dreaming of for decades\u201d. This being cable news, Banfield\u2019s producers invited Katie Way to appear on the show. And this being the digital era, Way declined the offer not with a \u201cno thanks\u201d but by popping off an email that called Banfield a \u201cburgundy lipstick bad highlights second wave feminist has-been\u201d and noted that \u201cno woman my age would ever watch your network\u201d. As I watched all of this whiz past me on my computer screen, sharpened by the reading glasses I\u2019d lately been forced to wear, I wondered if my real problem with young feminists was how little they seemed to need us older ones. As far as I could see, they didn\u2019t even want to know us. At 25, I not only wanted to know people like Daphne Merkin and Ashleigh Banfield, I wanted to be them. There were hundreds of women in my imaginative orbit \u2013 some of them over 50 or possibly even 60 \u2013 whom I felt this way about. I knew none of them, but I wanted to be all of them. Together, they formed a great phalanx of wise elders whose only duty to me was to be themselves. My duty, in turn, was to watch and learn. By which I mean that was my duty to myself. But something was different back then. I shared a planet with those elders. We occupied the same universe. We breathed the same air. The same cannot be said for the relationship between my generation and those that are coming up behind us. The world has changed so much between my time and theirs that someone just 10 years younger might as well belong to a different geological epoch. To a young person, someone like me is not so much an elder as an extinction. Is it any wonder, then, that older generations\u2019 contributions to the conversation are, at best, a kind of verbal meteor shower, the flickering, nattering remains of planets that haven\u2019t existed for eons? So this is where I find myself. Amid my exasperation and confusion, I have wandered into a devastating but oddly beautiful revelation: my generation will be the last to have known the world in its analog form. As a result, we\u2019ve grown old before actually getting old. We\u2019ve become dinosaurs before we\u2019re even 50. And it\u2019s here, from this primitive-creature vantage point, that I find myself pressed up against yet another revelation: the questions we face now when it comes to men and women are questions that arose a split second ago. Modern humans have been around for about 200,000 years. Civilization as we know it has been churning away for perhaps 6,000 years. Until the birth control pill came along in 1960, we were all essentially prisoners of nature, with women\u2019s conditions being markedly worse, sometimes obscenely so. Until 1960, the idea that women could compete with men in the job market, that men should do housework, that women had any purpose in life higher than having babies and men had any purpose higher than financially supporting those babies or going to war to protect them, was something close to unthinkable. That we have come so far in so little time is a marvel. That we should expect all the kinks to have been worked out by now is insane. In the scheme of things, the 59 years that have elapsed between 1960 and today is a nanosecond, a flash of time so imperceptible that it has passed in increments of billions by the time you have read this sentence. It was already nearly 30 years ago that the feral woman was out there with her folding table yelling: \u201cSign the petition.\u201d It was already nearly 30 years ago that, as far as I was concerned, I owned the world. It feels like yesterday. Then again, every day feels like yesterday. Every day becomes yesterday before you know it. Copyright 2019 by Meghan Daum.

Under Ethiopia\u2019s charismatic prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who was recently awarded the Nobel peace prize after forging a peace deal with Eritrea shortly after his appointment in April last year, and his lieutenant in the capital, deputy mayor Takele Uma, Addis Ababa is undergoing its most radical facelift in a generation, with the old station as the centrepiece.

Ezana argues that \u201cthese kind of projects are high-end projects\u201d that will aggravate social segregation, despite the government\u2019s promises to rehouse everyone on site. \u201cVery few people in Addis could afford to live in these flats. So developers or someone else will buy them out,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll be displaced by market forces.\u201d Meanwhile, Slieshi Degefa of the River Basins &amp; Green Areas Agency has said that up to 10,000 residents could be relocated as part of efforts to clean the rivers and surrounding areas. Several residents complained that they had been told their homes would be demolished and they were uncertain about their future. \u201cWe are not happy at all,\u201d says Mekbib, whose neighbourhood of 450 houses near the palace is to be cleared for a park. \u201cThey didn\u2019t consult us. Two months ago they just arrived with a form to be filled in within two days. It was a total shock.\u201d A new social housing project on the edge of Addis Ababa. Photograph: Charlie Rosser And then there are those who feel that, even if the government\u2019s intentions are positive, the lack of consultation with professionals is worrying. Biruk Terrefe, aPhD candidate at Oxford University\u2019s Department of International Development, argues that \u201cthe roll-out of big infrastructure that essentially still ignores existing plans ... and blindsides city administration officials sets a dangerous precedent\u201d. In this sense, he says, the administration is acting much like past Ethiopian regimes \u2013 despite the new rhetoric. La Gare, for instance, came out of nowhere, catching almost all architects, policymakers and city planners by surprise. The deal seems to have been struck at the highest diplomatic level, between Abiy and the Emirati rulers, as part of a package of investment geared towards easing Ethiopia\u2019s hard currency shortage. Even the city\u2019s planning office was kept in the dark. The architect Nahom Teklu Bekele describes it as a \u201cblank slate intervention\u201d that ignores the city\u2019s existing urban fabric. The old station sits at the southern end of Addis Ababa\u2019s only historic avenue, with a view all the way to city hall on a hilltop in the distance. La Gare will obstruct this entirely. \u201cHow dare someone block this historic vista and view?\u201d Nahom asks. \u201cThis is the only landmark urban space the city has.\u201d Takele\u2019s confidence, however, is undimmed. For him and the prime minister, it seems, gentrifying Addis Ababa is an endeavour that, like previous state megaprojects, Ethiopians should rally behind as a symbol of national pride. \u201cThe name Addis Ababa means \u2018new flower\u2019, and we need to make it live up to the name,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure one day this will be one of the best cities in Africa, and in the world \u2013 but we need to start now.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter \u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2019 because an earlier version referred to Takele Uma as a former deputy mayor of Addis Ababa.

      "body": "<p>In his <a href=\"https://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-poe/\">Poetics</a>, Aristotle argued that poetry was a more scientific and serious genre than history. This was because, he said, history is concerned only with individual and particular events. Poetry, on the other hand, is concerned with what might happen: that is, deep and general truths. In the newly revamped Museum of Modern Art in New York, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/10/moma-expansion-museum-new-york\">which reopens</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/10/moma-expansion-museum-new-york\"> on 21 October</a>, the march of history, at least as it has been understood by MoMA in recent decades, is out and poetry is in.</p> <p>Inside the refreshed museum \u2013 its gallery space enlarged by 30% thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/08/high-line-architects-liz-diller-and-ricardo-scofidio-win-ra-prize\">architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro</a> \u2013 a radical rehang reverses the museum\u2019s old \u201cBook of Genesis\u201d approach, as MoMA director <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/about/senior-staff/glenn-lowry\">Glenn D Lowry</a> characterised it. Recent decades have seen the museum organised by way of a stately procession, in which art movements and -isms were shown to have begotten other movements and -isms.</p> <p>This lucid, but necessarily sealed-off, worldview has now been replaced with the kind of thematic approach familiar to British audiences from two decades of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tate-modern\">Tate Modern</a> hangs. While still arranged according to a broad chronology, beginning with the 1880s on the fifth floor and descending to the present on the second, MoMA\u2019s individual rooms are organised around ideas, with titles such as War Within, War Without, Inner and Outer Space, and True Stories.</p> <p>The view of art history on show here is no longer one of straight lines and linear progressions, but one much more like the complex ripples set in motion by pebbles thrown into a pond. No longer will MoMA claim to tell a single story of modern and contemporary art. Every six months, the hang will substantially change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"058b42278dafe487e6d569a581e0197ed3d59914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/058b42278dafe487e6d569a581e0197ed3d59914/0_0_1993_2000/997.jpg\" alt=\"Into orbit \u2026 The Moon, 1928, by pioneering female modernist Tarsila do Amaral.\" width=\"997\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into orbit \u2026 The Moon, 1928, by pioneering female modernist Tarsila do Amaral.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Gerhardt/MoMA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some might say MoMA is letting itself off the hook: no definitive statements are made and everything is allowed to hover provisionally until the next remix. Lowry argues it is returning to the museum\u2019s founding principles. The great first director, <a href=\"https://www.theartstory.org/influencer/barr-alfred/\">Alfred H Barr Jr</a>, wrote: \u201cNothing that the visitors will see in the exhibition galleries, neither the works of art, nor the lighting fixtures, nor even the partitions, is at present permanent.\u201d</p> <p>Barr understood, said Lowry, \u201cthat the museum was to be a work in progress, changing and evolving as the world of contemporary art changed and evolved\u201d. The museum\u2019s glaciation of its displays came later, in the 1960s and 70s, he said. Nevertheless, even in the brave indeterminate future, there will remain a few constants. Some works \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80220\">Monet\u2019s Water Lilies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79766\">Picasso\u2019s Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon</a> \u2013 will always be there. \u201cWe\u2019d have a revolution if we took down the Water Lilies,\u201d said Ann Temkin, chief curator of painting and sculpture, at a museum preview.</p> <p>Underlying the new mix-it-up approach is the argument that teleological art history \u2013 seeing the present as the logical culmination of the past \u2013 lacks contingency, fails to take into account the idea that once upon a time C\u00e9zanne, say, was just a bloke making strange paintings in the south of France, not an art history colossus whose work had a mind-blowing market value. So the new hang is not a \u201cbang, bang, bang\u201d of famous masterpiece after famous masterpiece, as Temkin phrased it. While we spoke, we were sitting with our backs to <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/paul-cezanne-the-bather-c-1885/\">C\u00e9zanne\u2019s The Bather</a>, newly cleaned, with zingy blue details revealed of its background of rocks and water. To our right were <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/vincent-van-gogh-the-starry-night-1889/\">Van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night</a> and <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79277\">Henri Rousseau\u2019s The Dream</a>. So far, so \u201cbang, bang, bang\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"757a71f995ab76e611940458d539bb1ee887353e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/757a71f995ab76e611940458d539bb1ee887353e/43_0_1875_1125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne and Rousseau now hang near ceramics by the \u2018mad potter of Biloxi\u2019 George Ohr.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne and Rousseau now hang near ceramics by the \u2018mad potter of Biloxi\u2019 George Ohr.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Muzikar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in a case in front of us was a selection of exquisite, earth-toned ceramics by American <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-mad-potter-of-biloxi-106065115/\">George Ohr</a>, the self-styled \u201cmad potter of Biloxi\u201d. You could argue that these modest pots made in obscurity in Mississippi are irrelevant to the masterpieces of French post-impressionism. The point, according to Temkin, is to try to bring us back to around 1890 \u2013 when Van Gogh was painting in an asylum, Rousseau was collecting taxes, and no one knew what would be inscribed into the canon and what wouldn\u2019t. Above all, she explained, the connections are visual. Gesturing at the warm-brown ceramics, she said: \u201cYou could almost make a C\u00e9zanne out of those colours.\u201d</p> <p>Repudiating the Book of Genesis approach involves breaking up the patriarchal parade of white, male artists. So in a room titled Stamp, Scavenge, Crush \u2013 which centres on art using discarded or reused materials from the late 1940s to the early 60s, and features <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jul/26/art.usa\">Jasper Johns</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/19/robert-rauschenberg-just-something-be-around\">Robert Rauschenberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/06/cy-twombly-obituary\">Cy Twombly</a> \u2013 are also a photographic work by the African American <a href=\"https://beardenfoundation.org/\">Romare Bearden</a> and a bedsheet printed by <a href=\"https://ruthasawa.com/\">Ruth Asawa</a> in 1948 with a stamp to create a dense, graphic pattern. </p> <p>She was using the <a href=\"http://www.blackmountaincollege.org/history/\">Black Mountain College</a> laundry stamp \u2013 she was running the art school\u2019s laundry at the time, while learning about design and pattern from ex-Bauhaus masters such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/09/anni-albers-tate-modern-review\">Anni Albers</a>.) Twenty-eight per cent of works now on view at MoMA are by women, a crushingly small proportion even taking into account the fact that 13% can\u2019t neatly be assigned to a gender (because they are by collectives, for example). But 28% is still five times as high as the proportion in the galleries at the beginning of the century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"405b69e7377d083f3332f9b75e0839d7f71ef9ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/405b69e7377d083f3332f9b75e0839d7f71ef9ec/0_0_2000_1543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prison Notebook, 1976, by Ibrahim el-Salahi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"772\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fragile strength \u2026 Prison Notebook, 1976, by Ibrahim el-Salahi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Gerhardt/MoMA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This rebalancing has meant enlarging the collection \u2013 a process enabled by MoMA\u2019s considerable resources and the tradition of American philanthropy along with its ability to sell off works in order to buy new ones. (British national museums\u2019 constitutions prevent them from doing this.) Selling a L\u00e9ger meant, Temkin explained, that the museum could purchase several works by \u201cpioneering female modernists\u201d. One, The Moon (1928), by Brazilian painter <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3871\">Tarsila do Amaral</a>, acquired earlier this year, now holds court alongside Picasso, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/30/eileen-gray-e1027-corbusier-review\">Eileen Gray</a>. Donations include the extraordinarily extensive and coherent <a href=\"https://www.coleccioncisneros.org/collections\">Cisneros collection of Latin American art</a>, which for the time being will be shown as a kind of museum-within-a-museum. A wall of shimmeringly delicate wire sculptures by the Venezuelan <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/gego-rediscovering-an-extraordinary\">Gego</a> are a particular joy.</p> <p>The labels beside works, specifically their date of acquisition, tell a story in themselves about recent innovations at MoMA. A wooden sculpture by Lebanon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/06/saloua-raouda-choucair-obituary\">Saloua Raouda Choucair</a> entered the collection last year. A set of works by Polish artist <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern/display/performer-and-participant/edward-krasinski\">Edward Krasi\u0144</a><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern/display/performer-and-participant/edward-krasinski\">ski</a> came in 2015. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/03/ibrahim-el-salahi-tate-modern\">Ibrahim </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/03/ibrahim-el-salahi-tate-modern\">el-Salahi</a>\u2019s Prison Notebook, illustrated with ink drawings, made after he was wrongfully imprisoned in Sudan in 1975, was acquired in 2017. Despite its fragility and scale, it holds its own in a room themed around the conflicts of the 1970s opposite Philip Guston\u2019s magisterial painting <a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/philip-guston/deluge\">Deluge II</a>, made at the same time. A dangling, curvaceous hemp sculpture by Indian artist <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern/display/materials-and-objects/mrinalini-mukherjee\">Mrinalini Mukherjee</a> was also acquired in 2017. Perhaps my eyes are drawn to familiar things, or perhaps it is just that curators in London and New York breathe the same air, but it strikes me that these last are all artists foregrounded by Tate Modern in current displays or recent exhibitions. At any rate, the message is loud and clear: the world is a big place, bigger than Manhattan and Paris \u2013 and great art is being made all around it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15774b39034e83964bff98066b72399a8a4d498a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15774b39034e83964bff98066b72399a8a4d498a/0_71_2000_743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monet\u2019s Water Lilies in a fifth floor gallery at MoMa, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"372\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019d have a revolution if we took down Water Lilies\u2019 \u2026 Monet at MoMA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kurt Heumiller/Museum of Modern Art, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These themed rooms frequently draw on items from several of the institution\u2019s mighty departments, creating a mix of, for example, photography, film, publications and painting. So for example, in the room with Asawa\u2019s bedsheet there is a film of Merce Cunningham\u2019s dance work <a href=\"https://www.mercecunningham.org/the-work/choreography/antic-meet/\">Antic Meet</a> \u2013 like a lot of film in the galleries, simply projected on to a wall, offered as part of the mix. One of the most rewarding moments in the current hang is a modest, unobtrusive room devoted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/09/selected-poems-frank-ohara-review\">Frank O\u2019Hara</a> \u2013 from his manuscripts and early editions of books to artworks made by a host of greats to illustrate his work, and <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2011/01/21/an-inspiring-collaboration-larry-rivers-and-frank-ohara/\">Larry Rivers</a>\u2019s portrait of the poet.</p> <p>All this has meant delving deep into the collection. Lowry said the museum had, to his eyes, become almost like two institutions in recent years \u2013 one that visitors had access to, and the other in store, where there was a much more varied and diverse set of art. A work by the Indian painter <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/features/VS-Gaitonde-7387-1.aspx\">V</a><a href=\"https://www.christies.com/features/VS-Gaitonde-7387-1.aspx\">S Gaitonde</a>, for example, was purchased in 1963, and languished unseen for years \u2013 now, though, it\u2019s sharing wall space with Rothko. There is an entire case of radical zines and leaflets mailed to the museum in the early 1980s from Brazil \u2013 these items, from the <a href=\"https://www.printedmatter.org/catalog/tables/551\">Movimento de Arte Porn\u00f2</a>, were unsought by the institution but dutifully catalogued and preserved.</p> <p>Some things, on the other hand, have been permanently banished from the galleries. Like Tate before it, MoMA will no longer bandy around terms such as cubism, post-impressionism, abstract expressionism, or conceptualism in its labels. \u201cWe were trying to imagine what we would say if we had a group of friends over to dinner who aren\u2019t in the art world,\u201d Lowry told me. \u201cWhat would we want them to know? What would they need to know in order to have an interesting conversation?\u201d It is certainly not, he argued, a \u201cdumbing down\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"264480655dc28a9c4ce3723163e5b34f23c7308a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/264480655dc28a9c4ce3723163e5b34f23c7308a/0_82_2000_881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New look\u2026 a still from We Hold Where Study, 2017, by transgender artist Wu Tsang.

Photograph: Roman Mensing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo: Roman Mensing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The results of this particular innovation are, at this point, mixed \u2013 after all, you can eradicate art-world lingo and still bypass lucidity. Sometimes, refusing the actual word seems like a round in the hat game \u2013 in which participants pull a name out of a hat and describe it, without using the name itself. The introductory text of one room, titled Readymade in Paris and New York, seems, for example, to be a more or less a hat-game description of the word <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/may/05/a-century-of-dada-anti-war-artists-mainstream-con\">dada</a>. Indeed, hanging beside it is Richard Boix\u2019s drawing of members of the New York dada group (Man Ray, Duchamp, Katherine Dreier and others), with the word DADA writ large on it. But since the room introduction doesn\u2019t tell you what dada is, you\u2019d be none the wiser if you didn\u2019t already know.</p> <p>All of these changes have been a long time coming. Back at the turn of the millennium, soon after Lowry was appointed, the museum experimented with a series of thematic displays called MoMA 2000. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/30/arts/art-architecture-reinventing-moma-and-modern-art.html\">Some critics loved them</a>; some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/29/artsfeatures\">utterly rejected them</a>. Lowry denies the museum rowed back after the mixed reception, but, rather, the displays marked the beginning of a process that has culminated in this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/10/moma-expansion-museum-new-york\">reopening</a>, one that involved great institutional change. \u201cIt required over time a new generation of curators who came with fresh and new ideas and for whom interdisciplinarity was something natural. And we had to expand on training our vision,\u201d he said. Over the last decade, research groups on Asian, Latin American and African art have been formed at the museum. Curators have travelled more. The great MoMA tanker has gradually turned.</p> <p>Unsealing the edges of modern and contemporary art in this way has, said Temkin, been \u201cliberating, exhilarating. One thing I\u2019ve been insisting on is changing the way people speak about gaps in the collection. It feels so wrong because it assumes there is a complete puzzle, and if we just find every single puzzle piece, one day it will be solved and complete. Right now, we are saying, \u2018No, we don\u2019t know \u2013 there is no way of knowing some complete art history.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e1334eea62d80e2a1c60c7c3aca954ca62ee779\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e1334eea62d80e2a1c60c7c3aca954ca62ee779/0_133_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"work by Duchamp, Man Ray, Richard Boix and others in the Readymade in Paris and New York room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Work by Duchamp, Man Ray, Richard Boix and others in the Readymade in Paris and New York room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Doorly/MoMA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The museum, once a place of such authority, is now letting that authority go, admitting the impossibility of a fully coherent narrative, embracing the fact that it cannot tell the viewer everything. Strangely, its sleek and efficient spaces, so four-square, pale and elegant, renewed and enlarged at a cost of $450m (\u00a3356m), seem slightly at odds with this new intellectual porousness, despite architect Elizabeth Diller\u2019s efforts to make it more friendly and open.

      "bodyText": "In his Poetics, Aristotle argued that poetry was a more scientific and serious genre than history. This was because, he said, history is concerned only with individual and particular events. Poetry, on the other hand, is concerned with what might happen: that is, deep and general truths. In the newly revamped Museum of Modern Art in New York, which reopens on 21 October, the march of history, at least as it has been understood by MoMA in recent decades, is out and poetry is in. Inside the refreshed museum \u2013 its gallery space enlarged by 30% thanks to architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro \u2013 a radical rehang reverses the museum\u2019s old \u201cBook of Genesis\u201d approach, as MoMA director Glenn D Lowry characterised it. Recent decades have seen the museum organised by way of a stately procession, in which art movements and -isms were shown to have begotten other movements and -isms. This lucid, but necessarily sealed-off, worldview has now been replaced with the kind of thematic approach familiar to British audiences from two decades of Tate Modern hangs. While still arranged according to a broad chronology, beginning with the 1880s on the fifth floor and descending to the present on the second, MoMA\u2019s individual rooms are organised around ideas, with titles such as War Within, War Without, Inner and Outer Space, and True Stories. The view of art history on show here is no longer one of straight lines and linear progressions, but one much more like the complex ripples set in motion by pebbles thrown into a pond. No longer will MoMA claim to tell a single story of modern and contemporary art. Every six months, the hang will substantially change. Some might say MoMA is letting itself off the hook: no definitive statements are made and everything is allowed to hover provisionally until the next remix. Lowry argues it is returning to the museum\u2019s founding principles. The great first director, Alfred H Barr Jr, wrote: \u201cNothing that the visitors will see in the exhibition galleries, neither the works of art, nor the lighting fixtures, nor even the partitions, is at present permanent.\u201d Barr understood, said Lowry, \u201cthat the museum was to be a work in progress, changing and evolving as the world of contemporary art changed and evolved\u201d. The museum\u2019s glaciation of its displays came later, in the 1960s and 70s, he said. Nevertheless, even in the brave indeterminate future, there will remain a few constants. Some works \u2013 Monet\u2019s Water Lilies, Picasso\u2019s Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon \u2013 will always be there. \u201cWe\u2019d have a revolution if we took down the Water Lilies,\u201d said Ann Temkin, chief curator of painting and sculpture, at a museum preview. Underlying the new mix-it-up approach is the argument that teleological art history \u2013 seeing the present as the logical culmination of the past \u2013 lacks contingency, fails to take into account the idea that once upon a time C\u00e9zanne, say, was just a bloke making strange paintings in the south of France, not an art history colossus whose work had a mind-blowing market value. So the new hang is not a \u201cbang, bang, bang\u201d of famous masterpiece after famous masterpiece, as Temkin phrased it. While we spoke, we were sitting with our backs to C\u00e9zanne\u2019s The Bather, newly cleaned, with zingy blue details revealed of its background of rocks and water. To our right were Van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night and Henri Rousseau\u2019s The Dream. So far, so \u201cbang, bang, bang\u201d. But in a case in front of us was a selection of exquisite, earth-toned ceramics by American George Ohr, the self-styled \u201cmad potter of Biloxi\u201d. You could argue that these modest pots made in obscurity in Mississippi are irrelevant to the masterpieces of French post-impressionism. The point, according to Temkin, is to try to bring us back to around 1890 \u2013 when Van Gogh was painting in an asylum, Rousseau was collecting taxes, and no one knew what would be inscribed into the canon and what wouldn\u2019t. Above all, she explained, the connections are visual. Gesturing at the warm-brown ceramics, she said: \u201cYou could almost make a C\u00e9zanne out of those colours.\u201d Repudiating the Book of Genesis approach involves breaking up the patriarchal parade of white, male artists. So in a room titled Stamp, Scavenge, Crush \u2013 which centres on art using discarded or reused materials from the late 1940s to the early 60s, and features Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly \u2013 are also a photographic work by the African American Romare Bearden and a bedsheet printed by Ruth Asawa in 1948 with a stamp to create a dense, graphic pattern. She was using the Black Mountain College laundry stamp \u2013 she was running the art school\u2019s laundry at the time, while learning about design and pattern from ex-Bauhaus masters such as Anni Albers.) Twenty-eight per cent of works now on view at MoMA are by women, a crushingly small proportion even taking into account the fact that 13% can\u2019t neatly be assigned to a gender (because they are by collectives, for example). But 28% is still five times as high as the proportion in the galleries at the beginning of the century. This rebalancing has meant enlarging the collection \u2013 a process enabled by MoMA\u2019s considerable resources and the tradition of American philanthropy along with its ability to sell off works in order to buy new ones. (British national museums\u2019 constitutions prevent them from doing this.) Selling a L\u00e9ger meant, Temkin explained, that the museum could purchase several works by \u201cpioneering female modernists\u201d. One, The Moon (1928), by Brazilian painter Tarsila do Amaral, acquired earlier this year, now holds court alongside Picasso, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i and Eileen Gray. Donations include the extraordinarily extensive and coherent Cisneros collection of Latin American art, which for the time being will be shown as a kind of museum-within-a-museum. A wall of shimmeringly delicate wire sculptures by the Venezuelan Gego are a particular joy. The labels beside works, specifically their date of acquisition, tell a story in themselves about recent innovations at MoMA. A wooden sculpture by Lebanon\u2019s Saloua Raouda Choucair entered the collection last year. A set of works by Polish artist Edward Krasi\u0144ski came in 2015. Ibrahim el-Salahi\u2019s Prison Notebook, illustrated with ink drawings, made after he was wrongfully imprisoned in Sudan in 1975, was acquired in 2017. Despite its fragility and scale, it holds its own in a room themed around the conflicts of the 1970s opposite Philip Guston\u2019s magisterial painting Deluge II, made at the same time. A dangling, curvaceous hemp sculpture by Indian artist Mrinalini Mukherjee was also acquired in 2017. Perhaps my eyes are drawn to familiar things, or perhaps it is just that curators in London and New York breathe the same air, but it strikes me that these last are all artists foregrounded by Tate Modern in current displays or recent exhibitions. At any rate, the message is loud and clear: the world is a big place, bigger than Manhattan and Paris \u2013 and great art is being made all around it. These themed rooms frequently draw on items from several of the institution\u2019s mighty departments, creating a mix of, for example, photography, film, publications and painting. So for example, in the room with Asawa\u2019s bedsheet there is a film of Merce Cunningham\u2019s dance work Antic Meet \u2013 like a lot of film in the galleries, simply projected on to a wall, offered as part of the mix. One of the most rewarding moments in the current hang is a modest, unobtrusive room devoted to Frank O\u2019Hara \u2013 from his manuscripts and early editions of books to artworks made by a host of greats to illustrate his work, and Larry Rivers\u2019s portrait of the poet. All this has meant delving deep into the collection. Lowry said the museum had, to his eyes, become almost like two institutions in recent years \u2013 one that visitors had access to, and the other in store, where there was a much more varied and diverse set of art. A work by the Indian painter VS Gaitonde, for example, was purchased in 1963, and languished unseen for years \u2013 now, though, it\u2019s sharing wall space with Rothko. There is an entire case of radical zines and leaflets mailed to the museum in the early 1980s from Brazil \u2013 these items, from the Movimento de Arte Porn\u00f2, were unsought by the institution but dutifully catalogued and preserved. Some things, on the other hand, have been permanently banished from the galleries. Like Tate before it, MoMA will no longer bandy around terms such as cubism, post-impressionism, abstract expressionism, or conceptualism in its labels. \u201cWe were trying to imagine what we would say if we had a group of friends over to dinner who aren\u2019t in the art world,\u201d Lowry told me. \u201cWhat would we want them to know? What would they need to know in order to have an interesting conversation?\u201d It is certainly not, he argued, a \u201cdumbing down\u201d. The results of this particular innovation are, at this point, mixed \u2013 after all, you can eradicate art-world lingo and still bypass lucidity. Sometimes, refusing the actual word seems like a round in the hat game \u2013 in which participants pull a name out of a hat and describe it, without using the name itself. The introductory text of one room, titled Readymade in Paris and New York, seems, for example, to be a more or less a hat-game description of the word dada. Indeed, hanging beside it is Richard Boix\u2019s drawing of members of the New York dada group (Man Ray, Duchamp, Katherine Dreier and others), with the word DADA writ large on it. But since the room introduction doesn\u2019t tell you what dada is, you\u2019d be none the wiser if you didn\u2019t already know. All of these changes have been a long time coming. Back at the turn of the millennium, soon after Lowry was appointed, the museum experimented with a series of thematic displays called MoMA 2000. Some critics loved them; some utterly rejected them. Lowry denies the museum rowed back after the mixed reception, but, rather, the displays marked the beginning of a process that has culminated in this month\u2019s reopening, one that involved great institutional change. \u201cIt required over time a new generation of curators who came with fresh and new ideas and for whom interdisciplinarity was something natural. And we had to expand on training our vision,\u201d he said. Over the last decade, research groups on Asian, Latin American and African art have been formed at the museum. Curators have travelled more. The great MoMA tanker has gradually turned. Unsealing the edges of modern and contemporary art in this way has, said Temkin, been \u201cliberating, exhilarating. One thing I\u2019ve been insisting on is changing the way people speak about gaps in the collection. It feels so wrong because it assumes there is a complete puzzle, and if we just find every single puzzle piece, one day it will be solved and complete. Right now, we are saying, \u2018No, we don\u2019t know \u2013 there is no way of knowing some complete art history.\u2019\u201d The museum, once a place of such authority, is now letting that authority go, admitting the impossibility of a fully coherent narrative, embracing the fact that it cannot tell the viewer everything. Strangely, its sleek and efficient spaces, so four-square, pale and elegant, renewed and enlarged at a cost of $450m (\u00a3356m), seem slightly at odds with this new intellectual porousness, despite architect Elizabeth Diller\u2019s efforts to make it more friendly and open. It remains an intensely decorous, formal, demure museum (and it is $25 for a ticket, though the ground-floor displays, which currently include a room of paintings by Kenya-born Michael Armitage, can be visited for free). Perhaps a longing for unruliness was why I was so happy to see the holes punched out of the walls, revealing the grubby plywood sheets and dust balls lurking behind them, in a display devoted to the multidisciplinary performance artist Pope.L. The most striking example of MoMA\u2019s new approach \u2013 as well as a relatively rare abjuration of broad chronology \u2013 is placing Picasso\u2019s Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon beside a visceral painting, by African American artist Faith Ringgold, documenting the 1965 Los Angeles race riots.

      "bodyText": "Two decades ago, many scholars began predicting that as China\u2019s creation of wealth continued to speed ahead, the country would cross a threshold. Once a substantial new middle class had been created, they reasoned, politics would tip decisively in a more participatory, possibly even democratic, direction. But while robust economic growth continued, the first decade of this century came and went with no severe challenge to China\u2019s authoritarian model. And under China\u2019s present leader, Xi Jinping, who took office in 2013, it has only become more entrenched: last year he changed the longstanding rules of succession to allow himself to remain in charge for life. Now, however, this long-expected revolt of the middle class has arrived \u2013 not from China itself, but from Hong Kong. And more than any other problem China faces, the ongoing crisis in the city could determine Xi\u2019s standing and his country\u2019s direction over the next few years. The problem of open-ended civil unrest in Hong Kong, which has been punctuated by rising acts of violence and vandalism carried out by a distinct but hardline minority, is a reflection of China\u2019s new assertiveness under Xi \u2013 an assertiveness that marks a break with the caution of the post-Mao era. It can be seen in Xi\u2019s signature undertaking, the Belt and Road Initiative \u2013 an infrastructure building project with global ambitions. Or, most recently, the flaunting of new weapons systems during the military parade commemorating the 70th anniversary of Communist party rule \u2013 a declaration of China\u2019s intention to rival American military power more openly than at any time in the recent past. Under Xi, China has been intervening much more directly in the governance of Hong Kong.

Commenting after that case Hobby Lobby said it \u201cdid not fully appreciate the complexities of the acquisitions process\u201d and relied on dealers who did not understand how to properly ship the items. In a second high-profile controversy, the Green family and the Museum of the Bible were forced to remove five document fragments \u2013 described as part of the Dead Sea Scrolls \u2013 when they were identified as modern forgeries after reporting by the Guardian and other media organisations.",

All due respect to one of the greatest cinematic talents to have ever lived, but his sensitivity has been misapplied.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with jokes about tragedy, so long as they have got the right butt.</p> <p>Chaplin\u2019s film concludes by dropping the bit and delivering an earnest monologue about the tantamount importance of goodness and decency. The man was always a sentimentalist at heart, and while that doesn\u2019t necessarily weaken his film, its successors would advance this strain of satire by going all in on irony. Mel Brooks\u2019 The Producers imagined the fictitious musical Springtime for Hitler, a work so supremely offensive that it would surely disgust Broadway and provide the flop the protagonists\u2019 get-rich-quick scheme requires. Of course, the gag turns out to be on them; audiences had just started to warm up to the idea of weaponized bad taste and they\u2019d stumbled into a hit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OIQg_hk3F4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9OIQg_hk3F4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The rest of the 60s, the 70s, and the 80s extrapolated this idea and put it into practice on low-rent B-pictures termed \u201cNazisploitation\u201d. Many angled for sexiness over all else \u2013 though there\u2019s still plenty to chuckle at in the likes of Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS \u2013 and plenty of others took more purposefully comic aim at the absurdity of the de-platformed Nazis. One such trashy delight would be They Saved Hitler\u2019s Brain, a crackerjack 1968 adventure concerning a plot to defrost Hitler\u2019s cryogenically frozen head, which has been hidden deep in the jungles of South America. It\u2019s one of those so-bad-it\u2019s-good movies in on the game, able to poke fun at the harebrained Aryan experimenters from a couple decades\u2019 worth of safe remove. Films closer to our modern moment would evince a nostalgia for this anything-goes era, such as the 2012 release Iron Sky, which envisioned a colony of techno-Nazis establishing a base on the moon.</p> <p>These films make Hitler out to be a punching bag by playing up his well-known qualities of insecurity, impotent rage, and ineffectuality, though that\u2019s hardly a foolproof strategy. (Take Saturday Night Live\u2019s recurring character Gay Hitler, his sketches predicated on the noxious idea that nothing could be more humiliating than being a homosexual man.) Even so, there\u2019s a catharsis to the act of dissing one of the most evil men to have ever lived, a feeling articulated in characteristically blunt fashion by Jojo Rabbit with a defiant \u201cFuck off, Hitler!\u201d Others have chosen to go the more indirect route, subjecting him to indignities in the hopes of tarnishing his memory. In either case, silliness has been the modus operandi, a pox on a historical figure desperate to be respected \u2013 a matter complicated by the Trump of it all.</p> <p>Reality has grown so ridiculous as to render that once-lethal antic spirit redundant, leaving deadpan the new recourse. (No political cartoon depicting Donald Trump as a screaming orange infant reflects as poorly on him as his actual conduct.) The most effective Hitler satire in recent memory would have to be Look Who\u2019s Back, a mockumentary giving sober consideration to how today\u2019s society would receive a revived Hitler. He\u2019s not bumbling or foolish in this instance, just a fish-out-of-water getting used to the surf unsettlingly quickly. The film plays his second coming straight, pairing the risen Hitler with a film-maker convinced the guy\u2019s a committed actor, and the rest of the world meets him halfway. The final shots make the disquieting connection between today\u2019s nationalist movements and Hitler\u2019s legacy, ending with his chilling words: \u201cI can work with this.\u201d The magic works here in reverse, finding the plausibility in an implausible scenario instead of teasing the fanciful out from the real; Waititi and Chaplin\u2019s idealism has been replaced with a deep cynicism. With the real-world stakes presently too high for comfort, the only laughs to be had are the bitter ones.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jojo Rabbit is out in the US on 18 October and in the UK on 3 January</p></li> </ul>",

Chaplin\u2019s film concludes by dropping the bit and delivering an earnest monologue about the tantamount importance of goodness and decency. The man was always a sentimentalist at heart, and while that doesn\u2019t necessarily weaken his film, its successors would advance this strain of satire by going all in on irony. Mel Brooks\u2019 The Producers imagined the fictitious musical Springtime for Hitler, a work so supremely offensive that it would surely disgust Broadway and provide the flop the protagonists\u2019 get-rich-quick scheme requires. Of course, the gag turns out to be on them; audiences had just started to warm up to the idea of weaponized bad taste and they\u2019d stumbled into a hit. The rest of the 60s, the 70s, and the 80s extrapolated this idea and put it into practice on low-rent B-pictures termed \u201cNazisploitation\u201d. Many angled for sexiness over all else \u2013 though there\u2019s still plenty to chuckle at in the likes of Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS \u2013 and plenty of others took more purposefully comic aim at the absurdity of the de-platformed Nazis. One such trashy delight would be They Saved Hitler\u2019s Brain, a crackerjack 1968 adventure concerning a plot to defrost Hitler\u2019s cryogenically frozen head, which has been hidden deep in the jungles of South America. It\u2019s one of those so-bad-it\u2019s-good movies in on the game, able to poke fun at the harebrained Aryan experimenters from a couple decades\u2019 worth of safe remove. Films closer to our modern moment would evince a nostalgia for this anything-goes era, such as the 2012 release Iron Sky, which envisioned a colony of techno-Nazis establishing a base on the moon. These films make Hitler out to be a punching bag by playing up his well-known qualities of insecurity, impotent rage, and ineffectuality, though that\u2019s hardly a foolproof strategy. (Take Saturday Night Live\u2019s recurring character Gay Hitler, his sketches predicated on the noxious idea that nothing could be more humiliating than being a homosexual man.) Even so, there\u2019s a catharsis to the act of dissing one of the most evil men to have ever lived, a feeling articulated in characteristically blunt fashion by Jojo Rabbit with a defiant \u201cFuck off, Hitler!\u201d Others have chosen to go the more indirect route, subjecting him to indignities in the hopes of tarnishing his memory. In either case, silliness has been the modus operandi, a pox on a historical figure desperate to be respected \u2013 a matter complicated by the Trump of it all. Reality has grown so ridiculous as to render that once-lethal antic spirit redundant, leaving deadpan the new recourse. (No political cartoon depicting Donald Trump as a screaming orange infant reflects as poorly on him as his actual conduct.) The most effective Hitler satire in recent memory would have to be Look Who\u2019s Back, a mockumentary giving sober consideration to how today\u2019s society would receive a revived Hitler. He\u2019s not bumbling or foolish in this instance, just a fish-out-of-water getting used to the surf unsettlingly quickly. The film plays his second coming straight, pairing the risen Hitler with a film-maker convinced the guy\u2019s a committed actor, and the rest of the world meets him halfway. The final shots make the disquieting connection between today\u2019s nationalist movements and Hitler\u2019s legacy, ending with his chilling words: \u201cI can work with this.\u201d The magic works here in reverse, finding the plausibility in an implausible scenario instead of teasing the fanciful out from the real; Waititi and Chaplin\u2019s idealism has been replaced with a deep cynicism. With the real-world stakes presently too high for comfort, the only laughs to be had are the bitter ones. Jojo Rabbit is out in the US on 18 October and in the UK on 3 January",

      "body": "<p>The Twitter account @emoblackthot was a virtual therapist and best friend for over 170,000 followers \u2013 many of them people of color and/or queer. She would post gentle reminders to wear sunscreen every day and stay hydrated, rave about the latest songs she was obsessed with and share her struggles with anxiety and depression. If followers were experiencing anxiety attacks, @emoblackthot was there to talk them through it over DMs.</p> <p>On a platform overflowing with trolls and angry callouts, @emoblackthot stood out through her promotion of self-care and vulnerability and, as a consequence, quickly became viral. There was only one problem: she was not the person she claimed to be. </p> <p>Until last week, it was commonly accepted that the person behind @emoblackthot was a black woman. @emoblackthot would post about alleviating her period cramps with chamomile tea, the unfair beauty standards placed on darker-skinned black women and styling her kinky 4C hair. The posts felt like they belonged to a black woman who was confident, fashionable and a tastemaker. (At one point, followers genuinely theorized that the account was run by Normani, a fast-rising R&amp;B/pop singer, or the megastar Rihanna.)</p> <p>Sometimes, @emoblackthot would tweet about experiencing financial troubles and ask for donations through the Cash App. Followers, many of them black women, would happily oblige, thinking they were giving their money to a fellow black woman in need.</p> <p>A few months ago, @emoblackthot began teasing the reveal of her identity. She shared concerns that no one would \u201clike\u201d the real person behind the account. Fans quickly assuaged her fears. \u201cDo the identity reveal,\u201d one follower replied to a since-deleted tweet. \u201cThe opportunities that will come your way would blow your mind! i know it seems scary but trust the process. it\u2019ll work in your favor in the end.\u201d</p> <p>Last Friday morning, the reveal came. @emoblackthot chose something big and dramatic: a photoshoot and interview with the fashion magazine Paper.</p> <p>@emoblackthot was not Normani. Or Rihanna. Or even a black woman.</p> <p>The account runner was Isaiah Hickland \u2013 a 23-year-old black man.</p> <p>\u201cI did not envision ever revealing myself,\u201d Hickland said to the Guardian over email about his decision to come out. \u201cI wanted to deactivate the account without explanation and let it die, but people relied on it for their own reasons and I didn\u2019t want to not give them an explanation as to why the account was gone.\u201d</p> <p>The pushback was swift. @emoblackthot\u2019s followers felt like they had been scammed. \u201cImpersonating a queer black woman for clout is immoral because of all the shit queer bw [black women] receive,\u201d a fan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mouvaille/status/1182812268741976064\">tweeted</a>. \u201cWe only wanted an actual role model that was here for us and that cared for us. We thought we had that in EBT, but we were lied to.\u201d</p> <p>Hickland said he quickly received a slew of threatening and angry messages \u2013 including racial and homophobic slurs \u2013 after the reveal, which led to him deleting @emoblackthot and his personal accounts. \u201cI fully expected to be held accountable for my wrongdoings,\u201d he said over email. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t expect the amount of vitriol, lies, and hate being spread and sent my way.

      "bodyText": "The Twitter account @emoblackthot was a virtual therapist and best friend for over 170,000 followers \u2013 many of them people of color and/or queer. She would post gentle reminders to wear sunscreen every day and stay hydrated, rave about the latest songs she was obsessed with and share her struggles with anxiety and depression. If followers were experiencing anxiety attacks, @emoblackthot was there to talk them through it over DMs. On a platform overflowing with trolls and angry callouts, @emoblackthot stood out through her promotion of self-care and vulnerability and, as a consequence, quickly became viral. There was only one problem: she was not the person she claimed to be. Until last week, it was commonly accepted that the person behind @emoblackthot was a black woman. @emoblackthot would post about alleviating her period cramps with chamomile tea, the unfair beauty standards placed on darker-skinned black women and styling her kinky 4C hair. The posts felt like they belonged to a black woman who was confident, fashionable and a tastemaker. (At one point, followers genuinely theorized that the account was run by Normani, a fast-rising R&amp;B/pop singer, or the megastar Rihanna.) Sometimes, @emoblackthot would tweet about experiencing financial troubles and ask for donations through the Cash App. Followers, many of them black women, would happily oblige, thinking they were giving their money to a fellow black woman in need. A few months ago, @emoblackthot began teasing the reveal of her identity. She shared concerns that no one would \u201clike\u201d the real person behind the account. Fans quickly assuaged her fears. \u201cDo the identity reveal,\u201d one follower replied to a since-deleted tweet. \u201cThe opportunities that will come your way would blow your mind! i know it seems scary but trust the process. it\u2019ll work in your favor in the end.\u201d Last Friday morning, the reveal came. @emoblackthot chose something big and dramatic: a photoshoot and interview with the fashion magazine Paper. @emoblackthot was not Normani. Or Rihanna. Or even a black woman. The account runner was Isaiah Hickland \u2013 a 23-year-old black man. \u201cI did not envision ever revealing myself,\u201d Hickland said to the Guardian over email about his decision to come out. \u201cI wanted to deactivate the account without explanation and let it die, but people relied on it for their own reasons and I didn\u2019t want to not give them an explanation as to why the account was gone.\u201d The pushback was swift. @emoblackthot\u2019s followers felt like they had been scammed. \u201cImpersonating a queer black woman for clout is immoral because of all the shit queer bw [black women] receive,\u201d a fan tweeted. \u201cWe only wanted an actual role model that was here for us and that cared for us. We thought we had that in EBT, but we were lied to.\u201d Hickland said he quickly received a slew of threatening and angry messages \u2013 including racial and homophobic slurs \u2013 after the reveal, which led to him deleting @emoblackthot and his personal accounts. \u201cI fully expected to be held accountable for my wrongdoings,\u201d he said over email. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t expect the amount of vitriol, lies, and hate being spread and sent my way. I feel like my life is over.\u201d Hickland said his mental health had taken a severe hit from the online attacks. In under an hour, @emoblackthot had gone from being one of the most beloved accounts on \u201cBlack Twitter\u201d to one of the most hated. Even popular figures were brought into the mix. After interacting with and following @emoblackthot, the R&amp;B singer Kehlani was forced to clarify (in a since deleted tweet) how much she knew about Hickland. \u201cI was asked for advice on his financial situation at his day job,\u201d she posted. \u201cOnce he told me who he was, i told him he owed it to his followers to be honest about who he was \u2026 not a publication.\u201d Soon, Twitter users began filling in the details.

Dr Crystal Abidin, an anthropologist with a special focus on internet culture, said the reason an account like @emoblackthot \u2013 with its simple reminders to drink water and eat food \u2013 was able to thrive on Twitter was because of how angry content on the platform has become: \u201cThe content is novel in a space that is already so depressed.\u201d She said influencers who place an emphasis on self-care particularly appealed to marginalized communities (as with @emoblackthot\u2019s black female following) because the stressors of everyday life ring true. \u201cThe culture of self-care has at its ethos the feeling of being oppressed by mainstream culture.\u201d Digital masquerade is nothing new, Abidin points out. From Lonelygirl15 to A Gay Girl In Damascus to two TikTok teens faking a gay prom proposal, there have been plenty of faked viral moments. Hickland said it was likely the @emoblackthot persona was dead forever: \u201cFor now, I just plan on detoxing, doing a lot of self reflection, finally starting therapy and figuring out the next steps to attempt to make things right.\u201d",

Part of the reason is the remarkably low level of public discussion and information on this crisis. Another is that the political risks of action are higher than the perceived rewards \u2013 a balance the protesters want to redress. But perhaps the most important factor is the brute power of the pollutocrats driving this disaster. As the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-polluters\" title=\"\">The polluters series</a> shows, the big fossil fuel companies have used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/27/fossil-fuel-industry-clout-trump-era\" title=\"\">political funding</a>, intense lobbying and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/fossil-fuel-firms-social-media-fightback-against-climate-action\" title=\"\">gross deceptions of the public</a> to overwhelm environmental protections and keep harvesting their massive profits.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73a74d8764c67743778517a2f65faeba58552523\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73a74d8764c67743778517a2f65faeba58552523/0_300_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Area affected by high water, Bangladesh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Large numbers of people in Somalia, Mozambique, Bangladesh (above), the Caribbean and many other parts of the world are already losing their homes and livelihoods.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zakir Hossain Chowdhury/Barcroft Media</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Those who confront them have no such power.

Alongside the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/sep/29/rising-voices-young-people-fight-for-climate-action-video\" title=\"\">youth climate strikes</a>, Extinction Rebellion has changed the global conversation about climate and environmental breakdown. These movements are directly responsible for the declaration of a climate emergency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/01/declare-formal-climate-emergency-before-its-too-late-corbyn-warns\" title=\"\">by the UK </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/01/declare-formal-climate-emergency-before-its-too-late-corbyn-warns\" title=\"\">parliament</a> and many other political bodies.

Like other prominent activists, I will be lambasted for hypocrisy: this is now the favoured means of trying to take down climate activists. Yes, we are hypocrites. Because we are embedded in the systems we contest, and life is complicated, no one has ever achieved moral purity. The choice we face is not between hypocrisy and purity, but between hypocrisy and cynicism. It is better to strive to do good, and often fail, than not to strive at all.</p> \n<p>Other criticisms carry more weight. Extinction Rebellion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/04/extinction-rebellion-race-climate-crisis-inequality\" title=\"\">is too white</a>, and too middle class.

The poor parts of the world are the least responsible for climate disaster but the most likely to suffer its effects. They carry the cost of our consumption. We have imposed this crisis on others, and must do what we can to curtail it.</p> \n<p>Since I began writing this article, getting arrested has become easier: the police have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/15/extinction-rebellion-activists-defy-london-wide-protest-ban\" title=\"\">imposed a blanket ban</a> on \u201cany assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion autumn uprising\u201d across London. This looks to me like a breach of article 20 of the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/\" title=\"\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>: \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.\u201d Over the past four decades, the police have acquired an extraordinary array of powers \u2013 enabling them, in effect, to shut down any protest. But they deem even these insufficient: at a recent press conference <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/extinction-rebellion-london-protests-october-police-arrests-law-climate-change-a9133331.html\" title=\"\">they demanded</a> new \u201cbanning orders\u201d for \u201chabitual\u201d protesters. Given that regular protest has proved throughout history to be an essential mechanism for political reform, this looks like a direct attack on democracy.</p> \n<p>Far from deterring me, the draconian ban this week and the police demand for even greater powers has strengthened my determination. Now I feel I am standing not only for the habitability of the planet but also for the continued right to protest. This is my duty, and I intend to fulfil it.</p> \n<p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Since I began writing this article, getting arrested has become easier: the police have imposed a blanket ban on \u201cany assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion autumn uprising\u201d across London. This looks to me like a breach of article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.\u201d Over the past four decades, the police have acquired an extraordinary array of powers \u2013 enabling them, in effect, to shut down any protest. But they deem even these insufficient: at a recent press conference they demanded new \u201cbanning orders\u201d for \u201chabitual\u201d protesters. Given that regular protest has proved throughout history to be an essential mechanism for political reform, this looks like a direct attack on democracy. Far from deterring me, the draconian ban this week and the police demand for even greater powers has strengthened my determination. Now I feel I am standing not only for the habitability of the planet but also for the continued right to protest. This is my duty, and I intend to fulfil it. \u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "One of the year\u2019s most-hyped share market floats, the $3.2bn Latitude Financial IPO, has failed after superannuation funds led by the nation\u2019s biggest, Australian Super, decided not to purchase shares in the company. Latitude, a lender which is part-owned by private equity group KKR and helmed by controversial businessman Ahmed Fahour, decided to yank the offer late on Tuesday afternoon, robbing investment bankers working on the deal of a payday of up to $35m. The collapse of the IPO also means Fahour, a former chief executive of Australia Post, will miss out on a $22.5m bonus for listing Latitude, which was to be paid in company shares. It is the second time Latitude\u2019s owners have tried and failed to sell the company, raising questions about whether Australian investors have forgiven private equity groups for floats such as the disastrous Myer IPO a decade ago. In that deal, US private equity group TPG sold Australian investors Myer shares at $4.10 each and trousered $1.4bn, which it sent offshore with the taxation office in close pursuit. Shares in the department store immediately plummeted and were changing hands at about 58c on Wednesday morning. Australian Super, which manages more than $170bn in retirement savings, is understood to have told the brokers organising the Latitude float it would not be participating several weeks ago. Other large institutional investors also balked at the price of shares in the group, which organises loans for borrowers including customers of retail chain Harvey Norman. \u201cMost of the investment managers will say that the IPOs on offer aren\u2019t very good, particularly those from private equity,\u201d said Norman Zhang, the chief investment officer of $5.4bn super fund Media Super. He said Media Super used an external fund manager, Yarra Capital, to assess investment opportunities similar to Latitude. \u201cThey are looking for quality companies and I wouldn\u2019t consider Latitude to be a quality company,\u201d he said. The core of the Latitude business is the lending operation formerly run by GE Money, which the American group sold to a consortium made up of KKR, another US private equity group, Varde Partners, and troubled German bank Deutsche Bank, in 2015. Loan books of this type are well understood by large investors, but in preparation for its float Latitude also talked loudly of a future as a fintech, saying it was going to take on buy-now pay-later operation and share market darling Afterpay. The IPO\u2019s failure will sting Fahour, who quit Australia Post in February 2017 amid a stoush with the government over his $10.8m a year payout. Fahour previously ran the Australian operations of NAB but quit in 2009 after failing to secure the top job at the bank. An army of investment bankers and brokers who had been hoping to share in up to $35m in fees for arranging the IPO will now see nothing for their work. The investment bankers at Goldman Sachs, Macquarie Group and UBS who had been running the deal will feel the pain the most, but brokers at Bell Potter, Morgans, Wilsons, the CBA, Craigs, Crestone, Escala, Evans Dixon, NAB and Ord Minnett will also miss out. Latitude had initially hoped to sell between $1.2bn and $1.4bn worth of shares for between $2 and $2.25 each. However, on Tuesday it dramatically reduced the size of the deal, slashing the amount of stock on offer to $1bn and the price to $1.78. The price cut was not enough to get the offer over the line and on Wednesday morning Latitude formally killed the IPO. \u201cDespite extensive engagement with prospective investors the board and shareholders have determined not to proceed with the offer,\u201d chairman Mike Tilley said. Fahour left open the possibility of a third attempt to offload Latitude. \u201cWhile it is disappointing that we are not in a position to progress a public listing at this stage, we will continue to execute on the growth strategy with the support of our shareholder group,\u201d he said.",

<div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Tonight the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination converges on Ohio, where 12 candidates will meet on a debate stage at Otterbein University in

The state is now older, whiter and less educated than the national average, and as a result, has become more reliably Republican. </p> \n  <p><strong>Donald Trump </strong>won Ohio by 8.5 percentage points, the widest margin of any \u201cswing\u201d state. The margin of victory in traditional battleground states is typically much closer, as it was in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three Midwestern states that delivered Trump the White House. By comparison, <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> lost the traditional Republican strongholds of Arizona and Georgia by 3.5 percentage points and 5 percentage points respectively.</p> \n  <p>And last year, every Ohio Democrat running a statewide race lost, except for senator <strong>Sherrod Brown</strong>, who won re-election and nearly used that victory to run for president on the strength of his ability to win as a populist in the Rust Belt. That same year Democrats won governorships in Wisconsin and Michigan after losing the states to Trump in 2016. </p> \n  <p>Some Ohio Democrats insist the state is still in play for Democrats, noting Trump\u2019s unpopularity here.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the fourth Democratic presidential debate. Here are some of the main takeaways from the event: Elizabeth Warren weathered attacks from a number of her opponents in a clear sign that the Massachusetts senator has assumed frontrunner status in the race. Bernie Sanders made an impressive campaign return after his heart attack two weeks ago, declaring himself to be in excellent health and reportedly securing the endorsements of three influential congresswomen. Pete Buttigieg went on the attack against several of his opponents, criticizing proposals like Medicare for All and mandatory buybacks of assault weapons for allegedly being unrealistic. Joe Biden largely moderated his criticisms of other candidates, with the exception of a moment toward the end of the debate when he confronted Warren and took credit for rallying votes to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren responded by instead thanking Barack Obama for helping to make the agency a reality. Tom Steyer failed to make a splash in his debate debut, speaking less than any other Democratic candidate. Make sure to follow our usual live coverage of US politics starting tomorrow morning. We\u2019ll see you at the next debate in Georgia. Bernie Sanders now reportedly has the endorsement of three of the four members of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, the well-known group of progressive freshman congresswomen. However, a New York Times reporter highlighted the Squad member who is not endorsing him at this point: representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. Beto O\u2019Rourke is continuing his criticism of Pete Buttigieg offstage, arguing that the Indiana mayor relies on \u201cpolls\u201d and \u201cconsultants\u201d to determine his stances. Buttigieg argued onstage tonight that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal of a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons was unrealistic, advocating for a focus on more popular proposals like universal background checks. Meanwhile, more information is simultaneously coming in about candidates\u2019 fundraising numbers from the third quarter. As a New York Times reporter noted, Joe Biden has fallen behind the other top-polling candidates in cash on hand. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who has based her campaign around appealing to midwestern voters who swung to Trump in 2016, predicted the president would not carry her home state next year. Trump has reportedly set his sights on Minnesota after narrowly losing the state to Hillary Clinton in 2016, but some of his advisers have privately expressed fears about the president keeping his hold on the rest of the midwest. The final count is in, and Elizabeth Warren spoke far more than any other Democratic candidate onstage tonight. The tally is unsurprising, given how many candidates directly confronted Warren on everything from healthcare to regulation of tech companies. The Massachusetts senator has clearly taken on frontrunner status and is attracting more attacks from her opponents as a result. It depends on who you ask, but a range of voices on social media seem to think Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar had good nights \u2013 they were seen by some to have been able to lay out their centrist credentials a lot more effectively than they had before. But not everyone is convinced Representative Ilhan Omar is endorsing the presidential bid of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign announced. The progressive congresswoman said in a statement released by Sanders\u2019 campaign: \u201cBernie is leading a working class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity and geography. ... And it\u2019s why Bernie is fighting to end our forever wars and truly prioritize human rights in our foreign policy\u2014no matter who violates them. And it\u2019s why I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020.\u201d Sanders similarly praised Omar: \u201cIlhan is a leader of strength and courage. She will not back down from a fight with billionaires and the world\u2019s most powerful corporations to transform our country so it works for all of us. I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve done in Congress, and together we will build a multiracial working class coalition to win the White House.\u201d Reports emerged tonight that representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- another member of the so-called \u201cSquad,\u201d a group of four progressive freshman congresswomen -- would endorse Sanders at his Saturday rally in Queens. The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino has confirmed that representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will endorse Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential bid at his Saturday rally in Queens. A Twitter account for a grassroots group that backs Sanders appeared to celebrate the news in a tweet, although the message did not mention the progressive congresswoman by name. While the final question of the night was focused on the candidate\u2019s bipartisan friendships, there was from the CNN/New York Times moderators about climate change, LGBTQ rights, immigration or voter suppression. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign released a statement on the debate, saying the Democratic candidates threatened to \u201cunravel the hottest economy in modern history\u201d. The full statement reads: \u201cA dozen Democrats stood on stage tonight and made several things clear. They have always wanted to impeach President Trump, they have always wanted to eliminate employer-provided health insurance, they have always wanted to raise your taxes, and they have always wanted to unravel the hottest economy in modern history. \u201cAnother thing was also clear: Once again, President Trump was the hands-down winner of this debate.\u201d Answering the question of a surprising friendship he has had, Joe Biden cited his relationship with the late senator John McCain, echoing Amy Klobuchar. And with that, the debate has ended after more than three hours, running slightly over its allotted time. The candidates have offered very diverse answers on the question of a surprising friendship that they have had in life. However, the candidates have also used the final question to plug their campaign websites and upcoming events as a sort of unofficial closing statement. Joe Biden\u2019s visibly angry reaction to Elizabeth Warren over one of her signature achievements hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. \u201cI got you votes!\u201d Biden shouted, referring to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which Warren proposed in 2007 then established under Obama in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. You can watch the moment here: The debate is scheduled to conclude in just a few minutes, but the biggest news right now is happening offstage. Bernie Sanders has teased the audience about the special guest at his upcoming rally in Queens. The Washington Post is now reporting that the guest will be representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is endorsing the Vermont senator\u2019s presidential bid. The Post reports: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the most influential voices among young liberals and a rising Democratic star, plans to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president and appear with him at a rally on Saturday, according to two people with knowledge of her plans. The surprise endorsement is a political coup for Sanders, 78, who has been fading in the polls and has faced growing questions about his age and health ... The endorsement could be a blow for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, like Sanders, is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer. Amy Klobuchar recounted her friendship with the late Republican John McCain, saying she misses her former colleague \u201cevery day\u201d. Beto O\u2019Rourke also cited his friendship with a Republican colleague, specifically representative Will Hurd. The pair participated in a road trip to highlight the ability to cross the political aisle. The moderators have reached the final question of this three-hour debate and are turning to the issue of friendship. (Yes, friendship.) CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper referenced a recent controversy over talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres appearing to joke around with George W Bush, the Republican president who opposed gay marriage and launched the Iraq war. The candidates were asked to describe a friendship they have had that would \u201csurprise us\u201d. Tulsi Gabbard certainly delivered on the surprise element, citing her friendship with former Republican congressman Trey Gowdy, who was in talks this month to join Trump\u2019s team to combat impeachment efforts. Meanwhile, Trump is tweeting about the impeachment inquiry, falsely arguing that the whistleblower who raised concerns about his Ukraine call has been proven wrong on key points. In reality, the White House\u2019s own memo on the call confirmed key aspects of the whistleblower\u2019s account. Namely, Trump discussed a possible investigation of Joe Biden with the Ukrainian president and encouraged the foreign leader to work with his attorney general and Rudy Giuliani to investigate corruption. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are presenting a united front in defending their progressive vision for the country. The team effort is notable given that Warren has pulled ahead of Sanders in recent polls. However, that trend has not stopped Sanders from consistently siding with his Senate colleague on issues like Medicare for All. Joe Biden went after Elizabeth Warren by saying that he helped secure the votes to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which the Massachusetts senator was citing as one of her accomplishments. Asked to respond, Warren said she was so grateful to Barack Obama for making the CFPB a reality, prompting some gasps in the press room here in Westerville. Joe Biden has been asked whether the \u201cvisions\u201d offered by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would be able to attract enough voters to defeat Trump. The former vice-president initially answered by focusing on the alleged lack of feasibility in passing the pair\u2019s proposals. Biden said he was the only person onstage who has gotten something \u201creally big\u201d enacted. When specifically pressed on who was being \u201cvague\u201d, as Biden claimed, he cited Warren and Sanders\u2019 comments about Medicare for All. On the question of reproductive rights, Tulsi Gabbard said she supported \u201csome restrictions\u201d on access to abortion. Joe Biden defended reproductive rights as a \u201cconstitutional right\u201d but voiced opposition to the idea of expanding the number of supreme court justices to protect Roe v Wade. Pete Buttigieg, who has backed the idea of so-called \u201ccourt-packing\u201d, argued that the proposal would actually help to \u201cdepoliticize\u201d the judicial branch. Andrew Yang has caught the attention of debate watchers tonight by reminding them that Bing \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s search engine \u2013 still exists. But it\u2019s not good news for the plucky Google rival, as Yang reserved one of his most withering put downs of the night for it. CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett is asking candidates about reproductive rights, implicitly responding to critics who have complained about the lack of questions on the topic this election cycle. Kamala Harris said her justice department would review any state law that seeks to limit access to abortion. Amy Klobuchar criticized Trump\u2019s stance on the issue and argued for the necessity of funding Planned Parenthood. Bernie Sanders has fuelled speculation after mentioning that he will be joined by a very special guest at his rally in Queens this Saturday. Who could it be? Here are some of the predictions being made: Kamala Harris has become the latest candidate to directly take on Elizabeth Warren, this time on the issue of Trump\u2019s Twitter account. Harris has pushed Twitter to shutter the president\u2019s account, arguing that it is a matter of \u201ccorporate accountability\u201d. Warren responded to Harris\u2019 confrontation by saying she wanted to focus on kicking Trump out of the White House and noted she was not taking money from tech executives. Repeatedly pressed by Harris, Warren kept redirecting attention away from the matter of Trump\u2019s Twitter account and toward the issue of money in politics, arguing tech companies had too much political influence. Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly found herself at odds tonight with, among several other candidates, Andrew Yang. The tech entrepreneur argued that the Massachusetts senator\u2019s proposal to break up tech companies would not sufficiently revive America\u2019s economy amid the decline of manufacturing jobs. Warren responded by emphasizing that a Democratic president would need to crack down on monopolies regardless. We have reached the second commercial break of the Democratic debate, which gives the blog a chance to zoom out on what we have seen so far. Pete Buttigieg has repeatedly attempted to reframe the debate in terms of his more moderate proposals, repeatedly attacking Elizabeth Warren on issues like healthcare. His strategy emphasizes how the Indiana mayor is trying to pitch himself to voters as an alternative to Joe Biden. At the two-hour mark of a three-hour debate, only a few candidates have briefly mentioned the climate crisis. Tom Steyer pivoted from a question about foreign policy to call Trump\u2019s complete lack of climate policies a \u201cdisaster\u201d and argue that the US needs to work with the world to fight rising heat-trapping pollution. Bernie Sanders said fossil fuel companies are destroying the world and should be held liable. Pete Buttigieg touted the opportunities of wind power. But moderators still haven\u2019t asked any climate questions. Previous debates have included short segments on the climate crisis, near the end of the allotted time. Climate activists have feared television networks and moderators might not focus much on the issue, after presidential hopefuls participated in two separate climate events last month. In those events \u2013 a town hall and a forum \u2013 candidates did not interact with one another because the Democratic National Committee has refused to allow a climate-focused debate. Joe Biden, who the moderators noted would turn 80 during his first term, handled the question about his health by emphasizing the \u201cwisdom\u201d that comes with his age. The former vice president reiterated his promise to release his health records before voting begins in Iowa, the first caucus state. When pressed on whether he would release the records this year, Biden would not commit to that timeline and instead repeated that he would release them before Iowa voting starts. Bernie Sanders was trying to jump into a conversation about the opioid epidemic when moderator Erin Burnett interjected with a question about his health. Sanders, who suffered a heart attack earlier this month, said: \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great.\u201d He then pivoted to answer the opioid question. Turning to the issue of his health, Sanders plugged his upcoming rally in Queens, New York. He predicted that the event would settle any concerns about his health. Sanders then took the time to thank his fellow candidates \u201cfrom the bottom of my heart\u201d for their well wishes after his heart attack. He said: \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be with you this evening.\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro mentioned the killing of Atatiana Jefferson in his home state of Texas over the weekend. The death of Jefferson, an African-American woman who was fatally shot by a police officer as she babysat her nephew, has sparked outrage in recent days. And now, on a sartorial note ... Tom Steyer\u2019s tie has come under more fire tonight than Elizabeth Warren. At least that\u2019s how it seems looking at the reactions on Twitter: An NPR reporter shared this very fun fact about a unique connection between two of the Democrats participating in tonight\u2019s debate. Two of the more moderate candidates onstage, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, pushed back against the proposal of mandatory buybacks of assault weapons. But the pair emphasized that they have not backed the idea principally because they did not consider it feasible to pass such a proposal. Beto O\u2019Rourke was pressed on how he would enforce his mandatory buyback program of assault weapons. O\u2019Rourke has said he would track down the guns that are not turned in through the program, but he struggled to explain how he would do so. Pete Buttigieg, who had previously criticized O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal, said the former Texas congressman had shown in his answer that the idea was unrealistic. Buttigieg said that the country \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d for gun control reform, arguing that candidates should focus on more popular proposals like universal background checks. On the issue of proposing bold change, Buttigieg told O\u2019Rourke: \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage.\u201d Tulsi Gabbard has been accused by some debate viewers of following a pro-Assad line in her response to Trump\u2019s controversial withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria. This is what she said (while defending herself against claims of being an \u201cAssad apologist\u201d): And here\u2019s how people have responded: However some commentators have praised her for her proposal, including the editorial director of the Nation: Meanwhile, this was Pete Buttigieg\u2019s response to Gabbard: Tom Steyer chose to redirect the conversation toward the climate crisis. Asked a question about foreign policy, the billionaire activist said Trump\u2019s policies had been a \u201cdisaster\u201d but then pivoted to discussing the climate. Steyer said: \u201cWe can\u2019t solve the climate crisis in the US by ourselves, but we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world.\u201d (Yes, he did indeed say \u201cfrenemies\u201d.) This post was amended on 16 October 2019. The headline of an earlier version incorrectly said Tom Steyer was the first candidate to raise the issue of the climate crisis. This has been corrected. Calling upon his long record as a senator and vice-president, Joe Biden used his foreign policy answer to note he was the only candidate who has spent extensive time with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin. Biden explained the threat Putin poses to America while gesturing to his right, where Bernie Sanders is standing. Sanders responded by joking that Biden was calling him Putin, prompting laughs from the candidates and the audience. On a more serious note, Biden warned that Trump was putting the country in danger by being a \u201ccrazy, erratic president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy\u201d. With the exception of Tulsi Gabbard, the Democratic presidential candidates have been largely unified in their criticism of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. Kamala Harris said Trump \u201csold out the Kurds\u201d, and the decision demonstrated \u201cwhy dude gotta go\u201d. Juli\u00e1n Castro emphasized reports that the troop withdrawal, and the subsequent military action by Turkey, had allowed at least hundreds of people held at Isis prisons to escape. The two veterans onstage, Pete Buttigieg and Tulsi Gabbard, clashed over the proper course of action in Syria. Gabbard argued Buttigieg was fueling endless wars in the Middle East, but the Indiana mayor shot back that the Hawaii congresswoman was \u201cwrong\u201d and backing the abandonment of critical US allies. Moderators are now questioning the candidates about Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. Joe Biden said that the troop withdrawal was the \u201cmost shameful thing any president has done in modern history\u201d. Tulsi Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran who has criticized America\u2019s ongoing wars in the Middle East, said that the blame for what is happening in Syria did not solely belong to Trump. The Hawaii congresswoman argued that other politicians had fueled the violent situation in Syria. As we head into the second half of the debate, here is how much each candidate has spoken so far, via the New York Times\u2019 live tracker Here are the key takeaways from the debate so far: Democratic candidates are ganging up on Elizabeth Warren now that the Massachusetts senator has assumed frontrunner status. Joe Biden denied any wrongdoing by himself or his son in Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings overseas, forcefully pushing back against Trump\u2019s false corruption claims. Two candidates, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, raised the issue of reproductive rights because debate moderators have yet to ask a specific question about it. The first commercial break has ended, so stay tuned. Even Beto O\u2019Rourke is going after Elizabeth Warren, which is interesting given that he is far less moderate than candidates like Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar. The former Texas congressman said the Massachusetts senator was too focused on \u201cbeing punitive\u201d. As the debate turns to wealth inequality Tom Steyer \u2013 the only billionaire on stage \u2013 finally gets his say. He has waited 40 minutes to get into the debate and uses it to hit out at the power of corporations. It\u2019s met with mixed results: And as Guardian US columnist Robert Reich has also pointed out, Warren\u2019s follow-up was particularly punchy: A HuffPost reporter noted that Amy Klobuchar\u2019s strategy of attacking Elizbaeth Warren at every turn has been tried at previous debates, namely by John Delaney, and has proven to be ... less than successful. Amy Klobuchar really wants a fight with Elizabeth Warren. Asked about a wealth tax, Klobuchar instead pivoted to provide a \u201creality check\u201d to Warren. The Minnesota senator accused Warren of falsely portraying other candidates\u2019 plans and presenting her proposals as the only option. Moderators tried to draw a fight out between Joe Biden and candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who have endorsed a wealth tax. But the former vice-president did not take the bait, instead emphasizing that billionaires should pay more in taxes. This was Joe Biden\u2019s response when asked about his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, which have been the target of many false claims by Trump: Candidates are now taking a question on American income inequality. Specifically, the moderators asked Bernie Sanders about his proposed wealth tax. Pressed on whether the plan is intended to tax billionaires out of existence, Sanders argued that the country\u2019s current level of income inequality is a \u201cmoral and economic outrage\u201d. The moderators then turned to Tom Steyer, whom they identified as the only billionaire onstage. But the wealthy activist echoed Sanders\u2019 demand for a wealth tax to combat income inequality. The campaign of Pete Buttigieg is amplifying the Indiana mayor\u2019s attack on Elizabeth Warren by tweeting a video of him criticizing the frontrunner\u2019s healthcare proposal. Cory Booker interestingly used one of his answers to chastise the moderators for asking Joe Biden about his son\u2019s business activities overseas. The New Jersey senator said that the moderators were \u201cusing Trump\u2019s lies\u201d by raising the issue and argued Biden should not have to defend himself against false corruption claims. A feature of tonight\u2019s debate is how the more centrist candidates have turned their early fire on Elizabeth Warren. As the candidate with the most momentum it seems she has also become the focus of most of the early attacks, particularly over her healthcare plan. Here\u2019s how some commentators are interpreting the centrist charge Kamala Harris interrupted the contentious conversation about Medicare-for-all to demand more attention be given to reproductive rights. The California senator noted that debate moderators have yet to ask a question specifically about reproductive rights, and Harris argued that Republicans were putting women\u2019s lives at risk with restrictive abortion policies. Minutes later, Cory Booker similarly said that the candidates should devote more attention to reproductive rights tonight. The New Jersey senator praised Harris for raising the issue but said that men should also be actively engaged in the fight for reproductive rights. Bernie Sanders appears to be once again taking the side of Elizabeth Warren as the two progressive senators team up against their more moderate opponents. Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg all criticized Warren for endorsing a costly Medicare for All plan that they called unrealistic. Sanders, who has based his campaign around Medicare for All, jumped in to argue that the current US healthcare system was unsustainable and that Americans deserved better. The knives are out for Elizabeth Warren tonight now that the Massachusetts senator has taken the frontrunner title. Amy Klobuchar repeatedly criticized Warren for being allegedly unrealistic about what she would be able to achieve in healthcare reform if she were president. The Minnesota senator said that the distinction between Medicare-for-all and her healthcare proposal, which focuses on enacting a public option, is the \u201cdifference between a plan and a pipe dream.\u201d Bernie Sanders acknowledged in his healthcare answer that taxes would go up if his Medicare-for-all plan were enacted. Elizabeth Warren responded to Sanders by once again emphasizing costs over taxes and repeating that costs would go down overall for the middle class with her plan. Amy Kobuchar, echoing Pete Buttigieg, accused Warren of dodging the cost question. The Minnesota senator said: \u201cAt least Bernie is being honest.\u201d The moderators have quickly moved on from the question of Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities and posed a question to Elizabeth Warren about how she would pay for her healthcare plan. Repeatedly pressed on whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her Medicare for All plan, Warren said: \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that will not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d The moderators noted that Pete Buttigieg has accused Warren of being evasive on the question of paying for her plan. Buttigieg said that Warren had once again refused to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to a \u201cyes or no\u201d question. Warren responded that Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All who want it\u201d plan is really a \u201cMedicare for All who can afford it\u201d plan, which Buttigieg pushed back against. Joe Biden was asked a question about the foreign business activities of his son, Hunter, and why he considered it appropriate for his family to do such work overseas when he was president. Emphasizing that there is no evidence to substantiate Trump\u2019s corruption claims against him or his son, Biden said: \u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government.\u201d Biden argued that Trump was peddling these false corruption claims because he is scared to run against the former vice president. Biden said that, if nominated, Trump knows \u201cI will beat him like a drum\u201d. Tom Steyer is making his debate debut tonight, and he opened his answer on impeachment by applauding his Democratic opponents, saying that any of them would make a better president than Trump. Steyer first rose to prominence by pushing for Trump\u2019s impeachment long before news of the Ukraine controversy broke, and the billionaire activist hopes to build upon that name recognition tonight. Pete Buttigieg said that Trump\u2019s behavior and the inaction of congressional Republicans had left Democrats with no choice but to pursue impeachment. However, the Indiana mayor emphasized that candidates had to focus on what they would do after Trump left office. Buttigieg said that, as president, he would help the country \u201cturn the page\u201d and achieve change. Amy Klobuchar said Trump had engaged in \u201cillegal conduct\u201d in his communications with the Ukrainian president. But the Minnesota senator then shifted to a much more sweeping condemnation of the president, citing his decision to withdraw US forces from northern Syria and abandon America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Klobuchar concluded that Trump had consistently placed his personal interests above those of the country. Calling upon her record as a former prosecutor, Kamala Harris said that Trump has told the American people about the ways in which he has violated the constitution. Harris said of Trump\u2019s comments on his controversial Ukraine call: \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d The memo the White House released on the call proved that Trump discussed a possible investigation of Joe Biden with the Ukrainian president. The impeachment question is now being posed to other candidates, starting with Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator said that Trump has ignored the constitution in a number of ways, including by holding onto his business interests in alleged violation of the emoluments clause. Joe Biden, who was in the Senate during Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, said that he thought Democrats have been appropriately deliberative when it comes to considering the president\u2019s removal. The first question goes to Elizabeth Warren, and CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper asked why she supported Trump\u2019s impeachment with the 2020 election a year away. Cooper asked if it should be the American electorate who \u201cdetermines the president\u2019s fate.\u201d Warren responded that some issues go beyond politics and that the alleged constitutional violations Trump has committed would send a message to all future presidents about the country\u2019s democratic values. Warren concluded: \u201cThe impeachment must go forward.\u201d The fourth Democratic presidential debate, featuring the largest field to ever share one stage, has begun. The candidates are taking the stage and the debate is set to start in about five minutes, so here is how you can watch it. Tonight\u2019s debate at Otterbein University in Ohio is being jointly hosted by CNN and the New York Times and can be streamed on both outlets\u2019 websites. The moderators are CNN hosts Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett and Times national editor Marc Lacey. The event marks the first debate the Times has hosted in more than a decade. And the blog will be providing lives updates and analysis on the candidates\u2019 answers, so stay tuned. The dozen Democratic presidential candidates participating in tonight\u2019s debate are taking the stage at Otterbein University in Ohio. Spare a thought for the Rosencrantzes and Guildensterns of the Democratic primary tonight: the half-dozen candidates who didn\u2019t make the debate stage but are still running for president. If you think Juli\u00e1n Castro or Tulsi Gabbard are long shots, these are astronomical. Some of them will doubtless be watching from afar; others are defiantly holding rival events likely to draw rather less national attention. Self-help author Marianne Williamson, for example, will be speaking about \u201cthe spirit of America\u201d to an audience in Encinitas, California. Senator Michael Bennet is holding a town hall in Iowa tonight, then heading to New Hampshire, where former congressman Joe Sestak is on day three of an epic walk. Sestak has also just launched a campaign ad, \u201cUnited\u201d, that emphasises his military background and how he entered politics after his daughter overcame brain cancer. But the debate will be a sharp reminder that time is running out for former congressman John Delaney, first to enter the race in July 2017, Governor Steve Bullock and Congressman Tim Ryan \u2013 all of whom are presumably still hoping that Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar will somehow implode, leaving the centre lane open. Delaney embarks on his 37th trip to Iowa this week. According to the Washington Post, Bullock had a withering putdown when asked about this week\u2019s debate. \u201cWe may well be, like two-thirds of Iowans, not even watching,\u201d he told reporters. The dozen Democratic presidential candidates participating tonight will take the Ohio stage in just fifteen minutes, and they are offering previews of their performances over Twitter. Joe Biden made clear he intended to focus attention away from the false corruption claims Trump has leveled against him: Elizabeth Warren reiterated her demand for \u201cbig, structural change\u201d: Bernie Sanders criticized Trump for \u201cdemonizing\u201d Latinos and immigrants: And Kamala Harris went over her debate notes in a very liberally blue suit: Bernie is back! After being hospitalized for a heart attack earlier this month, Bernie Sanders, 78, needs to assuage concerns about is health and age and convince he is mentally and physically fit to be president, one of the most demanding jobs in the world. Health has always been treated with delicately on the campaign trail, but Sanders health scare places a new emphasis on a delicate question: how old is too old to be president? In recent interviews, Sanders has parried questions about whether he is physically well enough to stand for a three-hour debate as complex questions are volleyed among a debate stage with 11 rivals. A proud, one-time long distance runner, the senator has indicated that he intends to be a vision of vim and vigor on the debate stage Tuesday night. The candidate has been off the trail since he experienced chest pains at an event 1 Oct. event in Las Vegas and had two stents to clear an artery blockage. He has been recuperating at his home in Burlington. Supporters and allies believe Sanders health problems could provide an opportunity for the senator to make a more personal case for his signature healthcare policy, Medicare for all. Sanders has struggled to connect his policy with his personal story, even as his campaign has tried to coax him into conveying his softer side. Sanders, who repeatedly polls third in national and state primary surveys, has fiercely defended his campaign\u2019s handling of the incident, amid criticism over it\u2019s decision not to immediately disclose that the senator suffered a heart attack. The Democrats could not be making history tonight for packing the most presidential candidates ever onto a single debate stage were it not for the participation of every single one of the 12 contenders. But there is one candidate to whom extra credit might properly accrue for making the Democratic dozen happen tonight, and she is representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Because to be here, Gabbard had to overcome her own threat, made just days ago, not to be here. Last Friday, Gabbard released a video saying \u201cI\u2019m seriously considering boycotting the next debate\u201d because, she claimed, the Democratic party \u201cand the corporate media are rigging the election again.\u201d Like Donald Trump, who likes to float conspiracies about \u201crigged\u201d elections, Gabbard did not go into specifics. The difference between Trump and Gabbard is that Trump won, while Gabbard is polling at less than 1% nationally and appears to be a longshot to qualify for the next debate in November. In any case on Monday she announced that she would debate after all. Senator Amy Klobuchar promptly dunked on her on Twitter. The debate is now about 30 minutes away, so it seems like a good time to reintroduce each of the candidates who will be participating tonight. Here they are, in order of their podium placement from center stage: Joe Biden, the former vice president who has become the focus of false corruption allegations by Trump and his allies in recent weeks. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has started to creep ahead of Biden in early voting states as the Democratic base responds to her progressive message. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate who is making his campaign return tonight after suffering a heart attack earlier this month. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor from Indiana who seems to be offering himself as a fresher alternative to Biden. Kamala Harris, the California senator and former state attorney general who has promised to prosecute the case against Trump but has fallen behind in recent polling. Andrew Yang, the tech entrepreneur has pulled ahead of more \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates with his campaign promise of a universal basic income. Cory Booker, the New Jersey senator who enjoyed a fundraising boost late last month after warning he may have to drop out of the race if he did not see an uptick in donations. Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman and Senate candidate who has increasingly focused on gun control since the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August. Tom Steyer, the billionaire activist who rose to prominence by advocating for Trump\u2019s impeachment and is now making his debate debut after a late campaign launch. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who has based her campaign around appealing to Midwestern voters who swung from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016. Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman who threatened to boycott tonight\u2019s debate over her claim that the Democratic National Committee is \u201crigging\u201d the election. Julian Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and housing and urban development secretary who launched an uneven attack on Biden during the last debate. All 12 of those candidates will soon face off on one debate stage here in Westerville, Ohio, so stay tuned. Tonight the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination converges on Ohio, where 12 candidates will meet on a debate stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, a suburb of Columbus. For decades, Ohio has been the consummate presidential battleground. No president since John F Kennedy has won the White House without the Buckeye State. The state once represented the crossroads of the nation, a place where Appalachia meets the Midwest, where industry and agriculture prosper and where growing suburbs surrounded diverse urban centers. But its status as the nation\u2019s bellwether has faded in recent years as Ohio has failed to keep pace with the demographic changes transforming the country. The state is now older, whiter and less educated than the national average, and as a result, has become more reliably Republican. Donald Trump won Ohio by 8.5 percentage points, the widest margin of any \u201cswing\u201d state. The margin of victory in traditional battleground states is typically much closer, as it was in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three Midwestern states that delivered Trump the White House. By comparison, Hillary Clinton lost the traditional Republican strongholds of Arizona and Georgia by 3.5 percentage points and 5 percentage points respectively. And last year, every Ohio Democrat running a statewide race lost, except for senator Sherrod Brown, who won re-election and nearly used that victory to run for president on the strength of his ability to win as a populist in the Rust Belt. That same year Democrats won governorships in Wisconsin and Michigan after losing the states to Trump in 2016. Some Ohio Democrats insist the state is still in play for Democrats, noting Trump\u2019s unpopularity here. A recent Emerson poll of Ohio voters found that Trump\u2019s approval rating in Ohio hovered at 43% with a disapproval of 51%, mirroring his national approval rating. Meanwhile, 47% of Ohio voters said they supported impeachment, compared with 43% who said they did not. But the demographics here make it difficult for Democrats to succeed. \u201cOhio being selected as a debate site is a nice consolation prize. But don\u2019t mistake it as a fundamental shift in the 2020 political map,\u201d Bret Larkin, the former editorial director of the Plain Dealer, wrote in an op-ed. \u201cAnd Ohioans should not expect to see much of the party\u2019s nominee in the crucial months of next August, September and October.\u201d Read more on why Democrats are meeting tonight in Westerville: As we prepare for the debate to start in less than an hour, we are also following updates from House Democratic leaders\u2019 press conference on Capitol Hill about the impeachment inquiry. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said the panel\u2019s closed-door interviews in recent days has made it seem like Trump\u2019s controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president \u201cdidn\u2019t happen in isolation.\u201d Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, took a seat with reporters as Schiff provided an update on the impeachment investigation. Twelve candidates will participate in tonight\u2019s debate, but only two-thirds of them have secured their place in the next face-off. The fifth Democratic presidential debate will take place on November 20 in Georgia, and only eight candidates \u2013 Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer \u2013 have qualified so far. The other four candidates on tonight\u2019s stage \u2013 Beto O\u2019Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard and Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 have not yet met the polling requirement for the next debate. In order to qualify, O\u2019Rourke and Klobuchar both need at least three more polls where they receive 3 percent or more nationally or in one of the four early-voting states. Gabbard and Castro each need at least four more qualifying polls because neither of them has any yet. (Candidates can also qualify by reaching at least 5 percent in two polls of the early-voting states.) The four contenders have until November 13 to meet the requirement, but even with four weeks to hit the goal, it will be a difficult climb. Their best chance at winning a spike in polling might be to pull an attention-grabbing stunt at tonight\u2019s debate, perhaps by confronting one of the frontrunners like Biden or Warren. So stay tuned to see if it happens. Millions of debate viewers will likely have the same question on their minds when the candidates take the stage tonight: Who\u2019s the new guy? This is supposed to be a process of elimination, and through three previous debates, the Democratic field has indeed shrunk. But the debate stage will expand temporarily on Tuesday to admit one new face, billionaire activist Tom Steyer. Steyer, 62, who made a fortune as a hedge fund manager, is a favorite in progressive circles not only for championing causes such as climate activism and the impeachment of Donald Trump, but also for putting his money where his mouth is. He has donated hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to progressive causes. What has some Democrats feeling a bit miffed tonight is that now Steyer is ... putting his mouth where his money is and stepping forward as a presidential candidate himself. The American public will see Steyer in debate form for the first time tonight. What will they hear when he opens his mouth \u2013 an activist\u2019s resolve or a rich man\u2019s hubris? Hello, live blog readers! Welcome to part four of the Democratic presidential debate series. The Guardian is here at the debate site of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, just outside of Columbus. Our team will be bringing you live updates and analysis as the 12 candidates participating tonight face off in the largest presidential primary debate in history. The debate will get under way at 8pm ET. Before it starts, my colleagues and I will provide some context on each of the candidates onstage, those who did not qualify and the significance of the debate location. To start, read my five expectations for tonight\u2019s event. The Guardian team will have plenty more analysis before the debate starts, so stay tuned.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Arwa Mahdawi: \u2018Warren is the frontrunner and </strong><strong> Sanders was on fire\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Tuesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/15/democratic-debate-joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders\">crammed stage</a> meant real debate was impossible and, with the exception of a few heated disagreements, it was basically a conga line of predictable soundbites. Indeed, by the end of the night Anderson Cooper gave up any attempt at real substance and rounded things off with a question about \u201cyour most unexpected friend\u201d. Think I had that as a homework assignment when I was 12.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the clearest takeaway of the night is that Elizabeth Warren is now the frontrunner. She spent the evening on the defensive as the rest of the candidates took swipes at her. While she displayed extraordinary restraint in the face of some excruciating mansplaining (Beto O\u2019Rourke calling her \u201cpunitive\u201d felt like a politer version of \u201cnasty woman\u201d) it wasn\u2019t her strongest performance. She made it too easy for Republicans to call her evasive when it comes to healthcare costs. Warren needs to find a better way to explain that Medicare for All is the most equitable solution, even if taxes are raised.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t know what meds Bernie Sanders is on, but I\u2019d like some myself. It\u2019s hard to believe he recently had a heart attack; he was bursting with energy, and challenging other Dems to find the guts to stand up to the insurance companies. While Bernie Sanders was on fire Joe Biden seemed rattled; his performance was \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=expedentially&amp;src=typed_query\">expedentially</a>\u201d worse.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Jessa Crispin: \u2018The single-digit candidates are getting restless\u2019</h2> \n<p>The single-digit candidates are getting restless. Those polling below 5% are sensing the end of their campaigns, without even the dignity of a cabinet position on the horizon. They \u2013 among them Beto O\u2019Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard and the six-foot-tall rabbit that escaped from its medical laboratory by wearing the billionaire Tom Steyer\u2019s skin \u2013 are grasping for a few more percentage points, and they\u2019re trying to wrestle them one by one away from Elizabeth Warren.</p> \n<p>Now that Warren is ahead of Joe Biden in the polls, as the former vice-president continues his campaign to make each and every American voter deeply uncomfortable, she was the expected new target on the debate stage. The question was, are her opponents going to say something new, innovate their language and their positions, and create a new vision for America and a broken Democratic party, or are they just going to say the same old things in a louder voice. Guess which one they all chose!</p> \n<p>If only the positions they took and the punches they threw at Warren made any sense. Here was Kamala Harris adamantly insisting Warren take the bold position of ... deleting Trump\u2019s Twitter account. Here was Gabbard glitching in her new fascist Stepford mode, repeating the term \u201cregime change war\u201d with regards to American intervention in Syria more than 10 times in a few minutes. Here was Klobuchar freaking out about Russia, at least half a dozen scandals behind the times.</p> \n<p>These things are an endurance test, for us the voters as we crawl to the first primaries and to these candidates. Warren easily shrugged off her attackers, dooming them to languish in the shallow end of the polls until they run out of other people\u2019s money. None of this makes me feel like we have any idea of how actually to defeat Trump. But it was very nice to see Bernie Sanders healthy, smiling and still calling for revolution.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Jessa Crispin is the author of Why I Am Not a Feminist</em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Derecka Purnell: \u2018Warren won the night\u2019</h2> \n<p>Elizabeth Warren won the night. She was targeted as an emerging frontrunner, but held her own. When Kamala Harris demanded that Warren ask Twitter to shut down Donald Trump\u2019s account, she focused on breaking up big tech instead. When Pete Buttigieg claimed that she was evasive about raising taxes on the middle class, she answered carefully about lowering medical costs instead of increasing taxes.</p> \n<p>Bernie was a strong second. People counted him out after a heart attack, yet he debated tonight with clarity, humor and more affection that previously seen on national stages.

      "bodyText": "Arwa Mahdawi: \u2018Warren is the frontrunner and Sanders was on fire\u2019 Tuesday\u2019s crammed stage meant real debate was impossible and, with the exception of a few heated disagreements, it was basically a conga line of predictable soundbites. Indeed, by the end of the night Anderson Cooper gave up any attempt at real substance and rounded things off with a question about \u201cyour most unexpected friend\u201d. Think I had that as a homework assignment when I was 12. Perhaps the clearest takeaway of the night is that Elizabeth Warren is now the frontrunner. She spent the evening on the defensive as the rest of the candidates took swipes at her. While she displayed extraordinary restraint in the face of some excruciating mansplaining (Beto O\u2019Rourke calling her \u201cpunitive\u201d felt like a politer version of \u201cnasty woman\u201d) it wasn\u2019t her strongest performance. She made it too easy for Republicans to call her evasive when it comes to healthcare costs. Warren needs to find a better way to explain that Medicare for All is the most equitable solution, even if taxes are raised. I don\u2019t know what meds Bernie Sanders is on, but I\u2019d like some myself. It\u2019s hard to believe he recently had a heart attack; he was bursting with energy, and challenging other Dems to find the guts to stand up to the insurance companies. While Bernie Sanders was on fire Joe Biden seemed rattled; his performance was \u201cexpedentially\u201d worse. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist Jessa Crispin: \u2018The single-digit candidates are getting restless\u2019 The single-digit candidates are getting restless. Those polling below 5% are sensing the end of their campaigns, without even the dignity of a cabinet position on the horizon. They \u2013 among them Beto O\u2019Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard and the six-foot-tall rabbit that escaped from its medical laboratory by wearing the billionaire Tom Steyer\u2019s skin \u2013 are grasping for a few more percentage points, and they\u2019re trying to wrestle them one by one away from Elizabeth Warren. Now that Warren is ahead of Joe Biden in the polls, as the former vice-president continues his campaign to make each and every American voter deeply uncomfortable, she was the expected new target on the debate stage. The question was, are her opponents going to say something new, innovate their language and their positions, and create a new vision for America and a broken Democratic party, or are they just going to say the same old things in a louder voice. Guess which one they all chose! If only the positions they took and the punches they threw at Warren made any sense. Here was Kamala Harris adamantly insisting Warren take the bold position of ... deleting Trump\u2019s Twitter account. Here was Gabbard glitching in her new fascist Stepford mode, repeating the term \u201cregime change war\u201d with regards to American intervention in Syria more than 10 times in a few minutes. Here was Klobuchar freaking out about Russia, at least half a dozen scandals behind the times. These things are an endurance test, for us the voters as we crawl to the first primaries and to these candidates. Warren easily shrugged off her attackers, dooming them to languish in the shallow end of the polls until they run out of other people\u2019s money. None of this makes me feel like we have any idea of how actually to defeat Trump. But it was very nice to see Bernie Sanders healthy, smiling and still calling for revolution. Jessa Crispin is the author of Why I Am Not a Feminist Derecka Purnell: \u2018Warren won the night\u2019 Elizabeth Warren won the night. She was targeted as an emerging frontrunner, but held her own. When Kamala Harris demanded that Warren ask Twitter to shut down Donald Trump\u2019s account, she focused on breaking up big tech instead. When Pete Buttigieg claimed that she was evasive about raising taxes on the middle class, she answered carefully about lowering medical costs instead of increasing taxes. Bernie was a strong second. People counted him out after a heart attack, yet he debated tonight with clarity, humor and more affection that previously seen on national stages. Using the war in Iraq and the bailout, he vigorously reminded Joe Biden that the former vice-president accomplished more than just the Violence Against Women Act while in office, which silenced Biden. Harris started out quoting Maya Angelou, saying that when people show you who they are the first time, believe them. The irony is that Kamala constantly defends her prosecution record that came down on poor black people in California. Maybe the tides have turned: she called for an end to mass incarceration while calling for a new war on drugs \u2026 for pharmaceutical company employees.

Three hours is too long, and Americans are ready for fewer presidential hopefuls on stage.

      "bodyText": "A senior European monitor has raised serious concerns about the police investigation into the killing of the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Speaking to the Guardian on the second anniversary of Caruana Galizia\u2019s death, Pieter Omtzigt, a special rapporteur for the Council of Europe, listed a catalogue of alleged failings and said he was concerned the authorities may have turned down evidence that could lead to those who commissioned the killing. \u201cIndividual officers may be doing their best, but the approach of the police force as a whole, and of the politicians responsible for it, does not match the prime minister\u2019s promise to leave no stone unturned,\u201d Omtzigt said. A member of the Dutch parliament, Omtzigt was appointed to monitor the case last year by the Council of Europe, a human rights body whose assembly consists of elected representatives from 47 states, ranging from the UK to Russia. Caruana Galizia, known for her revelations about political corruption in Malta, was killed by a car bomb near her home on 16 October 2017. Three men accused of planting and triggering the explosive are awaiting trial. They were arrested weeks after the incident, but it is suspected the killing was ordered by individuals who are still at large. Among the failings identified by Omtzigt is the failure so far to agree a plea deal with one of the alleged hitmen, Vincent Muscat, who has spoken to police about a supposed intermediary. \u201cI am concerned that the authorities may have turned down evidence that could lead to whoever ordered the murder,\u201d Omtzigt said. \u201cAnd I am also worried that neither Mr Muscat, nor his lawyer, nor others who may be concerned by this situation \u2013 including the alleged intermediary \u2013 have been provided with adequate protection.\u201d Over the weekend, the Times of Malta reported anonymous claims that Muscat was in discussions with the attorney general for a reduced sentence in exchange for his testimony. However, Muscat\u2019s lawyers are said to be concerned he could be harmed in a revenge attack while in prison. He is being held alongside his alleged accomplices at the Corradino correctional facility, and is reported to be in fear for his life and reluctant to eat prison food. Omtzigt raised further concerns, including the delayed removal of a senior officer from the case despite a conflict of interest; the refusal of a copy of Caruana Galizia\u2019s laptop from German police, who had obtained the data; a complaint by the former head of Europol about unsatisfactory cooperation from the Maltese police; and anonymous briefings to journalists about imminent breakthroughs that turned out to be false. Meanwhile, the rapporteur\u2019s efforts to monitor the case have led to verbal attacks from Malta\u2019s prime minister and fears for his own safety. On the advice of the Netherlands\u2019 secret service, Omtzigt was accompanied by armed plain clothes officers, assigned by the Maltese authorities, when he visited the country. A veteran investigator, he has produced reports on corruption and bribery by the Azerbaijan government and on mass surveillance by the US and other countries, but this is the first time he has required police protection. Malta attempted in September 2018 to have Omtzigt removed as rapporteur, but this was rejected. Malta raised concerns about the politician\u2019s handling of an investigation into the shooting down of Malaysian airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, has used press conferences to question Omtzigt\u2019s credibility. He described the rapporteur as having \u201cserious credibility deficits\u201d and of having told \u201clies\u201d in relation to a previous investigation. Omtzigt rejects those claims. Senior members of Muscat\u2019s investigation have refused meetings requested by Omtzigt. \u201cEvery time I ask sharp, factual questions about the case or request meetings, they refuse any answer and come up with all kinds of stories,\u201d Omtzigt told the Guardian. Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder sent shockwaves across Europe and focused a spotlight on allegations by politicians in the European parliament that the rule of law has deteriorated sharply in the small Mediterranean country. The journalist\u2019s most significant investigations stemmed from the Panama Papers, a leak of documents from the archives of the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. Omtzigt said he was also concerned about the absence of any request to the Latvian authorities to produce bank account information which could relate to the case. Among Caruana Galizia\u2019s most important investigations was the revelation that two members of Malta\u2019s current Labour government had acquired secretive Panama registered companies soon after taking office. Material leaked from the Panama Papers suggests those companies were due to receive payments from another entity, called 17 Black, with an account at Latvia\u2019s now defunct ABLV bank. \u201cEven in Mongolia, people who were exposed in the Panama Papers had to resign,\u201d said Omtzigt. \u201cEverywhere, people resigned. Except Malta. Malta is the only exception we can find.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s office and Malta police did not respond to requests for comment.",

That\u2019s why we got involved in the first place.\u201d An invasion of north-eastern Syria by Turkey last week after Trump announced the withdrawal of US forces on Twitter has resulted in numerous reports of detained Isis fighters breaking out of \u2013 or simply walking away from \u2013 prisons where they had been held by Kurdish fighters formerly allied with the US who are now under attack from Turkish forces. Biden also warned that he believed if Trump were re-elected in November 2020, \u201cthere will be no Nato\u201d. The architects of the so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d, and especially the Republican backers of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and an expansive US presence in the Middle East, have long warned that the US must intervene abroad in order to prevent attacks at home. Questioned on Friday about a potential risk posed by Isis fighters freed amid the Syrian turmoil, Trump said it was Europe\u2019s problem. \u201cWell, they are going to be escaping to Europe, that\u2019s where they want to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to go back to their homes.\u201d Multiple Democratic candidates at the primary debate in Ohio condemned what they called Trump\u2019s betrayal of American allies in the region. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, leaving our allies for slaughter, makes America great again,\u201d the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar said.

A debate Tuesday night in Ohio among the biggest group of Democrats yet was notable for attacks directed at the new perceived frontrunner, the emergence of some fresh issues and the playing of some greatest hits (read: healthcare). Here are the key takeaways: Elizabeth Warren attacked in new role as frontrunner In earlier debates, the former vice-president Joe Biden was the candidate to scrap with for lesser-known candidates who wanted to make a splash. In Ohio, that torch passed to the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who has popped to the top of some recent polls. Whether the topic was healthcare or wealth inequality, the Democratic field turned their answers into challenges to Warren, who ended the night with a lion\u2019s share of the speaking time. Early in the debate, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, attacked Warren over what he said were the hidden costs of her plan for Medicare for All. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything \u2013 except this,\u201d Buttigieg said, accusing Warren\u2019s healthcare policy of having a \u201cmultitrillion-dollar hole\u201d. The Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar piled on: \u201cWe want a plan, not a pipe dream.\u201d The California senator Kamala Harris tried to get Warren to say Donald Trump should be kicked off Twitter, while former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke attacked Warren on her wealth tax proposal: \u201cSometimes I feel that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive, or pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up.\u201d But Warren appeared to handle the fire well, saying she backed policies, not punishment. \u201cI understand that this is hard,\u201d she replied on healthcare. \u201cWe are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard.\u201d A unified chorus on impeachment (almost) The debate began with a chorus call for the president\u2019s impeachment, with the candidates taking turns articulating why they thought the president had betrayed the public trust and why Democrats in Congress must forge ahead. \u201cImpeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over again without consequences,\u201d Warren said. \u201cOur Framers imagined this moment, a moment when we would have a corrupt president,\u201d said Harris. \u201cThis is one of those moments and Congress must act.\u201d Klobuchar slammed Trump for what she said was the sale of US foreign policy to the highest bidder. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make America great again, it makes Russia great again, and that\u2019s what this president has done,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cHe should be removed,\u201d said the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. The only minor note of dissent was sounded by the Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard, who is polling at less than 1% nationally: \u201cIf impeachment is driven by these hyper-partisan interests, it will only further divide us,\u201d she said. The (elderly) elephant in the room All three leading Democratic candidates \u2013 Biden, Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2013 are in their 70s, and the question of whether they are too old to take up the presidency was made explicit for the first time on Tuesday night. Warren, 71, had the sharpest answer: \u201cI say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,\u201d she said. Biden claimed his age and experience amounted to wisdom. \u201cI\u2019ve watched it, I know what the job is, I\u2019m engaged,\u201d he said. Sanders, a Vermont senator, answered a question about whether voters should be concerned about his recent heart attack by inviting everyone to \u201ca major rally that we\u2019re having in Queens\u201d. \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country,\u201d he said, and he appeared on form throughout the evening.

The OAIC typically does not comment on ongoing investigations.</p> <p>The department has blamed an increased workload for failing to update the disclosure log since 17 December last year.</p> <p>But FOI statistics show it generally has a smaller workload than most other agencies, which have kept their logs up to date much more efficiently.</p> <p>The last available statistics show the environment department is not even in the top 20 agencies for FOI requests.

Human services received 6,238 requests and its log is completely up to date.</p> <p>A department spokesperson said there had been a \u201csignificant upsurge\u201d in FOI requests and internal review requests, creating a backlog of work for its staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe department has uploaded on to its disclosure log documents released under FOI decisions made during 2018,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cHowever, the department has not been in a position to update its disclosure log for decisions made after December 2018.</p> <p>\u201cThis is as a result of a significant upsurge in the number of primary and internal review FOI requests lodged with the department, which has required the department to prioritise its FOI processing resources towards the critical task of responding to primary FOI requests.\u201d</p> <p>Experts have criticised the department\u2019s failure to meet its obligations.</p> <p>Peter Timmins, a lawyer and highly-regarded FOI expert, said it showed a broader problem with the federal government\u2019s attitude toward FOI.</p> <p>\u201cIt shows a broader problem really about the state of FOI if we have agencies that can disregard quite clear obligations to make documents released publicly available on their disclosure log,\u201d Timmins said. \u201cThe broader problem is that I think without appropriate leadership \u2013 and that really is at the highest level of government \u2013 about the importance of transparency and integrity, we see these breaches occur.\u201d</p> <p>Timmins said he had some sympathy with departments, who were expected to deal with FOI requests with ever-dwindling resources.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are quite a few agencies that are struggling to keep up with their obligations under the act, I have some sympathy for the department of environment on that front,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the law is the law.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/04/nsw-government-right-refuse-emailed-foi-requests\">Post haste: NSW government insists on 'absurd' right to refuse emailed FOI requests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In July, an anonymous individual used <a href=\"https://www.righttoknow.org.au/request/5529/response/15280/attach/3/FOI%20190717%20Notice%20of%20intention%20to%20refuse%20request.pdf\">FOI to apply for all the documents</a> the environment department had failed to upload to its disclosure log.</p> <p>The request was refused in August.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s environment department is unlawfully withholding more than 10,000 pages of freedom of information documents from the public, including internal records on Adani and the Angus Taylor grasslands affair. The department has failed to place documents on its FOI disclosure log for the past 10 months, meaning material it has released to individual applicants is not visible to the wider public. The failings, first reported by the Mandarin, are a breach of FOI law, which compels government agencies to publish documents online within 10 working days of giving them to the initial applicant. It means more than 10,000 pages have not been published on the log, including internal records on its decision to approve the controversial groundwater plan for the Adani coalmine and on Taylor\u2019s interactions with an investigation into land-clearing by a company he and his family part-owned. Guardian Australia understands the department\u2019s conduct has been the subject of an official complaint to the information watchdog, the office of the Australian information commissioner (OAIC). The OAIC typically does not comment on ongoing investigations. The department has blamed an increased workload for failing to update the disclosure log since 17 December last year. But FOI statistics show it generally has a smaller workload than most other agencies, which have kept their logs up to date much more efficiently. The last available statistics show the environment department is not even in the top 20 agencies for FOI requests. That list is topped by the home affairs and human services departments, which have managed to keep their disclosure logs relatively up to date. The environment department received 123 FOI requests in 2017-18, compared with 14,177 for home affairs. Human services received 6,238 requests and its log is completely up to date. A department spokesperson said there had been a \u201csignificant upsurge\u201d in FOI requests and internal review requests, creating a backlog of work for its staff. \u201cThe department has uploaded on to its disclosure log documents released under FOI decisions made during 2018,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cHowever, the department has not been in a position to update its disclosure log for decisions made after December 2018. \u201cThis is as a result of a significant upsurge in the number of primary and internal review FOI requests lodged with the department, which has required the department to prioritise its FOI processing resources towards the critical task of responding to primary FOI requests.\u201d Experts have criticised the department\u2019s failure to meet its obligations. Peter Timmins, a lawyer and highly-regarded FOI expert, said it showed a broader problem with the federal government\u2019s attitude toward FOI. \u201cIt shows a broader problem really about the state of FOI if we have agencies that can disregard quite clear obligations to make documents released publicly available on their disclosure log,\u201d Timmins said. \u201cThe broader problem is that I think without appropriate leadership \u2013 and that really is at the highest level of government \u2013 about the importance of transparency and integrity, we see these breaches occur.\u201d Timmins said he had some sympathy with departments, who were expected to deal with FOI requests with ever-dwindling resources. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are quite a few agencies that are struggling to keep up with their obligations under the act, I have some sympathy for the department of environment on that front,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the law is the law.\u201d In July, an anonymous individual used FOI to apply for all the documents the environment department had failed to upload to its disclosure log. The request was refused in August. The department said at the time that it expected to make the documents available on its disclosure log \u201cshortly\u201d. \u201cThe department is currently experiencing a backlog in uploading documents on to the department\u2019s disclosure,\u201d the department\u2019s acting general counsel, Kate Lalor, said at the time. \u201cThe department has taken steps to reduce the backlog and will continue to do so. It is anticipated that documents will continue to be uploaded on to the disclosure log in tranches over approximately the next month.\u201d Two months on the documents still have not appeared.",

A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the US Constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.<br></p>\n    <p>The formal process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment, the equivalent of congressional charges.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>According to arcane&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-106sdoc2/pdf/CDOC-106sdoc2.pdf\">Senate rules</a>, after the House notifies the Senate that impeachment managers have been selected, the secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, tells the House that the Senate is ready to receive the articles. Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/trump-impeachment-john-roberts-chief-justice-trial\">John Roberts</a>, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.</p>\n    <p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p>\n    <p>The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.</p>\n    <p>The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.</p>\n    <p>Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result.

      "bodyText": "Democrats continued their whirlwind investigation of Donald Trump on Tuesday as another witness testified before Congress, building momentum towards a likely impeachment of the president. Trump sought to fight back by drawing attention to a TV interview in which Hunter Biden, the son of the former vice-president Joe Biden, acknowledged \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in his business dealings in Ukraine but denied any wrongdoing. George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state, became the latest official to appear in private before three House committees. In emails supplied to Congress by the state department inspector general, Kent expressed concerns about White House efforts to remove the then ambassador to Ukraine. The impeachment inquiry is moving at dizzying speed. The Axios website noted that if everyone agrees to appear, Democrats will have interviewed 11 administration officials by the end of next week. Every witness has \u201cbolstered the case against Trump\u201d, Axios added, leaving White House officials demoralised or panicked. In a press conference on Tuesday evening, the House intelligence committee chair, Adam Schiff, said House Democrats had \u201cmade dramatic progress in answering some of the questions surrounding that July telephone call\u201d between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pelosi said the House was on a \u201cpath to truth\u201d but said a full vote to authorize the inquiry was not yet necessary, despite White House criticism. \u201cThere is no requirement that we have a vote. We will not be having a vote,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are on the path of fairness,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe are not here to call bluffs. We are on a path that is taking us to a path to truth, a timetable that respects our constitution.\u201d The hearings have been held behind closed doors but Democrats may yet decide to publish transcripts. Trump, who has been leading his own defence, tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cDemocrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings. If Republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the Fake News. Let the facts come out from the charade of people, most of whom I do not know, they are interviewing for nine hours each, not selective leaks.\u201d The torrent of damaging revelations continued on Monday when Fiona Hill, a British-born former senior director for Europe and Russia on the White House National Security Council (NSC), spoke to the House committees for 10 hours. According to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, Hill described a sharp exchange on 10 July between the then national security adviser, John Bolton, and the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland. It concerned the role played by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor commonly described as Trump\u2019s lawyer, in trying to persuade the Ukrainian government to open investigations into Democrats including Biden. Hill said Bolton instructed her to tell the NSC\u2019s attorney that Giuliani was acting in concert with White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, in a rogue operation with legal implications. \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Rudy and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton instructed Hill to tell the NSC lawyer, according to her testimony. She said Bolton had told her on an earlier occasion: \u201cGiuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d Hill also testified on Monday about Trump\u2019s decision, taken despite strenuous objections from aides including herself, to recall the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. The Washington Post reported that Hill had confronted Sondland over Giuliani\u2019s activities, which were not coordinated with officials charged with carrying out foreign policy. Sondland is due to give his version of events on Thursday. The impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower complaint filed in August that in part described a 25 July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump requested the \u201cfavor\u201d of an investigation into Biden, a potential rival in the 2020 election. Trump and Republicans have repeated unproven allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a gas company in Ukraine while his father was involved in international efforts to curb corruption in its government. Breaking his silence over his business dealings in Ukraine and China, the younger Biden told ABC News on Tuesday he had allowed himself to become involved in what he described as \u201ca swamp\u201d. But he repeatedly denied ever discussing his foreign work with his father. \u201cIn retrospect, I think there was poor judgment on my part,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I did nothing wrong at all, but it was poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is \u2026 a swamp in many ways.\u201d Several Democratic strategists have questioned the wisdom of Hunter Biden speaking out. The fear is that it might switch the focus away from Trump\u2019s efforts to enlist the help of the Ukraine government and on to the president\u2019s home ground: his unsubstantiated claims of corruption on the part of the Bidens. The week could deteriorate rapidly for Trump, whose effort to rally defenders in his own party has been damaged by concerns about a growing disaster in northern Syria, following Trump\u2019s abrupt pullback there, and a sense that major secrets attached to the Ukraine scandal are yet to emerge. Meanwhile, on Tuesday afternoon, Giuliani formally notified the House that he wouldn\u2019t submit documents demanded via subpoena by the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry. In a letter to the relevant committee chairmen from his erstwhile lawyer, Jon Sale, the inquiry was condemned as \u201can unconstitutional, baseless and illegitimate \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019\u201d and the subpoena called \u201coverbroad and unduly burdensome\u201d. The government budget office said that it would not comply with the demand for documents, either. The subpoena issued to the office of management and budget related to the delay in military funds to Ukraine. That issue is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, in relation to allegations that Trump held back congressionally approved aid to Ukraine as a form of pressure to persuade the new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate the Bidens. Giuliani is also facing scrutiny over his dealings involving Turkey. On Tuesday the Washington Post reported that he had privately urged Trump to extradite Fethullah G\u00fclen, the US-based Muslim cleric accused by Turkey of instigating a failed 2016 coup. It remains unclear why Giuliani would have pushed the issue, which is of great importance to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, according to the Post. Vivian Ho contributed reporting",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has dismissed out-of-hand a coroner\u2019s recommendation to introduce pill testing at music festivals in the state, before the official release of the findings. In a move labelled \u201cdisrespectful\u201d by the parent of one overdose victim, on Wednesday Berejiklian repeated her opposition to pill testing on the basis it would give a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d to festival-goers, and her belief that young people should simply not take drugs. \u201cWe think [pill testing] gives people a false sense of security in that, unfortunately \u2013 and our heart goes out to families who have lost loved ones under these circumstances \u2013 but unfortunately it has been found that at times it is the pure drug, it the pure MDMA, that is killing young people,\u201d she told the ABC on Wednesday. \u201cAnd we would say to young people: \u2018Do not take these drugs because you or your loved ones could suffer as a result.\u2019\u201d On Tuesday leaked recommendations from the deputy state coroner, Harriet Grahame, revealed that she would urge the state government to allow pill testing at music festivals, scrap sniffer dogs and instruct police not to punish people caught possessing drugs for personal use. She also called for police to limit the use of strip searches, and for the government to pay to establish a permanent drug-checking facility outside the festival context. The recommendations \u2013 which were not due to be published for several weeks \u2013 were leaked to the Sydney tabloid newspaper the Daily Telegraph, which has editorialised heavily against them. The coroner\u2019s inquest was held over four weeks in July and September and examined six MDMA-related deaths \u2013 of people aged between 19 and 23 \u2013 at music festivals between December 2017 and January. Julie Tam, whose 22-year-old son Joshua\u2019s death was one of the six investigated by the coroner, labelled the premier\u2019s dismissal of pill testing disrespectful, and called for her to listen to what experts were saying. \u201cYou sort of think, in many ways, it\u2019s very much a disrespect to the loss of our children,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere\u2019s not much that comes form the loss of a child, but at the very least I\u2019d like to think that it shines a light on the potential for there to be change. Obviously what\u2019s happening now is not working, and if we don\u2019t change we\u2019re going to continue to see young people fall by the way side.\u201d Tam said she was disappointed in the premier\u2019s refusal to consider the recommendations. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to think that following the amount of effort and money invested into the coronial inquest into the deaths of all of our children that the premier has basically said she\u2019s not interested,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think that\u2019s such a waste, I really do. The coroner is paid to be impartial, to gather information based on what the experts say, and for the NSW government to just say \u2018nope, we\u2019re not changing our minds\u2019 because what she\u2019s recommended might be unpalatable to them, I just struggle to find a word to describe it.\u201d He was one of six music festivals deaths investigated by the NSW coroner during a four-week inquest in July and September. Julie Tam said told Guardian Australia on Wednesday that Berejiklian has maintained her steadfast opposition to pill testing against the weight of an increasing body of experts who say it should be considered, including the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Australian Medical Association and the former Australian federal police commissioner Mick Palmer. On Tuesday the Uniting Church of NSW became the latest organisation to back pill testing, saying it would like to host a trial in the state. \u201cThe church is a strong advocate of changing our current approach by offering people who use drugs help and treatment rather than criminalising them and driving them into the shadows,\u201d said the Rev Simon Hansford, moderator of the church in NSW. \u201cPill testing can be the first opportunity someone has to talk to a health professional about drug use and its inherent risks.\u201d It comes at as the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre\u2019s latest Australian drug trends report, released on Wednesday, showed 45% of ecstasy users reported already testing their drugs using less reliable DIY kits. The inquest also heard evidence that a heavy police presence at music festivals could increase the danger of drug-related harm. Alex Ross-King, 19, died from a drug overdose at a music festival in NSW in January after taking an unusually high amount of MDMA before arriving at the venue because she was afraid of being caught with the drugs by police. Counsel assisting the coroner, Peggy Dwyer, told the inquest at the time that the practice was common among young people seeking \u201cto avoid being caught by police and charged with a criminal offence\u201d. While she said police and security often played a \u201cvital role\u201d in responding in the case of a medical emergency, the \u201cpresence and behaviours\u201d of police and security can \u201cexacerbate the risks associated with drug use\u201d. Despite that, police, backed by the state government, have resisted any attempts to limit the use of sniffer dogs or strip searches. Instead Berejiklian will attempt to reimpose a controversial festival licensing system overturned by the NSW parliament last month. \u201cOut of the 90-odd music festivals we hold across the state, for the vast majority it\u2019s business as usual. They do a great job and we encourage people to go and support those wonderful festivals,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cBut for 11 of them that are high risk, they need to have safety management plans in place; they need to have adequate medical staff, adequate security on site.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Peter Dutton has used his powers under the medevac laws to block the transfer of a refugee on security grounds, revealing as false his long-running claims that the laws rendered the government powerless to do so. On Wednesday it was revealed the home affairs minister had used his ministerial powers for the first time to override doctors\u2019 recommendations to transfer an individual. The Iranian man in question was recommended for transfer to accompany his daughter who required treatment, the Courier Mail reported. In a statement tabled in parliament, Dutton said he refused the transfer on 11 October under section 198G(2) of the Migration Act, because he reasonably believed the individual \u201cwould expose the Australian community to a serious risk of criminal conduct\u201d. \u201cThe department of home affairs has advised me that the accompanying family member has a history of violent and manipulative behaviour, including allegations of physical assault against his children, been investigated by the Nauruan police force for criminal activity, engaged in military service in Iran and that the department has been unable to verify his identity.\u201d Military service is compulsory for Iranian men. Dutton said he had instead approved the transfer of a separate family member to accompany the adult woman, and noted she also had family in Australia. Dutton and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, have repeatedly claimed the medevac laws \u2013 which the government is pushing to repeal \u2013 would bring murderers, rapists, and paedophiles to Australia and the government could not stop it happening. In June Dutton told Sky News: \u201cThe point made by the Labor party \u2013 and you heard a bit of the rhetoric in the previous interview \u2013 people of bad character can come, are able to come and, in fact, are required to come under Labor\u2019s laws that they passed. That\u2019s the reality.\u201d In February, before the bill was passed, he told Ray Hadley on 2GB: \u201cOne person has been accused of murder, out of Iran. Under the Labor party bill, or now law, we cannot stop that person from coming in.\u201d In February Morrison said: \u201cSomeone who\u2019s a paedophile, who\u2019s a rapist, who has committed murder \u2013 any of these other crimes \u2013 can just be moved on the say-so of a couple of doctors on Skype.\u201d He also said the bill \u201cdoesn\u2019t provide for the usual arrangements which would enable us to reject someone coming to Australia because they have a criminal history\u201d. The medevac laws allow for Australian-based doctors to recommend a refugee or asylum seeker offshore be transferred to Australia for care. The minister can refuse if he disagrees with the clinical assessment \u2013 in which case it goes to the independent medical panel for review \u2013 or on security or criminal grounds. The panel cannot override vetoes based on security or criminal concerns. The opposition spokeswoman on home affairs, Kristina Keneally, said Dutton\u2019s refusal was proof that medevac was working as intended. \u201cWhy did Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton claim people of bad character could be transferred to Australia under medevac when it\u2019s clear they have the powers to deny such transfers?\u201d she said. \u201cUnder medevac, the minister can refuse a transfer on security or serious character grounds and this decision does not get reviewed and cannot be overturned. In fact, before medevac, the courts were deciding medical transfers on health grounds only, not even taking into consideration security concerns.\u201d In the parliamentary inquiry into the medevac repeal bill, the department said it was the \u201climited nature of the character grounds\u201d which the minister could cite to refuse a transfer which were of concern. In answer to questions on notice, the department said \u201csecurity\u201d definitions under existing legislation \u201cset a very high bar\u201d and were \u201crelatively narrow\u201d. The definition \u201ctherefore may not coverall the national security concerns the minister may have,\u201d it said. Because of this, the minister had character or security grounds about six people recommended for six medevac transfers but was unable to refuse them. The answer did not detail what the concerns were. Labor, the Greens, key crossbenchers, and most relevant stakeholders have opposed a repeal of the laws. The Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Australian Human Rights Commission, and a former home affairs department official, Shaun Hanns, are among those opposed. Guardian Australia has previously revealed that under the previous medical transfer process \u2013 which still exists in parallel to medevac \u2013 the government ignored its own doctors\u2019 recommendations to transfer a person, for up to five years in some cases. The government was taken to federal court dozens of times to prompt a transfer, and spent more than $780,000 in 15 months responding to these cases. Some saw the department agree to transfer before proceedings commenced, while others required a court order. It was not once successful in arguing against a case, and is challenging the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear such cases. Under both systems, the government of Nauru has notoriously blocked or attempted to block transfers, or required them to go through extra levels of bureaucracy with its problematic overseas medical review panel. The government of PNG is similarly preventing the transfer of men approved for medevac but who have been jailed at the Bomana immigration detention centre as unlawful migrants.",

She could have been two miles away; it\u2019s just she was in the room next door. Our grief\u2019s been locked in for several weeks. It\u2019s not appropriate to meet her without therapists and mediators for us as a family but also for her. How can it be comfortable for her to be thrown into a situation like that without therapists and mediators?\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if they regarded the plan as a \u201cstunt\u201d, Dunn hesitated before replying: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I would think maybe they were trying to force it on to us but I still think the president was sincere at the end when he spoke to Charlotte.\u201d</p> \n<p>At first, Trump also flatly ruled out any possibility of Sacoolas returning to the UK, without giving a reason, but he signalled a possible shift later in the conversation. Dunn\u2019s parents also praised his warm and compassionate manner, noting that he held Charles\u2019s hand.</p> \n<p>Speaking outside the White House, Charles recalled: \u201cWhen we first got there, he extended his condolences to us, which did feel sincere. I don\u2019t suppose we would have expected anything else. Many of his staff also did the same on the way in.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34770887f33d0f9932e7fea5254e3a9d3b5bf615\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34770887f33d0f9932e7fea5254e3a9d3b5bf615/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles speak during a interview in Manhattan on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles speak during a interview in Manhattan on Tuesday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Mu\u00f1oz/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe then went round in circles a little bit because I think they were trying desperately to get us to not give in to accept the invitation to meet her on their terms, which we weren\u2019t willing to do.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo, upon leaving the meeting and ending the meeting, I said, \u2018If it was your 19-year-old son, or your son no matter what age, you would be doing the same as me.\u2019 And he actually grabbed hold of my hand little bit tighter and he said, \u2018Yes, I would be. Maybe we\u2019ll try and push this from a different angle.\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s that tiny little bit of hope that he will take another look and maybe work harder for us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The episode has provoked an outcry in the UK but received less attention in the US, where Trump is facing impeachment and multiple other distractions.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson has said Sacoolas should return to Britain, insisting: \u201cI do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u201d But a photograph of briefing notes held by Trump at recent event indicated that \u201cthe spouse of the US government employee will not return to the United Kingdom\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked if she felt the parents had made progress since arriving in America, Charles said: \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve got a little bit of progress. We didn\u2019t get the answers that we wanted. They couldn\u2019t tell us who made the decision to let her come back to the US. We asked how long she was there for; they still state it was three weeks; we\u2019re not totally sure about that. And I think paperwork needs to be shown to prove that somehow.\u201d</p> \n<p>But she said her son would have been \u201cproud\u201d of his parents taking his case all the way to the White House and meeting the US president. \u201cHe was always one to stand up for his rights when he knew he was in the right,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe would do everything that he could possibly do to make sure that he had that heard, anyone that he felt was being served any injustice ... he would have their back. He would be really proud and he\u2019s riding the skies up there now and pushing us on to continue to do him proud and more than anything now do his twin brother proud and his siblings.\u201d</p> \n<p>Charles and Dunn will remain in the US for a few days and still have questions for the UK\u2019s foreign office, including what date Sacoolas returned to the US and who made that decision. Charles said:<em> \u201c</em>We still want justice for Harry and we will take it as far as we possibly can to ensure that that\u2019s done.<em> </em>We do feel at this stage I think that we\u2019ve pretty much done as much as we can at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>A statement previously released on Sacoolas\u2019s behalf said she spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and again the following day and would continue to cooperate with them. It said: \u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident. No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d</p>",

Dunn\u2019s parents travelled to New York this week to urge Sacoolas to return and engage with a police investigation. They were surprised to receive an abrupt invitation to the White House in Washington on Tuesday \u2013 and even more taken aback by the offer that came without prior warning from Trump, a former reality TV host. \u201cThe bombshell was dropped soon after we walked in the room: Anne Sacoolas was in the building and was willing to meet with us,\u201d Charles told reporters after the meeting, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes. \u201cWe made it very clear that, as we\u2019ve said all along, we will meet with her and we would still love to meet with her, but it has to be on our terms and on UK soil.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe were a bit shocked but it didn\u2019t really make any difference to us, to be perfectly honest. She could have been two miles away; it\u2019s just she was in the room next door. Our grief\u2019s been locked in for several weeks. It\u2019s not appropriate to meet her without therapists and mediators for us as a family but also for her. How can it be comfortable for her to be thrown into a situation like that without therapists and mediators?\u201d Asked if they regarded the plan as a \u201cstunt\u201d, Dunn hesitated before replying: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I would think maybe they were trying to force it on to us but I still think the president was sincere at the end when he spoke to Charlotte.\u201d At first, Trump also flatly ruled out any possibility of Sacoolas returning to the UK, without giving a reason, but he signalled a possible shift later in the conversation. Dunn\u2019s parents also praised his warm and compassionate manner, noting that he held Charles\u2019s hand. Speaking outside the White House, Charles recalled: \u201cWhen we first got there, he extended his condolences to us, which did feel sincere. I don\u2019t suppose we would have expected anything else. Many of his staff also did the same on the way in. \u201cWe then went round in circles a little bit because I think they were trying desperately to get us to not give in to accept the invitation to meet her on their terms, which we weren\u2019t willing to do. \u201cSo, upon leaving the meeting and ending the meeting, I said, \u2018If it was your 19-year-old son, or your son no matter what age, you would be doing the same as me.\u2019 And he actually grabbed hold of my hand little bit tighter and he said, \u2018Yes, I would be. Maybe we\u2019ll try and push this from a different angle.\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s that tiny little bit of hope that he will take another look and maybe work harder for us.\u201d The episode has provoked an outcry in the UK but received less attention in the US, where Trump is facing impeachment and multiple other distractions. Boris Johnson has said Sacoolas should return to Britain, insisting: \u201cI do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u201d But a photograph of briefing notes held by Trump at recent event indicated that \u201cthe spouse of the US government employee will not return to the United Kingdom\u201d. Asked if she felt the parents had made progress since arriving in America, Charles said: \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve got a little bit of progress. We didn\u2019t get the answers that we wanted. They couldn\u2019t tell us who made the decision to let her come back to the US. We asked how long she was there for; they still state it was three weeks; we\u2019re not totally sure about that. And I think paperwork needs to be shown to prove that somehow.\u201d But she said her son would have been \u201cproud\u201d of his parents taking his case all the way to the White House and meeting the US president. \u201cHe was always one to stand up for his rights when he knew he was in the right,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would do everything that he could possibly do to make sure that he had that heard, anyone that he felt was being served any injustice ... he would have their back. He would be really proud and he\u2019s riding the skies up there now and pushing us on to continue to do him proud and more than anything now do his twin brother proud and his siblings.\u201d Charles and Dunn will remain in the US for a few days and still have questions for the UK\u2019s foreign office, including what date Sacoolas returned to the US and who made that decision. Charles said: \u201cWe still want justice for Harry and we will take it as far as we possibly can to ensure that that\u2019s done. We do feel at this stage I think that we\u2019ve pretty much done as much as we can at the moment.\u201d A statement previously released on Sacoolas\u2019s behalf said she spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and again the following day and would continue to cooperate with them. It said: \u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident. No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mal Meninga has led a chorus of disapproval against the Gold Coast Titans\u2019 major sponsor, after it abandoned the club, citing an \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d grand final Acknowledgment of Country speech from its captain, Ryan James, as the reason. The setback follows a disastrous season on the field for the Titans, who won only four games to finish last in the competition. James, a Bundjalung man and Indigenous All-Star, was invited to give the address before 80,000 people at this month\u2019s grand final but stumbled, forgetting his lines, before finally conceding \u201cI\u2019m lost\u201d. The crowd at ANZ Stadium responded supportively and his gaffe \u2013 which he described as \u201cthe biggest stuff-up of all time\u201d \u2013 was not seen as significant at the time. His predicament drew widespread sympathy online. But TFH, a construction and events hire company, has reportedly told the Titans its sponsorship deal was being terminated \u201ceffective immediately\u201d, citing James\u2019s speech as a major factor. TFH was a jersey sponsor of the Titans and also held naming rights for the club\u2019s training centre at Parkwood in a deal reportedly worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Fans on social media accused TFH of using James as a scapegoat, with the comedian Dave Hughes urging the company to retract its claim that his grand final lapse had anything to do with their decision. Meninga, the head of performance and culture at the Titans, told AAP it was a \u201cpretty weak excuse\u201d. \u201cThey have been great sponsors of the Titans for a long period of time. I know there are some other things in that letter sent to [the club],\u201d Meninga said. \u201cBut for that to be part of it, it\u2019s in pretty poor taste. \u201cRyan was a little embarrassed by it all, but hey we forget things,\u201d Meninga said. \u201cAs I say to everyone, you put that on a scale of the negative things that happen in your life. It doesn\u2019t even get a run to start off with.\u201d The Titans endured a bruising 2019 season, winning only four games to finish last on the ladder. Their coach, Garth Brennan, was sacked in July after having won only 12 of 40 matches during his tenure. In a letter to the Titans, as reported by News Ltd, TFH\u2019s director, Brett Thomas, said the sponsorship agreement was being terminated because of \u201cpublic comment and discussion surrounding the team\u2019s performance, the performance of the coach, and adverse discussions regarding the utilisation and selection of player talent\u201d. \u201cThe embarrassing performance of Ryan James in his speech last weekend was offensive and weighed heavily on this decision,\u201d he added. TFH has been a sponsor of the Titans since 2012, and weathered a player cocaine scandal in 2015, the sacking of two coaches, and persistently underwhelming on-field performances. The Gold Coast Titans logo remains prominent on the TFH website as part of its \u201csponsored community\u201d. Other fans were scathing of the rationale offered by TFH.",
