      "bodyText": "Thomas Markle could be called to give evidence at the high court against his estranged daughter Meghan, as part of her ongoing legal action against the Mail on Sunday, after it emerged that the paper\u2019s defence appears to rely on his account. The Duchess of Sussex is suing the newspaper for breach of copyright, invasion of privacy, and misuse of personal data after it published excerpts from a letter she sent her father complaining about how he was treating her. The Mail on Sunday filed its defence at the high court on Tuesday, arguing that the duchess and other royals \u201crely on publicity about themselves and their lives to maintain the privileged positions they hold\u201d and that she could not \u201chave a reasonable expectation of privacy that the contents of the letter were private and would remain so\u201d. They said there is a \u201chuge and legitimate public interest\u201d in the private lives of the royals and would defend the case, which comes as the royal family struggles with the question of how to disentangle Prince Harry and his wife from public life. Among the evidence disclosed in the court papers are highly personal text messages between Thomas Markle and his daughter in the run-up to her wedding in May 2018. The Mail on Sunday\u2019s defence dismissed the copyright claim by arguing the letter was not an original literary work, while suggesting that Meghan allowed her friends to brief the American celebrity magazine People on her behalf in February 2019. Among the claims made by People was that the Duchess had sent her father a \u201cloving\u201d letter six months earlier. In response the Mail on Sunday has argued that Thomas Markle had the right to publicly defend himself and exercise his right to freedom of speech by making the letter public and giving an interview to defend himself against the briefing in People. They say he only decided to release the letter after being hurt by how it was characterised and claim that Meghan expected it to be made public. \u201cThomas Markle had a weighty right to tell his version of what had happened between himself and his daughter including the contents of the letter. She did not suggest that they try to repair their relationship. \u201cExcept for the receipt of the letter, Mr Markle had not heard from his daughter since he wrote to tell her he was too ill to attend her wedding, nor has he ever been introduced to or met Prince Harry or their son, his grandson,\u201d the court documents said. The Mail on Sunday also suggested that if the case headed to court it would request copies of any private messages sent by Meghan to her friends in which she authorises them to speak to the media on her behalf, potentially prompting further embarrassment. Meghan\u2019s legal team at the reputation management specialists Schillings have already confirmed that she kept a copy of the letter after writing it in hand, before sending it to her Los Angeles representatives to pass to her father. The royal has pledged to give any damages from the case to charity. Prince Harry is separately suing the publishers of the Sun and the Mirror over allegations of historic phone hacking.",

The US assassination of Iran\u2019s most powerful general, Qassem Suleimani, was met last week with missile strikes on US bases in Iraq. Iran faces internal pressure too: mass anti-government protests have erupted in the capital after the Revolutionary Guards, on high alert for US retaliation, \u201caccidentally\u201d shot down a passenger plane killing 176 people. Australia has sent HMAS Toowoomba to the Middle East as a contribution to the US-led coalition protecting oil tankers traversing the Strait of Hormuz. Iran also wants to force western forces from neighbouring Iraq \u2013 over which it seeks to impose greater influence \u2013 and Australia\u2019s continued commitment to the US coalition there is a further complication in the relationship. Australia has fewer levers of influence to pull with Tehran. The Iranian citizen Negar Ghodskani, held in an Adelaide prison for two years on allegations of sanctions busting while she fought extradition to the US, was ultimately sent to America where a judge sentenced her to time served and ordered her released. Ghodskani has since returned to Iran. Two other Australians \u2013 the travel bloggers Jolie King and Mark Firkin \u2013 held for allegedly flying a drone near a military base in Tehran were released in October reportedly as part of an informal \u201cprisoner swap\u201d for the Iranian doctoral student Reza Dehbashi Kivi, who was imprisoned in Brisbane for more than a year pending extradition to the US over allegations he exported American radar equipment for detecting stealth planes or missiles to Iran.",

Refusing a freedom of information request for written briefings that informed the government\u2019s allocation of grants in the lead-up to the May election, the department claimed a range of exemptions, despite agreeing that disclosure would allow \u201csome oversight of public expenditure\u201d. The government has come under fire for its management of the regional jobs and investment packages (RJIP) program, after the auditor general tabled a scathing report on Melbourne Cup day that found ministers had knocked back almost 30% of recommended projects and supported 17% of those not recommended. The refusal to release documents, in response to a freedom of information request from Guardian Australia, states that advice was also sought from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet about the release, with Scott Morrison\u2019s department advising that the documents would reveal cabinet decisions. The department said the documents contained \u201copinion and advice\u201d prepared for the minister as well as assessment and scoring methodology associated with the RJIP funding package. \u201cThis information is considered to be deliberative in nature. If this information were released it could reasonably be expected to provide insight into the deliberations of the department. \u201cIn particular, the briefs contain details on the methodology used by the the department regarding how it assesses, scores and ranks applications under the RJIP package. \u201cI am of the view that this information should not be released as it would provide insight into how this package, as well as potential future funding programmes, are assessed within the department.\u201d One of the criticisms of the government\u2019s management of the program is that the ministerial panel ignored the department\u2019s ranking of projects when it awarded the funds. In one instance the top eight projects recommended for funding in the Wide Bay-Burnett region, based on the department\u2019s merit-based scoring system, were knocked back for funding, while two known political donors to the Liberal National party with a lower score were successful. The authorised freedom of information officer who made the decision to reject the FOI request was Donna Wieland, the department\u2019s general manager of regional programs, who also provided advice to the infrastructure minister, Michael McCormack, about how to avoid providing documents in response to a Senate order. The refusal also claimed that the privacy and business affairs of applicants were also grounds for refusing release of the documents. \u201cI consider that releasing information relating to RJIP applicants could reasonably be expected to result in applicants being hesitant to provide information to the department in future, if these documents were to be disclosed routinely through the FOI process,\u201d the rejection letter says. Guardian Australia has reported on a range of projects that have raised questions about the rigour of the RJIP application process, including a project on the New South Wales south coast that attempted to raise money for an aquaculture farm through a fish-based cryptocurrency. A camper trailer company in the same region won a grant while it was possibly trading insolvent, while in Queensland a company that received a grant for a ferry project is losing money and the project is unlikely to happen for two more years. In another case a former Nationals candidate secured a $300,000 grant under the scheme. Labor\u2019s shadow regional development minister, Catherine King, criticised the failure to release the documents as an example of the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, \u201ctreating the people of Australia with absolute contempt\u201d. \u201cAgain the government is hiding critical documents from the Australian public which relate to the expenditure $220 million of taxpayer funds,\u201d she said. \u201cFOI rules are in place to allow for proper scrutiny of government decisions, but here we see the government using them to hide information from the Australian community.\u201d The government is bracing for another auditor general report into the Community Sport Infrastructure grants program, which saw applications recommended by Sport Australia rejected by the Nationals deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, when she was sports minister.",

It suddenly opened up a whole new way of looking at that period.\u201d One of the people standing with me outside the Mintaro during filming is the film\u2019s writer, Shaun Grant. He has worked with Kurzel before \u2013 penning their acclaimed 2011 debut Snowtown \u2013 and reiterates that push for originality, or even extremity: \u201cPeter [Carey] took it so far,\u201d he says, \u201cand Justin and I decided to take it a step further.\u201d Grant continues: \u201cYou know that history aficionados will say \u2018that didn\u2019t happen!\u2019 But you can\u2019t please everyone. And who really knows what happened back then? I\u2019m all for messing with it and playing with it. There is always room for new stories about familiar legends. You just need to find a clear point of view.\u201d That point of view involves a move away from realism into a meta space. References to legend, myth-making and the idea of fulfilling or escaping destiny are strewn throughout True History of the Kelly Gang (a title which, as is the case with Carey\u2019s book, is ironic). Ned\u2019s mother Ellen (Essie Davis), for instance, compels her son with lines such as \u201cbe who you are meant to be!\u201d. There are occasions when Ned feels incentivised to take control of his personal narrative: \u201cEvery man should be an author of his own history,\u201d he decrees. But there are also times when he seems resigned to the idea of never controlling how he will be remembered, on one occasion glumly noting that \u201ca myth is more profitable than a man\u201d. Cast members articulate the film\u2019s approach to these self-conscious elements in different ways. Davis, for instance, tells me the story is \u201call about curses\u201d and \u201ctrying not to become what you are cornered into becoming\u201d. \u201cThere is of course a difference between the life of Ned Kelly and the legend, the story everybody wants,\u201d Kurzel says. \u201cHe became bigger than what he was. We somehow found a way to use him to create an identity for what we are, and what we are not.\u201d For MacKay, who plays old buckethead himself \u2013 without (gasp!) a beard \u2013 embracing the legend involved forgetting about Ned Kelly\u2019s status as one of Australia\u2019s most iconic, larger-than-life historical figures. \u201cA legend is what other people made of him,\u201d says MacKay. \u201cHe probably wasn\u2019t a legend in his own time, so I play him as a guy who just happens to be called Ned Kelly. A bloke whose actions became \u2013 and stood for \u2013 something else. A man who became, in the end, a fridge magnet.\u201d \u2022 True History of the Kelly Gang is in Australian cinemas now and will be available to stream on Stan on 26 January. It is released in UK cinemas on 28 February",

      "bodyText": "David Hytner was at White Hart Lane to see Tottenham dominate their opponents from the Championship, even if they were forced to survive a late scare. The fourth round draw Watford or Tranmere Rovers v Wolves or Man United Hull City v Chelsea Southampton v Tottenham Hotspur Queens Park Rangers v Sheffield Wednesday Bournemouth v Arsenal Northampton Town v Derby County Brentford v Leicester City Millwall v Sheffield United Reading v Cardiff City or Carlisle United West Ham United v West Bromwich Albion Burnley v Norwich City Coventry City v Birmingham City Manchester City v Fulham Newcastle United v Oxford United Portsmouth v Barnsley Shrewsbury Town v Liverpool Japhet Tanganga has been speaking to BBC Sport and he seems like a nice young man. \u201cWe had chances to kill the game but obviously you\u2019re not always going to score but we had to defend well,\u201d said TOttenham\u2019s man of the match. \u201cIt was a sloppy goal we shouldn\u2019t have conceded it. We made it hard for ourselves.\u201d On first couple of appearances in Tottenham\u2019s first team, he had this to say: \u201cI\u2019m just grateful that the gaffer is trusting me, the club for giving me the opportunity and my team-mates for trusting me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m ready for whenever the manager picks me. I\u2019m loving it, the opportunity to play in this stadium and in front of these fans.\u201d Elsewhere in the FA Cup: Blackpool entertained Reading but went down 2-0 at Bloomfield Road. Coventry City from League One scored three without reply in an emphatic win over Bristol Rovers. Newcastle United beat Rochdale 4-1 in a match I thought might end in an upset, while Shrewsbury Town pulled off the upset of the night, with the League One side beating Bristol City from the division above. Southampton are next up for Tottenham. Jose and the troops will have to travel to St Mary\u2019s for the fourth round, where they ought to face a stern test from the rejuvenated Saints. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It\u2019s all over at White Hart Lane, where Tottenham have beaten Middlesbrough by the odd goal of three. Giovanni Lo Celso and Erik Lamela got the goals for Jose Mourinho\u2019s side during a dominant first-half display, but George Saville\u2019s late effort proved little more than a consolation despite a much improved performance from the visitors in the second half. 90+2 min: An Ashley Fletcher downward header doesn\u2019t threaten the Tottenham goal, but narrowly evades the lunge of Rudy Gestede, who was trying to poke it past Gestede. 90+1 min: Japhet Tanganga, tonight\u2019s man of the match, canters elegantly down the right touchline and sends the ball arcing across the face of goal. At near post and far post respectively, Lamela and Son stretch every sinew but are unable to divert the ball goalwards. 90 min: Some of Boro\u2019s players look absolutely dead on their feet as they go in search of an equaliser. Spurs continue to dominate as the stadium announcer announces a minimum of three minutes of added time. 89 min: Moments after blazing a free-kick over the bar in what could conceivably be his final game for Tottenham, Christian Eriksen tries to play in Son. Boro clear their lines. 87 min: There\u2019s only the kick of a ball in this game with five minutes to go, which seems remarkable, considering Tottenham should have been out of sight at half-time. Adam Clayton receives treatment for cramp but is forced to carry on, as Middlesbrough have used all their substitutes. 85 min: That was excellent from Saville, who controlled a ball from deep, made room for a shot and then drove his right-footed effort into the corner. Tottenham substitution: Eric Dier off ... and he doesn\u2019t look one bit happy about it. Dele Alli replaces him. Boro pull one back! It\u2019s a splendid finish from George Saville, who shoots low, hard and with pinpoint accuracy into the bottom left-hand corner from distance, beating Gazzaniga who was at full stretch. 82 min: Having looked in real danger of shipping a hiding on the strength of their first half performance, Middlesbrough have upped their game considerably in the second 45 minutes. 79 min: A low diagonal drive through the Boro penalty area from Eriksen somehow avoids four or five players from both teams and threatens to sneak in at the far post. Tomas Mejias, his view impeded, sees it very late and does exceptionally well to keep the ball out. 78 min: Gazzaniga claims the inswinger from the corner and sends Lo Celso upfield on the counter-attack. It ends with Son winning a corner for Spurs and he goes close with a near post header from the set-piece. 76 min: Saville shoots narrowly wide from distance after being teed up by a good pull-back from his fellow substitute Tavernier. His effort actually took a touch off a defender and Middlesbrough have another corner. Before it\u2019s taken, Jonathan Woodgate sends on Rudy Gestede for Lukas Nmecha. 74 min: Middlesbrough substitution: Djed Spence, who\u2019s been one of Borro\u2019s more impressive players tonight goes off. He\u2019s replaced by Marcus Tavernier, who is the brother of Rangers skipper James. 73 min: Now Tottenham have a corner. The ball\u2019s floated in to the box, only to be headed out over the touchline by Spence for a Tottenham throw-in. 72 min: Boro win a corner and the ball\u2019s sent into the mixer. Lukas Nmecha wins the header under pressure from Davinson Sanchez, but can\u2019t get high enough over the ball to steer it on target. 70 min: Another probing run into the Boro penalty area from the industrious Son, but he loses his footing under pressure from Paddy McNair and the ball runs out of play for a goal-kick. 68 min: Lamela picks out Eriksen with a neat pass into the Middlesbrough box. With his back to goal, the midfielder is unable to turn and get off a shot and Middlesbrough intercept his pass towards Son. 67 min: Son wins a corner off Adam Clayton as he tries to take on the U2 bass player with a darting run into the Middlesbrough box. Nothing comes of it. 65 min: In his own penalty area, Eric Dier leaps to head a free-kick floated in from deep out for a corner. It\u2019s curled towards the far post, but Vertonghen clears with a meaty header and sends Tottenham upfield on the counter-attack. Boro get bodies back quickly to put a stop to their gallop. 64 min: Djed Spence picks up the ball on the right wing and sends a cross towards the far post. The ball sails out of play and wide. Moments previously Paulo Gazziniga was quick off his line to deny Lukas Nmecha down by right byline. 63 min: Son gets on the ball near the halfway line, but immediately gives it away to Adam Clayton. 61 min: Tottenham substitution: Heung-min Son replaces Lucas Moura. 59 min: Tomas Mejias almost puts his team in trouble again, making a bit of a mess of a pass to Djed Spence. The defender does well to clear his lines under pressure, sparing his goalkeeper\u2019s blushes in the process. 58 min: Boro substitution: Ben Liddle, whose father Craig used to play for Middlesbrough and is now involved with their academy, makes way for Norn Iron international George Saville. 56 min: Lucas Moura tries to pick out Eriksen with a cross from the right into the Middlesbrough penalty area. Adam Claytpon intercepts with a well-timed leap and when the ball eventually finds its way back to Moura, he blazes over from distance. 54 min: With a free-kick in a good position just outside the Tottenham penalty area, Lewis Wing brings a decent save out of Gazzaniga, who tips the low drive around his post. Middlesbrough have their second corner of the game, but nothing comes of it. Better, from Middlesbrough. Much better. 51 min: An awful miss from Ryan Sessegnon, who somehow fires over with the goal gaping after getting on the end of a cross whipped across the edge of the six-yard box by Tanganga. He was offside, which may come as a relief when he views that one later. Good work down the right from Tanganga, mind. His cross was inch perfect, even if Sessegnon\u2019s positioning was not. 50 min: Ryan Sessegnon fouls Djed Spence out by the right touchline, giving Middlesbrough a free-kick in a good position. Marvin Johnson swings the ball into the penalty area, but Tottenham clear. 49 min: Jan Vertonghen and Ashley Fletcher clash heads, prompting referee Craig Pawson to stop play and enquire after their welfare. They both seem OK. 47 min: Since making the mistake that led to Tottenham\u2019s opening goal, Middlesbrough goalkeeper Tomas Mejias has been kicking almost all of his clearances long, but an awful lot of them have been going straight to Tottenham players. The latest lands at the feet of Japhet Tanganga, who sets up another Spurs attack which ultimately comes to nothing. 46 min: Middlesbrough get the ball rolling in this second half, with no changes in personnel on either side. They\u2019ve a two-goal deficit to overhaul and will need to play an awful lot better than they did in the opening 45 minutes if they are to have any chance of doing so. It\u2019s been a stroll in the park for Tottenham, who lead courtesy of goals from Giovani Lo Celso and Erik Lamela. Middlesbrough improved a bit as the half went on but have been second best by a distance. 45 min: Lucas Moura sends a cross into the Middlesbrough box from deep and Erik Lamela takes it on his chest. Stuck to him like glue, Djed Spence scrambles the ball clear. 44 min: Boro win a free-kick down near the corner. The ball\u2019s stood up at the far post and Ashley Fletcher leaps highest, but steers his firm header wide. 42 min: In what has arguably their best passage of play, Middlesbrough finally string a few passes together across midfield and end up winning a throw-in on the edge of the final third. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s a start. They\u2019ve had 25% of possession in this first half so far. 40 min: Middlesbrough win a throw-in deep in Tottenham territory, but within seconds Spurs are on the counter-attack with Lucaqs Moura galloping up the field with the ball at his feet. With Christian Eriksen up in support and unmarked, Moura opts to go it alone but pulls his shot from the edge of the penalty area a few inches wide of the left upright. 36 min: Teed up by Jonny Howson after a great jinking run by the defender, Paddy McNair blazes a decent shooting opportunity high over the bar, prompting sarcastic cheers and whistles from the Spurs fans congregated behind it. Had he scored, his effort would almost certainly have been ruled out for offside. 34 min: Lucas Moura does well to scorch up the right touchline and keep the ball in play before it can go out for a throw-in and whips it across the Middlesbrough penalty area trying to pick out Eriksen, who is screaming for the pass. His delivery manages to evade both the Dane and Erik Lamela and another good chance goes to waste. 33 min: Eriksen shoots under the defensive wall, which to a man jumps obligingly. There\u2019s not much welly on his effort, however, a state of affairs which allows Boro goalkeeper Mejias to get down to his right to save comfortably. 32 min: Lewis Wing brings down Christian Eriksen just outside the Boro penalty area as the Tottenham midfielder broke from midfield. Free-kick for Tottenham in a wonderful position, just to the right of the D. 29 min: Lo Celso collides with Marvin Johnson as he tries to make room for another shot in the Tottenham penalty area and goes to ground theatrically, holding his face. There\u2019s a VAR check to see if Spurs should get a penalty, but no spot-kick is forthcoming. 28 min: Japhet Tanganga makes an overlapping gallop down the inside right and has the ball played into his path by Giovani Lo Celso. On only his second start for Tottenham, he threatens to open his goalscoring account, but his low diagonal drive goes agonisingly wide of the far post. Jonathan Woodgate needs to do something, fast, or his team are going to get slaughtered tonight. 26 min: It\u2019s all too easy for Tottenham, who are two goals to the good and in complete control. Ryan Sessegnon cuts in from the left, beats Paddy McNair for speed and shoots diagonally towards the bottom right-hand corner from 20 yards out. Tomas Mejias gets down to get a touch and ensure the ball goes out for a corner. Nothing comes from the set piece. 23 min: Moura dinks the ball into the path of Winks with a neat pass as the Englishman gallops through midfield. It\u2019s another promising move for Tottenham, but they fail to add to their lead. 22 min: Erik Lamela almost adds his second and Tottenham\u2019s third, spinning to shoot from the edge of the Boro penalty area after picking up a pass from Lo Celso, only to see his effort fizz over the bar. 21 min: Tottenham continue to turn the screw against a Middlesbrough team that have offered little. No sooner than I type that, however, than Davinson Sanchez almost gifts them an opening by misjudging the flight of a long ball and missing his header, but Ashley Fletcher is unable to capitalise. 20 min: Dier seems to have recovered from what looked a painful knock. Middlesbrough win a free-kick near halfway, which Dael Fry boots long. Erik Lamela wins the defensive header. 17 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Eric Dier receives treatment after landing awkwardly and hurting his back. Erik Lamela doubles Tottenham\u2019s lead. He slides the ball past Mejias into the bottom left-hand corner after a piercing run past three players into the Middlesbrough box. Atrocious defending from the visitors, who practically ushered him through. 12 min: Close!!! Gazzaniga gets down quickly to save smartly from Nmecha as, unmarked in the Spurs penalty area, the Middlesbrough striker is played in by Ben Liddle and shoots for the bottom corner. 10 min: Not realising his goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga has charged off his line and come to the edge of his area, Davinson Sanchez heads a long ball aimed towards Lukas Nmecha back towards his own goal. Luckily for him, Gazzaniga is directly behind him and the ball goes straight into his hands. That could have been a comical own goal. 8 min: Another ball into the Middlesbrough box and this time Mejias does hoof it clear unceremoniously. 6 min: It\u2019s all Spurs at the moment, with Middlesbrough apparently happy to sit back and try to soak up the pressure. They\u2019ve made life exceptionally difficult in these early stages, however, with Mejias trying to play the ball out from the back when he would have been better served lumping it forward. 3 min: Under pressure and attempting to play the ball out from the back, Mejias plays the ball to Lo Celso on the edge of the penalty area instead. The Tottenham midfielder skips across the face of the penalty to make room for a shot and expertly fires the ball into the bottom left-hand corner. An early rick from Boro goalkeeper Tomas Mejias gifts an early goal to Tottenham. 2 min: There\u2019s early pressure as Jonny Howson is forced into an early clearance, with both sides lining up playing with three at the back. 1 min: Tottenham kick-off, their players wearing their usual home kit of white shirts, navy shorts and white socks. The players of Middlesbrough wear red shirts, white shorts and red socks. Not long now: The pre-match light show is under way and the two teams are making their way out on to the pitch in the well appointed surroundings of White Hart Lane. It\u2019s a dirty night in north London, but 4,000 Middlesbrough fans are in attendance despite the unpleasant weather. Kick-off is less than two minutes away ... In the event of a draw tonight: There will be extra time and then penalties if required. While extra time has been scrapped in the Carabao Cup and the EFL Trophy, it is still played in the FA Cup. Replays have, however, been scrapped from the fifth round stage. Tottenham: Gazzaniga, Tanganga, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Sessegnon, Dier, Winks, Lo Celso, Eriksen, Lamela, Lucas Subs: Vorm, Foyth, Cirkin, Aurier, Skipp, Alli, Son Middlesbrough: Mejias, Spence, Howson, McNair, Fry, Johnson, Clayton, Liddle, Wing, Nmecha, Fletcher Subs: Brynn, Wood, Saville, Malley, Tavernier, Roberts, Gestede Some team news: Tottenham make five changes to their side for tonight\u2019s game. Jan Vertonghen, Eric Dier, Erik Lamela, Ryan Sessegnon and Giovani Lo Celso all come in, with Son Heung-min and Dele Alli on the bench. Troy Parrott doesn\u2019t feature in the match-day squad. Boro also make five changes, with Ben Liddle handed his first senior start, as Southampton await the winner in round four. Speaking of Robbie: Here\u2019s an interesting interview he did after being appointed to the coaching staff at Boro last summer. A sort of homecoming: Middlesbrough manager and his assistant Robbie Keane return to their old stomping ground (albeit a stomping ground that hadn\u2019t been built during their time at Spurs) tonight. Tottenham youngster Clarke off to QPR: \u201cJack Clarke is putting the finishing touches to a loan move to Queens Park Rangers for the remainder of the season,\u201d writes David Hytner. Read on ... Transfer window: Catch up on all the latest deals and club-by-club guides for the top divisions in England, Spain, Italy, France and Germany. Early team news With Harry Kane, Moussa Sissoko, Ben Davies, Tanguy Ndombele and Hugo Lloris unavailable due to injury, Jose Mourinho said that only Toby Alderweireld was guaranteed a rest tonight. Despite recent complaints that he doesn\u2019t have a centre-forward to fill in for Kane, the Portuguese manager elected not to include Irish teenager Troy Parrott in his squad for Saturday night\u2019s defeat at the hands of Liverpool. It will be interesting to see if the highly regarded 17-year-old centre-forward gets a run-out tonight. Middlesbrough boss Jonathan Woodgate has had to plan for this game without the services of Ryan Shotton, George Friend, Britt Assombalonga, Daniel Ayala and Anfernee DIjksteel, who are all keeping Boro\u2019s medical staff busy. Despite ongoing talk linking him with a return to West Ham, goalkeeper Darren Randolph has travelled with the squad but is unlikely to play. White Hart Lane is the venue for tonight\u2019s match between Tottenham Hotspur and Middlesbrough, who played out a 1-1 draw at the Riverside Stadium a week ago on Sunday. Ashley Fletcher gave Middlesbrough an early second half lead on that occasion, only for Lucas Moura to restore parity within six minutes. Kick-off tonight is at 8.05pm, but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime.",

      "bodyText": "Environmental authorities have warned much of Victoria is set for another smoky day on Wednesday, but conditions are expected to improve with rain forecast for large parts of the state by the afternoon. The forecast comes after small group of residents still in a town cut off by bushfire were forced to shelter on the beach after a blaze in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland flared. Only about 12 people remain at Tamboon and most of them sought protection by the water overnight, the State Control Centre said on Wednesday. An emergency warning remained in place for the fire, but authorities were maintaining contact with the group and a Victoria police boat was available to get the residents if they needed to leave. The Environmental Protection Agency in Victoria issued a hazardous air quality alert for much of the state until at least 5pm. \u201cWhen you reach the hazardous air quality range anyone can develop symptoms,\u201d chief health officer Brett Sutton said on Tuesday. \u201cThere can be eye, nose and throat irritation, people can have a cough develop or worse, or even wheeze.\u201d At hazardous level people are advised to stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed. The Bureau of Meteorology stated there was a 80% chance of rainfall and a possible thunderstorm in Melbourne during the afternoon and evening with up to 15mm of rain. The rain would help disperse the smoke and would result in an improved air quality rating. The seven-day forecast predicts several days of rain for the state and cooler temperatures with maximums in the low 20s. As the smoky haze hung over the city, Victorian authorities named a man who died while fighting a fire in the East Gippsland region. David Moresi was constructing control lines to stop a fire in the East Gippsland region from spreading when he was ejected from his vehicle during a rollover, officials said at a press conference. The 69-year-old, who was working for Forest Fire Management Victoria, was killed in the accident on 30 November. He was named by authorities on Wednesday, following his funeral. \u201cOur thoughts and condolences go to David\u2019s widow, Judy, and family, given this tragic set of circumstances,\u201d said Victoria\u2019s emergency services commissioner, Andrew Crisp. On Tuesday, Victorians were breathing the worst air quality in the world due to the smoke that had blanketed the state from the bushfires in Victoria\u2019s east and from New South Wales. A number of sporting events and venues were shut for the day, and Slovenian tennis player Dalia Jakupovic was forced to abandon her Australian Open qualifying match at Melbourne Park due to a coughing fit while playing in the smoke. Tennis Australia delayed the start of the qualifiers on Wednesday by three hours, and has said it would consult with environmental authorities in making future decisions on whether it is safe for players to compete while the smoke still lingers in Victoria. The first matches on court on Wednesday won\u2019t be until at least 1pm, and practice has been suspended until 11am. Climate and Health Alliance executive director Fiona Armstrong called on governments to consider issuing text message alerts for air pollution. \u201cGovernments should also issue advice to councils, schools, childcare centres and workplaces with high numbers of outdoor workers so they are aware of their responsibilities to the people under their care or employment,\u201d she said. The federal government distributed 450,000 P2 face masks to the Victorian government earlier this month for high-risk members of the public, and Armstrong called for the program to be expanded to everyone in smoke-affected areas. The rain was not expected to provide much relief for firefighters in the state\u2019s north-east and east, with less than 5mm of rain predicted for those areas. The fire in Tamboon was the only one in Victoria\u2019s fire-ravaged East Gippsland and north-east, as milder conditions provided a slight reprieve for fire crews to get on top of containment lines. On Wednesday there were 17 fires still going in Victoria and more than 1.4 million hectares burnt. There were 1,500 firefighters battling the blazes, including 130 from overseas and another 140 international personnel will arrive later in January.",

      "bodyText": "Steve Bruce\u2019s only real concern now must be that Mike Ashley may decide he does not need any expensive new players after all. Newcastle United\u2019s owner attended his first home match of the season before a transfer summit with his manager and watched Bruce\u2019s previously shot-shy side not only score freely but monopolise possession to an almost unprecedented degree. Delighted as he seemed to hear home fans chant his name within Ashley\u2019s earshot, the manager\u2019s worry will be that this walk in the park against Brian Barry-Murphy\u2019s third-tier visitors may have made his pitch to the retail tycoon significantly harder. If so, that would be a shame. It is all very well having an FA Cup fourth-round home tie with Oxford to look forward to \u2013 not to mention a potential appearance in the fifth round for the first time since 2006 \u2013 but Newcastle\u2019s Premier League status is still far from secure and they could do with reinforcement at centre-forward, in central midfield and on the wing. Here, though, an own goal, followed by three more from Miguel Almir\u00f3n, Matty Longstaff and Joelinton \u2013 the last a collector\u2019s item \u2013 made everything look easy. It was Joelinton\u2019s first goal since August and the \u00a340m Brazilian striker was relief personified as he raced to embrace Bruce. \u201cI was worried sick he was going to jump on me and do my knee in,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cBut watching Joelinton score was the best part of the night for me. The kid\u2019s got a big burden to carry but he\u2019s got a big heart.\u201d All the pre-match attention had concentrated on 40-year-old Aaron Wilbraham \u2013 or Wilbrahimovic, as he prefers to be known \u2013 but Rochdale\u2019s centre-forward barely got a touch against a three-man defence marshalled by the newly fit Jamaal Lascelles. As Newcastle swiftly cantered into a three-goal first-half lead the danger of Wilbraham being given the cold shoulder by Steve Bruce\u2019s daughter Amy, who recently oversaw the interior design of an extension to the striker\u2019s house in Cheshire, receded. The League One strugglers may have conjured the first chance but soon after Jimmy Keohane\u2019s deceptive, swerving shot from outside the area zoomed narrowly wide of Karl Darlow\u2019s goal, Newcastle were ahead. Although Eoghan O\u2019Connell beat Joelinton to Matt Ritchie\u2019s inviting cross, the central defender merely succeeded in diverting the ball into his own net. Ritchie was starting his first game since sustaining a serious ankle injury in August and, eager to make up for lost time, the left wing-back quickly created a second goal. Once again it came from a stellar cross and involved Matty Longstaff taking a steadying touch before swivelling superbly and lashing a shot beyond Robert S\u00e1nchez. Poor S\u00e1nchez would soon pay for a subsequent decision to take a short goal-kick. After a failed attempt to build patiently from the back ended up exposing Luke Matheson, the visiting 17-year-old right-back, to intense pressure, the ball ended up back at the keeper\u2019s feet. S\u00e1nchez endeavoured to play it out again but, instead, found Almir\u00f3n. Retaining commendable poise the suddenly prolific Paraguayan used his left foot to register a fourth goal in seven games. If Bruce was gratified to be serenaded by an appreciative Gallowgate End apparently no longer pining for Rafael Ben\u00edtez, he must have been even happier to witness something even more unusual \u2013 his team retaining possession for protracted periods. As he almost shyly obliged requests to \u201cgive us a wave, Brucie\u201d, Newcastle\u2019s manager was able to admire the sight of his players constructing geometrically precise passing triangles of the sort notable by their absence in the Premier League this season. Although the home side became a little careless in the second half, handing Rochdale the odd half-chance, the academy graduate Tom Allan, 20, stepped off the bench to enjoy an impressive Newcastle debut at right wing-back. He combined with his fellow substitute Andy Carroll, who later hit the bar, to cue up Joelinton.

This was a specimen of <em>Rafflesia tuan-mudae</em> and beat the previous largest flower record of 107cm for <em>Rafflesia arnoldii</em>, also in Sumatra.</p> <p>Rafflesia is not only a giant flower, but it has no leaves, stems or proper roots. It cannot photosynthesise and instead sucks the food and water out of a particular vine using long thin filaments that look like fungal cells.

This was a specimen of Rafflesia tuan-mudae and beat the previous largest flower record of 107cm for Rafflesia arnoldii, also in Sumatra. Rafflesia is not only a giant flower, but it has no leaves, stems or proper roots. It cannot photosynthesise and instead sucks the food and water out of a particular vine using long thin filaments that look like fungal cells. It gorges itself on the vine for a few years before bursting out into a flower bud, swells for several months before blooming into a flower that looks like a bright red bucket with big thick lobes. It gives off a whiff of rotting meat that, together with its gigantic size, helps attract pollinating flies.

It\u2019s got an exciting director, a promising trailer and \u2013 if it adheres to the good/bad/good/bad pattern of James Bond films that began all the way back with Goldeneye \u2013 it might mean that Daniel Craig goes out on a high. And now there\u2019s another potential plus in its favour: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/14/james-bond-billie-eilish-to-provide-no-time-to-die-theme\">Billie Eilish is doing the theme tune</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/14/james-bond-billie-eilish-to-provide-no-time-to-die-theme\">James Bond: Billie Eilish to provide No Time to Die theme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s especially exciting about this news is that, compared with the last couple of insipid \u2013 though admittedly Oscar-winning \u2013 efforts, Billie Eilish is refreshing. She\u2019s young. She\u2019s authentic. She has a signature sound that doesn\u2019t automatically align with the overwrought warbling of, say, Sam Smith. The history of the James Bond franchise contains a smattering of fantastic outliers \u2013 Live and Let Die, A View to a Kill, We Have All the Time in the World \u2013 that have flourished precisely because they haven\u2019t hewed to the ossified blueprint of what constitutes a Bond theme. If this song is as good as the director and producer are promising, then we could really have something special on our hands.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIhNsAtPbPI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BIhNsAtPbPI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Better yet, a title like No Time to Die is a songwriter\u2019s dream, in that lots of things rhyme with the word \u201cdie\u201d. Daniel Craig\u2019s Bond tenure has been littered with some truly abysmal titles that were no use to the musical art whatsoever. No wonder so many of them had their performers squirming around loopholes. Nothing rhymes with \u201cCasino Royale\u201d, so Chris Cornell sang a song called You Know My Name. Sam Smith, knowing that any song entitled Spectre would have had to at some point use the word \u201chectare\u201d, chickened out and sang Writing\u2019s on the Wall instead. Faced with the abomination that was Quantum of Solace, Jack White just made up his own Bond title with Another Way to Die. Only Adele took on the mantle of writing a song named after the actual film, and even she screwed it up by rhyming \u201csky fall\u201d with \u201ccrumble\u201d. So this is a golden opportunity for Eilish. No Time to Die is an open goal of a title, and she has the chops to really make it work.</p> <p>However, let\u2019s not get carried away here. This is James Bond we\u2019re talking about, so we should never underestimate the franchise\u2019s tendency to bungle a sitter. Because, yes, Billie Eilish is authentic and unique and unwilling to turn in a traditional theme. But that doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019ll be any good. Remember when they got Madonna in to jazz up the Bond theme as a genre? Remember how horrible that was? Remember how Die Another Day sounded like a bad song being fed through a worse Bluetooth connection? Or remember how bad Another Way to Die was, with White almost rapping his verses and then Alicia Keys using the chorus to make a noise like she\u2019d just found a dead snake in her bed? Remember Sheryl Crow? Of course you don\u2019t.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DyDfgMOUjCI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And that\u2019s the danger with No Time to Die. James Bond is such a creaky old antique of a franchise that change has to come slowly. A nudge here. A bottle of Heineken there. Altering the direction of the Bond films is like piloting a cruise ship. Every change of course has to be slow and incremental. Do a handbrake turn and you\u2019ll kill everyone. Eilish\u2019s minimalistic brand of clicks and whooshes might be good by itself but there\u2019s a real risk it\u2019ll be like painting Pikachu on a Chippendale when it\u2019s set to the hoary old pervert psychedelia of the film\u2019s opening titles.</p> <p>Plus, as much as I hate to say it, one thing has got me really worried about Eilish\u2019s participation in all this. When her involvement was announced, she released a statement saying: \u201cIt feels crazy to be a part of this in every way. To be able to score the theme song to a film that is part of such a legendary series is a huge honor. James Bond is the coolest film franchise ever to exist.

      "bodyText": "No Time to Die already has a lot going for it. It\u2019s got an exciting director, a promising trailer and \u2013 if it adheres to the good/bad/good/bad pattern of James Bond films that began all the way back with Goldeneye \u2013 it might mean that Daniel Craig goes out on a high. And now there\u2019s another potential plus in its favour: Billie Eilish is doing the theme tune. What\u2019s especially exciting about this news is that, compared with the last couple of insipid \u2013 though admittedly Oscar-winning \u2013 efforts, Billie Eilish is refreshing. She\u2019s young. She\u2019s authentic. She has a signature sound that doesn\u2019t automatically align with the overwrought warbling of, say, Sam Smith. The history of the James Bond franchise contains a smattering of fantastic outliers \u2013 Live and Let Die, A View to a Kill, We Have All the Time in the World \u2013 that have flourished precisely because they haven\u2019t hewed to the ossified blueprint of what constitutes a Bond theme. If this song is as good as the director and producer are promising, then we could really have something special on our hands. Better yet, a title like No Time to Die is a songwriter\u2019s dream, in that lots of things rhyme with the word \u201cdie\u201d. Daniel Craig\u2019s Bond tenure has been littered with some truly abysmal titles that were no use to the musical art whatsoever. No wonder so many of them had their performers squirming around loopholes. Nothing rhymes with \u201cCasino Royale\u201d, so Chris Cornell sang a song called You Know My Name. Sam Smith, knowing that any song entitled Spectre would have had to at some point use the word \u201chectare\u201d, chickened out and sang Writing\u2019s on the Wall instead. Faced with the abomination that was Quantum of Solace, Jack White just made up his own Bond title with Another Way to Die. Only Adele took on the mantle of writing a song named after the actual film, and even she screwed it up by rhyming \u201csky fall\u201d with \u201ccrumble\u201d. So this is a golden opportunity for Eilish. No Time to Die is an open goal of a title, and she has the chops to really make it work. However, let\u2019s not get carried away here. This is James Bond we\u2019re talking about, so we should never underestimate the franchise\u2019s tendency to bungle a sitter. Because, yes, Billie Eilish is authentic and unique and unwilling to turn in a traditional theme. But that doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019ll be any good. Remember when they got Madonna in to jazz up the Bond theme as a genre? Remember how horrible that was? Remember how Die Another Day sounded like a bad song being fed through a worse Bluetooth connection? Or remember how bad Another Way to Die was, with White almost rapping his verses and then Alicia Keys using the chorus to make a noise like she\u2019d just found a dead snake in her bed? Remember Sheryl Crow? Of course you don\u2019t. And that\u2019s the danger with No Time to Die. James Bond is such a creaky old antique of a franchise that change has to come slowly. A nudge here. A bottle of Heineken there. Altering the direction of the Bond films is like piloting a cruise ship. Every change of course has to be slow and incremental. Do a handbrake turn and you\u2019ll kill everyone. Eilish\u2019s minimalistic brand of clicks and whooshes might be good by itself but there\u2019s a real risk it\u2019ll be like painting Pikachu on a Chippendale when it\u2019s set to the hoary old pervert psychedelia of the film\u2019s opening titles. Plus, as much as I hate to say it, one thing has got me really worried about Eilish\u2019s participation in all this. When her involvement was announced, she released a statement saying: \u201cIt feels crazy to be a part of this in every way. To be able to score the theme song to a film that is part of such a legendary series is a huge honor. James Bond is the coolest film franchise ever to exist. I\u2019m still in shock.\u201d Did you catch that? Billie Eilish thinks that James Bond is the coolest film franchise ever to exist. No, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s trad and naff and a full 50% of its instalments are absolutely terrible. Even Daniel Craig wanted out at one point, and he actually is James Bond.

The union backed Owen Smith in 2016 and was said to have lacked influence under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership.</p> \n<p>Fifteen executive members of the shop workers\u2019 union Usdaw will gather in Manchester on Monday afternoon to decide who to support.

      "bodyText": "Labour leadership hopefuls and their supporters are wooing union executive members as they seek to make the final ballot which will decide who will lead the party. Representatives of the five remaining candidates \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Jess Phillips \u2013 have approached general secretaries as they seek to win 5% of the party\u2019s affiliated membership. To reach this threshold, each candidate is seeking support from one of the UK\u2019s \u2018big five\u2019 unions \u2013 Unison, Unite, GMB, the Communication Workers\u2019 Union and Usdaw. Starmer became the firm favourite to win the leadership race last week when he won the backing of Unison, the UK\u2019s largest union. Pressure is building on the remaining candidates to find a major union to ensure they make the shortlist from which party members, trade unionists, members of affiliated societies and registered supporters will choose a winner. The UK\u2019s third biggest union, GMB, will invite all candidates to a 50-strong executive meeting on Tuesday. After a hustings, the executive will decide who to support. Nandy has been in contact with the union\u2019s general secretary, Tim Roache, and her campaign is run by the MP Louise Haigh who is a firm favourite with the union. Starmer is still in the running for the GMB vote, sources said, because he is \u201ca safe pair of hands\u201d and is the favourite to win. The union backed Owen Smith in 2016 and was said to have lacked influence under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. Fifteen executive members of the shop workers\u2019 union Usdaw will gather in Manchester on Monday afternoon to decide who to support. An eclectic group, they include at least one former Conservative party member and a supporter from Labour\u2019s left. The moderate union, which backed Smith in 2016, Andy Burnham in 2015 and David Miliband in 2010, is not expected to back Long-Bailey, but could support any of the other candidates, sources said. \u201cThis is not a done deal, but we won\u2019t be backing anyone seen as close to Corbyn,\u201d said one source. The Communication Workers\u2019 Union executive would have been expected to back Long-Bailey. But an element of unpredictability has been introduced to the process by a decision to invite around 500 delegates to make the final decision at a special conference at the end of this month. Dave Ward, the general secretary and a key Corbyn supporter, has this week written to the candidates asking for their views on the 2017 and 2019 manifestos, re-nationalisation of Royal Mail, whether they support a publicly owned national investment bank and universal broadband, and what their media strategy would be if they won. Reports have claimed that Unite, the UK\u2019s second biggest union which is most closely associated with Corbyn, will back Long-Bailey. But the general secretary, Len McCluskey, has warned that the decision has not been made and will be decided by the union\u2019s executive council on 24 January. The contenders will have to gain nominations from at least 33 constituency Labour parties or three affiliates, of which two must be trade unions, representing at least 5% of affiliate membership. There are only 12 unions affiliated to the Labour party, of which only five are big enough to get a candidate into the next round on their own. Candidates will also have to win the support of a smaller allied union and a socialist society to satisfy party rules. Nandy\u2019s campaign received a boost on Tuesday when the National Union of Mineworkers backed her as a candidate, the Yorkshire Post reported. Although membership of the NUM fell with the privatisation of the 15 state-owned coal mines still in operation in 1994, the union has maintained a symbolic role because of the emotional ties between the Labour movement and local communities. \u201cFormer coalfields and towns are crying out for real change. Some of these areas are part of the famous red wall that fell in the last election. I get it. If Labour wants to be part of making that change happen, we have to go back out into our communities and fight for it,\u201d Nandy said. In a further development, the Corbyn-supporting grassroots group Momentum is facing criticism from some supporters for only offering one option each in a ballot on Labour\u2019s leader and deputy leader. Forms sent to members invites them to vote either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d for Long Bailey and her running mate Angela Rayner. Michael Chessum, a former Momentum executive member, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThis is a joke and you should vote No on principle.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Derek Warwick, vice-president of the British Racing Drivers\u2019 Club, has echoed Lewis Hamilton\u2019s concern that reaching Formula One is in danger of becoming beyond the reach of talented working-class youngsters. In December Hamilton stated his belief that only drivers supported by wealthy families or backers can make it through the ranks of racing. Warwick concurred, suggesting that even drivers with exceptional talent might fail to progress due to the difficulty of meeting the expense of modern racing. \u201cIf we are not careful, we are not going to get the next Lewis Hamilton because he is not going to be able to afford it unless his father or mother is a multimillionaire,\u201d he said. While no one will talk about how much drivers bring to the table in Formula One, it costs \u00a3270,000-\u00a3350,000 to race in British F3, rising to at least \u00a3750,000-\u00a31m to switch to F3. Drivers would need around \u00a31.5m to race in F2. Hamilton grew up on a council estate in Stevenage and his father funded his career until McLaren took him on as part of their programme when he was 13. \u201cMy dad spent something like \u00a320,000 and remortgaged the house several times in the first years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today it\u2019s just got so expensive. There are very few, if [any] working-class families on their way up. It\u2019s all wealthy families.\u201d Warwick, who raced in F1 between 1981 and 1993 has long promoted the sport in Great Britain and is a former president of the BRDC, which supports British talent with its Aston Martin young driver of the year award. Last year it was won by 19-year-old Jonathan Hoggard. With the award comes \u00a3200,000, a test in a Red Bull F1 car and a drive in an Aston Martin Vantage World Endurance Championship car and membership of the BRDC. However Warwick believes Hoggard\u2019s task remains mountainous. \u201cWe are doing our little bit to try and help British motorsport but it is difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Jonathan I fear he might not be able to carry on his career because he hasn\u2019t got enough money to make the next step.

Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The EU will tell the UK that it must maintain higher labour and environmental standards than some of its own member states and that it will put the socioeconomic interests of its fishing communities at the centre of its post-Brexit negotiating strategy, diplomats have heard. Diplomats briefed by the European commission on Tuesday were informed that the UK would need to commit to staying beyond the common basic minimum of standards applied to EU member states. The EU will insist that the British government signs up to the \u201cnon-lowering of higher domestic labour and environmental standards in order to encourage trade and investment\u201d. The UK has \u201cgold-plated\u201d EU regulations in key fields including the environment and it will be bound to maintain those under the deal being plotted out in Brussels. The EU also expects the UK to sign up to Brussels\u2019 state aid rules with an \u201cindependent enforcement authority in the UK\u201d working in \u201cclose cooperation with [the European] commission\u201d. According to slides published by the European commission on Tuesday, the intention is to build what some sources have described as a \u201cpunishment clause\u201d into a future deal. The EU would be granted the possibility of \u201cautonomous remedies \u2013 interim measures to react quickly to disruptions of the equal conditions of competition in relevant areas\u201d should the UK lower its standards. According to the slides, the commission foresees the commitments of the UK on state aid and environmental and labour standards to also evolve through a joint committee that will set \u201chigher standards or include additional areas\u201d. On the issue of fishing rights in British waters after Brexit, diplomats were told that beyond \u201csustainability and conservation\u201d an objective of the EU would be protecting the often comparatively poor fishing towns and villages on the North Sea coast. The UK has insisted that post-Brexit fishing policy in British waters would be determined by scientific advice and innovation in practices. The government has also stated in official communications that \u201cmarket access for fisheries products is separate to the question of fishing opportunities and access to waters\u201d. But in the slide presentation, commission officials insisted that socioeconomic factors would play a role in the unprecedented negotiation and restated the intention of the EU to link the level of access given to UK goods in Europe. The officials told the diplomats that the fisheries negotiation would be done \u201cwithin the context of the overall economic partnership, including a direct link with negotiations on trade in goods\u201d. Under the Common Fisheries Policy the EU\u2019s seas and 100 fish stocks are in effect common to the 28 EU member states. The total number of each species of fish that can be taken from various zones in the EU\u2019s seas each year is settled by the member states on the advice of scientists, to ensure sustainability. Each country has a species-by-species quota they can take from that European haul under quotas that have been fixed since 1983 on the basis of the recorded catches of the various national fleets between 1973 and 1978. According to recent estimates, 33% of the catches of the European fishing fleet are caught in what will soon be claimed as British waters. Both sides have committed to negotiating a new framework for deciding fishing rights by 1 July although EU sources believe that the sheer complexity of the issue will result in the talks going deep into the year. Speaking in Strasbourg, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, stressed the difficulty of reaching agreement on the many issues in trade and beyond by the end of 2020 and used Boris Johnson\u2019s previous claim to want \u201ccake and to eat it\u201d against him. She said: \u201cWe have to make enormous progress \u2013 this is decisive \u2013 until the summer and here we have to decide on, or it\u2019s the UK\u2019s choice to decide on, how close or how distant they want to be from the EU. \u201cBut that also means from the single market in other terms. You cannot have no free movement for people and then expect to have free movement for goods, capitals and services. \u201cYou cannot expect to have a level playing field if there\u2019s a huge divergence in taxation or social standards or environmental standards. \u201cSo it\u2019s the choice of the UK how far they want to align or diverge. But this is decisive for how good the access to the single market will be or not, in short. It\u2019s the old proverb, \u2018You cannot have the cake and eat it at the same time\u2019.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Mohammad Elmi was on his way to fulfill a lifelong dream. On 13 December 2019, the 31-year-old Iranian boarded a flight to Los Angeles to join his wife in the United States and start a PhD program at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Sixty-five hours later, he was back in the Iranian capital, Tehran, refused entry to the United States by immigration officers at the airport.</p> <p>In Iran, Elmi had helped design the country\u2019s first portable electrocardiogram device, which made cardiac monitoring more accessible to rural populations. He was accepted to study biomedical applications of electrical engineering in Santa Barbara, where his wife Shima Mousavi is pursuing a master\u2019s degree, and had received a visa to travel to the US. Preparing for the move, he had left his job and depleted his savings, planning to live off his new teaching and research assistant position.</p> <p>But when Elmi stepped off the plane after a long, sleepless flight, he was detained by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Over the next 24 hours, he was held in a series of rooms in a restricted section of Los Angeles international airport and was searched and questioned repeatedly by CBP. Mousavi waited near the airport for eight hours before her phone rang. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Elmi told her. \u201cThey are sending me back to Iran.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, the Guardian reported US authorities were increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/14/iranian-students-barred-from-us-lost-money-broken-dreams-no-answers\">stopping Iranian students</a> from boarding US-bound flights without informing them their visas had been cancelled prior to travel. In recent months, however, a growing number of Iranians with valid student visas have been detained upon arrival at US airports by Customs and Border Protection and deported back to Iran. Some of them have been barred from returning to the United States for years.</p> <p>Since August, at least 10 students have been sent back to Iran upon their arrival at US airports, the Guardian found, the most recent of whom was deported on 3 January. Seven of those 10 students had flown into Logan international airport in Boston, where some of them allege serious infractions by CBP, including multiple complaints about an individual officer.</p> <p>According to the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, a not-for-profit advocacy organization, the removal of Iranian students upon their arrival \u201chas increased substantially within the past few months\u201d as political tensions between Washington and Tehran have escalated. \u201cThe number of cases we hear about from other communities does not compare to what\u2019s happening to Iranians,\u201d said Ali Rahnama, PAAIA attorney.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"528f390751a1fa1923c170a726fd51edfb15038a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/528f390751a1fa1923c170a726fd51edfb15038a/0_185_3711_2227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammad Elmi, center back in red, said goodbye to friends and family at the airport in Tehran before leaving for California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohammad Elmi, center back in red, said goodbye to friends and family at the airport in Tehran before leaving for California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018They ruined my plans for years\u2019</h2> <p>By the time Iranian students arrive at a US airport, they\u2019ve already gone through a lengthy and intense approval process. Iranians with student visas are exempt from the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, which bars most Iranians from traveling to the US. While most student visa applications are handled within US embassies, visas for Iranians are vetted by US intelligence agencies in Washington DC and greenlit by the Department of Homeland Security before being issued.</p> <p>Despite the rigorous vetting process, CBP appeared to question, in most of the deported students\u2019 cases, whether their past or future work might violate US sanctions on Iran\u2019s government, nuclear and energy sectors.</p> <p>Several deported students said CBP accused them during questioning of concealing connections with the Iranian government they had allegedly established during the two years of military service all men in Iran must complete. Those students said they had fulfilled their military service doing low-level administrative tasks.</p> <p>Elmi worked in an office that provided housing loans to army personnel. Javad, an incoming University of Pittsburgh student who declined to give his last name out of concern for future visa applications, said he was told by CBP officers at the Boston airport he was being deported because of a sanctions violation relating to his service, even though he had completed his military service filing paperwork in a dentistry office. Another student who declined to be identified said he was deported from Boston after officers found a photo on his phone showing him in military uniform.</p> <p>Several immigration attorneys said they could not make sense of these deportations. \u201cWhy should an eight-month visa process be thrown out over a couple questions at the airport?\u201d Rahnama said. \u201cThese students already disclosed all their information and went through months and months of security clearance,\u201d he added.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why should an eight-month visa process be thrown out over a couple of questions? These students went through months of security clearance</p> <footer> <cite>Ali Rahnama</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Elmi said many of the questions CBP asked him at LAX had come up during his visa application process months earlier. \u201cThey were the exact same questions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf there was any problem with my career, they should not have issued me a visa,\u201d said Mahla Shahkhajeh, an incoming Iowa State University graduate student, who was refused entry at the Boston airport in late December over her work for a packaging company that sold products to companies associated with Iranian oil production. Shahkhajeh had quit her job after receiving her US visa, moved out of her apartment, turned down other PhD offers and bought a plane ticket to the US that cost four months\u2019 pay. \u201cThey ruined my plans for the next five years,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>\u2018They treated me like a terrorist\u2019</h2> <p>In addition to being questioned, the students say they had their phones, laptops and hard drives searched. Some were asked questions about their religious and political beliefs.</p> <p>Between rounds of questioning, officers searched the contents of Elmi\u2019s bags and made him unlock his phone and write down the password. Then in another room, they told him to spread his legs and put his hands on the wall. \u201cThey started with my legs and worked up,\u201d Elmi said. \u201cThey treated me like I was a terrorist.\u201d</p> <p>Several of the students who were deported from the Boston airport said the screening there was aggressive and in some cases abusive. A student held for questioning at the airport in August while he was en route to Detroit said he was led to a private room with a metal table. \u201cIn the room, the officer\u2019s behavior changed.

      "bodyText": "Mohammad Elmi was on his way to fulfill a lifelong dream. On 13 December 2019, the 31-year-old Iranian boarded a flight to Los Angeles to join his wife in the United States and start a PhD program at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Sixty-five hours later, he was back in the Iranian capital, Tehran, refused entry to the United States by immigration officers at the airport. In Iran, Elmi had helped design the country\u2019s first portable electrocardiogram device, which made cardiac monitoring more accessible to rural populations. He was accepted to study biomedical applications of electrical engineering in Santa Barbara, where his wife Shima Mousavi is pursuing a master\u2019s degree, and had received a visa to travel to the US. Preparing for the move, he had left his job and depleted his savings, planning to live off his new teaching and research assistant position. But when Elmi stepped off the plane after a long, sleepless flight, he was detained by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Over the next 24 hours, he was held in a series of rooms in a restricted section of Los Angeles international airport and was searched and questioned repeatedly by CBP. Mousavi waited near the airport for eight hours before her phone rang. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Elmi told her. \u201cThey are sending me back to Iran.\u201d Last year, the Guardian reported US authorities were increasingly stopping Iranian students from boarding US-bound flights without informing them their visas had been cancelled prior to travel. In recent months, however, a growing number of Iranians with valid student visas have been detained upon arrival at US airports by Customs and Border Protection and deported back to Iran. Some of them have been barred from returning to the United States for years. Since August, at least 10 students have been sent back to Iran upon their arrival at US airports, the Guardian found, the most recent of whom was deported on 3 January. Seven of those 10 students had flown into Logan international airport in Boston, where some of them allege serious infractions by CBP, including multiple complaints about an individual officer. According to the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, a not-for-profit advocacy organization, the removal of Iranian students upon their arrival \u201chas increased substantially within the past few months\u201d as political tensions between Washington and Tehran have escalated. \u201cThe number of cases we hear about from other communities does not compare to what\u2019s happening to Iranians,\u201d said Ali Rahnama, PAAIA attorney. \u2018They ruined my plans for years\u2019 By the time Iranian students arrive at a US airport, they\u2019ve already gone through a lengthy and intense approval process. Iranians with student visas are exempt from the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, which bars most Iranians from traveling to the US. While most student visa applications are handled within US embassies, visas for Iranians are vetted by US intelligence agencies in Washington DC and greenlit by the Department of Homeland Security before being issued. Despite the rigorous vetting process, CBP appeared to question, in most of the deported students\u2019 cases, whether their past or future work might violate US sanctions on Iran\u2019s government, nuclear and energy sectors. Several deported students said CBP accused them during questioning of concealing connections with the Iranian government they had allegedly established during the two years of military service all men in Iran must complete. Those students said they had fulfilled their military service doing low-level administrative tasks. Elmi worked in an office that provided housing loans to army personnel. Javad, an incoming University of Pittsburgh student who declined to give his last name out of concern for future visa applications, said he was told by CBP officers at the Boston airport he was being deported because of a sanctions violation relating to his service, even though he had completed his military service filing paperwork in a dentistry office. Another student who declined to be identified said he was deported from Boston after officers found a photo on his phone showing him in military uniform. Several immigration attorneys said they could not make sense of these deportations. \u201cWhy should an eight-month visa process be thrown out over a couple questions at the airport?\u201d Rahnama said. \u201cThese students already disclosed all their information and went through months and months of security clearance,\u201d he added. Elmi said many of the questions CBP asked him at LAX had come up during his visa application process months earlier. \u201cThey were the exact same questions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was any problem with my career, they should not have issued me a visa,\u201d said Mahla Shahkhajeh, an incoming Iowa State University graduate student, who was refused entry at the Boston airport in late December over her work for a packaging company that sold products to companies associated with Iranian oil production. Shahkhajeh had quit her job after receiving her US visa, moved out of her apartment, turned down other PhD offers and bought a plane ticket to the US that cost four months\u2019 pay. \u201cThey ruined my plans for the next five years,\u201d she said. \u2018They treated me like a terrorist\u2019 In addition to being questioned, the students say they had their phones, laptops and hard drives searched. Some were asked questions about their religious and political beliefs. Between rounds of questioning, officers searched the contents of Elmi\u2019s bags and made him unlock his phone and write down the password. Then in another room, they told him to spread his legs and put his hands on the wall. \u201cThey started with my legs and worked up,\u201d Elmi said. \u201cThey treated me like I was a terrorist.\u201d Several of the students who were deported from the Boston airport said the screening there was aggressive and in some cases abusive. A student held for questioning at the airport in August while he was en route to Detroit said he was led to a private room with a metal table. \u201cIn the room, the officer\u2019s behavior changed. He got aggressive,\u201d said the student, who declined to be identified for fear of retribution in future visa applications. \u201cTell us the fucking truth!\u201d the student remembers the officer shouting. \u201cI was so scared I was shaking,\u201d the student said. The officer asked him if he was a radical Muslim. Other students reported that same officer had shouted at them, asking one of them whether he had a girlfriend and if he \u201clikes blondes like other Arabs do\u201d. One student said he was told by a CBP translator in Logan airport to avoid flying through Boston in the future. \u201cIf you get a new visa,\u201d the student recalls the translator saying, \u201cdon\u2019t fly through Boston. The rules are stricter here.\u201d All of the students denied entry in Boston were officially deported and banned from the US for five years. Multiple students said CBP gave them records of their questioning that were partly inaccurate or fabricated, while others were put on planes back to Iran without a copy of the paperwork. \u201cI don\u2019t know under which section of the law I was not allowed to enter the US,\u201d Shahkhajeh said. CBP told the Guardian it was not at liberty to discuss an individual\u2019s processing and that it prohibits profiling on the basis of race or religion. \u201cCBP has understood Iran and its proxies to be a very capable adversary for some time,\u201d a CBP spokesperson, Nate Peeters, said in a statement, adding that the agency \u201cis operating with an enhanced security posture\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The UK has failed to pass on the details of 75,000 convictions of foreign criminals to their home EU countries and concealed the scandal for fear of damaging Britain\u2019s reputation in Europe\u2019s capitals, the Guardian can reveal. European trust in the UK on security issues sank to a new low on Tuesday night after details emerged of the apparent cover-up, which prompted calls for an investigation in the UK and a warning from one senior MEP that a Brussels inquiry was inevitable. The police national computer error, revealed in the minutes of a meeting at the criminal records office, went undetected for five years, during which one in three alerts on offenders \u2013 potentially including murderers and rapists \u2013 were not sent to EU member states. Authorities in EU countries were not informed of the crimes committed, the sentences given to their nationals by UK courts or the risk the convicted criminals posed to the public. Because the details were not passed on, dangerous offenders could have travelled back to their home countries without the normal notification to local authorities of their presence. Such is the scale of the scandal that the Home Office initially chose to conceal the embarrassing failure from EU partners. Minutes of an ACRO criminal records meeting last May \u2013 deleted from the ACRO website after the Guardian story was first published \u2013 state: \u201cThere is a nervousness from Home Office around sending the historical notifications out dating back to 2012 due to the reputational impact this could have.\u201d A minute of a meeting held the following month said: \u201cThere is still uncertainty whether historical DAFs [daily activity file], received from the Home Office, are going to be sent out to counties (sic) as there is a reputational risk to the UK.\u201d Asked if the Home Office had resolved the problem in the seven months since the second meeting, a spokesman said: \u201cWork is already under way with the police to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.\u201d The historical backlog of 75,000 notifications has still not been sent to European law enforcement agencies, sources confirmed. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing glitch that we need to fix.

The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, joined calls for a \u201cfull urgent investigation\u201d into the decision to keep the blunder from European partners, with the Liberal Democrats saying the Home office had \u201cserious questions to answer\u201d. Abbott told the Guardian: \u201cIt is bad enough to have made serious errors in relation to sharing information on criminals, but it seems that there was also an attempt at a cover-up. \u201cMinisters need to come clean. When did they know about these failures, why did they not make them public, and how are they going to prevent any repetition?

This month, the European parliament\u2019s justice and home affairs committee was given evidence of \u201cdeliberate violations and abuse\u201d by the UK of the Schengen Information System (SIS), an EU database used by police and border guards across the border-free Schengen zone. The British authorities had made \u201cunlawful\u201d full or partial copies of the database that were said by an EU report to pose \u201cserious and immediate risks to the integrity and security of SIS data\u201d. Sophie in \u2019t Veld, a Dutch MEP on the European parliament\u2019s committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs, said she expected an urgent inquiry by a European parliament justice committee, adding the issue would be raised with the European commission in a resolution. She said: \u201cThis is yet another scandal that casts a very dark shadow over security and law enforcement cooperation. This cover-up could have exposed EU countries to security risks and should urgently be investigated by the Schengen scrutiny group in the European parliament. \u201cCertainly, we will add this to the already long list of issues that need to be discussed with the UK in the context of the future relationship. \u201cThis revelation of the failure to alert authorities on criminals and the cover-up afterwards casts serious doubts on the UK as a reliable partner. \u201cThe purpose of information exchange is enhancing security. If one side fails to deliver, security gains are zero and cooperation pointless.\u201d An EU official agreed that the issue would impact on the level of trust in the UK. The source added that the revelations also undermined British claims that a British loss of EU databases would prove mutually disadvantageous. During the negotiation over the post-Brexit relationship, the government will seek to convince Brussels that there should be continued data exchange with British authorities, operational cooperation between law enforcement authorities and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The UK will no longer be a member of Europol and its police and security services will lose access to key EU databases at the end of the transition period in December 2020. Officials believe the failure to alert EU partners is down to the police national computer, a database containing information on millions of convicted criminals and their jail records. It generates daily activity files of the latest updates, and any relating to foreign offenders are meant to be forwarded to the European Criminal Records Information Exchange System (ECRIS) by a body known as ACRO Criminal Records Office, responsible for international police data sharing. Last year, ACRO realised that a large number of the alerts that should have been given to foreign countries had been missed, many of which covered convictions of criminals who had dual nationality. ACRO\u2019s strategic management board was briefed last May about the \u201congoing issue dating back to 2015 regarding notifications out for foreign nationals and that the current DAF reports are missing about 30% of foreign nationals\u201d. The board was warned that an estimated 75,000 checks had not been done over the years. A spokesman for ACRO said: \u201cACRO relies on the daily activity files from the police national computer to send notification messages to other countries in relation to cases where one of their nationals has been convicted in the UK. \u201cThe issue arose when it was noticed that not all relevant DAFs were sent to ACRO, for example in cases where the subject had dual nationality. \u201cAs a result, a software script has been developed at Hendon, the PNC headquarters, and is due to be released in the next software update schedule (the date of which is yet to be confirmed).\u201d",

A Netflix spokesman said: \u201cNetflix has always paid the taxes required in the countries where we operate.\u201d In September, Amazon revealed it received \u20ac241m in tax credits in 2018, despite efforts by EU authorities in Brussels to ensure the company pays more tax. Amazon Europe, which is based in Luxembourg and aggregates the billions of pounds of sales the retailer makes from individual countries across the continent, received the credits after reporting a pre-tax loss of \u20ac493m in 2018. Sales rose 11.6% to \u20ac28bn. Amazon, which is being pursued by the European commission for more than \u20ac250m over \u201cillegal tax advantages\u201d in Luxembourg, paid just \u20ac55m in tax on European revenues of \u20ac24.9bn in 2017. In 2016, it paid \u20ac16.5m on revenues of \u20ac21.6bn.",

Reporting the vulnerability represents a departure for the NSA from its past strategy of keeping security flaws under wraps to exploit for its own intelligence needs. The NSA revealed during a press conference on Tuesday that the \u201cserious vulnerability\u201d could be used to create malicious software that appeared to be legitimate. The flaw \u201cmakes trust vulnerable\u201d, the NSA director of cybersecurity, Anne Neuberger, said in a briefing call to media on Tuesday. If the vulnerability had been successfully exploited, an attacker would have been able to conduct \u201cman-in-the-middle attacks\u201d and decrypt confidential information on user connections to the affected software, Microsoft said. Microsoft said it had not seen any evidence that hackers had used the technique discovered by the NSA. \u201cCustomers who have already applied the update, or have automatic updates enabled, are already protected,\u201d said Jeff Jones, a senior director at Microsoft, in a statement. The vulnerability has a broad reach: as of 2017, Windows 10 was used on 400m computers. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the NSA had discovered the flaw in recent weeks and alerted Microsoft to the problem. The issue was announced on Microsoft\u2019s January \u201cPatch Tuesday\u201d, the second Tuesday of each month, when the company typically releases security improvements for operating systems and other software. Priscilla Moriuchi, who retired from the NSA in 2017 after running its east Asia and Pacific operations, said this was a good example of the \u201cconstructive role\u201d that the NSA could play in improving global information security. Moriuchi, now an analyst at the US cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said it was probably a reflection of changes made in 2017 to how the US determines whether to disclose a major vulnerability or exploit it for intelligence purposes. The revamping of what\u2019s known as the \u201cvulnerability equities process\u201d put more emphasis on disclosing unpatched vulnerabilities whenever possible to protect core internet systems and the US economy and general public. The NSA has previously been criticized after it took advantage of vulnerabilities in Microsoft products to deploy hacking tools against adversaries and kept the technology multinational in the dark about it for years. When one of those tools was dramatically leaked to the internet by a group calling itself ShadowBrokers, it was deployed against targets around the globe by hackers of all stripes. In the most dramatic case, a group used the tool to unleash a huge malware outbreak dubbed WannaCry in 2017. The data-wiping worm wrought global havoc, affecting what Europol estimated was 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries. Disclosing the vulnerability to Microsoft was \u201ca significant step for the National Security Agency\u201d, said Rick Holland, chief information security officer at Digital Shadows, a San Francisco-based provider of digital risk protection solutions. \u201cMake no mistake, though; the NSA will continue to hoard zero-days and leverage them as required to accomplish their objectives,\u201d he said, referencing the agency\u2019s previous policy of not alerting the public to potential vulnerabilities.",

Today, Iran is a terrorist nation where the people mourn the death of a brutal regime general, and tomorrow they become stalwarts of democracy, putting their lives on the line to oppose their authoritarian regime.

If US hawks view the trouble on the streets as a sign that their strategy is working and try to stoke it, they will in fact be weakening those Iranians who favour compromise and strengthening the hardliners who want to see more confrontation. That the powerful are prepared to accept a monolithic picture of Iran is especially worrying at a time when open conflict seems more likely. There is no analyst who can write about what all Iranians believe. Think about how challenging it is gauging public opinion in western nations, let alone in a nation that has been isolated from the rest of the world for the past four decades. Treating Iran like an analytical buffet table, choosing to accept only those facts that fit your agenda, is a recipe for misunderstanding with potentially fatal consequences. \u2022 Reza H Akbari is a programme manager at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting",

Before Monday\u2019s crisis family meeting, sources had indicated Meghan was likely to be personally involved in the urgent discussions precipitated by the couple\u2019s shock announcement that they intended to \u201cstep back\u201d from frontline royal duties. She had been expected to participate via conference call from Vancouver Island, in Canada, to which she flew back on Thursday to be with the couple\u2019s young son, Archie, and their two dogs which have been flown out. The couple are said to have decided Meghan\u2019s direct input was not necessary for the highly confidential meeting, hosted by the Queen, understood to have been led by the Prince of Wales, and attended by Princes William and Harry. A palace source said: \u201cIn the end, the Sussexes decided it wasn\u2019t necessary for the duchess to join.\u201d Harry was left to argue the couple\u2019s case on his own, which was the first time all four senior royals had met face-to-face following the couple\u2019s unexpected statement last Wednesday. Confirmation that it was the couple\u2019s decision for Meghan not to take part will stymie speculative reports she had been deliberately excluded, aides will hope. Buckingham Palace has yet to reveal full details of how the Sussexes might achieve their goal of splitting time between the UK and Canada, stepping back as senior royals, and becoming financially independent by earning an income unfettered by royal constraints. As senior palace officials concentrated on nailing the fine print, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, revealed the federal Canadian government had not been involved \u201cup until this point\u201d about what the couple\u2019s move there would mean.

Channel 4\u2019s chief executive, Alex Mahon, said it was important to focus on attracting more younger viewers because \u201ctheir behaviours are changing faster than older viewers, they go more to streaming\u201d, but said \u201cwe still want to be broad\u201d and appeal to older audiences. Mahon pointed out that last year Channel 4 aired 24 of the 30 top-rating youth shows, and also its ethnic minority audiences were up 9% \u2013 a record. Katz said the broadcaster\u2019s new regional bases were helping to change its makeup, with some ideas not being commissioned because the new regional commissioners were telling him that \u201cno one outside London is interested in that\u201d. He said the less metropolitan feel would become more apparent when the BBC Breakfast presenter Steph McGovern begins her new daily current affairs show in the spring. The Channel 4 bosses appeared confident that the broadcaster can continue to challenge convention despite clashing with the government last year over its decision to fill Boris Johnson\u2019s empty place in its climate change debate with an ice sculpture and after Johnson was called a \u201cknown liar\u201d by Channel 4\u2019s head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne. Mahon noted that the government\u2019s threat to its remit made during the general election had been withdrawn and said: \u201cElections are a heated time. On the climate change debate, Ofcom gave us a very clean bill of health on impartiality.\u201d Meanwhile, Katz said after the success of Brexit: The Uncivil War, which starred Benedict Cumberbatch as Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, \u201cwe are working on a number of projects with James Graham who wrote that show\u201d, but whether Cummings will be in them or not \u201cis another question\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Harvey Weinstein faced fierce opposition in a Manhattan court on Tuesday to his attempt to have the next critical stage of jury selection in his rape trial conducted behind closed doors. The New York district attorney leading the prosecution of Weinstein, Joan Illuzzi, was joined by several prominent news outlets in objecting to a defense demand that the jury pool be sequestered when they are subjected to individual questioning by legal teams this week. Such a move would exclude all media and public from the proceedings, casting in secrecy the final steps taken to produce a jury for the eagerly awaited trial. Weinstein\u2019s legal team made the demand last week, arguing that unless the potential jurors were questioned in private the film producer would not be assured of a fair and impartial trial. Defense lawyers have made numerous attempts to call for an adjournment on grounds that the jury pool is being tainted \u2013 from objecting to the sounds of women chanting an anti-rape anthem outside the courthouse to protesting about comments made by the judge in ordering Weinstein to stop using his cellphone in court. The second phase of jury selection, known as voir dire, is expected to start on Thursday and involves potential jurors being grilled by both defense and prosecution lawyers about their backgrounds and experience in the hope of flushing out any prejudices. Both legal teams can then remove up to three people from the jury pool without giving an explanation. Weinstein faces five counts relating to the allegations of two women that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. They include two counts of predatory sexual assault, two counts of rape and one count of a criminal sex act. In her response to the court, Illuzzi objected to Weinstein\u2019s attempt to have voir dire held in secret. \u201cThe procedure employed in this case is fair and reasonable. There is simply no authority for the proposition, advanced here by the defense, that exposure to pre-trial publicity requires individualized, sequestered voir dire,\u201d the prosecutor said. Lawyers representing the New York Times, the New Yorker, Daily News, Associated Press and other news outlets also filed a response objecting to Weinstein\u2019s motion. They said that contrary to the idea that publicity would be harmful to the movie producer\u2019s case, \u201cMr Weinstein and his counsel have sought to make their case through the media\u201d. The news organizations point out that Weinstein\u2019s lead defense lawyer, Donna Rotunno, has spoken to several publications and TV stations including Newsweek, ABC and CNN.",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson surfaced on Tuesday to give his first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/14/boris-johnsons-bbc-breakfast-interview-the-main-points\" title=\"\">wide-ranging interview</a> since the election. The prime minister gave little away. But clearly visible is his political project to raise issues that identify the Conservatives with the workers and the smaller towns and distance them from liberal thinking in the big cities. The Tories\u2019 response to the potential collapse of the Exeter-based airline Flybe is instructive. First it was suggested that <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-flybe-funding/uk-government-to-consider-cutting-air-passenger-tax-to-help-flybe-media-idUKKBN1ZD0KG\" title=\"\">air passenger taxes</a> on domestic flights could be cut. This is a calculated appeal to people\u2019s wallets with cheaper flights. But it is also a surefire way to rile liberals who rightly question the wisdom of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/doug_parr/status/1216969816558448641?s=20\" title=\"\">encouraging flying when the planet is burning</a>.</p> <p>The same political trick was attempted on the issue of county lines drugs gangs which Mr Johnson, in a naked attempt to earn tabloid applause, said needed to be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7885755/Boris-Johnson-vows-county-lines-drugs-gangs-totally-wound-up.html\" title=\"\">wound up</a>\u201d. This taps into the social conservatism of small-town Britain while simultaneously being a provocation to the liberal sense that drugs are a problem for larger society, not just the criminal justice system.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson surfaced on Tuesday to give his first wide-ranging interview since the election. The prime minister gave little away. But clearly visible is his political project to raise issues that identify the Conservatives with the workers and the smaller towns and distance them from liberal thinking in the big cities. The Tories\u2019 response to the potential collapse of the Exeter-based airline Flybe is instructive. First it was suggested that air passenger taxes on domestic flights could be cut. This is a calculated appeal to people\u2019s wallets with cheaper flights. But it is also a surefire way to rile liberals who rightly question the wisdom of encouraging flying when the planet is burning. The same political trick was attempted on the issue of county lines drugs gangs which Mr Johnson, in a naked attempt to earn tabloid applause, said needed to be \u201cwound up\u201d. This taps into the social conservatism of small-town Britain while simultaneously being a provocation to the liberal sense that drugs are a problem for larger society, not just the criminal justice system. Mr Johnson hopes to trade in issues that pose dilemmas for liberals but seem clearcut to ordinary voters. Such a political strategy was born in Mr Johnson\u2019s 2016 Brexit campaign that successfully ghettoised well-off and well-educated voters as out-of-touch in their urban citadels. This politics rests on the increasing salience of class. It is perhaps a liberal conceit to suggest that class has vanished from modern societies which claim to be purely meritocratic, with the only barriers to upward mobility being the overt and institutionalised forms of discrimination.

All played a part, but Mr Johnson aligned Brexit with a promise of national renewal to win the 2016 referendum with a coalition of wealthy southern and left-behind voters. He then repeated the trick by putting that result at the heart of the last election \u2013 and won by being more popular with working-class voters than middle-class ones.

The number of people logging on to Warhammer-community.com was up 48% in the period, with fans returning to the site more frequently. \u201cOur business and the Warhammer hobby continue to be in great shape,\u201d Rountree said. \u201cWe are pleased to once again report record sales and profit levels in the period. The global team have worked their socks off to deliver these great results.\u201d He also pointed to the success of its new Citadel Colours paint range, which comes in shades such as \u201cork flesh\u201d and \u201cblood angels red\u201d. The company had delivered a step change in its paint offering, Rountree said.",

It is charged on each passenger on flights departing from the UK, and set according to the distance of their final destination and the class of travel.</p>\n    <p>It is intended to incentivise passengers to seek alternative arrangements from flying, which is the most carbon-intensive form of transport. By reducing demand for flights, it seeks to decrease carbon emissions from the air industry.</p>\n    <p>Destinations are grouped into two bands, above and below 2,000 miles from London, and charged at three rates \u2013 effectively for economy class, premium economy and business/first-class seats. All short-haul flights to Europe, including domestic, are charged in the same band, rising from \u00a313 in economy to \u00a378 in first class. A long-haul first-class flight now attracts APD of \u00a3528.</p>\n    <p>Airlines have long lobbied against the tax, particularly after the rates were doubled in 2007.</p>\n    <p>Flybe has argued that it is especially hard hit as the tax only applies to UK departures, and is therefore applied to each leg of a domestic return flight. That means, for example, that a return flight from Cardiff to Manchester is taxed at \u00a326, while an international return flight from the UK to Moscow pays \u00a313 in APD.</p>\n    <p>Long-haul flights from Northern Ireland are exempt from APD, as well as departures from remote parts of Scotland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The chancellor, Sajid Javid, said: \u201cI welcome Flybe\u2019s confirmation that they will continue to operate as normal, safeguarding jobs in UK and ensuring flights continue to serve communities across the whole of the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reviews we are announcing today will help level up our economy.

The plans were thrashed out in consultation with trade unions, after Labour members passed a motion at their autumn conference calling for an ambitious target of hitting net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. In an article in the Guardian, Phillips, whose campaign slogan is \u201cspeak truth, win power\u201d, said the public should be more directly involved in determining what policies Britain should adopt to tackle the climate crisis. \u201cOn climate breakdown, we need a plan that involves the public much more.

As well as calling for the wider use of citizens\u2019 assemblies, Phillips adopts some of the proposals for political reform advocated by Clive Lewis, the leftwing Norwich South MP who dropped out of the leadership race on Monday after failing to secure adequate support from MPs. She said the electoral system should be changed \u2013 \u201cso that parliament better reflects votes cast\u201d \u2013 and the House of Lords reformed. Her other proposals include devolution to local authorities; automatic voter enrolment; and creating a new watchdog to regulate online political advertising, funded by an advertising levy. \u201cIf people are to trust our electoral process, we urgently need to combat fake news during campaigns. Apart from Twitter, which has banned political adverts, the social media giants aren\u2019t stepping up,\u201d she said. Phillips was one of the five contenders who passed the first hurdle to getting on the ballot paper on Monday, by securing the backing of 23 MPs and MEPs. She is a women\u2019s rights campaigner and well-liked by colleagues in the House of Commons, but is viewed with suspicion by some on the left of the party, because of her criticisms of Jeremy Corbyn. Phillips announced a twelve-person campaign team on Tuesday, jointly chaired by former Grimsby MP Melanie Onn and Ilford North MP Wes Streeting. Onn and Streeting said: \u201cWe have represented different parts of the country and had different views on Brexit, but we both know Jess is the person to bring our party and our country together.\u201d",

A Flybe return fare \u2013 for a 1hr 10 min flight from Exeter Airport to London City - currently costs \u00a3144 at peak times (rising to \u00a3302 for a flexible ticket). A similar trip from Southampton to Manchester on 17-18 February can now cost \u00a398 on Flybe for a one-hour hop \u2013 or \u00a3122 for four hours on the train. Other journeys \u2013 most obviously from Northern Ireland to the mainland \u2013 are impossible solely by rail. Would someone take over Flybe\u2019s routes? Possibly. Other carriers might well eye some lucrative routes should Flybe fail. Newquay-London is a route operated under a public service obligation and so would definitely continue. But given the wider network appears unprofitable, some passengers will likely need to seek new connections.",

Because students at Good Shepherd are fundraisers for <a href=\"https://www.marysmeals.org.uk/\">Mary\u2019s Meals</a>, the NGO that funds school dinners at Vorkor and 2,357 other schools in 18 countries across the world.

MacFarlane-Barrow asked what he could do to help, and the boy replied that what he needed was easy: food to eat, and a school to go to. MacFarlane-Barrow launched Mary\u2019s Meals as a result. It now feeds more than 1.5 million children daily, with a budget of around \u00a326m, almost 90% of which comes from donations.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2020/jan/15/environment-inequality-hunger-which-global-problems-would-you-fix-first\">Environment, inequality, hunger: which global problems would you fix first? \u2013 quiz</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cOne meal for one child costs just 7p \u2013 that\u2019s pocket money even the youngest children have,\u201d says Kim Webster, a spokesperson for Mary\u2019s Meals.

And Mary\u2019s Meals manages to keep overheads low by recruiting volunteers \u2013 in practice these are usually mothers or grandmothers with kids in the relevant school \u2013 to run their kitchens.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s still, though, a long way to go. <a href=\"http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/new-methodology-shows-258-million-children-adolescents-and-youth-are-out-school.pdf\">Unesco estimates</a> that across the world 258 million children between the ages of six and 17 miss out on school because of poverty.

On one recent morning in Liberia, a river connection to a remote local school was impassable because of rains. Bags of porridge, rice and beans that had been stacked up on the bank for the short voyage were loaded back into a vehicle. Across the water we could see the faces of children who would be getting no school dinner until the water receded.</p> \n<p>Food is not the only challenge for young people in Liberia.</p> \n<p>One of the kindergarten children at Kondh school in Bomi County is Blessing Johnson, four. Her mother, Ma-tenneh, died of Ebola the day after she was born; a week later, her father, Molu, died of it, too. Blessing is being raised by her mother\u2019s sister, Zoe, who already has four children of her own; to know her niece is getting fed at school makes a huge difference to the family.</p> \n<p>Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/27/liberia-ebola-first-doctor-dies-brisbane-virus-outbreak\">Ebola</a>, of course, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/04/westafrica.qanda\">civil war</a>, 14 years of it, in which more than 200,000 Liberians died and more than 1 million were uprooted.</p> \n<p><br>At another school, there is a boy who\u2019s much older than anyone else called Waharbu Zinah. He\u2019s 19, but he\u2019s only been at school for six years. At the age of three he was kidnapped from his village by soldiers, and even after the war ended in 2003 he was effectively enslaved. \u201cI looked after the man who had been the boss-man of the soldiers; I had to fetch and carry for him,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was just a small kid \u2013 I had no chance on my own.\u201d He finally escaped when he was 13, and settled in Lowah; he works on a farm to support himself.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"426a250a27a3253653025a62abd485afec8c77c7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/426a250a27a3253653025a62abd485afec8c77c7/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waharbu Zinah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After being kidnapped by soldiers at the age of three, Waharbu Zinah, now 19, is in school, and benefiting from the Mary\u2019s Meals scheme.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Watt</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect to see my parents again \u2013 I\u2019ve no idea what happened to them.

He may not be the sort of pupil the children at the Good Shepherd have in mind when they\u2019re fundraising, but what Mary\u2019s Meals is offering him is the most important gift of all: a second chance.</p> \n<p><em>Mary\u2019s Meals paid for Joanna Moorhead\u2019s visit to Liberia</em></p> \n<p><br><br></p>",

The eight-year-old has been up since dawn, collecting firewood, fetching water. Now she\u2019s ready for school in a crisp white shirt and navy-blue skirt in her family\u2019s muddy, two-room shack. In the narrow porch there\u2019s a pile of rags, some carrier bags, a few bowls and a couple of plastic chairs. In a UK home it would look like stuff waiting to go to the tip. Here, it represents this family\u2019s entire earthly possessions. Liberia is one of the poorest countries on Earth, and the Kamaras are one of its poorest families. They eke out a living growing vegetables on the land around the shack. In families that hover as close to subsistence as this one, sending their children to school makes little sense. Learning to read and write, to do addition and subtraction, might be an investment in a long-term future, but it doesn\u2019t put food on the table today or tomorrow. And yet Massa is setting off on the 40-minute trek to school. This morning it\u2019s dry: when the rain is pouring down, as it often does at this time of year, Massa carries her uniform in an old carrier bag to keep it dry, and changes into it when she reaches school. As we walk she speaks of the subject she likes best (English), her friends, and how she hopes one day to move to the city. At the Vorkor public school in a village near the regional centre Tubmanburg, smoke is curling from an open-sided \u201ckitchen\u201d, where several women are busy over a fire preparing today\u2019s dinner in vast pots.

It\u2019s children who bear the brunt of global poverty, every which way you look: they make up 30% of the world\u2019s population, but account for 50% of its poorest people. Many of these children are in Africa, where 228 million live in what the UN classes as extreme poverty; in sub-Saharan Africa, one child in three is stunted due to malnutrition. Even in the regions and schools that Mary\u2019s Meals support, the terrain and weather conditions sometimes make food deliveries impossible. On one recent morning in Liberia, a river connection to a remote local school was impassable because of rains. Bags of porridge, rice and beans that had been stacked up on the bank for the short voyage were loaded back into a vehicle. Across the water we could see the faces of children who would be getting no school dinner until the water receded. Food is not the only challenge for young people in Liberia. One of the kindergarten children at Kondh school in Bomi County is Blessing Johnson, four. Her mother, Ma-tenneh, died of Ebola the day after she was born; a week later, her father, Molu, died of it, too. Blessing is being raised by her mother\u2019s sister, Zoe, who already has four children of her own; to know her niece is getting fed at school makes a huge difference to the family. Before Ebola, of course, there was civil war, 14 years of it, in which more than 200,000 Liberians died and more than 1 million were uprooted. At another school, there is a boy who\u2019s much older than anyone else called Waharbu Zinah. He\u2019s 19, but he\u2019s only been at school for six years. At the age of three he was kidnapped from his village by soldiers, and even after the war ended in 2003 he was effectively enslaved. \u201cI looked after the man who had been the boss-man of the soldiers; I had to fetch and carry for him,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was just a small kid \u2013 I had no chance on my own.\u201d He finally escaped when he was 13, and settled in Lowah; he works on a farm to support himself. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to see my parents again \u2013 I\u2019ve no idea what happened to them. The only way I can have a future is if I provide one for myself \u2013 and I\u2019m doing my best to do that.\u201d Getting fed at school, he tells me, is the deal-breaker that makes it possible for him to afford to be educated, and furthers his dream of one day going to college. Seeing Waharbu\u2019s tall frame squeezed behind a dilapidated desk, paying careful attention to the young man just a few years older than him who\u2019s teaching reading from the school\u2019s single blackboard, is a humbling experience. He may not be the sort of pupil the children at the Good Shepherd have in mind when they\u2019re fundraising, but what Mary\u2019s Meals is offering him is the most important gift of all: a second chance.

Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to block a second independence referendum in perpetuity does not change this. And it is spectacular naively to think this will close the issue down. It will only inflame the debate, as Boris Johnson\u2019s history of demagoguery and division shows he is well practiced in doing.</p> <p>Scotland and the whole UK are deeply unequal societies which desperately need radical change. But the Tories are hell-bent on destroying what is left of the welfare state, and the SNP are advocating a decade of cuts in a separate Scottish state.</p> <p>The people of Scotland rejected independence in 2014, but Scotland remains divided. I believe that home rule within the UK is the only viable option that stands a chance of healing the divisions in our society.

Normally Big Ben chimes every hour, but it has been silenced for some time because of a four-year restoration programme. This is a tale that tells you something about the Brexiters\u2019 preoccupation with history, tradition and symbolism, as well as about the way some newspaper coverage operates in a curious grey zone between the serious and the absurd. All this helps to explain why 60 Tory Brexiters wrote to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/01/11/dozens-tory-mps-stage-last-ditch-attempt-persuade-parliament/\">the Sunday Telegraph at the weekend demanding that Big Ben should bong for Brexit.</a> And it explains why Boris Johnson himself felt obliged to make a concession to this nonsense in his BBC interview this morning by floating the idea of having some sort of public appeal to pay for Brexit bongs. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/14/boris-johnson-faces-fresh-questions-on-brexit-and-northern-ireland-deals?page=with:block-5e1d7e7c8f0852212f74d996#block-5e1d7e7c8f0852212f74d996\">10.03am.)</a></p> <p>Johnson did, though, seem to acknowledge that it would be be unreasonable to expect the government to pay the \u00a3500,000 cost of getting Big Ben to chime on 31 January. And today the <strong>House of Commons commission</strong> has put out a press notice explaining why it would cost so much. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the bell to ring on 31 January, the temporary striking mechanism used for Remembrance Sunday and New Year\u2019s Eve would need to be reattached and tested to ensure the timing is correct. </p> <p>Alongside this work, a temporary floor of the belfry where Big Ben is housed, would also need to be installed as extensive work is currently taking place in this area. </p> <p>The cost for the temporary floor and installing, testing and striking Big Ben would be approximately \u00a3120,000. </p> <p>In addition to the set-up, the delay to work in the belfry would push back the planned programme of work by two to four weeks \u2013 with each week of delays costing approximately \u00a3100,000 a week. </p> <p>As such, the minimum cost of sounding Big Ben would be \u00a3320,000 \u2013 but could be much higher (up to \u00a3500,00). </p> <p>Based on this information, the commission felt that this extra expenditure could not be justified, but will respond to any change to this decision made by the house. </p> </blockquote> <p>In a statement explaining why the commission did not support spending this money, <strong>Sir Lindsay Hoyle</strong>, the Speaker, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The commission believes it is important to weigh up the costs this would involve if Big Ben is to chime on 31 January. You are talking about \u00a350,000 a bong. </p> <p>We also have to bear in mind that the only people who will hear it will be those who live near or are visiting Westminster.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b776a419d8aaf25419859e8dc48c27c35ffdfe21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b776a419d8aaf25419859e8dc48c27c35ffdfe21/0_278_5246_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ben during ongoing renovations to the Tower and the Houses of Parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big Ben during ongoing renovations to the Tower and the Houses of Parliament.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-14T17:34:56.937Z\">at 5.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1dcddb8f088d80a182abb3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-14T14:24:05.228Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from <strong>Carwyn Jones</strong>, the former first minister of Wales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AMCarwyn/status/1217072683160080387\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If Boris Johnson says that it is entirely a matter for the UK if it chooses to leave the EU then it\u2019s entirely matter for Scotland if it chooses to leave the UK.

She enclosed with her letter <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/scotlands-right-choose-putting-scotlands-future-scotlands-hands.pdf\">a 38-page report (pdf) </a>published by the Scottish government explaining why the Scottish government believes a second referendum is justified.</p> <p>In his letter Johnson rejects the request \u2013 not just for now (which was the line used by Theresa May when she rejected Sturgeon first request for a second independence referendum after the Brexit vote), or until the next Holyrood elections in 2021 (the line used by Jeremy Corbyn in the general election). He rejects it for the foreseeable future, on the grounds that Scotland settled this matter in the 2104 referendum.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You and your predecessor made a personal promise that the 2014 independence referendum was a \u201conce in a generation\u201d vote ...</p> <p>The UK government will continue to uphold the democratic decision of the Scottish people and the promise that you made to them. For that reason, I cannot agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums.</p> <p>Another independence referendum would continue the political stagnation that Scotland has seen for the last decade, with Scottish schools, hospitals and jobs again left behind because of the campaign to separate the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is not unexpected.

It wasn\u2019t one for the history books, it wasn\u2019t over-forensic, and perhaps the main takeaway is that Johnson has just as prone to using bluster, evasion and hyperbole when faced with difficult questions as he was before he went on his New Year holiday. Still, he was not untruthful in the way that he was yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/13/labour-leadership-nomination-deadline-means-thornberry-and-lewis-risk-elimination-from-contest-at-230pm-live-news?page=with:block-5e1c6c068f087e8308e6d673#block-5e1c6c068f087e8308e6d673\">when talking about post-Brexit GB/NI trade in his press conference in Northern Ireland</a>, and he covered quite a lot of ground, giving sometimes interesting answers.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said that he wanted to see county lines drug gangs \u201ctotally wound up\u201d. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to see crime come down. I want to see the county lines drugs gangs wound up, rolled up. They are reducing the quality of life for people across our country, they are killing young kids. I want to see that thing totally wound up.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a fine ambition, but Johnson did not give details of any how this might happen and, as a goal, it may not be realistic. But perhaps people won\u2019t mind if they believe that at least he is trying.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He described Brexit as one of his \u201cleast favourite subjects\u201d.</strong> When the presenter, <strong>Dan Walker,</strong> turned to Brexit, saying it was one of Johnson\u2019s favourite subjects, Johnson replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is one of my least favourite subjects, because we need to move on.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is not the first time that Johnson has made this point, but it does reinforce suggestions that the man who led the Vote Leave campaign in 2016 is not convinced that the whole project has been an undiluted triumph.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to rule out the UK and the EU failing to reach a trade deal by the end of this year.</strong> Asked what the chances were of the two sides achieving a comprehensive trade deal by the end of this year, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s very likely. I\u2019m not going to give you a percentage.</p> </blockquote> <p>When Walker put it to him that in the past he had sounded more confident than this, Johnson revised his language. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Enormously likely, how about that? Epically likely ... Obviously you always have to budget for a complete failure of common sense. That goes without saying. But I am very, very, very confident - three verys there - that we will get [a deal].</p> </blockquote> <p>In the past other ministers, like Michael Gove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/michael-gove-promises-brexit-trade-deal-with-eu-by-end-of-2020\">(here)</a>, have categorically ruled out the UK and the EU failing to agree a trade deal by the end of 2020. Perhaps Johnson\u2019s relative reticence was explained by Walker\u2019s inclusion of the word \u201ccomprehensive\u201d in his question. Most experts think a basic \u201cbare bones\u201d trade deal could be negotiated before the end of this year, but not a comprehensive one. Ursula Von der Leyen, the European commission president, has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/08/brexit-pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-to-tell-eu-chief-at-first-meeting-that-trade-deal-wont-be-based-on-alignment-live-news?page=with:block-5e15db3a8f087e8308e6ab0d#block-5e15db3a8f087e8308e6ab0d\">there won\u2019t be time to negotiate a full deal before the end of this year.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to give a firm commitment to saving the regional airline Flybe, but said the government was strongly committed to regional connectivity.</strong> Asked if the government would step in to help the firm, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it\u2019s not for government to step in and save companies that simply run into trouble. But be in no doubt that we see the importance of Flybe in delivering connectivity across the whole United Kingdom. It\u2019s very important, for instance, where I was yesterday in Northern Ireland. </p> </blockquote> <p>When pressed on what the government might do, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can\u2019t go into commercially confident discussions ... We\u2019re working very hard to do what we can. But obviously people will understand that there are limits commercially to what a government can do to rescue any particular firm.</p> <p>But what we will do is ensure that we have the regional connectivity that this country needs, and that is part of our agenda of uniting and levelling up. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to say whether the Chinese company Huawei would be allowed a role in constructing the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure network</strong>. Asked about this, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The British public deserve to have access to the best possible technology. I\u2019ve talked about infrastructure and technology. We want to put in gigabit broadband for everybody. </p> <p>Now if people oppose one brand or another, then they have to tell us what\u2019s the alternative.</p> <p>On the other hand, let\u2019s be clear. I don\u2019t want as UK prime minister to put in any infrastructure that is going to prejudice our national security or our ability to cooperate with five eyes intelligence partners.</p> </blockquote> <p>The American government has been strongly urging the UK to boycott Huawei, claiming that it would pose a security threat (because in practice Huawei is under the control of the Chinese government). But there are also claims that the US opposition to Huawei is to a large extent driven by commercial considerations, as much as security ones, and the head of MI5 has said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/12/huawei-technology-poses-no-threat-to-uk-security-ex-mi5-head\">he does not believe the US would cut off security cooperation with the UK, as it threatens to do, if the UK does award contracts to Huawei.</a> It is impossible to tell what the UK will decide on the basis of Johnson\u2019s answer, but he sounded less inclined to boycott Huawei than in previous answers he has given to this question. For example, compare today\u2019s words with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/04/general-election-tories-juggle-trump-nato-and-campaigning-live?page=with:block-5de7d1988f083546b1e00fd9#block-5de7d1988f083546b1e00fd9\">what he said on this at the Nato summit in December.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said he expected the intelligence and security committee\u2019s report on Russian interference in UK politics to be published within weeks, but claimed that it would not be as sensational as critics assumed.</strong> He said: </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I happen to have to read it, and I think that after all that awful clamour in the election campaign people are going to be disappointed. But, anyway, it will appear.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for when it would be published, he said that he thought that would be within weeks. But he admitted he did not know for sure. The report won\u2019t be published until a new ISC has been set up, and that is not happening quickly.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said he would announce a plan for reforming social care this year, and implement it during this parliament.</strong> Asked why he had not done this already, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will bring forward a plan this year and we will get it done within this parliament. This is a big, big thing. I mean, this is a potentially massive change in the way we fund social care, and we\u2019ve got to get it right.</p> <p>We have got to think very carefully about how we do it because there are lots of quite important moral and social issues contained in it.</p> <p>You know, should taxpayers be paying for people who might be able to afford it? What is the relationship you want to encourage, should families be looking after their own, their elderly relatives [and] to what extent?</p> <p>All these are very complex questions. The key thing is that everybody must have safety and security in their old age, nobody should sell their home to pay for the cost of that care. We will do that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Johnson was unable to explain to Walker why he was taking so long to publish his plan when he claimed in July last year, on the day be became PM, to already had a plan.<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/boris-johnsons-first-speech-as-prime-minister-24-july-2019\"> In his first speech from No 10</a> Johnson said: \u201cI am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said the chances of the Americans extraditing Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an intelligence official accused of killing Harry Dunn in a road accident, were \u201cvery low\u201d. </strong>Asked about this case, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that it\u2019s right that we made the appeal for extradition ... I think the chances of America actually responding by sending Anne Sacoolas to this country are very low. That\u2019s not what they do.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that he should have ended his New Year holiday early to return to deal with the Iran crisis.</strong> Asked about this, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was not in this country but I worked very hard, as you can imagine, in making sure there was a European response.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He praised the Iranians for taking responsibility for shooting down the Ukrainian passenger airliner. </strong>He said</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m glad the Iranians have accepted responsibility and identified it as an appalling mistake and it does appear that it was a mistake.</p> <p>It is very important that the bodies are repatriated in a dignified way and that the families are allowed to grieve and to have closure.</p> <p>Clearly, as President Rouhani has said, Iran made a terrible mistake. It is good they have apologised.</p> <p>The most important thing now is that tensions in the region calm down.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson urged President Trump to come up with a replacement for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the deal with Iran that ensured it abandoned work on acquiring a nuclear bomb.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we are going to get rid of it then we need a replacement.</p> <p>The problem with the JCPOA \u2013 this is the crucial thing, it\u2019s why there is this tension \u2013 the problem with the agreement is that from the American perspective it\u2019s a flawed agreement, it expires, plus it was negotiated by President Obama. From their point of view it has many, many faults.</p> <p>If we are going to get rid of it, let\u2019s replace it and let\u2019s replace it with the Trump deal. That\u2019s what we need to see. I think that would be a great way forward. President Trump is a great deal-maker - by his own account and many others. Let\u2019s work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson played down reports that he intends to keep a relatively low media profile as PM. </strong>At the weekend there were reports that he decision to let Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, take the lead in briefing MPs on the Iran crisis was part of a plan not to hog the limelight on all issues facing government. Asked if this meant he would be a \u201csubmarine\u201d PM, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In terms of the submarine, the submarine is crashing through the ice flows ... the conning tower is emerging through the ice floes right now. Here I am talking to you. I gave two press conferences yesterday. I want to be as available as I possibly can.</p> <p>But I do believe in cabinet government. I do believe in the strength of our cabinet, they\u2019re a fantastically able bunch of people. I want them to be leading ... I want people who who are excited about their work and want to deliver for the people of this country.</p> </blockquote> <p>Since the general election Johnson has kept a relatively low media profile. It remains to be seen whether this will continue, but this probably is a deliberate strategy. Prime ministers often define themselves in contrast to their predecessors, and Johnson may well be keen to show that he is not like David Cameron, who was very keen on recording short clips for broadcasters giving his views on the story of the day.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson said he was confident that the royal family would resolve the Harry/Meghan crisis.</strong> But he refused to comment on the story in detail, saying it was best for politicians not to interfere. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My view on this is very straightforward: I am a massive fan, like most of our viewers, of the Queen and the royal family as a fantastic asset for our country. I\u2019m absolutely confident that they are going to sort this out. </p> <p>But they are going to sort it out much more easily without a running commentary from politicians.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He suggested that the government was working on a plan to allow people to contribute to the cost of allowing Ben Ben to chime on 31 January to mark Brexit. </strong>The Commons authorities have ruled this out because interfering with the Big Ben restoration project to allow the bell to be rung at the end of the month would cost \u00a3500,000. Asked about this, Johnson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bongs cost \u00a3500,000 but we\u2019re working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong because there are some people who want to.</p> <p>Because Big Ben is being refurbished, they seem to have taken the clapper away, so we need to restore the clapper in order to bong Big Ben on Brexit night.</p> <p>And that is expensive, so we\u2019re looking at whether the public can fund it.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was not clear whether or not Johnson was joking.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he had considered doing veganuary, but he said that giving up cheese was \u201cjust a crime\u201d.</strong> But he did also say that he hoped to lose some weight in 2020.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a80f540687f9d92526213e81dd097718a7663d50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a80f540687f9d92526213e81dd097718a7663d50/139_401_1732_1038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson being interviewed by Dan Walker (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson being interviewed by Dan Walker (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Breakfast/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-14T12:50:59.125Z\">at 12.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1d7c3f8f088d80a182a81d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-14T08:34:30.584Z\">8.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Johnson says he wants to see county lines drugs gangs 'totally wound up'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There were various news lines in that interview, but perhaps the most surprising line came when Johnson announced that he wanted to end county lines drug dealing.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has written to Nicola Sturgeon to formally reject her request for the transfer of powers necessary to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence. In response, Sturgeon has said that the PM\u2019s stance will increase support for independence. (See 12.27pm.) Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, has said he backs home rule for Scotland. (See 4.13pm.) Britain, France and Germany have kickstarted a process that could lead to United Nations sanctions being reimposed on Iran and the collapse of the 2015 nuclear deal, after triggering the deal\u2019s dispute resolution mechanism. Addressing MPs, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said the UK was still committed to the deal \u2013 even though Boris Johnson this morning said President Trump should work up a new deal to replace it. (See 1.25pm.) Britain believes the information dramatically presented by a delegation from Donald Trump\u2019s administration about the risks of using Huawei technology in 5G networks contains nothing its intelligence agencies had not foreseen. Boris Johnson has refused to rule out the UK and the EU failing to agree a post-Brexit trade deal by the end of this year. This was one of many lines that emerged from an interview that Johnson gave to BBC Breakfast this morning. See 10.03am for a full summary. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has said that there will be checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland after Brexit under arrangements set out in the withdrawal agreement. Yesterday Boris Johnson claimed that this was not the case. (See 3.32pm.) Emergency talks were taking place between the chancellor, Sajid Javid, and the business and transport departments, amid attempts to ensure the survival of Flybe, Europe\u2019s largest regional carrier. The Labour party has opened the scheme allowing people to pay \u00a325 so that they can vote in the leadership contest as a registered supporter. Applications will only be allowed for 48 hours, with the scheme closing at 5pm on Thursday. Jess Phillips, a Labour leadership candidate, has used an article in the Guardian to argue that citizens\u2019 assemblies should be used to shape climate crisis policy. (See 5.02pm.) Boris Johnson\u2019s assertion that the wife of a US intelligence officer charged with causing the death by dangerous driving of the 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn is unlikely to be sent back to the UK to face trial is misconceived, a spokesman for the teenager\u2019s family has said. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has said that Britain remains \u201copen\u201d to participating in the Erasmus+ EU student exchange programme after Brexit \u2013 although he also said the government was looking at alternatives. Speaking in the Queen\u2019s speech debate he said: As we prepare to forge a new place on the international stage, we want our young people to have the opportunity to study abroad through exchange programmes. The United Kingdom is open to participation in the next Erasmus+ programme and this will be a question for future negotiations with the European Union. We do truly understand the value that such exchange programmes bring all students right across the United Kingdom, but to ensure we\u2019re able to continue to offer that, we\u2019ll also develop our own alternative arrangements should they be needed. A new offence relating to possession of terrorist propaganda that glorifies or encourages extremism could be introduced to toughen up UK anti-terror laws. An energetic if perhaps niche campaign to ensure the chimes of Big Ben sound at the moment of Brexit on 31 January appears doomed after Commons authorities played down the idea, while a funding plan promised by Boris Johnson to pay for it turned out to not exist. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The Labour leadership candidate Jess Phillips has also written an article for the Guardian setting out a six-point plan for restoring trust in politics. Her proposals included: a fairer voting system; using citizen assemblies to shape climate crisis policy; voting at 16, with people being automatically enrolled on the electoral register when they get a national insurance number; and a body to regulate online political advertising. It is all quite constructive and high-minded. In the article she also describes Boris Johnson as a \u201cblond baboon\u201d, which is less constructive and high-minded. First, we need to be honest, even if that\u2019s uncomfortable. On social care we need to be clear that looking after the elderly will require people to contribute more in tax. When we\u2019re asked whether immigration is too high, instead of fudging a response, let\u2019s say what we think: no, it isn\u2019t. The public isn\u2019t stupid \u2013 people know when we\u2019re trying to avoid saying something. Second, we need a new approach in order to reach decisions on long-term challenges. On climate breakdown, we need a plan that involves the public much more. Citizens\u2019 assemblies are increasingly used around the world to build consensus. In Ireland, they helped pave the way for the historic changes on abortion, while in Poland they improved government response to major flooding. It\u2019s time we used them here. Here is an extract. Here is Newsnight\u2019s diplomatic editor, Mark Urban, on our story about the latest Westminster response to US concerns about Huawei. Jess Phillips has released details of some of the people who will be running her campaign for the Labour leadership. Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, and Melanie Onn, the former Labour MP for Great Grimsby, are the campaign chairs. Here are the other appointments from the Phillips press release. Alicia Kennedy is the campaign director. Alicia is a Labour peer, a former deputy general secretary of the Labour party and was until recently chief of staff to the deputy leader Rachel Kinnock, is overseeing visits and campaign events Caroline Badley who is heading up operations Ruth Smeeth leads on stakeholder engagement Matt Goddin is heading up the field team supported by Steph Lloyd and Labour Students chair Rania Ramli Francis Grove-White, formerly of the Labour party head office and the People\u2019s Vote campaign will be leading on political strategy Blair McDougall, who was chief strategist at Better Together, and Will Straw, former executive director of the Stronger In campaign, will act as advisors, particularly on winning again in Scotland and championing a close relationship for Britain with Europe after Brexit The Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has now issued his own statement about Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to rule out letting Scotland hold another independence referendum. It goes further than the statement from Scottish Labour earlier. (See 1.42pm.) Leonard says: I have long argued that the future of Scotland will be won and lost in Scotland, and not on the banks of the river Thames. Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to block a second independence referendum in perpetuity does not change this. And it is spectacular naively to think this will close the issue down. It will only inflame the debate, as Boris Johnson\u2019s history of demagoguery and division shows he is well practiced in doing. Scotland and the whole UK are deeply unequal societies which desperately need radical change. But the Tories are hell-bent on destroying what is left of the welfare state, and the SNP are advocating a decade of cuts in a separate Scottish state. The people of Scotland rejected independence in 2014, but Scotland remains divided. I believe that home rule within the UK is the only viable option that stands a chance of healing the divisions in our society. We can\u2019t wait for a UK Labour government to deliver this, so we must demand it now and mobilise for radical change. While Leonard has long been a thoughtful advocate of federalism, I\u2019m pretty sure that this is the first time he has talked about home rule specifically since he became leader. Former UK Labour leader Gordon Brown has regularly advocated sweeping powers for the Scottish parliament under a federal UK state, describing it as \u201cunifying\u201d third option between the status quo and independence. In the Financial Times\u2019 regular lunchtime Brexit briefing email, George Parker says there was a \u201ccurious change of tone\u201d in what Boris Johnson said about the prospects of getting a UK-EU trade deal before the end of 2020 in his BBC interview this morning. (See 10.03am.) Parker explains: Boris Johnson spent the general election campaign saying there was \u201cabsolutely zero\u201d chance that Britain and the EU would not agree a trade deal by his self-imposed deadline of December 2020, but on Tuesday something changed. Rather than sticking to his script, the prime minister told BBC\u2019s Breakfast programme that it was only \u201cepically likely\u201d that a deal would be in place, admitting one could not account for \u201ca complete failure of common sense\u201d. It is a curious change of tone. Mr Johnson\u2019s previous categoric assertion that a deal would be done in 11 months was intended to close down speculation about what he would do in the event of a \u201cno trade deal\u201d Brexit on January 1 2021. Now he will have stoked business concerns that such an outcome, with Britain trading on World Trade Organization terms, is again a possibility. Tariffs, quotas, paperwork and queues at Dover won\u2019t make it a very happy new year for business. Or is Mr Johnson, whose \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d rhetoric about Brexit day last October turned out to be just rhetoric, leaving the door ajar for a possible extension to the transition period \u2014 something explicitly ruled out in the Conservative manifesto? The County Councils Network, which represents counties in England, has welcomed what Boris Johnson said in his BBC interview this morning about tackling county lines drug dealing. (See 10.03am.) Sam Corcoran, the leader of Cheshire East council and the CCN\u2019s environment and communities spokesperson, said: Today\u2019s comments from the prime minister shows that tackling county lines is a real priority for this government. Drug crime and serious youth violence are too often seen as \u2018urban\u2019 problems far removed from the rural shires. However, over recent years the largest proportional increases in knife crime have been in county areas, substantially so in some places, which our members attribute to the growing reach of county lines crime and exploitation into rural areas. This is a complex issue, and one that will need local organisations working together to eradicate county lines in their areas. County authorities must be part of any solution, and need adequate levels of funding to protect vulnerable young people who end up being exploited by drugs gangs. At the same time, our communities would benefit from an increased police presence \u2013 so it is imperative that a rise in police numbers is reflected across the country, not just urban areas. Newt Gingrich, the leading US Republican and a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, seems a bit alarmed by the line Boris Johnson took on Huawei in his BBC interview this morning. (See 10.03am.) Britain believes the information dramatically presented by a delegation from Donald Trump\u2019s administration about the risks of using Huawei technology in 5G networks contains nothing its intelligence agencies had not foreseen, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, was speaking in the European parliament earlier. According to Daniel Ferrie, a European commission spokesman, Barnier insisted that the Northern Ireland protocol (the post-Brexit arrangement negotiated by Boris Johnson keeping Northern Ireland in the single market, as an alternative to the backstop) would involve checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland. Yesterday Johnson claimed that there would be no such checks. A Labour peer has been suspended by the party after the first investigation under the Lords\u2019 new misonduct system found he harassed two women, one of whom accused him of \u201cstalker-ish\u201d behaviour. The report by Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, the Lords commissioner for standards, found that David Lea, a former trade unionist made a peer in 2019, had been the subject of 18 complaints between 2011 and 2019, including shouting at or otherwise bullying staff, making a racially offensive remark, and inappropriate behaviour towards a woman. One of these complaints, by a woman named only as AB, was made in 2018, but resubmitted last year after the introduction of the revised Lords code of conduct focused on better combating bullying and harassment. AB said she was left distressed after Lord Lea, whom she had joined on an official parliamentary visit some years ago but had no dealings with since, sent her a package including a framed photo of them on the visit. It also included a letter inviting her to his house, and saying he had a copy of the photo on his piano at home. AB said this felt \u201cslightly stalkerish\u201d. Lord Lea, 82, told the inquiry that while he apologised he did not understand why AB had been upset, \u201cunless she had some feelings of affection for me\u201d. The other complaint, which was made separately, came from a woman identified as TU, who said that when she was alone in the room where she worked he would repeatedly come in to talk, asking her to come for a cup of tea with him, and once promised to write her a sexually suggestive poem. TU told the inquiry: \u201cI just want to be able to come to work, do my job and be a work person rather than a woman at work.\u201d Scott-Moncrieff said both cases constituted harassment, with Lea agreeing to undergo training. A Labour Lords spokesman said: The chief whip has informed Lord Lea that he is suspended from the Labour peers group until further notice. We appreciate that David has already begun the recommended training and further discussions will be had once that course has been completed to the satisfaction of the commissioner. Anyone wanting to understand fully Brexit could do a lot worse than trying to make sense of the obsession that a few Brexiters have with getting Big Ben to chime to mark the moment when the UK leaves the EU. Normally Big Ben chimes every hour, but it has been silenced for some time because of a four-year restoration programme. This is a tale that tells you something about the Brexiters\u2019 preoccupation with history, tradition and symbolism, as well as about the way some newspaper coverage operates in a curious grey zone between the serious and the absurd. All this helps to explain why 60 Tory Brexiters wrote to the Sunday Telegraph at the weekend demanding that Big Ben should bong for Brexit. And it explains why Boris Johnson himself felt obliged to make a concession to this nonsense in his BBC interview this morning by floating the idea of having some sort of public appeal to pay for Brexit bongs. (See 10.03am.) Johnson did, though, seem to acknowledge that it would be be unreasonable to expect the government to pay the \u00a3500,000 cost of getting Big Ben to chime on 31 January. And today the House of Commons commission has put out a press notice explaining why it would cost so much. Here\u2019s an extract. For the bell to ring on 31 January, the temporary striking mechanism used for Remembrance Sunday and New Year\u2019s Eve would need to be reattached and tested to ensure the timing is correct. Alongside this work, a temporary floor of the belfry where Big Ben is housed, would also need to be installed as extensive work is currently taking place in this area. The cost for the temporary floor and installing, testing and striking Big Ben would be approximately \u00a3120,000. In addition to the set-up, the delay to work in the belfry would push back the planned programme of work by two to four weeks \u2013 with each week of delays costing approximately \u00a3100,000 a week. As such, the minimum cost of sounding Big Ben would be \u00a3320,000 \u2013 but could be much higher (up to \u00a3500,00). Based on this information, the commission felt that this extra expenditure could not be justified, but will respond to any change to this decision made by the house. In a statement explaining why the commission did not support spending this money, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, said: The commission believes it is important to weigh up the costs this would involve if Big Ben is to chime on 31 January. You are talking about \u00a350,000 a bong. We also have to bear in mind that the only people who will hear it will be those who live near or are visiting Westminster. This is from Carwyn Jones, the former first minister of Wales. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has welcomed his tweet. Scottish Labour has provided a suitably non-committal response to Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to grant Holyrood the powers to hold a second independence referendum. The party\u2019s spokesperson for the constitution, Alex Rowley, said: The immediate priority for both the prime minister and the first minister should be minimising the damage caused by Brexit. There are conversations to be had in the future about other issues, but at the moment the focus should be on protecting Scotland\u2019s interests in the face of our imminent exit from the EU. Regular readers will know that these \u201cconversations\u201d lately have included the Scottish Labour executive rejecting last Saturday leader Richard Leonard\u2019s proposals for a special conference on federalism. Leonard was proposing that the party consider supporting a multi-option referendum on independence, but the party instead decided to hold a private \u201caway day\u201d to decide its future policy on the union. Since Scottish Labour\u2019s disastrous election result, a number of senior Labour figures, including defeated Scottish MPs, have said the party needs to accept the case for a referendum, and also consider splitting away from the UK party. In his BBC interview Boris Johnson also spoke about the considerations he will take into account when deciding whether or not to allow the Chinese firm Huawei a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network. (See 10.03am.) Australia banned Huawei from its 5G networks in 2018 and, in an interview on the World at One, the former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the UK would be potentially vulnerable if it used the Chinese firm for this work. He said: 5G means it isn\u2019t possible to separate the sensitive parts of the network with the bulk of it, so we concluded that it wasn\u2019t acceptable for high-risk vendors to provide 5G infrastructure in Australia. Turnbull said Chinese telecoms companies like Huawei were obliged to assist their intelligence services. And he claimed that the \u201cfive eyes\u201d countries - the five English speaking countries that share intelligence (the US, the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand) had been too complacent about the threat posed by the company. He said: The five eyes countries have been asleep at the switch in allowing China to own most of the companies that possess the capability to provide 5G networks. In his BBC interview this morning Boris Johnson said President Trump should work on a replacement for the the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the deal with Iran that ensured it abandoned work on acquiring a nuclear bomb. (See 10.03am.) His comment coincided with the UK, France and Germany \u2013 the E3, the three individual EU states that were party to the JCPOA \u2013 issuing a statement accusing Iran of not meeting its obligations under the deal, and triggering the dispute mechanism. Here is the text of the statement from the E3. And here is my colleague Patrick Wintour\u2019s story on this. In the Commons Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has just delivered a statement explaining the reasons behind the E3 statement. According to the statement, the E3 are still committed to making the JCPOA work. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, asked Raab why Boris Johnson was calling for a replacement to the JCPOA in his BBC interview if it was official government policy to maintain it. She told MPs: So, in the space of two or three days, the prime minister has gone from signing a joint statement with France and Germany calling for the retention and restoration of the JCPOA to calling for it to be scrapped and replaced by some mythical Trump deal. Responding to Thornberry, Raab said that Johnson fully supported the JCPOA, and that it was Iran that was threatening the agreement. He also said it was not just President Trump who had argued for a broader deal with Iran; President Macron was making that case too, Raab said. He said the UK government thought the JCPOA was \u201cthe best available deal for restraining Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions\u201d. But he also said the UK was \u201cfully open to a broader initiative which would address not just the nuclear concerns but the broader concerns around the destabilising activity that we have seen recently\u201d. In the Commons the transport minister Paul Maynard is responding to an urgent question about Flybe. But he has not revealed much about the government\u2019s intentions. He said the government was working hard on what it might do to support the company, but he refused to go into detail. And he said he would not comment on reports that air passenger duty could be cut to help the airline. APD was a matter for the Treasury, he said. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has issued this response to Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to rule out allowing Scotland to hold another independence referendum. (See 11.22am.) She accuses Johnson of showing \u201cutter contempt for the votes, views and interest of the people of Scotland\u201d. And she claims that the PM\u2019s stance will end up being self-defeating. She explains: The problem for the UK government is that the longer they try to block a referendum, the more they demonstrate that the Westminster union is not a partnership of equals and the more support for independence will grow. It will also mean for the Tories that the loss of half of their seats suffered at the recent general election - fought by them on the sole issue of opposition to an independence referendum - will be only the start of their road back to political oblivion in Scotland. In short, as well as being unsustainable, the position set out today by the UK government is also an entirely self-defeating one. Ireland is to hold a general election on Saturday 8 February, RTE is reporting. RTE has full coverage on a live blog. Labour leadership hopeful Jess Phillips is visiting Glasgow today where she\u2019ll be meeting Labour activists later on. Scottish Labour is still smarting from the loss of all its Scottish MPs but one in last December\u2019s general election, and at a meeting of the Scottish executive on Saturday rejected leader Richard Leonards proposals for a special conference on federalism, which could have seen the party support a multi-option referendum on independence. Phillips has been one of the few leadership candidates so far to take head-on the issue of Scotland and Scottish independence \u2013 yesterday she got involved in a Twitter spat with first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, arguing that \u201cthe SNP\u2019s abject failings on education and health show that it is your administration that remains a threat to opportunity and equality for working people in Scotland.\u201d Today Phillips is expected to reinforce her message, pledging that a Labour party led by her would be \u201c100 per cent committed to the union\u201d. A slightly curious feud between No 10 and Good Morning Britain (GMB), ITV\u2019s breakfast programme, has escalated after host Piers Morgan rang Boris Johnson\u2019s head of communications to protest at the PM giving an interview to the BBC rather than them. The tension dates back to the election, when GMB sent a camera crew to Pudsey in West Yorkshire to ambush Johnson on an early-morning campaign visit to a dairy company after being denied an interview. Johnson escaped into a fridge, although Downing Street aides insisted he was not hiding. The PM gave his first post-New Year TV interview to BBC1\u2019s Breakfast. Morgan appeared to learn this live on air, and decided to phone Lee Cain, the No 10 communications chief. \u201cI\u2019m just going to call Lee Cain. He\u2019s the Downing Street press officer that keep betraying us,\u201d Morgan said. Cain did not answer, so Morgan left him a message: We\u2019ve just found out that you\u2019ve betrayed us and given another interview with Boris to BBC Breakfast, and you\u2019ve also banned all your cabinet from coming on the show. So we\u2019re going to play games with you too. I\u2019m going to ring you live on air every day that I\u2019m here until you stop this pathetic, childish behaviour, and you start honouring your promises. So good morning Lee, have a good day. Saying that he enjoyed \u201ca good feud\u201d, Morgan also called for action from Johnson\u2019s press secretary, Robert Oxley, who shielded the PM during the dairy company visit: \u201cMr Oxley, what\u2019s his name? He\u2019s the one who was jostling our reporter.\u201d Before Christmas Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, formally wrote to Boris Johnson requesting a section 30 order - permission under section 30 of the Scotland Act for Scotland to hold a referendum on independence. She enclosed with her letter a 38-page report (pdf) published by the Scottish government explaining why the Scottish government believes a second referendum is justified. In his letter Johnson rejects the request \u2013 not just for now (which was the line used by Theresa May when she rejected Sturgeon first request for a second independence referendum after the Brexit vote), or until the next Holyrood elections in 2021 (the line used by Jeremy Corbyn in the general election). He rejects it for the foreseeable future, on the grounds that Scotland settled this matter in the 2104 referendum. He says: You and your predecessor made a personal promise that the 2014 independence referendum was a \u201conce in a generation\u201d vote ... The UK government will continue to uphold the democratic decision of the Scottish people and the promise that you made to them. For that reason, I cannot agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums. Another independence referendum would continue the political stagnation that Scotland has seen for the last decade, with Scottish schools, hospitals and jobs again left behind because of the campaign to separate the UK. This is not unexpected. During the election campaign Johnson repeatedly said he would not allow a second independence referendum, claiming that if Labour were elected the UK would end up having two further referendums, on Brexit and on Scottish independence. These are from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll on Boris Johnson\u2019s interview, and what he said about Brexit. (See 10.03am.) John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said that it would be a mistake for the government to cut air passenger duty to help the regional airline Flybe. This option is being considered. But McDonnell said in a statement: Bailing out a company through a tax cut across the industry is not the way forward. Working with the company and unions, the government should look at targeted assistance to support routes judged on economic, environmental and social grounds. That was Boris Johnson\u2019s first interview of 2020, and his first extensive broadcast interview since the general election. It wasn\u2019t one for the history books, it wasn\u2019t over-forensic, and perhaps the main takeaway is that Johnson has just as prone to using bluster, evasion and hyperbole when faced with difficult questions as he was before he went on his New Year holiday. Still, he was not untruthful in the way that he was yesterday, when talking about post-Brexit GB/NI trade in his press conference in Northern Ireland, and he covered quite a lot of ground, giving sometimes interesting answers. Here are the main points. Johnson said that he wanted to see county lines drug gangs \u201ctotally wound up\u201d. He said: I want to see crime come down. I want to see the county lines drugs gangs wound up, rolled up. They are reducing the quality of life for people across our country, they are killing young kids. I want to see that thing totally wound up. This is a fine ambition, but Johnson did not give details of any how this might happen and, as a goal, it may not be realistic. But perhaps people won\u2019t mind if they believe that at least he is trying. He described Brexit as one of his \u201cleast favourite subjects\u201d. When the presenter, Dan Walker, turned to Brexit, saying it was one of Johnson\u2019s favourite subjects, Johnson replied: It is one of my least favourite subjects, because we need to move on. This is not the first time that Johnson has made this point, but it does reinforce suggestions that the man who led the Vote Leave campaign in 2016 is not convinced that the whole project has been an undiluted triumph. He refused to rule out the UK and the EU failing to reach a trade deal by the end of this year. Asked what the chances were of the two sides achieving a comprehensive trade deal by the end of this year, he replied: I think it\u2019s very likely. I\u2019m not going to give you a percentage. When Walker put it to him that in the past he had sounded more confident than this, Johnson revised his language. He said: Enormously likely, how about that? Epically likely ... Obviously you always have to budget for a complete failure of common sense. That goes without saying. But I am very, very, very confident - three verys there - that we will get [a deal]. In the past other ministers, like Michael Gove (here), have categorically ruled out the UK and the EU failing to agree a trade deal by the end of 2020. Perhaps Johnson\u2019s relative reticence was explained by Walker\u2019s inclusion of the word \u201ccomprehensive\u201d in his question. Most experts think a basic \u201cbare bones\u201d trade deal could be negotiated before the end of this year, but not a comprehensive one. Ursula Von der Leyen, the European commission president, has said there won\u2019t be time to negotiate a full deal before the end of this year. He refused to give a firm commitment to saving the regional airline Flybe, but said the government was strongly committed to regional connectivity. Asked if the government would step in to help the firm, he replied: Well, it\u2019s not for government to step in and save companies that simply run into trouble. But be in no doubt that we see the importance of Flybe in delivering connectivity across the whole United Kingdom. It\u2019s very important, for instance, where I was yesterday in Northern Ireland. When pressed on what the government might do, he replied: I can\u2019t go into commercially confident discussions ... We\u2019re working very hard to do what we can. But obviously people will understand that there are limits commercially to what a government can do to rescue any particular firm. But what we will do is ensure that we have the regional connectivity that this country needs, and that is part of our agenda of uniting and levelling up. He refused to say whether the Chinese company Huawei would be allowed a role in constructing the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure network. Asked about this, he said: The British public deserve to have access to the best possible technology. I\u2019ve talked about infrastructure and technology. We want to put in gigabit broadband for everybody. Now if people oppose one brand or another, then they have to tell us what\u2019s the alternative. On the other hand, let\u2019s be clear. I don\u2019t want as UK prime minister to put in any infrastructure that is going to prejudice our national security or our ability to cooperate with five eyes intelligence partners. The American government has been strongly urging the UK to boycott Huawei, claiming that it would pose a security threat (because in practice Huawei is under the control of the Chinese government). But there are also claims that the US opposition to Huawei is to a large extent driven by commercial considerations, as much as security ones, and the head of MI5 has said that he does not believe the US would cut off security cooperation with the UK, as it threatens to do, if the UK does award contracts to Huawei. It is impossible to tell what the UK will decide on the basis of Johnson\u2019s answer, but he sounded less inclined to boycott Huawei than in previous answers he has given to this question. For example, compare today\u2019s words with what he said on this at the Nato summit in December. Johnson said he expected the intelligence and security committee\u2019s report on Russian interference in UK politics to be published within weeks, but claimed that it would not be as sensational as critics assumed. He said: I happen to have to read it, and I think that after all that awful clamour in the election campaign people are going to be disappointed. But, anyway, it will appear. As for when it would be published, he said that he thought that would be within weeks. But he admitted he did not know for sure. The report won\u2019t be published until a new ISC has been set up, and that is not happening quickly. Johnson said he would announce a plan for reforming social care this year, and implement it during this parliament. Asked why he had not done this already, he said: We will bring forward a plan this year and we will get it done within this parliament. This is a big, big thing. I mean, this is a potentially massive change in the way we fund social care, and we\u2019ve got to get it right. We have got to think very carefully about how we do it because there are lots of quite important moral and social issues contained in it. You know, should taxpayers be paying for people who might be able to afford it? What is the relationship you want to encourage, should families be looking after their own, their elderly relatives [and] to what extent? All these are very complex questions. The key thing is that everybody must have safety and security in their old age, nobody should sell their home to pay for the cost of that care. We will do that. Johnson was unable to explain to Walker why he was taking so long to publish his plan when he claimed in July last year, on the day be became PM, to already had a plan. In his first speech from No 10 Johnson said: \u201cI am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.\u201d He said the chances of the Americans extraditing Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an intelligence official accused of killing Harry Dunn in a road accident, were \u201cvery low\u201d. Asked about this case, he said: I think that it\u2019s right that we made the appeal for extradition ... I think the chances of America actually responding by sending Anne Sacoolas to this country are very low. That\u2019s not what they do. He rejected claims that he should have ended his New Year holiday early to return to deal with the Iran crisis. Asked about this, he said: I was not in this country but I worked very hard, as you can imagine, in making sure there was a European response. He praised the Iranians for taking responsibility for shooting down the Ukrainian passenger airliner. He said I\u2019m glad the Iranians have accepted responsibility and identified it as an appalling mistake and it does appear that it was a mistake. It is very important that the bodies are repatriated in a dignified way and that the families are allowed to grieve and to have closure. Clearly, as President Rouhani has said, Iran made a terrible mistake. It is good they have apologised. The most important thing now is that tensions in the region calm down. Johnson urged President Trump to come up with a replacement for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the deal with Iran that ensured it abandoned work on acquiring a nuclear bomb. He said: If we are going to get rid of it then we need a replacement. The problem with the JCPOA \u2013 this is the crucial thing, it\u2019s why there is this tension \u2013 the problem with the agreement is that from the American perspective it\u2019s a flawed agreement, it expires, plus it was negotiated by President Obama. From their point of view it has many, many faults. If we are going to get rid of it, let\u2019s replace it and let\u2019s replace it with the Trump deal. That\u2019s what we need to see. I think that would be a great way forward. President Trump is a great deal-maker - by his own account and many others. Let\u2019s work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead. Johnson played down reports that he intends to keep a relatively low media profile as PM. At the weekend there were reports that he decision to let Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, take the lead in briefing MPs on the Iran crisis was part of a plan not to hog the limelight on all issues facing government. Asked if this meant he would be a \u201csubmarine\u201d PM, he replied: In terms of the submarine, the submarine is crashing through the ice flows ... the conning tower is emerging through the ice floes right now. Here I am talking to you. I gave two press conferences yesterday. I want to be as available as I possibly can. But I do believe in cabinet government. I do believe in the strength of our cabinet, they\u2019re a fantastically able bunch of people. I want them to be leading ... I want people who who are excited about their work and want to deliver for the people of this country. Since the general election Johnson has kept a relatively low media profile. It remains to be seen whether this will continue, but this probably is a deliberate strategy. Prime ministers often define themselves in contrast to their predecessors, and Johnson may well be keen to show that he is not like David Cameron, who was very keen on recording short clips for broadcasters giving his views on the story of the day. Johnson said he was confident that the royal family would resolve the Harry/Meghan crisis. But he refused to comment on the story in detail, saying it was best for politicians not to interfere. He said: My view on this is very straightforward: I am a massive fan, like most of our viewers, of the Queen and the royal family as a fantastic asset for our country. I\u2019m absolutely confident that they are going to sort this out. But they are going to sort it out much more easily without a running commentary from politicians. He suggested that the government was working on a plan to allow people to contribute to the cost of allowing Ben Ben to chime on 31 January to mark Brexit. The Commons authorities have ruled this out because interfering with the Big Ben restoration project to allow the bell to be rung at the end of the month would cost \u00a3500,000. Asked about this, Johnson said: The bongs cost \u00a3500,000 but we\u2019re working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong because there are some people who want to. Because Big Ben is being refurbished, they seem to have taken the clapper away, so we need to restore the clapper in order to bong Big Ben on Brexit night. And that is expensive, so we\u2019re looking at whether the public can fund it. It was not clear whether or not Johnson was joking. He said that he had considered doing veganuary, but he said that giving up cheese was \u201cjust a crime\u201d. But he did also say that he hoped to lose some weight in 2020. There were various news lines in that interview, but perhaps the most surprising line came when Johnson announced that he wanted to end county lines drug dealing. No one will question the merits of his ambition, but he is making a promise that will be very hard to deliver. This is what he said on the topic. I want to see crime come down. I want to see the county lines drugs gangs wound up, rolled up. They are reducing the quality of life for people across our county, they are killing young kids. I want to see that thing totally wound up. Q: Will Ann Secoulas, the US diplomat accused of killing Harry Dunn in a road accident, face justice? Johnson says the US are unlikely to send her back to the UK. That is not what they do. Q: Will Huawei be allowed a role in building the 5G infrastructure? Johnson says Britons deserve the best infrastructure available. But he will not jeopardise security. Q: When will we see the ISC report on Russia and UK elections? Johnson says it could be out in weeks. But he has read it, he says. He says he thinks people will be disappointed. Q: Would you go vegan for January? Johnson says he has considered it, but does not see how you could give up cheese. And that\u2019s it. The interview is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: Will you save Flybe? Johnson says it is not for government to save companies that run into trouble. But he says he understands the importance of Flybe for regional connectivity. He says the government is working hard to see what it can do. But there are limits to what can be done to save companies, he says. But he stresses the importance of regional connectivity. He wants to level up, he says. Johnson says the national living wage has been increased. Q: After the election you said you would work around the clock to retain the trust of people who voted Tory, especially in the north. What are you doing? Johnson says there will be dramatic change in investment in the NHS. He says he is hiring 20,000 more police officers. He says he wants to see county lines drug dealing rolled up, wound up. Johnson says he wants to end county lines drug dealing. Q: When you became PM, you said you had a plan for social care. Where is it? Johnson says he is working on it. Q: You said you had a plan. Where is it? Johnson says he will do it during this parliament. Q: When will we see your plan? Johnson says he will bring forward a plan this year, and implement it this parliament. Johnson commits to announcing plans to reform social care this year. Q: When will people see a difference to the NHS? Johnson says this is his number one priority. This is a new government, with a different approach. The NHS is getting its biggest ever cash injection, he says. He says he will be working on this flat out. Only recently they announced that parking charges for patients would go, he says. He says this is a massive project that will require a revolution in how they provide, not just medical care but social care. Q: There were stories in the papers at the weekend about you being a submarine PM - not hogging the limelight all the time. Johnson dismisses the stories. As for changing this year, he wants to lose weight, he says. He says he gave two press conferences. As for being a submarine, he will be crashing through the ice. But he does believe in cabinet government, he says. Q: Do you think Big Ben should bong for Brexit? Johnson says that would cost \u00a3500,000. But the government is developing a plan to enable people to celebrate Brexit, he says. He says, because Big Ben is being refurbished, the clapper has been taken away. Walker turns to Brexit. Johnson says that is one of his least favourite subjects. Q: What is the chance of a comprehensive trade deal by the end of this year? Johnson says it is very likely. Q: You do not sound very confident. Johnson says he it is enormously likely, epically likely. He says he is very, very, very confident about getting a deal. Q: Is there an issue with media intrusion in this country? Johnson reverts to his answer about not wanting to interfer in the Harry/Meghan story. He says the royal family is not helped by politicians wading in. The royal family is a fantastic institution, he says. And so is the media, he says. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Ben Quinn. Boris Johnson is being interviewed now on BBC Breakfast by Dan Walker. After some questions about Iran, Walker asks about Harry and Meghan. Johnson says he is confident the royal family will be able to sort this out. But they will be able to sort it out more easily without interference from politicians. Good morning. British political life in 2020 continues to pick up a new pace today, starting later this morning with the first sit-down interview by the prime minister since the general election. Fresh from his appearance in Northern Ireland where he basked in the feel-good moment of generated by deal paving the way for the resumption of power sharing at Storming, Boris Johnson will take questions from the BBC at Downing Street in a short while. While he sidestepped questions about funding to shore up the historic deal in Belfast, he pledged the government\u2019s support for Northern Ireland\u2019s revived power-sharing executive. Not all is settled however, as the Sinn F\u00e9in Northern Ireland assembly member and Stormont finance minister, Conor Murphy, has warned that the government\u2019s offer for extra money as part of the deal to restore the executive \u201cfalls way short\u201d of what was promised Perhaps even more pressingly, with 17 days to go before Brexit he\u2019s also going to face questions about the type of dealmaking which the UK is prepared to engage in on that front. In a pointed intervention last night during Gavin Barwell\u2019s maiden speech in the House of Lords, Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff warned there was no chance of the government agreeing a new trade deal with the EU by the end of the year. The Labour leadership race also meanwhile rolls on today after candidates made it through to the next round of the contest \u2013 Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry.",

Homeshare is growing quickly in the UK, with greater numbers of older and younger people living together \u2013 the older person enjoying company and a hand around their house, and the younger person finding an affordable home. It is easy to see initiatives like Homeshare as peripheral, but there\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t be mainstream \u2013 especially when the need has never been greater. The global Homeshare movement shows that this approach can be brought to thousands of people, and is in many other countries. National and local government have a role, not least in removing current tax and benefits disincentives for homesharing in later life. We hear so much about services and society letting older people down that our fixation on the risks of acting is paralysing us, as the risks of inaction bring a rising tide of loneliness, housing shortages and societal breakdown. All of us need to challenge our assumptions and prejudices: recognising that both older and younger people have much to offer each other. We cannot force the generations together en masse. People bridge the generational divide, like any other, because they make a personal connection with an individual. Alex Fox CEO, Shared Lives Plus \u2022 John Harris highlighted the number of residential care homes disconnected from the local community in his piece on the growing age divide. By contrast, retirement communities are a distinct housing with care setting which effectively bridges between generations to tackle loneliness. Rather than being \u201cwell set back from the road\u201d, many of the hundreds of new developments being built are on or near a high street, and act as hubs for the whole community by welcoming members of the public to use shared facilities. Take the Chocolate Quarter in Bristol, run by the St Monica Trust on the site of the old chocolate factory which previously served as the heart of the community. On top of 136 supported housing units and a 93-bed care home, the Quarter has office space, a swimming pool, pottery, dance studio, cinema, restaurant and bar \u2013 all accessible to local people and designed to appeal to all ages. The on-site GP centre refers patients to activity groups in the retirement community, building a sense of shared participation and mutual benefit. Instead of being islands of the elderly, innovative retirement communities create intergenerational connections to the benefit of us all. Michael Voges Executive director, Arco (Associated Retirement Community Operators) \u2022 John Harris\u2019s otherwise excellent piece omits one interesting point that age in Britain not only correlates with geography, economics and politics, but also with higher education, where there is a huge generational gap.

Tricia Cusack Greystones, County Wicklow, Ireland \u2022 John Harris refers to obvious generation gaps but chooses the wrong symbol \u2013 the residential care home. Over 50 years I have been associated with the management of several; and my son is in an excellent care home that opened 125 years ago.

I tell him it\u2019s not an annoyance at all and start with an easy one: Where do you get your ideas? \u201cOh, you know, the magical world of ideas,\u201d he replies.</p> <p>His exhibition, which takes place on the eighth floor of the Whitney, comprises a previously untitled work that the museum acquired in 2015 but has never displayed until now. When viewers emerge from the lift on the eighth floor, they will discover a cornucopia of fresh fruit and vegetables, each variety presented as a sculpture on its own wooden plinth. Four times a week, museum staff will collect the ripened fruit and vegetables and \u2013 according to Bader\u2019s instructions \u2013 make a salad. The slicing and dicing will be captured on film and projected in the empty gallery, after which the salad will be served to viewers. Staff will then replenish the plinths with fresh produce, and so the process will continue.</p> <p>Nature has long had a role in Bader\u2019s playful, provocative work. In 2011 he <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/darren-baders-living-sculptures\">let loose two goats in a gallery</a>. He intended to feature a couple of cats, too, but realised that wouldn\u2019t do because \u2013 as he wrote in an accompanying announcement \u2013 \u201ccat predator, goat prey\u201d. Instead, he encouraged viewers to adopt a cat from an animal shelter in the East Village and, in that way, own a Bader artwork of their own. The following year, he created <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/t-magazine/darren-bader-art.html\">Lasagna on Heroin</a>, which is exactly what it says on the tin: a serving of lasagne injected with heroin.</p> <p>His works are a puckish update of Marcel Duchamp\u2019s readymades, which present objects from daily life (a urinal, a shovel) as high art. Although, as Bader points out, \u201cWe\u2019re 107 years post-premiere of the storied \u2018readymade\u2019, so notions of high art and daily life are not what they were.\u201d The installation at the Whitney also nods to other works across art history that have engaged with food. I mention <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/salad-as-performance-art\">Make a Salad </a><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/salad-as-performance-art\">by Alison Knowles</a>, a founding member of the Fluxus group, which also included Yoko Ono.

When I ask him whether sticking fruit and veg on plinths in a museum makes it art, he tells me he wouldn\u2019t know. Either way, let\u2019s hope it tastes as good as it looks.

      "bodyText": "And then there were 12. On Monday, Cory Booker, the US senator from New Jersey, became the latest contender to drop out of the Democratic presidential primary. The field is still very big, but it has narrowed in one meaningful sense: it was once historically diverse, but with Booker out, just three candidates of color remain, only one of whom, the former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, is black. Booker blamed the distraction of jury duty in President Trump\u2019s impending Senate impeachment trial for his exit, as well as his winnowing finances, exacerbated by his failure to qualify for recent Democratic debates, including tonight\u2019s. It will take place in Iowa, which is 91% white. Every single candidate on stage will be white, too. As is ritual in campaign coverage, after Booker dropped out, reporters and pundits chewed over the reasons for his failure \u2013 among them, media obsessions with the campaign horse race (Booker never really cut through in the polls), and with shiny new objects (Exhibit A: Pete Buttigieg). \u201cI think a big part of Booker\u2019s problem, why he never had \u2018a moment,\u2019 was that he\u2019d had so many moments before,\u201d Olivia Nuzzi, Washington correspondent at New York magazine, wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe\u2019d been on magazine covers and the subject of glowing profiles since the mid-2000s.

      "body": "<h2><strong>PLAY IT AGAIN</strong></h2> <p>With so many managers complaining about how often the players on their football teams are forced to play football these days, The Fiver can\u2019t help but yearn for the good old days when FA Cup ties were replayed indefinitely, for as long as it took before one of the teams involved eventually prevailed. In 1971, the amateur players of Alvechurch finally beat Oxford City after the two sides met six times across three weeks \u2013 on Saturday, Tuesday, Monday, Wednesday, Saturday, Monday \u2013 in their own and assorted other grounds, with four of the matches going to extra-time. Nearly all the players involved had full-time jobs and their attempts to qualify for the first round proper were also punctuated by league games. And do you know what? Rather than cry The Fiver a river, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/21/oxford-city-alvechurch-longest-fa-cup\">they just got on with it</a>.</p> <p>In stark contrast, today\u2019s comparatively mollycoddled divas don\u2019t have to play any more than one replay before their ties are decided by penalty shootouts and even that isn\u2019t enough to pacify managers who still think their charges are being overworked. Of the six third-round replays slated for Tuesday evening, three feature Premier League sides whose managers have intimated they would rather not have to play. \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and say it\u2019s the main priority as it\u2019s not,\u201d sighed Nigel Pearson, of his Watford side\u2019s replay against Tranmere at Prenton Park. Tuesday afternoon\u2019s news that the game has been washed out by Storm Brendan will have done little to improve the mood of a man whose players should already have booked their place in the fourth round, having thrown away a 3-0 lead against their League One opponents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/dec/30/football-january-transfer-window-latest-deals-premier-league-europe\">Transfer window January 2020 \u2013\u00a0every deal from Europe's top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lucky to survive against Rochdale at Spotland, Newcastle are faced with a replay Bernard Cribbins could certainly do without. With 12 of his senior players knacked, Bruce may be forced to squeeze himself into a club shirt and line up, but can console himself that \u2013 should he elect to do so \u2013 the black and white stripes will at least have a slimming effect.</p> <p>Meanwhile in London, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will be hoping his players have recovered sufficiently from the 25 minutes they spent running around against Liverpool last Saturday, to see off the challenge of Middlesbrough. The Tottenham boss has been defending his \u201cpragmatic\u201d (translation: \u201ccowardly\u201d) approach against the champions-elect on the grounds that his players aren\u2019t fit enough to exert themselves fully for any longer. It is a weird claim that flies in the face of all available evidence from the Pochettino era that preceded his own reign. On the subject of who will line up against Boro, Humility Man\u2122 said Toby Alderweireld was definitely being given the day off to kick back and relax. \u201cHe is the only one I can give a rest because I have options behind,\u201d he blurted, making it clear that somebody else will be tasked with lumping the ball long in the general direction of Lucas Moura or whoever else gets to fill Harry Kane\u2019s size nines.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live\">Join Barry Glendenning from 8.05pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Tottenham 2-0 Middlesbrough in their FA Cup third-round replay</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cI like Wilbrahimovic \u2013 it\u2019s a good one.

      "bodyText": "PLAY IT AGAIN With so many managers complaining about how often the players on their football teams are forced to play football these days, The Fiver can\u2019t help but yearn for the good old days when FA Cup ties were replayed indefinitely, for as long as it took before one of the teams involved eventually prevailed. In 1971, the amateur players of Alvechurch finally beat Oxford City after the two sides met six times across three weeks \u2013 on Saturday, Tuesday, Monday, Wednesday, Saturday, Monday \u2013 in their own and assorted other grounds, with four of the matches going to extra-time. Nearly all the players involved had full-time jobs and their attempts to qualify for the first round proper were also punctuated by league games. And do you know what? Rather than cry The Fiver a river, they just got on with it. In stark contrast, today\u2019s comparatively mollycoddled divas don\u2019t have to play any more than one replay before their ties are decided by penalty shootouts and even that isn\u2019t enough to pacify managers who still think their charges are being overworked. Of the six third-round replays slated for Tuesday evening, three feature Premier League sides whose managers have intimated they would rather not have to play. \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and say it\u2019s the main priority as it\u2019s not,\u201d sighed Nigel Pearson, of his Watford side\u2019s replay against Tranmere at Prenton Park. Tuesday afternoon\u2019s news that the game has been washed out by Storm Brendan will have done little to improve the mood of a man whose players should already have booked their place in the fourth round, having thrown away a 3-0 lead against their League One opponents. Lucky to survive against Rochdale at Spotland, Newcastle are faced with a replay Bernard Cribbins could certainly do without. With 12 of his senior players knacked, Bruce may be forced to squeeze himself into a club shirt and line up, but can console himself that \u2013 should he elect to do so \u2013 the black and white stripes will at least have a slimming effect. Meanwhile in London, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will be hoping his players have recovered sufficiently from the 25 minutes they spent running around against Liverpool last Saturday, to see off the challenge of Middlesbrough. The Tottenham boss has been defending his \u201cpragmatic\u201d (translation: \u201ccowardly\u201d) approach against the champions-elect on the grounds that his players aren\u2019t fit enough to exert themselves fully for any longer. It is a weird claim that flies in the face of all available evidence from the Pochettino era that preceded his own reign. On the subject of who will line up against Boro, Humility Man\u2122 said Toby Alderweireld was definitely being given the day off to kick back and relax. \u201cHe is the only one I can give a rest because I have options behind,\u201d he blurted, making it clear that somebody else will be tasked with lumping the ball long in the general direction of Lucas Moura or whoever else gets to fill Harry Kane\u2019s size nines. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Barry Glendenning from 8.05pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Tottenham 2-0 Middlesbrough in their FA Cup third-round replay. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI like Wilbrahimovic \u2013 it\u2019s a good one. Norwich fans labelled me that. Paul Lambert used to put me on for 20-25 minutes in the Premier League and I remember three or four games on the bounce I was doing all these backheels and flicks and, because they were all coming off, I ended up getting that tag and it has been passed on\u201d \u2013 Rochdale forward Aaron Wilbraham, 75, gets his chat on with Ben Fisher before their FA Cup replay at Newcastle.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cIn a season more full of \u2018Everton, that \u2026\u2019 moments than just about any I can remember, the possibility that not only Ronald Koeman, but also Bobby M, had been linked with taking over at the Nou Camp has to be the most E,T \u2026 of all. Get your money on now for a Netherlands v Belgium final at Euro 2020 because it would just, you know, be Everton, that \u2026\u201d \u2013 Tony Killen. \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Fiver. Since Barcelona are, so they say, more than a club, wouldn\u2019t their door be marked \u2018Fes-ne un\u2019 (the Catalan for \u2018do one\u2019), rather than \u2018Has uno\u2019?\u201d \u2013 Tom Paternoster-Howe. \u201cEvery time, like today, I moan about modern football \u2013 having to subscribe to three different TV channels just to watch the football, players going down as soon as they\u2019re touched, VAR and the like \u2013 I find myself yearning for the past. Then, I remember that on this day in 1994, Fantasy Football League was first broadcast with guests Peter Cook and Mandy Smith (there\u2019s a reference for the kids) with Sir Geoff Hurst doing the staggeringly unfunny Phoenix from the Flames and realise how deluded I was back in the 1990s\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Tony Killen. BITS AND BOBS Quique Seti\u00e9n says he did not imagine in his \u201cwildest dreams\u201d becoming Barcelona manager after Ernesto Valverde was given a thorough booting. \u201cYesterday, I was walking around my home town with cows around me and now I\u2019m here at Barcelona managing the best players in the world,\u201d he honked. Meanwhile, Bar\u00e7a have trousered more income over a season than any other club in world football for the first time. West Ham are 18th. Watford have bolstered their squad with the \u20ac8m acquisition of Ignacio Pussetto from fellow Pozzo plaything Udinese. Spurs will pass around Jack Clarke to QPR. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r doesn\u2019t want people getting ahead of themselves over Mason Greenwood potentially receiving an England call. \u201cLet the boy settle in first before we talk about England and the Euros,\u201d he cooed. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo reckons Wolves will land his transfer targets to boost their thin squad. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough moment but we\u2019re working on it,\u201d he growled. And Portsmouth will submit a planning application after releasing plans to renovate Fratton Park\u2019s Milton End, which look a fair deal more sensible than their stadium plans from 2007. STILL WANT MORE? Sid Lowe on the right old palaver Barcelona got themselves into in giving Ernesto Valverde a thorough booting. Jonathan Liew gets into the heads of Arda Turan and his Mr 15% to imagine the sort of natter they might have had after the midfielder\u2019s loan at Istanbul Basaksehir went pear-shaped.

These are short journeys that could easily be substituted with rail trips. Exeter to London now takes just over two hours by train compared to one hour 10 minutes by plane. However, a true comparison must take into account the extra time required to travel to and from the airport and to check in.</p> <p>Short-haul flights have a disproportionately large carbon footprint, with an average 65kg per person by plane compared to just over 11kg by train. Yet the aviation industry still receives an annual subsidy through an exemption from tax on aviation fuel and VAT on tickets. So rather than using subsidies to artificially prop up a business that is financially and environmentally unsustainable, the government should transfer those subsidies to rail travel. That would increase and improve regional and local rail networks, and reduce fares. A frequent flyer levy would generate additional revenue to fund rail and other sustainable transport solutions, while encouraging a shift away from flying.</p> <p>We need to follow the lead taken by others in Europe. In Sweden, the number of passengers on domestic flights <a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/strategy/flight-shame-a-factor-in-swedish-traffic-decline/136087.article\" title=\"\">fell 9%</a><a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/strategy/flight-shame-a-factor-in-swedish-traffic-decline/136087.article\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/strategy/flight-shame-a-factor-in-swedish-traffic-decline/136087.article\" title=\"\">last year</a>, largely as a result of a home-grown \u201cflight shame\u201d movement. Meanwhile, the Greens in Germany have <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/aviation/news/german-greens-want-to-ban-domestic-flights-by-2035/\" title=\"\">pledged to </a><a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/aviation/news/german-greens-want-to-ban-domestic-flights-by-2035/\" title=\"\">ban domestic flights</a> in the next 15 years if they enter a coalition government, a not unlikely scenario in the near future.</p> <p>Of course the colossal size of the aviation industry in the UK means there are thousands of jobs dependent on it. This helps to explain why governments have consistently been reluctant to challenge it. Redundancy is always a painful process, but the reality is that many jobs in aviation and other fossil fuel-based industries simply aren\u2019t sustainable. This is why we urgently need an industrial policy based around <a href=\"https://campaigns.greenparty.org.uk/manifesto/#gnd\" title=\"\">the Green New Deal</a> to train and reskill workers so they can transition to the environmentally and socially beneficial jobs of the future.</p> <p>It is also clear that such a transition will generate more and better jobs. In this case, increasing the cost of flights will also provide a boost to domestic jobs in tourism, as millions more people would spend their weekends and short breaks in the UK rather than in far-flung destinations.</p> <p>The government shouldn\u2019t be throwing a lifeline to Flybe or encouraging the domestic aviation industry through tax cuts. On the contrary: we need to use all the instruments at our disposal to radically slash the number of domestic flights and invest in a local and regional transport revolution. We must ensure that the cheapest and most convenient transport option is always the sustainable one.</p> <p>\u2022 Molly Scott Cato is Green party MEP for South West England and Gibraltar.

Then there are all the flights we take within the country: 38% of Flybe\u2019s flights are domestic. These are short journeys that could easily be substituted with rail trips. Exeter to London now takes just over two hours by train compared to one hour 10 minutes by plane. However, a true comparison must take into account the extra time required to travel to and from the airport and to check in. Short-haul flights have a disproportionately large carbon footprint, with an average 65kg per person by plane compared to just over 11kg by train. Yet the aviation industry still receives an annual subsidy through an exemption from tax on aviation fuel and VAT on tickets. So rather than using subsidies to artificially prop up a business that is financially and environmentally unsustainable, the government should transfer those subsidies to rail travel. That would increase and improve regional and local rail networks, and reduce fares. A frequent flyer levy would generate additional revenue to fund rail and other sustainable transport solutions, while encouraging a shift away from flying. We need to follow the lead taken by others in Europe. In Sweden, the number of passengers on domestic flights fell 9% last year, largely as a result of a home-grown \u201cflight shame\u201d movement. Meanwhile, the Greens in Germany have pledged to ban domestic flights in the next 15 years if they enter a coalition government, a not unlikely scenario in the near future. Of course the colossal size of the aviation industry in the UK means there are thousands of jobs dependent on it. This helps to explain why governments have consistently been reluctant to challenge it. Redundancy is always a painful process, but the reality is that many jobs in aviation and other fossil fuel-based industries simply aren\u2019t sustainable. This is why we urgently need an industrial policy based around the Green New Deal to train and reskill workers so they can transition to the environmentally and socially beneficial jobs of the future. It is also clear that such a transition will generate more and better jobs. In this case, increasing the cost of flights will also provide a boost to domestic jobs in tourism, as millions more people would spend their weekends and short breaks in the UK rather than in far-flung destinations. The government shouldn\u2019t be throwing a lifeline to Flybe or encouraging the domestic aviation industry through tax cuts. On the contrary: we need to use all the instruments at our disposal to radically slash the number of domestic flights and invest in a local and regional transport revolution. We must ensure that the cheapest and most convenient transport option is always the sustainable one. \u2022 Molly Scott Cato is Green party MEP for South West England and Gibraltar. She has pledged not to fly at all in 2020",

      "bodyText": "Chad Johnson, who was named to the Pro Bowl six times as a wide receiver during his career in the NFL, is attempting a comeback in the XFL as a kicker. The XFL, which is aiming to fill a gap for football fans during the NFL off-season, launches at the start of February. The 42-year-old Johnson, who last played in the NFL in 2011, believes he can make it as a kicker. He said he is \u201cas excited as hell\u201d after securing a tryout in Houston next week, and has hopes of one day kicking in the NFL. \u201cPretty far fetched but imagine me being consistent during an XFL season &amp; getting a chance at a 53 man roster in the NFL, even i don\u2019t make it just being able to compete for a spot at a entirely different position will be so riveting,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Kicking duties are lighter in the XFL, where there are no extra-points kicks, than in the NFL. In December, Johnson posted a video to Instagram of himself making a 60-yard field goal, although he was kicking from a tee with no opponents. He is a keen soccer fan, and has played for the United Premier Soccer League team Boca Raton FC. He also made a brief appearance at a Professional Bull Riders event in 2011, when he lasted 1.5 seconds on a mount named Deja Blue.

Downing was the more emollient, but had Robert\u2019s respect. \u201cYou worry me, Mick,\u201d he once joked. \u201cYou\u2019re honest, but you\u2019re not stupid.\u201d</p> <p>In retirement on the Dorset coast with his second wife, Merete Bates, a painter and former Guardian arts critic, Robert immersed himself in music, history and film (he boasted \u201cthe best collection of European DVDs in southern England\u201d) and his community. Labour being a no-hoper in rural Dorset, he stood unsuccessfully for the county council as a Lib Dem. He was still walking the Jurassic cliffs until shortly before his death.</p> <p>He is survived by Merete, their children, Adam and Galina, a son, Hugh, from his first marriage to Joan McClune, which ended in divorce, a daughter, Katherine, from a previous relationship, and three grandchildren.</p>",

Despite John\u2019s impatience to get back to the high politics of Ted Heath\u2019s \u201cWho governs Britain?\u201d election in February 1974, we kept him up all night to clinch a deal on the dubious grounds that a victorious Heath would impose a pay freeze. Downing was the more emollient, but had Robert\u2019s respect. \u201cYou worry me, Mick,\u201d he once joked. \u201cYou\u2019re honest, but you\u2019re not stupid.\u201d In retirement on the Dorset coast with his second wife, Merete Bates, a painter and former Guardian arts critic, Robert immersed himself in music, history and film (he boasted \u201cthe best collection of European DVDs in southern England\u201d) and his community. Labour being a no-hoper in rural Dorset, he stood unsuccessfully for the county council as a Lib Dem. He was still walking the Jurassic cliffs until shortly before his death. He is survived by Merete, their children, Adam and Galina, a son, Hugh, from his first marriage to Joan McClune, which ended in divorce, a daughter, Katherine, from a previous relationship, and three grandchildren.",

The package of assistance, which will come from the government\u2019s $2bn recovery fund, will be used for food vouchers, financial assistance and support services to be administered by the charity sector and made \u201cimmediately available\u201d to those affected. Emergency relief funding for communities directly affected by fire will be increased by $40m with the extra funds able to be used for a broad range of basics including utility bills, clothing, petrol and bus tickets. \u201cIn recognition of the crisis situation, this relief will also be made available as cash payments when necessary to help cover emergency costs for people who work or live in affected areas,\u201d the government said in a statement.

The extra $40m will be primarily administered by the Salvation Army Property Trust and the St Vincent de Paul Society, which collectively provide services across the affected areas. The government said these organisations would work with locally-based organisations \u201cto ensure access for communities in need\u201d. Another $10m will be allocated to the expansion of financial counselling services, including extra support for the National Debt Helpline and increased funding for locally-based providers to deliver face-to-face services, including through outreach. The government is also promoting \u201csafe\u201d financial products that are not available through mainstream organisations for people on low incomes as an alternative to high-risk, high-interest products. These include the No Interest Loans Scheme and StepUP, a low-interest loan scheme, available through Good Shepherd Microfinance. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the $50m package would also help to stimulate bushfire-affected communities, while also helping people \u201cto get through the coming days and weeks\u201d. \u201cI know many Australians are doing it really tough, they\u2019ve seen their homes and livelihoods destroyed or damaged by these devastating fires,\u201d Morrison said ahead of Wednesday\u2019s announcement. \u201cFor many people right now it\u2019s the basics that count. We need to make sure everyone has food on the table and clothes on their backs.\u201d The social services minister, Anne Ruston, said financial counselling would help people \u201cget back on their feet quickly\u201d. \u201cAs affected Australians count the personal toll of these devastating fires we want to make sure they have support to plan and rebuild their lives,\u201d Ruston said. Earlier on Wednesday Labor criticised the process for delivery of disaster relief funding. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese said people need \u201ca single point of entry\u201d and should not have to deal with \u201cred tape and bureaucracy in order to get the support that they need\u201d. On Monday, the country\u2019s peak welfare body, the Australian Council of Social Service, called on the federal government to boost emergency payments, increase Disaster Recovery Allowances, provide $30m in food aid, and provide additional relief for people on low incomes who could not afford insurance. The government has been making a series of announcements about how it will spend its $2bn recovery fund following announcements on Tuesday of $50m for wildlife recovery and $100m for fire-affected farmers and primary producers.",

      "bodyText": "Leaked pictures from inside Papua New Guinea\u2019s Bomana immigration detention centre have given a glimpse of where up to 20 asylum seekers still remain locked up by PNG authorities, despite widespread concerns for their health, welfare and legal rights. Despite around 30 men being released after signing agreements to return to their country of origin, Guardian Australia understands all remain in PNG. In August PNG authorities arrested 52 men who had previously been detained on Manus Island on behalf of the Australian government after seeking asylum by boat. Of the 52, there are believed to be just 18 left inside the prison. The others have all been removed, having signed agreements to be voluntarily returned to their country of origin. They are being accommodated in Port Moresby ahead of deportation, but none have left, and few are willing to speak about the Bomana prison for fear of being returned. Having fled and sought asylum, then spent up to seven years in Australia\u2019s offshore detention system, multiple former detainees have said it was Bomana which broke them. In the months since they were detained, numerous detainees self-harmed or attempted to take their own lives. Some have been hospitalised. One Iranian asylum seeker described the conditions in Bomana as \u201cdesigned to torture people\u201d. The first public pictures from inside the centre, taken late last year and obtained by Guardian Australia, reveal the living arrangements for those who were held and those who remain. According to the photographs and interviews with people familiar with the facility, Bomana\u2019s immigration detention centre is divided into five compounds \u2013 Karanas and Diwai on one side of the centre, and Raun Wara, Kunai and Balus on the other. There is no shade and the compounds which each hold a few dozen demountable rooms are separated by fences. In the rooms \u2013 which are only air conditioned in one compound \u2013 men sleep on a hard plastic mattresses with no pillow. Food is minimal. According to former detainees there are frequent announcements over the loudspeaker and unannounced room searches by guards, including by some Australian employees. The Australian government has maintained it has no involvement or visibility inside Bomana, and there are suggestions that the PNG government\u2019s approach has caused concern with Australian authorities. Detainees determined to have behavioural issues are held in solitary conditions in Karanas, a managed accommodation area. It has been alleged to Guardian Australia that men are sometimes sent to Karanas as punishment. The Diwai compound is a supported accommodation area designated for people with mental health issues requiring further support, but Guardian Australia was told it was also used as temporary detention for other people being deported. The other three compounds, Raun Wara, Kunai, and Balus, are on the other side of the facility, but still separated from each other by fence. The men who were taken to Bomana had either had their asylum claims rejected or were never assessed, and they were deemed non-refugees. Ahead of their detention in the Australia-funded facility, the men were ordered to surrender their mobile phone, any medication, and to pack up their personal property. They were then taken to Bomana and denied access to phones, lawyers and, allegedly, adequate medical care. Critical cases were taken to hospital, but no further information was available. It was later revealed that at least a dozen were very ill and had been at various stages of approval for medevac to Australia, including nine who had been approved. That process stopped upon their detention. In recent months groups of detainees have been released and housed in Port Moresby, after signing agreements to be deported back to their home countries. Guardian Australia approached the PNG immigration department and minister with questions but received no response. Graham Thom, a spokesman for Amnesty International Australia, said it was \u201cfrightening\u201d that men continued to be detained in Bomana. \u201cGiven the small number left, we see no reason why they\u2019d keep this centre open and those individuals detained,\u201d Thom said. \u201cThe men [who have been released] are clearly not going anywhere anyway.\u201d Thom welcomed that the majority of the men had been released but he said Amnesty had major concerns it was only because they had agreed to return home, \u201cwhen clearly what we\u2019re being told is they still have grave fears for their safety\u201d. \u201cIf the only way you get out is putting your life potentially at risk, then this is a serous breach of PNG human rights obligations.\u201d This article was amended on 24 January 2020 to remove a reference to Port Moresby tap water bing unsafe to drink.

      "bodyText": "In an editorial on Saturday, the Weekend Australian defended the News Corp paper\u2019s climate coverage in response to criticism that it had underplayed the bushfire crisis and chosen to highlight concerns about arsonists and hazard reduction rather than explain the climate change drivers of the horrendous season. The editorial said: \u201cIn our coverage, the Australian\u2019s journalists report facts about how to tackle bushfires and about how to deal with the impact of climate change. Second, we host debates reflecting the political division that exists in Australia about how to address climate change without destroying our economy.\u201d It said its coverage of the bushfires had been \u201cwilfully and ineptly misrepresented by the New York Times and Guardian Australia as climate denial\u201d. The Australian newspaper\u2019s editorials, like its news stories, accept the basic premise that humans cause climate change and that action should be taken. The newspaper also covers diligently the news around the climate policy debate and the implications of climate change for business. But its defence of its bushfire coverage ignores its prolonged willingness to expose readers to a regular diet of misrepresentations on climate change science on its opinion page, as well as outright denial of the breadth of science linking fossil fuel burning to dangerous climate change. In November, as the bushfire crisis was unfolding, News Corp\u2019s executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, told his annual general meeting: \u201cThere are no climate change deniers around, I can assure you.\u201d The next day the Australian ran a column from the mining industry figure and geologist Prof Ian Plimer, who wrote: \u201cIt has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.\u201d The organisation Climate Feedback asks climate scientists to fact-check articles and opinion columns. Like three previous Plimer columns, the group gave the article its lowest rank for scientific credibility, saying it was \u201ca mixture of misdirection, misleading claims and outright falsehoods\u201d. Last month, two days after the Bureau of Meteorology declared that 17 December 2019 had been Australia\u2019s hottest day on record, the Australian published a story quoting a long-time critic and climate science \u201csceptic\u201d questioning the bureau\u2019s methodology. The story quoted \u201cclimate scientist\u201d Dr Jennifer Marohasy but did not mention that Marohasy works at the Institute of Public Affairs, a Melbourne thinktank heavily financed by the mining billionaire Gina Rinehart and known for promoting climate science denial. The story reported Marohasy\u2019s criticisms of a widely used technique known as homogenisation that corrects for known errors in data, even though the data used to calculate the hottest day record is not homogenised. The Australian has a long history in this space. In 2009 it published a column that dismissed climate science as a \u201cfraud\u201d pushed by \u201cwarmaholics\u201d. In response, an exasperated Dr Michael Coughlan, then chief climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said: \u201cThe Australian clearly has an editorial policy. \u201cNo matter how many times the scientific community refutes these arguments, they persist in putting them out \u2013 to the point where we believe there\u2019s little to be gained in the use of our time in responding.\u201d In 2013 a study of News Corp\u2019s coverage of climate change found it was a dominant voice in the country\u2019s media on the subject. The Australian wrote more on it than any other outlet, and almost half its comment pieces expressed doubt about the science, including 100% of seven editorials analysed. Only 18% of news stories expressed doubt, the study said. In 2013 the newspaper ran a front page story with the headline \u201cSea rise \u2018not linked to warming\u2019 \u201d, based on a study which it later admitted it had \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d. The same year it ran a news story claiming that \u201cexperts\u201d were worried about a coming ice age. The article relied on five-year-old quotes lifted from a blog by a group that has claimed carbon dioxide is a \u201ccoolant\u201d and not a greenhouse gas. The Australian has also published stories sympathetic to claims that wind turbines make people sick. In 2012 the Australian Press Council upheld a complaint against the newspaper after it ran an article by a British climate science denier, James Delingpole, in which he quoted an anonymous sheep farmer who had compared the wind energy industry to a paedophile ring. After the press council\u2019s judgment, Delingpole returned in the Australian to say he stood by \u201cevery word\u201d of his story \u201cespecially the bit about paedophiles\u201d. One of the Australian\u2019s most flagrant and regular deniers has been Maurice Newman, the former ABC chairman and adviser to Tony Abbott who believes climate scientists are part of a global socialist plot. \u201cThe scientific delusion, the religion behind the climate crusade, is crumbling,\u201d Newman has written. On checking one column, a scientist Newman had quoted to back his argument that global cooling was on the way said the claims were \u201cscientifically ludicrous\u201d. As recently as last week Newman referred to \u201cthe media left, Hollywood and the rest of the global warming cult\u201d, comparing them to \u201cancient druids\u201d. Even while covering the topic of hazard reduction, the Australian has turned to climate science deniers. On New Year\u2019s Eve it ran an opinion column by Viv Forbes that advocated a revival of traditional fire management techniques, while blaming the intensity of the fires on a lack of hazard reduction and the creation of national parks. The column did not mention climate change. Forbes spent more than 40 years in the coal industry \u2013 a connection not disclosed in the column \u2013 and leads a project against the Paris climate agreement that says fossil fuel emissions are not changing the climate, and that increasing concentrations of CO2 are \u201cimproving the environment, not harming it\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The Attorney-General\u2019s Department formally warned Christopher Pyne that he was banned from lobbying for a defence contractor that won millions of dollars in government work, including during his time as minister. The Guardian revealed last year that GC Advisory, Pyne\u2019s lobbyist firm, planned to lobby on behalf of a defence contractor, Saber Astronautics, which had won three contracts with the defence department worth $2.7m in the previous 12 months. A day after the Guardian\u2019s report, the Attorney-General\u2019s Department wrote to Pyne\u2019s firm to remind it that the former defence minister was banned from lobbying for clients like Saber. Lobbying rules prohibit former government ministers from engaging \u201cin lobbying activities relating to any matter that they had official dealings with in their last 18 months in office\u201d. Documents obtained through freedom of information show the head of the department\u2019s integrity and security division, Andrew Walter, expressly warned GC Advisory that it must take steps to avoid a conflict of interest. \u201cWe understand that Saber currently holds a number of contracts with the Department of Defence, some of which were obtained while Mr Pyne held the position of Minister for Defence,\u201d Walter wrote. \u201cAs such, Mr Pyne is prohibited from engaging in lobbying activities on behalf of Saber until 11 October 2020.\u201d The letter, though, highlights difficulties in enforcing the lobbying rules. Walter could only seek assurances from GC Advisory that Pyne would be kept at arm\u2019s length from involvement with Saber. \u201cWhile this does not prevent other GC Advisory lobbyists from undertaking lobbying on behalf of Saber, the department seeks your assurance that Mr Pyne will not do so and that appropriate processes are put in place to manage any potential conflict of interest,\u201d he wrote. Pyne is one of only two registered lobbyists working on behalf of GC Advisory. Pyne is barred from lobbying for Saber, but his colleague, GC Advisory\u2019s principal Adam Howard, is not. Howard is a former chief of staff to Pyne, meaning he was also subject to restrictions on lobbying on matters he had official dealings with in the year prior. But Howard left the minister\u2019s office about 18 months ago and there is no suggestion he would be in breach of the code by lobbying for Saber. Howard wrote a reply to the Attorney-General\u2019s Department saying Pyne was \u201cacutely aware\u201d of his obligations and that measures had been taken to ensure he would not lobby for Saber. One such measure was to ensure Pyne was given no knowledge of \u201cSaber Astronautics defence interests\u201d. \u201cAny lobbying activities concerning Saber Astronautics applicable under the Australian Lobbying Code of Conduct will not be handled by Mr Pyne,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMr Pyne will not be aware of Saber Astronautics defence interests, if any. His advice will not be sought. In that regard appropriate measures have been put in place to ensure there are no conflicts of interest.\u201d In an additional statement to the Guardian, a GC Advisory spokesman said: \u201cMr Pyne is well aware of the code of conduct for previous Ministers and he abides by it. Mr Pyne does not lobby for any defence clients. GC Advisory adheres to the Lobbying Code of Conduct in every respect.\u201d Saber is not the only defence contractor taken on by GC Advisory. The firm is also acting for Ethan Group, an IT contractor that won more than $50m in work from the defence department in the last four years. Tender data also suggests it won about 43 contracts with defence worth $8.9m during Pyne\u2019s time as defence minister. Ethan Group said it was only using GC Advisory for general consulting work. Pyne\u2019s job helping consulting giant EY grow its defence business also sparked intense scrutiny last year. The role prompted an inquiry into ministerial standards, which, among other things, prevent former ministers from lobbying or holding business meetings with members of the government, parliament, public service or defence force on any matter for which they held ministerial responsibility for 18 months after leaving parliament. They also require ministers not to use information they have obtained in office for private gain. Pyne was cleared of any breach of the standards by the former Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary Martin Parkinson.",

There is a particular enmity towards the Today programme, with Downing Street making the pointed decision to stop putting ministers up for interview on the Radio 4 programme \u2013 prompting the Today editor, Sarah Sands, to say the government is using its landslide majority to \u201cput the foot on the windpipe\u201d of the broadcaster. While viewers on BBC One were watching the prime minister go head-to-head with the presenter Dan Walker in Downing Street, Radio 4\u2019s listeners had to make do with the former cabinet minister Liam Fox in Today\u2019s traditional 8.10am headline political interview slot.

      "body": "<p>Residents and green activists are maintaining a 24-hour vigil in an attempt to protect a line of Norway maple trees in Bristol after developers began chopping them down.</p> <p>People in the St Paul\u2019s area of the city woke early on New Year\u2019s Eve to the sound of workers with chainsaws starting to fell the trees as part of a new housing development.</p> <p>One tree had been cut down by the time residents arrived at the Lower Ashley Road but two women chained themselves to a pair of the remaining trees, halting the work.</p> <p>Since New Year\u2019s Eve, members of the Save the M32 Maples \u2013 so-called because the trees are close to the motorway \u2013 have kept watch over the trees and called on Bristol city council to prevent them being destroyed.</p> <p>The developers stopped the work while negotiations with residents and the city council took place but the \u201ctruce\u201d ends on Wednesday and locals fear the chainsaws will return. Activists have promised to take direct action again to make sure that the workers cannot safely cut down the trees.</p> <p>Amirah Cole, a resident, said: \u201cThese trees play a role in protecting people from pollution. They are for everyone and we need to do more to protect them. We\u2019re in a climate crisis. We have to nurture trees.\u201d</p> <p>Protesters huddled together lit a brazier for warmth on Tuesday. Ribbons and baubles were draped in the trees and drivers beeped their horns as they passed to show their support.</p> <p>Another local, Sian Whelan, said: \u201cThe trees are very important part of the area. They are more than 50 years old. They have been growing since the time the motorway was built. This street is a motorway slip-road in effect. When the trees are in full bloom they\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p> <p>Outline planning permission was granted in 2016 for the site, formerly owned by the council, to be turned into offices and accommodation. A revised plan for affordable housing is expected to be put into the council soon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"91233528eee1ecc813004cef54b4406f51b142e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91233528eee1ecc813004cef54b4406f51b142e5/0_0_5504_8256/667.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters demonstrate against the felling of five maple trees in St Paul\u2019s, Bristol.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters demonstrate against the felling of five maple trees in St Paul\u2019s, Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The original permission allowed the removal of the trees if developers paid for replacement trees within one mile of the site. But planning officers had asked the landowner to refrain from removing the trees until a decision on the new planning application received for the site had been considered.</p> <p>At a full council meeting on Tuesday, the Save the M32 Maples group claimed it had discovered the council still owned the strip of land on which the trees are sited \u2013 and argued this meant it should be doing more to save them. The council said it was investigating this claim.</p> <p>Another resident, Rachel Lamp, pointed out that Bristol was the <a href=\"https://www.climateemergency.uk/blog/bristol-council-declares-a-climate-emergency/\">first UK council to declare a climate emergency </a>and had <a href=\"https://bristolgreencapital.org/new-ambitious-target-launched-double-city-tree-canopy-cover-2050/\">pledged to double the size of the tree canopy in the city</a>. She said: \u201cThey are missing a fantastic opportunity to look like a forward-thinking green council by not stopping these trees from being cut down.\u201d</p> <p>There are only three maples left \u2013 but neighbours see them as a valuable antidote to the motorway\u2019s fumes. \u201cThey represent so much more than three maple trees,\u201d said Lamp. \u201cI feel like no one\u2019s being listened to here apart from the landowners and developers. It\u2019s incredibly upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Vassili Papastavrou, the secretary of the <a href=\"https://bristoltreeforum.org/\">Bristol Tree Forum</a>, said it was not an isolated occurrence: \u201cImportant urban trees are being removed all over Bristol. We are in a climate emergency so the obvious presumption should be to build around existing trees on development sites.\u201d</p> <p>A Bristol city council spokesperson said: \u201cWe are disappointed to learn the owner has not been following the advice given by officers to delay work on these trees. The mayor [Marvin Rees] has met with the developer and residents to try to find a solution and will be meeting them again shortly to continue this discussion.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Residents and green activists are maintaining a 24-hour vigil in an attempt to protect a line of Norway maple trees in Bristol after developers began chopping them down. People in the St Paul\u2019s area of the city woke early on New Year\u2019s Eve to the sound of workers with chainsaws starting to fell the trees as part of a new housing development. One tree had been cut down by the time residents arrived at the Lower Ashley Road but two women chained themselves to a pair of the remaining trees, halting the work. Since New Year\u2019s Eve, members of the Save the M32 Maples \u2013 so-called because the trees are close to the motorway \u2013 have kept watch over the trees and called on Bristol city council to prevent them being destroyed. The developers stopped the work while negotiations with residents and the city council took place but the \u201ctruce\u201d ends on Wednesday and locals fear the chainsaws will return. Activists have promised to take direct action again to make sure that the workers cannot safely cut down the trees. Amirah Cole, a resident, said: \u201cThese trees play a role in protecting people from pollution. They are for everyone and we need to do more to protect them. We\u2019re in a climate crisis. We have to nurture trees.\u201d Protesters huddled together lit a brazier for warmth on Tuesday. Ribbons and baubles were draped in the trees and drivers beeped their horns as they passed to show their support. Another local, Sian Whelan, said: \u201cThe trees are very important part of the area. They are more than 50 years old. They have been growing since the time the motorway was built. This street is a motorway slip-road in effect. When the trees are in full bloom they\u2019re lovely.\u201d Outline planning permission was granted in 2016 for the site, formerly owned by the council, to be turned into offices and accommodation. A revised plan for affordable housing is expected to be put into the council soon. The original permission allowed the removal of the trees if developers paid for replacement trees within one mile of the site. But planning officers had asked the landowner to refrain from removing the trees until a decision on the new planning application received for the site had been considered. At a full council meeting on Tuesday, the Save the M32 Maples group claimed it had discovered the council still owned the strip of land on which the trees are sited \u2013 and argued this meant it should be doing more to save them. The council said it was investigating this claim. Another resident, Rachel Lamp, pointed out that Bristol was the first UK council to declare a climate emergency and had pledged to double the size of the tree canopy in the city. She said: \u201cThey are missing a fantastic opportunity to look like a forward-thinking green council by not stopping these trees from being cut down.\u201d There are only three maples left \u2013 but neighbours see them as a valuable antidote to the motorway\u2019s fumes. \u201cThey represent so much more than three maple trees,\u201d said Lamp. \u201cI feel like no one\u2019s being listened to here apart from the landowners and developers. It\u2019s incredibly upsetting.\u201d Vassili Papastavrou, the secretary of the Bristol Tree Forum, said it was not an isolated occurrence: \u201cImportant urban trees are being removed all over Bristol. We are in a climate emergency so the obvious presumption should be to build around existing trees on development sites.\u201d A Bristol city council spokesperson said: \u201cWe are disappointed to learn the owner has not been following the advice given by officers to delay work on these trees. The mayor [Marvin Rees] has met with the developer and residents to try to find a solution and will be meeting them again shortly to continue this discussion.\u201d",

In the near future and sooner than most anticipate there will be a significant reallocation of capital.</p> <p>That shift is already underway. </p> <p>Investors poured $20.6 billion into sustainable funds last year, nearly quadrupling the record it had set a year earlier, according to Morningstar. The industry has broadened in recent years, after starting with simple funds that bluntly excluded stocks deemed as harmful, such as gun makers or tobacco stocks. </p> <p>Investors, particularly younger ones, increasingly say they want their money invested with an eye toward sustainability. Fearful of losing out on those dollars and the fees that they produce investment companies are rushing to meet the surging demand. </p> <p>Fund managers increasingly say they consider environmental, social and governance issues in their broad investment strategy. It\u2019s known as ESG investing in the industry, and it means fund managers measure a company\u2019s performance on the environment and other sustainability issues along with its bottom-line financials when choosing which stocks to own. </p> <p>ESG funds say such an approach can help investors returns, rather than just their consciences, because it can help avoid risky companies, and the big losses they may have ahead of them in the future. Companies with poor records on the environment are more likely to face big fines, for example. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1dd5d08f08d66fcfaa3c8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-14T15:01:16.052Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>If BlackRock really wants to make a difference on the climate emergency, it needs to pile more pressure onto the companies it invests in.</strong></p> <p>That means voting in favour of climate-friendly motions at AGMs, and voting against directors who don\u2019t take the problem seriously enough.</p> <p><strong>George Hay</strong> of <strong>Reuters</strong> has a good take on this, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-fink-breakingviews/breakingviews-larry-fink-slowly-becomes-part-of-climate-solution-idUSKBN1ZD1PD\">here</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fink\u2019s most eye-catching shift is to change how BlackRock plans to engage with the companies it invests in, whether active or passive. From now on, it will be \u201cincreasingly disposed\u201d to vote against directors at companies that are not doing enough. That includes those like Exxon Mobil which lobbyist CDP argues have been slow to explain how their balance sheets would be affected by higher temperatures.<br></p> <p>BlackRock itself is evidence of what such a change can achieve.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the BlackRock move: BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, will make climate change central to its investment decisions. Founder and CEO Laurence Fink, who oversees the management of about $7 trillion in funds, said in his influential annual letter to CEOs Tuesday that he believes we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance because of a warming planet. Climate change has become the top issue raised by clients, Fink said, and it will affect everything from municipal bonds to long-term mortgages for homes. The New York firm is taking immediate action, exiting investments in coal used to generate power, and it will begin asking clients to disclose their climate-related risks. Because capital markets pull future risk forward, we will see changes in capital allocation more quickly than we see changes to the climate itself, Fink wrote in the letter. In the near future and sooner than most anticipate there will be a significant reallocation of capital. That shift is already underway. Investors poured $20.6 billion into sustainable funds last year, nearly quadrupling the record it had set a year earlier, according to Morningstar. The industry has broadened in recent years, after starting with simple funds that bluntly excluded stocks deemed as harmful, such as gun makers or tobacco stocks. Investors, particularly younger ones, increasingly say they want their money invested with an eye toward sustainability. Fearful of losing out on those dollars and the fees that they produce investment companies are rushing to meet the surging demand. Fund managers increasingly say they consider environmental, social and governance issues in their broad investment strategy. It\u2019s known as ESG investing in the industry, and it means fund managers measure a company\u2019s performance on the environment and other sustainability issues along with its bottom-line financials when choosing which stocks to own. ESG funds say such an approach can help investors returns, rather than just their consciences, because it can help avoid risky companies, and the big losses they may have ahead of them in the future. Companies with poor records on the environment are more likely to face big fines, for example. If BlackRock really wants to make a difference on the climate emergency, it needs to pile more pressure onto the companies it invests in. That means voting in favour of climate-friendly motions at AGMs, and voting against directors who don\u2019t take the problem seriously enough. George Hay of Reuters has a good take on this, here: Fink\u2019s most eye-catching shift is to change how BlackRock plans to engage with the companies it invests in, whether active or passive. From now on, it will be \u201cincreasingly disposed\u201d to vote against directors at companies that are not doing enough. That includes those like Exxon Mobil which lobbyist CDP argues have been slow to explain how their balance sheets would be affected by higher temperatures. BlackRock itself is evidence of what such a change can achieve. Fink\u2019s greater focus on climate change owes much to the firm\u2019s own clients \u2013 such as Japan\u2019s huge Government Pension Investment Fund \u2013 shoving it in this direction. If Fink is serious about applying the same pressure on the companies BlackRock invests in, his 2020 letter may be seen as a watershed. While environmental campaigners want more from BlackRock, investors such as Ross Gerber are applauding Larry Fink: Here\u2019s our news story on BlackRock\u2019s move into sustainable investing: Here\u2019s Thomas O\u2019Neill, research director at data analysts InfluenceMap (who helped with our Polluters investigation recently) on BlackRock\u2019s decision to shun thermal coal producers: \u201cThis is a positive announcement in the move to make financing of thermal coal more costly. The climate movement will be watching closely to see how BlackRock\u2019s policy of scrutinizing other parts of the thermal coal value chain develops - critically, concerning utilities who continue to plan on new coal generation.\u201d Financial journalist Anne Ashworth reckons BlackRock has been bounced into action by the Greta effect: BlackRock certainly has a lot of catching up to do. As well as holding huge stakes in the fossil fuel industry, BlackRock has also dragged its feet on sustainability in the past, before now seemingly seeing the light. The New York Times sums up the criticism: BlackRock itself has come under criticism from both industry and environmental groups for being behind on pushing these issues. Just last month, a British hedge fund manager, Christopher Hohn, said that it was \u201cappalling\u201d of BlackRock not to require companies to disclose their sustainability efforts, and that the firm\u2019s previous efforts had been \u201cfull of greenwash.\u201d Climate activists staged several protests outside BlackRock\u2019s offices last year, and Mr. Fink himself has received letters from members of Congress urging more action on climate-related investing. According to Ceres and FundVotes, a unit of Morningstar, BlackRock had among the worst voting records on climate issues. Extinction Rebellion aren\u2019t very impressed by BlackRock\u2019s move. The activist campaign, whose protests have helped highlight the climate emergency, points out that Larry Fink\u2019s group has endless billions invested in polluting companies. It\u2019s not always the case that something is better than nothing, particularly if it\u2019s used to distract from the truth. And the truth is that the world\u2019s biggest miners and polluters will not be losing any sleep over this. BlackRock remains waist-deep in fossil fuel investments and the world\u2019s top backer of companies that destroy the Amazon rainforest and ignore the rights of indigenous people. BlackRock can rest assured that we will continue to pile on the pressure until they act to protect our children and the natural world. Back in October, The Guardian showed how BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street collectively held $300bn in fossil fuel investments. My colleague Patrick Greenfield also highlighted that the companies had failed to support climate activists (something BlackRock is now pledging to address). BlackRock and Vanguard opposed or abstained on more than 80% of climate-related motions at FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500 fossil fuel companies between 2015 and 2019, according to data provided by ProxyInsight. The big three are among a number of asset managers that offer \u201cclimate-friendly\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d investment funds that have substantial holdings in fossil fuel companies. Author and journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin says Larry Fink\u2019s move towards sustainable investment is a \u201cwatershed\u201d moment: BUT..... Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gilbert points out that BlackRock\u2019s index-tracking funds aren\u2019t involved. That means the trillions of dollars used for passive investing won\u2019t be directed towards cleaner investments. He writes: BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s biggest fund manager with $7 trillion of assets, says it plans to \u201cplace sustainability at the center of our investment approach.\u201d As environmental, social and governance issues become more pressing, especially for younger savers, it\u2019s a savvy business move that will pressure its peers to follow suit. But there\u2019s a problem. With about two-thirds of the money it manages allocated to index-tracking funds, the issue of how to harness the resources in passive products \u2014 the bulk of which command fees that are too low to finance costly and time-consuming engagement with company boards \u2014 remains unaddressed. Bloomberg\u2019s David Fickling has a good theory about BlackRock\u2019s move towards climate activism. He reckons some CEOs are as scared about the climate emergency as anyone, but can\u2019t reconcile it with their daily lives. This means they end up taking business decisions that make the crisis worse. He cites Siemens\u2019 refusal to abandon a contract to provide rail signalling at a new Australian coalmine, despite also pledging to become carbon neutral by 2030. This prompted a long letter from Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser trying to justify the decision, in which he sound genuinely torn by the dilemma. BlackRock\u2019s move has been welcomed by the US senator for Hawaii, Brian Schatz: Not everyone understands the importance of the climate emergency, of course. If you want to keep putting money into fossil fuel producers, or other companies who contribute large CO2 emissions, BlackRock will happily invest it for you. After all, it\u2019s your money. So after outlining its new commitment to sustainable investment, the company\u2019s letter to its clients concludes by pointing out that the world will be burning hydrocarbons for some time. We invest on your behalf, not our own, and the investments we make will always represent your preferences, timelines, and objectives. We recognize that many clients will continue to prefer traditional strategies, particularly in market-cap weighted indexes. We will manage this money consistent with your preferences, as we always have. The choice remains with you. As we move to a low-carbon world, investment exposure to the global economy will mean exposure to hydrocarbons for some time. While the low-carbon transition is well underway, the technological and economic realities mean that the transition will take decades. Global economic development, particularly in emerging markets, will continue to rely on hydrocarbons for a number of years. As a result, the portfolios we manage will continue to hold exposures to the hydrocarbon economy as the transition advances. BlackRock\u2019s decision to drop major thermal coal producers like hot potatoes is a blow to the fossil fuel sector, says Jeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, the responsible investment campaign group. But, she insists Larry Fink and colleagues need to do a lot more to actually clean up the financial sector, and put pressure on banks: \u201cBlackRock\u2019s coal divestment decision is yet another significant blow to the already dying market. Yet major banks like Barclays continue to prop up coal-heavy companies. If BlackRock is serious about its commitment to phase out thermal coal, it should use its voting rights to get major coal financiers to do the same. She also says Fink has been too secretive, given BlackRock\u2019s massive influence: While we welcome its commitment to improve transparency of its stewardship activities, for far too long the asset manager has kept everyone in the dark about the companies it was meeting with, the topics discussed, and most importantly the outcome of those engagements. But we might not like what we see when we open the door on these activities: BlackRock\u2019s current voting disclosures on climate issues give little comfort that it will vote in a manner fitting of the climate crisis.\u201d BlackRock\u2019s pledge to become a more environmentally responsible investor has been welcomed by some campaigners. Diana Best, senior strategist for the Sunrise Project, says Larry Fink\u2019s decision is a \u201cfantastic start\u201d, which could spur rivals into action. \u201cBlackRock\u2019s new initiatives match the size of the crisis we\u2019re seeing 2020 and are the direct result of an outpouring of pressure from the global climate movement that has zeroed in on the company over the past year. Putting climate change at the absolute center of its business is the way every company should respond to this planetary emergency. \u201cBlackRock beginning its shift of capital out of fossil fuels, including today\u2019s divestment of coal in its actively managed funds, is a fantastic start and instantly raises the bar for competitors such as Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors. But Best also warns that BlackRock has more work to do: Even with today\u2019s announcements, based on its size BlackRock will still remain one of, if not the largest, investors in fossil fuels. So we will be looking for additional leadership from the company in, as Larry Fink said, \u2018fundamentally reshaping finance to deal with climate change,\u201d including additional shifts of capital out of fossil fuels.\u201d Sunrise is part of the BlackRock\u2019s Big Problem campaign, which calls the company \u201cthe biggest driver of climate chaos you\u2019ve never heard of\u201d. BlackRock is also promising to double the number of environmental, Social, and Governance-focused exchange-traded funds it offers. It will add a \u2018fossil fuel screen\u2019 to allow investors to keep their money away from big polluters. BlackRock is also (belatedly) promising to play a more active role in fighting the climate emergency, by joining the Climate Action 100+ campaign (announced last week) It is also demanding that companies publish their plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized. It threatens..... Given the groundwork we have already laid and the growing investment risks surrounding sustainability, we will be increasingly disposed to vote against management when companies have not made sufficient progress. You can read Larry Fink\u2019s annual letter to the world\u2019s CEOs, warning about the climate emergency, here: A Fundamental Reshaping of Finance BlackRock\u2019s letter to clients, outlining its new pledge to sustainable investment, is here: Sustainability as BlackRock\u2019s New Standard for Investing How, exactly, will BlackRock clean up its act? The investment giant has told clients this morning that it will make several major changes. Some will improve its own practices, and others will make it easier for people to choose environmentally-sustainable products. It will make sustainability a \u201cstandard offering\u201d in its financial products. That means environmentally responsible versions of popular funds, including retirement products, and its iShares investing platform Its active investment managers will be held accountable for how they have managed exposure to environmental, social and governance issues (ESG). These risks will be treated with the \u201csame rigor\u201d as credit and liquidity risk It will reduce ESG risk from its active strategies, which currently manage $1.8 trillion of assets. That includes quitting thermal coal producers (as explained earlier). It will integrate new ESG assessment tools into its risk management platform, called Aladdin. It will also build new tools; one to assess physical climate risks and one to calculate the sustainability-related characteristics of companies. BlackRock will do a better job of showing investors the sustainability risks of their investments. By the end of 2020, it will show which controversial holdings are within its mutual funds, and report their carbon footprint. Some journalists are questioning quite how significant BlackRock\u2019s new environmental pledges will be in practice. Neil Hume of the Financial Times reckons the new anti-coal policy won\u2019t affect the world\u2019s biggest miners. That\u2019s because their coal production, although significant, is only a small part of their overall business. Bloomberg\u2019s Dani Burger points out BlackRock isn\u2019t proposing ditching fossil fuel companies from its passive investment arm (tracker funds that model the broad stock market). BlackRock\u2019s new opposition to thermal coal, and the firms which burn it, could make it harder to invest in China. China produced 44% of the world\u2019s coal in 2016, according to data from the World Economic Forum. BlackRock is promising to ditch its holdings in any company that produces more than a quarter of its revenues from thermal coal. Larry Fink says its active investment teams will shun major coal producers, due to the environmental damage they cause. Thermal coal is significantly carbon intensive, becoming less and less economically viable, and highly exposed to regulation because of its environmental impacts. With the acceleration of the global energy transition, we do not believe that the long-term economic or investment rationale justifies continued investment in this sector. As a result, we are in the process of removing from our discretionary active investment portfolios the public securities (both debt and equity) of companies that generate more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal production, which we aim to accomplish by the middle of 2020. Fink adds that BlackRock will also \u201cclosely scrutinise\u201d firms that are heavily reliant on thermal coal (which would include power companies and major manufacturers). BlackRock has been targeted by climate emergency activists in recent months, given it is a major investor in the fossil fuel industry. Protesters, such as Extinction Rebellion, have urged the group to divest its investments in greenhouse gas emitters, and in companies who are chopping down the Amazon rain forest. This message seems to have got through to BlackRock, which has noted that children and young adults are taking a key role in these protests. Larry Fink says today\u2019s activists are tomorrow\u2019s business leaders and politicians (as well as savers who won\u2019t want to invest in fossil fuel firms). Young people have been at the forefront of calling on institutions \u2013 including BlackRock \u2013 to address the new challenges associated with climate change. They are asking more of companies and of governments, in both transparency and in action. And as trillions of dollars shift to millennials over the next few decades, as they become CEOs and CIOs, as they become the policymakers and heads of state, they will further reshape the world\u2019s approach to sustainability. BlackRock is also firing a warning shot at business leaders, saying it will use its clout to vote them off their boards if they don\u2019t take climate change seriously. CEO Larry Fink writes: We believe that when a company is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. Last year BlackRock voted against or withheld votes from 4,800 directors at 2,700 different companies. Where we feel companies and boards are not producing effective sustainability disclosures or implementing frameworks for managing these issues, we will hold board members accountable. Given the groundwork we have already laid engaging on disclosure, and the growing investment risks surrounding sustainability, we will be increasingly disposed to vote against management and board directors when companies are not making sufficient progress on sustainability-related disclosures and the business practices and plans underlying them. This is ironic, as BlackRock has previously been heavily criticised for failing to support shareholder motions on climate Investors around the world have woken up to the climate emergency, BlackRock says. In today\u2019s letter, Larry Fink warns that capital will be reallocated faster than many people think -- that\u2019s a coded way of saying that certain assets prices are going to tumble. He writes: Investors are increasingly reckoning with these questions and recognizing that climate risk is investment risk. Indeed, climate change is almost invariably the top issue that clients around the world raise with BlackRock. From Europe to Australia, South America to China, Florida to Oregon, investors are asking how they should modify their portfolios. They are seeking to understand both the physical risks associated with climate change as well as the ways that climate policy will impact prices, costs, and demand across the entire economy. These questions are driving a profound reassessment of risk and asset values. And because capital markets pull future risk forward, we will see changes in capital allocation more quickly than we see changes to the climate itself. In the near future \u2013 and sooner than most anticipate \u2013 there will be a significant reallocation of capital. Breaking: BlackRock, the asset management titan, has announced it will put environmental sustainability at the core of its investment decisions. In his annual letter to CEOs, just released, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says the climate emergency is forcing investors to rethink their plans. He writes: Climate change has become a defining factor in companies\u2019 long-term prospects. Last September, when millions of people took to the streets to demand action on climate change, many of them emphasized the significant and lasting impact that it will have on economic growth and prosperity \u2013 a risk that markets to date have been slower to reflect. But awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance. This move follows heavy criticism of BlackRock itself in recent years, as it is a major investor in oil, gas and coal. So what will BlackRock actually do? Fink identifies several measures, including lowering its exposure to fossil fuel companies - a major demand by environmental protesters. He says BlackRock will: making sustainability integral to portfolio construction and risk management; exiting investments that present a high sustainability-related risk, such as thermal coal producers; launching new investment products that screen fossil fuels; and strengthening our commitment to sustainability and transparency in our investment stewardship activities. Crucially, the company is talking about playing an active role in solving the climate crisis, telling shareholders: BlackRock does not see itself as a passive observer in the low-carbon transition. We believe we have a significant responsibility \u2013 as a provider of index funds, as a fiduciary, and as a member of society \u2013 to play a constructive role in the transition. Fink\u2019s letter comes just days after BlackRock signed up to Climate Action 100+, a pressure group of investors who are pushing the world\u2019s largest CO2 emitters to cut pollution. Fink\u2019s letter is online here. I\u2019ll pull together more highlights and reaction now. Here\u2019s our latest story on the push to safe Flybe. In the City, shares in UK gambling firms have fallen after they were hit with a ban on credit card payments. The Gambling Commission has decided to block people from placing bets using credit cards, responding to concerns that vulnerable gamblers are being allowed to run up huge debts. The culture minister, Helen Whately, says: \u201cThere is clear evidence of harm from consumers betting with money they do not have, so it is absolutely right that we act decisively to protect them. The prospect of losing a lucrative income stream from addicts has hit the sector. Shares in William Hill have dropped by 3.1% this morning, with Flutter (owner of Paddy Power) losing 1.6%. China has also posted strong trade figures today, Exports rose 7.6% year-on-year in dollar terms in December, up from a 1.3% decline in November. That\u2019s stronger than expected. Imports jumped 16.3% year-on-year, up from a measly 0.3% rise in November. This is also fuelling hopes that China\u2019s economy is picking up. China\u2019s currency has hit its highest level since the end of July. The yuan jumped by 0.3% to 6.8968 against the US dollar, on relief that relations with Washington are improving. Investors are hoping that the Phase One trade deal will boost growth, alongside Beijing\u2019s attempts to stimulate its economy. Ironically, America\u2019s decision to stop calling China a currency manipulator is also helping the yuan to strengthen. China has welcomed America\u2019s decision to stop labelling it as a currency manipulator. Customs vice-minister Zou Zhiwu told reporters in Beijing that it was a \u201ccorrect choice\u201d (China had always insisted that the US was being unfair on this issue). Separately, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China would keep its currency \u2018basically stable\u2019. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Peace is breaking out between the US and China in their long-running, damaging, trade dispute. A high-level delegation of Chinese officials have landed in Washington, ready to put their signature to the Phase One deal agreed with the US. The signing ceremony, scheduled for tomorrow, will allow Donald Trump to declare a victory -- and could eventually lead to lower tariffs on each country\u2019s imports. The preliminary deal doesn\u2019t tackle some of the tough issues, but it does include a pledge for China to buy more US food, agriculture and seafood products, and to stop forcing US companies to hand over their intellectual property. And in an important sign that relations are thawing, America is also stopping labelling China a currency manipulator. It no longer claims that Beijing keeps the yuan unfairly cheap to make its exports competitive, at the expense of rivals. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin announced the change of policy, saying that: \u201cChina has made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation, while promoting transparency and accountability Kit Juckes of Societe Generale it\u2019s an encouraging sign for investors: The symbolic removal of the \u2018currency manipulator\u2019 tag from China has no great significance but it\u2019s a reward for getting the \u2018Phase 1\u2019 trade deal over the line and markets are euphoric ahead of tomorrow\u2019s signing ceremony. The yuan is stronger, and is dragging trade -sensitive currencies with it. Global stocks are also continuing to rally. The US stocks scaled new peaks last night, lifting MSCI\u2019s All Country Index of stocks to a new record as well. Also coming up today UK regional airline Flybe continues to fight for survival, send ministers scurrying to fins ways to keep its planes in the air. The latest rumour is that the government is considering cutting air passenger duty on domestic flights, or allowing Flybe to defer its bill, to provide the company with some breathing space. Flybe continues to operate this morning, as the UK\u2019s pilots union urges the government to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to save the firm. Environmentalists, though, take another view.... It\u2019s also a busy morning for corporate news. UK housebuilder Taylor Wimpey has reported a 5% increase in home completions in 2019, while retailer BooHoo posting a 44% surge in revenues over Christmas. The agenda 1.30pm GMT: US inflation for December. CPI is expected to rise to 2.4% year-on-year, from 2%",

      "body": "<h2>\u2018Just out of nowhere I felt really really sad\u2019</h2> <p>I have always been extremely happy. When I was 45 my husband left me quite suddenly after 25 years of what I thought was a very happy life. I was miserable but I could cope. After six days I met my current husband and apart from being unhappy I was also in love. But then I turned 47 and two or three months later I felt so miserable. Just out of nowhere I felt really really sad. I had no money, I missed my children, and my work wasn\u2019t going well. It feels like I had to cross some sort of swamp to get to the other side. Now, at the age of 54, I am happy and have been for quite a while. <strong>Manon Sikkel, 54, writer, Amsterdam</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I feel like I\u2019m questioning a lot about life these days\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s weird timing that I\u2019m seeing your article now, at the age 47, as I do feel like I\u2019m questioning a lot about life these days. I think a lot about the difference between how I thought life would be and the reality. I became a parent quite late and, to be honest, I do struggle with the practicalities of looking after a pre-schooler. I do love my little girl, but it can often feel like hard work at a time of life when used to think I\u2019d feel less pressured and stressed.</p> <p>Work-wise, I became self-employed two years ago. Partly because of childcare issues, but also because, working in marketing, I could sense myself losing touch with the latest developments \u2013 especially on the social media side. Obviously family time is important and we all need to earn a living, but I suppose this is an age where I think I haven\u2019t achieved what I might have wanted (although I was never totally sure what this was). Or I at least wonder what else I could be doing that might be more fulfilling. It is a funny time of life for me, and I don\u2019t want to moan as I do appreciate there\u2019s not actually anything wrong with my life. Hopefully things will change as my daughter becomes more self-reliant and I can enjoy time with her more. And while I must admit to feeling quite lost now, I think my 50s could be OK. <strong>Matt, Birmingham</strong></p> <h2>\u2018My 40s in general were probably the best period of my life\u2019</h2> <p>Sorry to go against the findings but I would say that my 40s in general were probably the best period of my life. My life changed a lot during my 20s and 30s and I had a lot of fun as a performing musician, but having young kids and being very involved with their development was very satisfying. The relationship with my partner was good and I reached a kind of maturity whilst still retaining most of my energy and enthusiasm for life. I would definitely say I was far more satisfied with life at 47 than I was at 57. <strong>Andrew Jarman, 63, works in event production, Seville, Spain</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m not sure where my life is going\u2019</h2> <p>I worry a lot: about money, my kids\u2019 happiness, my marriage, and family issues. I miss my dad who passed away; I have insomnia and I\u2019m not sure where my life is going. I feel so tired that at the end of the day I go to bed before the kids! So I don\u2019t really do anything for me, not anything that I can sustain, anyway, because I\u2019m either with the children, at work or too tired/don\u2019t have enough money. I am unhappy about my home: my husband is a bit of a hoarder and we have a very small house. I hate the clutter as it stresses me out and makes me sad, but he won\u2019t throw anything away. It upsets me. <strong>Katie, 47, Sydney</strong></p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s that classic midlife realisation that I\u2019ve spent more than 20 years in a career that I don\u2019t really enjoy\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ll be 47 in a couple of weeks. Physically I\u2019m in good shape and quite active. However, over the past nine months or so my mental health has been very poor. I\u2019ve had quite severe depression and anxiety attacks. I\u2019ve tried therapy (not very helpful) and am on antidepressants, but feel like I\u2019m really only just keeping my head above water. I haven\u2019t been off work but cannot focus and feel like I\u2019m just going through the motions when I\u2019m there. I don\u2019t socialise as much as I used to, and don\u2019t tend to enjoy it when I do. There are a number of factors that have combined to hit me hard at this age.</p> <p>I have a job with lots of responsibilities and stress; a parent with dementia and poor health; and the various stresses and strains that go with being a husband and parent. I\u2019m lucky enough not to have financial worries, but even so I find managing my personal finances stressful. Most of all, though, it\u2019s that classic midlife realisation that I\u2019ve spent more than 20 years in a career that I don\u2019t really enjoy or find meaningful or fulfilling, and that the clock is ticking if I want to spend the rest of my life doing things that I love and are important to me. <strong>John, London</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Just before my 47 birthday my husband announced that he was having an affair\u2019</h2> <p>At the time I felt there must be more \u2013 that the monotony of existence couldn\u2019t go on. Then, a few weeks before my 47 birthday, my husband announced he was having an affair with his secretary. He packed his things and left. I was pretty cross about him throwing away a 25-year relationship in such a cliched fashion \u2013 but a part of me was singing with joy. This was my \u2018out\u2019. The following year wasn\u2019t a pleasant one, and I did grieve for what I lost \u2013 but I love my new life. I have a home, children, friends, a resurrected career and no miserable old git asking how much my boots cost. I have become much happier. <strong>Naomi, Oxfordshire</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I saw the first symptoms of menopause and had difficulty sleeping\u2019</h2> <p>Ghastly. I was working 12 hours a day to support my family, with a house husband who hated staying at home to look after our two children but couldn\u2019t find a well-paid job. This put a terrible strain on our marriage. I discovered later that he spent his day online in sex chat rooms. I felt unattractive, exhausted from my three-hour commute every day into London, and a bad mother. Not surprisingly, at 49 things came to a head. I ended up having an affair and we divorced when I was 51.</p> <p>I put on weight through excessive drinking and a lack of exercise. I saw the first symptoms of menopause and had difficulty sleeping. In bed at night I had the sensation of ants crawling over my legs. There were some very dark times when I had massive rows with my husband and walked out of the house, only returning after five or six hours. I have now been in a loving and secure relationship for nine years. <strong>Gemma, Dorset</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I can enjoy my dreadfully dreary and mundane hobbies without fear of what people might think\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m generally happier than I\u2019ve ever been. No one told me middle age was so enjoyable. I know who I am and still have enough energy to enjoy life. I have sod all to prove to anyone at this age so I can enjoy my dreadfully dreary and mundane hobbies and activities without fear of what people might think. It\u2019s great.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Just out of nowhere I felt really really sad\u2019 I have always been extremely happy. When I was 45 my husband left me quite suddenly after 25 years of what I thought was a very happy life. I was miserable but I could cope. After six days I met my current husband and apart from being unhappy I was also in love. But then I turned 47 and two or three months later I felt so miserable. Just out of nowhere I felt really really sad. I had no money, I missed my children, and my work wasn\u2019t going well. It feels like I had to cross some sort of swamp to get to the other side. Now, at the age of 54, I am happy and have been for quite a while. Manon Sikkel, 54, writer, Amsterdam \u2018I feel like I\u2019m questioning a lot about life these days\u2019 It\u2019s weird timing that I\u2019m seeing your article now, at the age 47, as I do feel like I\u2019m questioning a lot about life these days. I think a lot about the difference between how I thought life would be and the reality. I became a parent quite late and, to be honest, I do struggle with the practicalities of looking after a pre-schooler. I do love my little girl, but it can often feel like hard work at a time of life when used to think I\u2019d feel less pressured and stressed. Work-wise, I became self-employed two years ago. Partly because of childcare issues, but also because, working in marketing, I could sense myself losing touch with the latest developments \u2013 especially on the social media side. Obviously family time is important and we all need to earn a living, but I suppose this is an age where I think I haven\u2019t achieved what I might have wanted (although I was never totally sure what this was). Or I at least wonder what else I could be doing that might be more fulfilling. It is a funny time of life for me, and I don\u2019t want to moan as I do appreciate there\u2019s not actually anything wrong with my life. Hopefully things will change as my daughter becomes more self-reliant and I can enjoy time with her more. And while I must admit to feeling quite lost now, I think my 50s could be OK. Matt, Birmingham \u2018My 40s in general were probably the best period of my life\u2019 Sorry to go against the findings but I would say that my 40s in general were probably the best period of my life. My life changed a lot during my 20s and 30s and I had a lot of fun as a performing musician, but having young kids and being very involved with their development was very satisfying. The relationship with my partner was good and I reached a kind of maturity whilst still retaining most of my energy and enthusiasm for life. I would definitely say I was far more satisfied with life at 47 than I was at 57. Andrew Jarman, 63, works in event production, Seville, Spain \u2018I\u2019m not sure where my life is going\u2019 I worry a lot: about money, my kids\u2019 happiness, my marriage, and family issues. I miss my dad who passed away; I have insomnia and I\u2019m not sure where my life is going. I feel so tired that at the end of the day I go to bed before the kids! So I don\u2019t really do anything for me, not anything that I can sustain, anyway, because I\u2019m either with the children, at work or too tired/don\u2019t have enough money. I am unhappy about my home: my husband is a bit of a hoarder and we have a very small house. I hate the clutter as it stresses me out and makes me sad, but he won\u2019t throw anything away. It upsets me. Katie, 47, Sydney \u2018It\u2019s that classic midlife realisation that I\u2019ve spent more than 20 years in a career that I don\u2019t really enjoy\u2019 I\u2019ll be 47 in a couple of weeks. Physically I\u2019m in good shape and quite active. However, over the past nine months or so my mental health has been very poor. I\u2019ve had quite severe depression and anxiety attacks. I\u2019ve tried therapy (not very helpful) and am on antidepressants, but feel like I\u2019m really only just keeping my head above water. I haven\u2019t been off work but cannot focus and feel like I\u2019m just going through the motions when I\u2019m there. I don\u2019t socialise as much as I used to, and don\u2019t tend to enjoy it when I do. There are a number of factors that have combined to hit me hard at this age. I have a job with lots of responsibilities and stress; a parent with dementia and poor health; and the various stresses and strains that go with being a husband and parent. I\u2019m lucky enough not to have financial worries, but even so I find managing my personal finances stressful. Most of all, though, it\u2019s that classic midlife realisation that I\u2019ve spent more than 20 years in a career that I don\u2019t really enjoy or find meaningful or fulfilling, and that the clock is ticking if I want to spend the rest of my life doing things that I love and are important to me. John, London \u2018Just before my 47 birthday my husband announced that he was having an affair\u2019 At the time I felt there must be more \u2013 that the monotony of existence couldn\u2019t go on. Then, a few weeks before my 47 birthday, my husband announced he was having an affair with his secretary. He packed his things and left. I was pretty cross about him throwing away a 25-year relationship in such a cliched fashion \u2013 but a part of me was singing with joy. This was my \u2018out\u2019. The following year wasn\u2019t a pleasant one, and I did grieve for what I lost \u2013 but I love my new life. I have a home, children, friends, a resurrected career and no miserable old git asking how much my boots cost. I have become much happier. Naomi, Oxfordshire \u2018I saw the first symptoms of menopause and had difficulty sleeping\u2019 Ghastly. I was working 12 hours a day to support my family, with a house husband who hated staying at home to look after our two children but couldn\u2019t find a well-paid job. This put a terrible strain on our marriage. I discovered later that he spent his day online in sex chat rooms. I felt unattractive, exhausted from my three-hour commute every day into London, and a bad mother. Not surprisingly, at 49 things came to a head. I ended up having an affair and we divorced when I was 51. I put on weight through excessive drinking and a lack of exercise. I saw the first symptoms of menopause and had difficulty sleeping. In bed at night I had the sensation of ants crawling over my legs. There were some very dark times when I had massive rows with my husband and walked out of the house, only returning after five or six hours. I have now been in a loving and secure relationship for nine years. Gemma, Dorset \u2018I can enjoy my dreadfully dreary and mundane hobbies without fear of what people might think\u2019 I\u2019m generally happier than I\u2019ve ever been. No one told me middle age was so enjoyable. I know who I am and still have enough energy to enjoy life. I have sod all to prove to anyone at this age so I can enjoy my dreadfully dreary and mundane hobbies and activities without fear of what people might think. It\u2019s great. Only down side is my job which is down to a lack of skilled positions in my area - but the pay is ok and it keeps me out of trouble. David, Carlisle \u2018I feel like life is slipping by\u2019 At the age of 46.5 I feel quite drained by the daily routine which involves managing a household, two kids and a full-time job. I have come to realise that over the last year or so, every holiday I take is followed by an utmost struggle to fit back into the usual pattern and this has induced me to reflect on the quality of life I live and my expectations.

      "bodyText": "Jack Clarke is putting the finishing touches to a loan move to Queens Park Rangers for the remainder of the season. The Tottenham winger spent the first half of the campaign on a loan\u2011back deal at Leeds \u2013 from where Spurs signed him last summer for an initial fee of around \u00a310m. It has been a tough season for the 19-year-old, who made only three appearances for Leeds \u2013 two as a starter in the EFL Cup, one as a substitute in the Championship. He was held back in part by the rule that says Championship clubs can only name five loanees in their matchday squads. Leeds have five other players on temporary deals and Clarke was often the odd man out. Tottenham recalled him when the January window opened with a view to finding him a loan where he could feature more regularly and QPR who, coincidentally, face Leeds at Loftus Road on Saturday, have beaten off competition from other Championship clubs to get him. Spurs are poised to announce the loan signing of the midfielder Gedson Fernandes from Benfica. The 21\u2011year\u2011old, who has two Portugal caps, has completed his medical and will join on an 18-month deal, which could become permanent in the summer of 2021. Spurs are looking for a new striker to cover the long-term injury absence of Harry Kane and have opened talks with Milan over the Poland international Krzysztof Piatak, who is rated at \u00a330m. Tottenham would like to take him on loan but Milan are adamant that it must be a permanent deal or nothing. Chelsea\u2019s Conor Gallagher is set to join Swansea City on loan until the end of the season and follow Marc Guehi and Rhian Brewster in reuniting with the former England Under-17 manager Steve Cooper. Gallagher trained with Chelsea\u2019s first team squad after his loan at Charlton Athletic was cut short and the 19-year-old midfielder, who was targeted by several clubs after impressing on loan at Charlton during the first half of the season, has already agreed to move to Swansea. Gallagher had interest from Burnley and Norwich City, both of whom wanted to sign him permanently, and West Bromwich Albion were one of the Championship clubs hoping to take him on loan. However Cooper\u2019s presence at Swansea has helped the Welsh club win the race to land the highly rated Chelsea youngster. Guehi, a 19-year-old Chelsea defender has joined Swansea on loan for the next 18 months, and Cooper also helped the Championship club borrow the 19-year-old forward Brewster from Liverpool. Brewster, Guehi and Gallagher were all part of the England Under-17 squad that won the World Cup under Cooper in 2017. Charlton were desperate to hang on to Gallagher but Chelsea\u2019s loan department want their top young players to push themselves on loan, which means playing for sides pushing for promotion from the Championship. Lee Bowyer\u2019s side are 19th in the Championship, whereas Swansea are seventh. Gallagher, one of the most promising players to emerge from Chelsea\u2019s flourishing academy, has scored six goals for Charlton this season and was one of the south London club\u2019s best performers. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d Bowyer said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see this coming if I\u2019m honest, which makes it harder to take. We have to move on.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Last year, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie gave the inaugural <a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/tlsvoices/f3d0d722-3ecb-42db-8332-a66d9166881e\">Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez</a><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/tlsvoices/f3d0d722-3ecb-42db-8332-a66d9166881e\"> lecture</a> and spoke about truth and storytelling. \u201cTo start a story, a true story, thinking of balance is already to place an obstacle in the path of that story,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause what one must focus on is not balance, but truth.\u201d</p> <p>Those who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/12/bbc-fairness-not-balance-one-side-lying-brexit\">lamented the failures of the BBC</a> over the past few years<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/12/bbc-fairness-not-balance-one-side-lying-brexit\"> </a>will understand this point only too well, but I\u2019d still recommend listening to this lecture. It\u2019s moving and impressive to hear Adichie make her points so forcefully and eloquently \u2013 and a worthwhile reminder of the curious fact that the people who offer us the best insights into reality are often novelists, rather than reporters.</p> <p>Adichie herself is a case in point. Among other things, Half of a Yellow Sun is one of the great truth-telling novels. Both in Nigeria and around the world, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2007/jun/06/books1191\">many people\u2019s introduction to the Biafran conflict</a>. It has helped hundreds of thousands of people understand a situation that has been largely forgotten, while telling a story that feels truthful \u2013 but is also clearly a work of fiction.</p> <p>It\u2019s here that the definition of truth becomes complicated. We accept that fiction tells us the truth, even if that\u2019s a contradiction in terms. We all understand what Hemingway meant when he explained how he produced fiction: \u201cAll you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter that Papa sat there and made things up. There\u2019s a different kind of truth to be found in how he describes the downhill rush of skiing, the taste of Spanish red wine, or how it feels to know you\u2019ve lost the love of your life.</p> <p>Yet, this idea does also have obvious complications. We have to do some internal calculations to work out exactly where that truth lies. Hemingway\u2019s short stories are different to his journalism, for instance. His novel about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea\">an old man catching a mythically huge fish</a> has a different relationship to historical events than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Farewell_to_Arms\">his novel about the Italian front in the first world war</a>. If you want to know the moral truth about the pompous cruelty of fascists in Italy in the early years of Mussolini\u2019s reign, I\u2019d recommend reading his short story about travelling through the country, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Ti_Dice_La_Patria%3F\">Che Ti Dice La Patria</a> \u2013 just don\u2019t go there for the cold facts and stats.</p> <p>We feel such gradations of truth instinctively when we read, so much so that it seems almost redundant to try to sift through these differences in this way. But every so often, a book tests our instincts and makes us investigate our feelings about truth and reality more deeply. Half of a Yellow Sun is one of those books.</p> <p>On a factual level, this novel has deep roots in the events of 1967 to 1970. Adichie drew on first-hand eyewitness accounts from her parents and close family, friends and compatriots who were involved in the Biafran conflict. She researched books on the war for years <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b45s0\">(even though they could be \u201cboring\u201d)</a> and says that almost every single incident in the novel is based on something real. That adds an extra frisson of horror to descriptions of incidents like the one where a woman shows Olanna a bag containing her little girl\u2019s head and says: \u201cDo you know it took me so long to plait this hair? She had such thick hair \u2026\u201d Or the horrific descriptions of hunger and desperation at refugee centres, the rapes and the murders.</p> <p>At the same time, facts are not Adichie\u2019s main concern. She doesn\u2019t get much involved in debates about the numbers killed by the famine the war brought, the political manoeuvres of the various powers who helped arm fighters on both sides. She doesn\u2019t state the kind of truths that would go into an encyclopedia article on Biafra. She shows instead the things that her characters see and feel. It\u2019s deliberately one-sided and narrow in its focus. There\u2019s no false pretence at balance.</p> <p>So it is that we learn as much about the flavour of pepper soup, or the way dust motes swim in the sunlight, as we do about facts and figures. We learn more about what it means to find yourself fighting for your life. To be so brutalised by conflict that you can be involved in a gang rape. To be hungry enough to eat rats. To not know where your sister is, but know enough that she almost certainly isn\u2019t coming back. Adichie\u2019s concern is not so much with the physical and countable impact of the conflict as the emotional.</p> <p>At the conclusion of the M\u00e1rquez lecture, Adichie asks whether we should reconsider the distinction between journalism and fiction, and \u201crethink the labels we attach to writing. Whether we should think more simply of good writing and bad writing. Storytelling that engages and storytelling that does not.\u201d On this reckoning, she has succeeded. The truth the book tells is about the horror and the pity of war. About the human beings who had to suffer it. Wikipedia can tell me that \u201calmost two million Biafran civilians died from starvation\u201d during the war, but it\u2019s Half of a Yellow Sun that shows me what that really means.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last year, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie gave the inaugural Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez lecture and spoke about truth and storytelling. \u201cTo start a story, a true story, thinking of balance is already to place an obstacle in the path of that story,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause what one must focus on is not balance, but truth.\u201d Those who have lamented the failures of the BBC over the past few years will understand this point only too well, but I\u2019d still recommend listening to this lecture. It\u2019s moving and impressive to hear Adichie make her points so forcefully and eloquently \u2013 and a worthwhile reminder of the curious fact that the people who offer us the best insights into reality are often novelists, rather than reporters. Adichie herself is a case in point. Among other things, Half of a Yellow Sun is one of the great truth-telling novels. Both in Nigeria and around the world, it was many people\u2019s introduction to the Biafran conflict. It has helped hundreds of thousands of people understand a situation that has been largely forgotten, while telling a story that feels truthful \u2013 but is also clearly a work of fiction. It\u2019s here that the definition of truth becomes complicated. We accept that fiction tells us the truth, even if that\u2019s a contradiction in terms. We all understand what Hemingway meant when he explained how he produced fiction: \u201cAll you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter that Papa sat there and made things up. There\u2019s a different kind of truth to be found in how he describes the downhill rush of skiing, the taste of Spanish red wine, or how it feels to know you\u2019ve lost the love of your life. Yet, this idea does also have obvious complications. We have to do some internal calculations to work out exactly where that truth lies. Hemingway\u2019s short stories are different to his journalism, for instance. His novel about an old man catching a mythically huge fish has a different relationship to historical events than his novel about the Italian front in the first world war. If you want to know the moral truth about the pompous cruelty of fascists in Italy in the early years of Mussolini\u2019s reign, I\u2019d recommend reading his short story about travelling through the country, Che Ti Dice La Patria \u2013 just don\u2019t go there for the cold facts and stats. We feel such gradations of truth instinctively when we read, so much so that it seems almost redundant to try to sift through these differences in this way. But every so often, a book tests our instincts and makes us investigate our feelings about truth and reality more deeply. Half of a Yellow Sun is one of those books. On a factual level, this novel has deep roots in the events of 1967 to 1970. Adichie drew on first-hand eyewitness accounts from her parents and close family, friends and compatriots who were involved in the Biafran conflict. She researched books on the war for years (even though they could be \u201cboring\u201d) and says that almost every single incident in the novel is based on something real. That adds an extra frisson of horror to descriptions of incidents like the one where a woman shows Olanna a bag containing her little girl\u2019s head and says: \u201cDo you know it took me so long to plait this hair? She had such thick hair \u2026\u201d Or the horrific descriptions of hunger and desperation at refugee centres, the rapes and the murders. At the same time, facts are not Adichie\u2019s main concern. She doesn\u2019t get much involved in debates about the numbers killed by the famine the war brought, the political manoeuvres of the various powers who helped arm fighters on both sides. She doesn\u2019t state the kind of truths that would go into an encyclopedia article on Biafra. She shows instead the things that her characters see and feel. It\u2019s deliberately one-sided and narrow in its focus. There\u2019s no false pretence at balance. So it is that we learn as much about the flavour of pepper soup, or the way dust motes swim in the sunlight, as we do about facts and figures. We learn more about what it means to find yourself fighting for your life. To be so brutalised by conflict that you can be involved in a gang rape. To be hungry enough to eat rats. To not know where your sister is, but know enough that she almost certainly isn\u2019t coming back. Adichie\u2019s concern is not so much with the physical and countable impact of the conflict as the emotional. At the conclusion of the M\u00e1rquez lecture, Adichie asks whether we should reconsider the distinction between journalism and fiction, and \u201crethink the labels we attach to writing. Whether we should think more simply of good writing and bad writing. Storytelling that engages and storytelling that does not.\u201d On this reckoning, she has succeeded. The truth the book tells is about the horror and the pity of war. About the human beings who had to suffer it. Wikipedia can tell me that \u201calmost two million Biafran civilians died from starvation\u201d during the war, but it\u2019s Half of a Yellow Sun that shows me what that really means.",

      "bodyText": "The Sistine Chapel is easy to find. Just follow the A259 through Goring-by-Sea until you see the low, spireless red brick English Martyrs Church. Enter this Catholic place of worship \u2013 and look up.Above the simple wooden pews, laid out in bold yellows, greens, pinks and blues, you can see God dividing the land and waters, making the sun and Earth, reaching out a powerful finger to spark life into Adam. It\u2019s Michelangelo\u2019s masterpiece all right, superbly replicated by the Sussex church\u2019s deacon, Gary Bevans. Created between 1987 and 1993, his achievement seems all the more remarkable now that digital reproductions of the original are having a bit of a moment. HBO\u2019s The Young Pope and its follow-up The New Pope both use hi-tech digital copies, as does Netflix\u2019s The Two Popes. Yet Bevans\u2019 version is hand-painted. That makes it a human story \u2013 and a human masterpiece. \u201cI\u2019m a trained signwriter,\u201d says Bevans as we gaze up at the prophets, nudes and scenes from Genesis. \u201cThat was my craft when I left school. It\u2019s a lovely old craft \u2013 pub signs, shop fronts, lorries before they were done in vinyl. I had a love of doing old masters for pleasure.\u201d Bevans never went to art college: everything he knows about fine art he has \u201cpicked up by experience\u201d and by curiosity. \u201cI like the Renaissance: I see that as the height of western art. I do love to see the visual in a church \u2013 smells and bells. It lifts you from the bland reality of life. All churches should be like this.\u201d Certainly, if you like incense and tolling bells, there\u2019s no place like Rome. Michelangelo gave the Vatican its defining glory when, in 1508, he started to fresco the vaulted ceiling of the papal chapel built by Pope Sixtus IV (hence \u201cSistine\u201d). When Bevans saw the ceiling for himself in the 1980s, it was midway through a restoration that had uncovered a much more luminous and colourful creation than anyone expected. \u201cAbout 20 of us went from here to Rome on a pilgrimage,\u201d says Bevans. \u201cI came back and looked at this white ceiling and thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have Renaissance art here.\u2019\u201d The parish priest was cautiously encouraging, saying: \u201c\u2018Do you think you could do it?\u2019\u201d As progress was made, TV cameras and tourists were drawn in, their contributions helping to fund the work. Bevans himself wasn\u2019t paid and had to keep one eye on his sign-painting business. \u201cJuggling my time, I had to make sure I provided for my young children and wife.\u201d As a signwriter, he was used to filling precisely planned spaces to the millimetre. When he started his epic task, he had to map out the whole 100ft painting on a grid. Then he built a wooden vaulted surface under the church roof, primed it in white, and copied his drawing onto it. The result is perfect. Sussex\u2019s Sistine is two-thirds the size of the original, and its proportions are bang on, making it a mathematical as well as an artistic feat. In the Renaissance, this command of large-scale perspective was called quadratura. While you won\u2019t find many modern art schools teaching the technique, Bevans\u2019s grasp of it perfectly captured the spatial intricacy of Michelangelo\u2019s original. Bevans also came to know the agony and ecstasy that Michelangelo experienced. Like the old master, Bevin stood on a platform to paint, with his head bent up \u2013 he did not lie on his back as is sometimes believed. \u201cAt first I could only do it for 20 minutes. It took me six months to be able to paint like that for four to six hours at a time.\u201d He almost fell off the scaffold, too. One difference is that, because Bevans was painting on wood rather than plaster, he couldn\u2019t use the classic fresco technique, having to opt instead for acrylics.

The required rate is under four an over now, with both openers wonderfully placed to reach tons.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1dc3b48f08d66fcfaa3b9f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-14T13:37:42.506Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>18th over: Australia 125-0 (Warner 58, Finch 55) Target 256. </strong>Jadeja has Finch in a bit of bother early in the over, finding his leading edge when trying to tuck him into the legside.

The action gets underway at the Wankhede Stadium at 7pm AEST.</p> <p>It\u2019s the middle of January and the Sydney Test finished just over a week ago, so the Australian public can look forward to *checks notes* a three-match ODI overseas tour? That can\u2019t be right, can it? But alas, in cricket\u2019s new world order that\u2019s how things roll, and the first of what Kurt Cobain might have called a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7B-AlKTdGQ\">radio friendly unit shifter</a> - for all it\u2019s shallow context - promises to be a belting contest between powerful sides. </p> <p>For Australia it is a chance to build on a prosperous summer, one in which the pall of Cape Town has been removed emphatically with five thumping Test victories. It is their first ODI since suffering defeat in the 2019 World Cup semi-final, and the first step on the road to the 2023 World Cup - in India. </p> <p>For the hosts it\u2019s also an opportunity to put World Cup disappointment behind them and chip away at England\u2019s lead on top of the ICC rankings. The formidable top three of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli love this match-up. Borrowing some numbers from ESPNCricinfo, since 2013, that trio have scored 58% of India\u2019s runs against Australia. While in the 21 matches they have played against Australia, 14 of them have featured a century from at least one those batsmen.</p> <p>Remember you can keep me company throughout the night via email: <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com</a> or Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">@JPHowcroft</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1737073e7aac9ed902cfdb0371b12646618f8678\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1737073e7aac9ed902cfdb0371b12646618f8678/0_0_3249_2321/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and Navdeep Saini in good spirits before the first ODI against Australia in Mumbai.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and Navdeep Saini in good spirits before the first ODI against Australia in Mumbai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-14T07:29:31.356Z\">at 7.29am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

We\u2019ll find out when the series continues at Rajkot on Friday. Talk to you then. Bye for now! Warner speaks. Turns out he was the player of the match, the gong he and Finch shared was for... something else? Who knows. \u201cThe champion!\u201d gushes Sanjay as he welcomes the opener to the mic. Warner reiterates the commentary of Finch about the fightback with the ball. Says with the bat, wanted to attack in the power play and were able to finish it clinically after that. He concludes by talking about his fitness as the major driver behind what he\u2019s been able to achieve this season. Aaron Finch and Dave Warner are the joint players of the match. The captain speaks to the post-match presentation. Thinks the way they fought back with the ball was the turning point after the Indian platform was laid. Says they could be a bit better in the field still but hard to criticise the performance. One game at a time, and all that. On Warner, says he\u2019s been unstoppable for some time now. Virat Kohli speaks. Totally outplayed in all three departments. It\u2019s a very strong Australian team who will hurt you if you aren\u2019t up to the mark. Didn\u2019t have enough intent with the bat; were too respectful of the bowlers. Australia capitalise. It\u2019s another challenge to bounce back from here but total credit to the visitors. The more game time in any format the better in terms of T20 World Cup preparation. Two more opportunities. Batted four because of how KL Rahul has been going but need to re-think it. Was worth a try having himself at four. \u201cPeople need to relax. I\u2019m allowed to experiment and try things from time to time.\u201d Before we hear from the captains in Mumbai, the news from South Africa isn\u2019t good for Jack Leach, the Somerset spinner returning home ill. Just on the partnership, that\u2019s the second biggest first-wicket stand for Australia in ODIs, only behind Warner and Head who put on 286 at Adelaide in 2017. WOW! Warner finishes the job with back to back boundaries. Extraordinary. 37.4 overs over: Australia 258-0 (Warner 128, Finch, 110) Target 256. 37th over: Australia 249-0 (Warner 120, Finch, 110) Target 256. \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d Hello there, Olly. \u201cI knew Labuschagne would struggle to cut the mustard at ODI level. He\u2019s contributed virtually nothing today.\u201d Very good. Have any other Australians picked up a Thanks For Coming on ODI debut? Can\u2019t be many. 36th over: Australia 244-0 (Warner 116, Finch, 109) Target 256. This is now the highest opening stand against India in an ODI, breaking their own record (238) set at Bangalore in 2017. They\u2019re four closer to knocking the target off ten down when Finch opens his bat to parry Shami through the cordon for yet another boundary. Warner keeps the strike, eight from the over with 12 more runs needed in 14 overs. 35th over: Australia 236-0 (Warner 115, Finch, 102) Target 256. He joins Warner with three figures, the ton from 108 deliveries. To think when Australia were in India just ten months ago he was on the cusp of losing his spot in the team. That\u2019s all well behind him now. The skipper gets to his ton with a tidy lap sweep for four. He may have been overtaken now but it was Finch who got this going early on. 34th over: Australia 229-0 (Warner 114, Finch 96) Target 256. It\u2019s already Australia\u2019s highest opening stand batting second, Harsha Bhogle tells me on the telly. Next stop: Finch\u2019s ton. He\u2019s back on strike after a quiet Kuldeep over. 33rd over: Australia 226-0 (Warner 113, Finch 94) Target 256. Bumrah is usually inoculated from harsh treatment due to how carefully teams play him... but not tonight. Warner is enjoying such an absurd hand, he is happy enough getting his front pad out of the line to twice hammer the world\u2019s best white-ball quick through cover for four. It doesn\u2019t get much better than that. DRINKS! 32nd over: Australia 215-0 (Warner 104, Finch 92) Target 256. Stand and DELIVER from Finch! Kuldeep gives him some air on middle stump so the captain clears his front pad to lift him straight over long-off for SIX! That was in response to the googly too, which has been a slight vulnerability for him tonight. Range hitting, they call it. Into the 90s he goes with a couple more, cut off the back foot. I should note that Warner has pulled level with ME Waugh as the second most prolific century-maker for Australia in ODIs, only Ricky Ponting ahead of them with 29. 31st over: Australia 205-0 (Warner 104, Finch 83) Target 256. It continues for Warner, starting the over with a century and finishing it with a magnificent off-drive, giving the fielder on the circle no chance. They need 51 runs in 19 overs. And what a shot to bring it up, cutting Bumrah expertly behind point for four. There\u2019s that familiar leap. What a brilliant hand. It also brings up the 200 stand. 30th over: Australia 197-0 (Warner 96, Finch 83) Target 256. Ohhhh! Warner is now batting without anything on his head. He\u2019s going to bring up an international ton without a helmet or a hat. What a wonderful development. He\u2019s four closer to that with a hammered cover drive, pinging Kuldeep to the rope in an instant. NOT OUT! Yep, there was a thick edge on the missed sweep. A ton surely awaits. 29th over: Australia 189-0 (Warner 90, Finch 81) Target 256. HAS JADEJA TRAPPED WARNER LBW? It is given out on the field but he reviews it straight away, punching gloves with Finch. He hit it. Stand by in any case. 28th over: Australia 187-0 (Warner 89, Finch 81) Target 256. Michael Slater could not be more excited about how this has all played out tonight. Good on him - I\u2019m probably a bit of a Slats apologist, in truth. He gets another moment to celebrate when Warner jumps across his stumps to glance Thakur away for four more. This reminds me of when this two knocked England over without losing a wicket at the MCG to start the ODI series against England in January 2014. \u201cAny word on Pant?\u201d asks Brandon Green on twitter. \u201cKnow he copped a concussion, was it the ricochet from his bat that he was out on?\u201d We haven\u2019t had anything further on the TV broadcast. And yes, I believe that\u2019s when he did it - that\u2019s certainly what they brought up on screen at the start of this chase when explaining why the Indian wicketkeeper is off the ground. 27th over: Australia 179-0 (Warner 83, Finch 80) Target 256. Jadeja does what he does best: racing through a 60-second over before they\u2019ve had a chance to really look up. In saying that, three singles come, Finch joining Warner in the 80s. 26th over: Australia 176-0 (Warner 82, Finch 79) Target 256. Thakur to Finch, and down the legside to begin. No good. He\u2019s back where he needs to be after that but with just over three an over needed, they are comfortable with that approach. \u201cHi Adam, Hope you\u2019re well.\u201d And you, Ruth Purdue! \u201cIt may be a tired topic but can I call for Maxwell to be in the team again? That genius needs to be on the platform he deserves.\u201d No complaints from these quarters. However, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s been left at home to dominate the BBL. That\u2019ll live longer in the memory than this series. He can then return for the New Zealand matches in March before the IPL. Something like that? 25th over: Australia 172-0 (Warner 81, Finch 77) Target 256. Warner gets into the 80s first, albeit off another edge. He went hard at Jadeja, who did him in flight, saved only by the inside feather of his blade. Sure enough, given the way these two have gone tonight, it evades Rahul\u2019s gloves and runs away for four. The crowd are chanting for Kohli? Or is it Dhoni? Probably the latter, come to think of it. 24th over: Australia 166-0 (Warner 76, Finch 76) Target 256. Australia are on track to get this inside 40 overs - what a performance. Ten more added here, Finch joining Warner in the 70s lashing Shami through point, then drawing level on 76 off the outside edge. It doesn\u2019t matter from here, they\u2019re toying with the hosts. 23rd over: Australia 156-0 (Warner 76, Finch 66) Target 256. Kuldeep now bowling his seventh over, worked through the legside early in the over - the 150 partnership coming along the way, the fourth time this pair have achieved that - before Warner decides to go BANG over long on for SIX! The third time he\u2019s cleared that boundary through the course of this fantastic innings. 100 runs to go. \u201cThis has been a magnificent effort by our Australian friends against a very good Indian side,\u201d observes Martin Fairhurst. \u201cI look forward to the rest of the series - can India fight back? It\u2019s food for thought too for the upcoming T20 World Cup this year in Australia.\u201d That\u2019s where all roads lead for this Australian white-ball team after this series. They have never won (or hosted) the T20 World Cup before, of course. 22nd over: Australia 146-0 (Warner 69, Finch 63) Target 256. Despite the fact that we\u2019re only 21 overs into this chase, India are just about up to their last chance with Shami now back into the attack. Mindful of this, I\u2019m sure, there are no risks here. Finch did get a chance to cut and did so well but Jadeja was at backward point with the flying stop, pulling the ball down without a bother. What a gem he is. 21st over: Australia 143-0 (Warner 67, Finch 62) Target 256. Kuldeep beats Finch again with that googly, the bails taken by KL Rahul. It\u2019s sent upstairs to check for the stumping his foot never leaves the ground. A couple of singles are Australia\u2019s lot until the final ball, which spins down the legside. Kuldeep, re-bowling that delivery, is insistent that he has Finch lbw to finish but it\u2019s turned down. Kohli, upon realising that he already torched his review, gets in the umpire\u2019s face. In my experience, umpires don\u2019t tend to change their minds after they\u2019ve said not out. \u201cThis opening stand has been antithetical to the Indian approach when it comes to constructing an ODI innings,\u201d writes Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cThe openers are willing to take risks and not rely on solely running between the wickets during the early stages of the game. England have proved that you can be successful with this approach, especially by taking out the fine margins which come with lower scores produced as a result of caution. Hopefully the home side\u2019s management decides to put enough faith in the entire line-up to back the top three to unleash their full potential for aggression henceforth, because their current approach seems more outdated with every passing day.\u201d 20th over: Australia 140-0 (Warner 66, Finch 61) Target 256. So, India have burned their review now too. Before the appeal, Warner was given another half-tracker by the usually-accurate tweaker, once again carving it for four. Cruise control. NOT OUT! He smashed it. HAS JADEJA TRAPPED FINCH LBW? Michael Gough doesn\u2019t think so but Kohli has sent it to the TV umpire and technology to decide once and for all. Stand by. 19th over: Australia 133-0 (Warner 61, Finch 60) Target 256. Some good news here: Warner has called for his canary yellow cap. When I\u2019m king, the Baggy Gold will return to the kit for Australian ODI players - one day. But small steps. The next is the gold helmet, which they haven\u2019t used for about 15 years. None of this is probably of interest to Finch, the captain well on top of Kuldeep\u2019s top spinner to start the new over, crunching it past point for his ninth four. The required rate is under four an over now, with both openers wonderfully placed to reach tons. 18th over: Australia 125-0 (Warner 58, Finch 55) Target 256. Jadeja has Finch in a bit of bother early in the over, finding his leading edge when trying to tuck him into the legside. But just when the experienced spinner seems to have found a groove, he gives a half-tracker to Warner, slapped away for four past cover. Easy. 17th over: Australia 118-0 (Warner 54, Finch 52) Target 256. India are going to have to bowl Australia out, that much is clear. Kohli looks relatively calm at drinks, avoiding the temptation to give his charges a spray. Kuldeep has been the man most likely so far, at Finch at least, so they are happy enough taking the singles on offer rather than attacking the boundary. There really is no rush whatsoever. 16th over: Australia 115-0 (Warner 53, Finch 50) Target 256. With one to cover off Bumrah, the Australian captain raises his bat from his 52nd ball - the 39th time he\u2019s made at least 50 in an ODI. It\u2019s another good set from Bumrah but he is already through half of his overs with 31 taken from them. DRINKS are called with Australia needing just 141 further runs at 4.2 per over from here. Top batting. 15th over: Australia 110-0 (Warner 50, Finch 49) Target 256. For real this time, Warner is the man who gets to raise his bat for the first half-century of the innings with a single down the ground off Kuldeep. He reaches the mark in 40 deliveries, the 38th time he\u2019s gone beyond 50 in ODIs. The wrong\u2019un has Finch in a bit of strife for a second time, beating his edge when attempting to cut. In turn, the captain elects to defend the rest of the over. The best set of India\u2019s defence. 14th over: Australia 109-0 (Warner 49, Finch 49) Target 256. Anything Finch can do, is it? Warner starts this new over - Bumrah back into the attack - with another imposing pull shot, giving the sweeper no chance to cut it off. Bumrah is too classy for that to bother him that much, beating the outside edge with one that goes a long way with the angle. Later, in at Finch, he bowls a very similar delivery and cuts the right-hander in half. It\u2019s such a good delivery that after pitching off and clearing leg, it beats the \u2018keeper\u2019s gloves, running away for four byes. Ouch. 13th over: Australia 100-0 (Warner 44, Finch 49) Target 256. It\u2019s a bit unclear, some scoreboards online/at the ground putting Finch beyond the milestone, others leaving him one short. He certainly raised the bat when smashing Kuldeep right back over his head for SIX early in the over, also bringing up the Australian 100. Anyway, whether or not the personal milestone has been reached (I suspect it hasn\u2019t), this has been a wonderful partnership, going at 7.7 runs an over. 12th over: Australia 94-0 (Warner 44, Finch 43) Target 256. Jadeja joins Kuldeep at the bowling crease and Warner makes an immediate statement, flat-batting the orthodox tweaker over midwicket for SIX MORE! The required rate is now 4.3. 11th over: Australia 87-0 (Warner 38, Finch 43) Target 256. They nearly get one first ball after the field is spread, Kuldeep winning Finch\u2019s top edge via a misread googly. He\u2019s very lucky that didn\u2019t go to hand. As is the custom in the over after the power play, they play the rest conservatively after that near mishap. Of course, the left-arm wristspinner has been extremely effective against Australia. 10th over: Australia 84-0 (Warner 37, Finch 41) Target 256. What a power play for this pair, sticking the landing with 13 further runs before the field goes out. Warner pulled Thakur twice in identical fashion, prompting a ropey bouncer, called a wide. They\u2019re running wonderfully, too. India need something... right now. 9th over: Australia 71-0 (Warner 26, Finch 40) Target 256. Ten more runs are piled on here, Finch striking another picture-perfect cover drive to begin Shami\u2019s new spell, spun around to follow Bumrah. He then overcorrects with an offering that\u2019s too short, slapped away for four more by the skipper. India are in a fair bit of strife. 8th over: Australia 61-0 (Warner 25, Finch 31) Target 256. BIIIIIG from Warner! Thakur was excellent the first time around but the opener has his measure now, popping him way back into the crowd at midwicket for Australia\u2019s first SIX of their chase. Earlier in the over, with his eye well and truly in now, he picked up the seamer over mid-on for four then heaved him over square leg for another. 15 off it. The required rate for the Australians from here is already just 4.64 an over. 7th over: Australia 46-0 (Warner 11, Finch 31) Target 256. Warner moves to 5000 ODI runs with his best shot of the innings so far, a punishing pull through square leg off Bumrah. The TV tells us that he has reached the mark (in 115 innings) faster than every batsman with the exception of Amla (101), Richards and Kohli (both 114). He celebrates with another four, through point this time. Here we go. There\u2019s some further commentary chat about Marnus\u2019 name, the message through to the box about the Labu-shane preference. That\u2019s accurate to an extent. I was there when this first came up when he joined the team in 2018 in the UAE. He was clear then that the Australianised version was fine with him because it was easier but he was equally happy with the accurate pronunciation being used. 6th over: Australia 36-0 (Warner 6, Finch 27) Target 256. Earlier in the over, Warner was also fortunate to survive a leg before shout from the new bowler Thakur, beaten on the inside edge from a delivery that really hooped in at him from around the wicket. Despite hitting his back pad, it was given out on the field. The technology showed that it would have been umpire\u2019s call had it been reviewed. A eventful and frugal start from the first-change seamer. NOT OUT! Warner is correct, he didn\u2019t hit it. The decision is overturned by the TV umpire. India were absolutely convinced in their appeal but it is not to be. WARNER REVIEWS! He\u2019s been given out caught behind hooking down the legside off Thakur. Upstairs we go. Can he get it overturned? Stand by. 5th over: Australia 33-0 (Warner 5, Finch 25) Target 256. Four more! Of Finch\u2019s five boundaries, four of them have been through point, this another square drive from the very middle of his bat. Warner, by contrast, is being kept quiet by Shami. He\u2019s helped by a misfield at midwicket from the final ball, three taken from a compact push. The TV commentators are having the usual debate about Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s name, Murali Karthik making the very reasonable point that it is a South African/Afrikaans name and deserves to be pronounced accordingly. 4th over: Australia 25-0 (Warner 2, Finch 21) Target 256. Finch is flying here, 11 taken from this Bumrah over. He timed the pants off his first boundary, skipping through cover with no backswing required; only a forward push. The second is an even better stroke, off the back foot through point. Exceptional batting. \u201cNothing gives me a greater satisfaction than V Kohli facing the mic after a loss,\u201d says Krishnamoorthy. That\u2019s quite punchy! An interesting read last weekend about the Indian skipper and the high-regard he\u2019s held in off the field. 3rd over: Australia 14-0 (Warner 2, Finch 11) Target 256. Shot! Finch gets forward to Shami early in his fresh over, crashing him through the covers for a second boundary, quickly into double figures. Later in the set, Warner nearly does the same but Pandey, on the field at cover as Pant\u2019s substitute, makes a well-timed diving stop. Shami beats the left-hander with a beauty to finish, angling in from around the wicket before straightening off the seam. That\u2019s where he\u2019s so good. 2nd over: Australia 8-0 (Warner 1, Finch 6) Target 256. Bumrah to Warner, who leaves carefully to begin before getting off strike with a delivery that smashes into his thigh pad. Finch\u2019s turn to take on his old nemesis and he pushes him with lovely timing through point for a couple. Given how frequently Bumrah has crashed into his stumps over the last 18 months, that\u2019ll help with his confidence. \u201cHiya Adam.\u201d Emails Peter Gibbs, watching with his mum - loyal OBOers! \u201cHappy New Year to you and all.\u201d Great to have you with us. You can also drop me a line. 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 1, Finch 4) Warner is off the mark down to third man, Shami finding the outside slither of his bat second ball. Finch is moving first up himself, throwing his hands at a wide half volley and placing it safely enough through the gap at point for four. There\u2019s an update on the commentary explaining why KL Rahul has the gloves for India: Rishabh Pant is off the field after copping a whack to the head during his innings of 28 earlier. He hasn\u2019t yet been subbed out. The players are back on the field in Mumbai! To begin, Warner and Finch against Bumrah and Shami, the latter taking the first over. It doesn\u2019t come much tastier than that in one-day international cricket. The visitors\u2019 target is 256. PLAY! Something of mine to plug, too. For those of you who followed the 1999 World Cup podcast last year, we\u2019re back on The Greatest Season That Was with another walk down memory lane, this time documenting the famous 1994-95 Australia \u2018A\u2019 series. Yes, that was the summer where administrators brought a fourth team into the traditional ODI series because they didn\u2019t trust England or Zimbabwe to put up much of a fight for Mark Taylor\u2019s men. It turned out to be an inspired decision. Some reading during the break. Check out our weekly Spin column, Ali Martin talking to England\u2019s champions from the Under 19 World Cup of 1998. Thanks, JP. Our man put in a huge tennis shift today before taking care of the first innings. Well played. Australia did that nicely, denying India the chance to explode the old fashioned way with consistent wickets in the middle overs. You find me watching Star\u2019s coverage in London, where Michael Slater is currently learning Hindi. Just another day in 2020. Good afternoon/evening to you all. Australia will be the happier of the two sides at the changeover. They never allowed India to get away from them, took wickets at regular intervals after that long second-wicket partnership, and they will be confident of chasing down 255 with the fast outfield at the Wankhede Stadium, especially if the dew settles and makes bowling awkward. The three pacemen all bowled superbly, each deserving their multiple-wicket hauls, while the two spinners kept India in check when their innings was meandering. Not a great day at the office for India\u2019s much vaunted batsmen. Rohit and Kohli both fell cheaply while Dhawan was one of a number of Indians to give their wicket away needlessly. Find out if Australia can chase down 256 with the incomparable Adam Collins. Shami tries to smash Richardson into the sea but can only skew a top-edge high into the air that Carey does very well indeed to circle around and pouch. That\u2019s your lot. Lovely from Kuldeep, giving himself room and drilling Starc through the covers for four, the bowler then overreaches with his reply and flings a wide well down the leg-side. Four more for Kuldeep! Stand and deliver this time, walloping Starc back over his head. The crowd is back into this and India, creeping over 250, have something to defend. They might not get much more than 250 though because Kuldeep has run himself out, chancing Steve Smith\u2019s arm with a suicidal single and coming a cropper. Smith threw down the stumps from the ring behind point with plenty of time to pick his target. I was only thinking the other day how few direct run outs we see, considering the increase in fielding drills. 49th over: India 255-9 (Shami 10) 48th over: India 243-8 (Shami 9, Kuldeep 7) Richardson returns in the final bowling change of the innings, and he sends down a beauty. Slower balls, line and length, bumpers, the full shebang, and India can only muster three singles. 47th over: India 240-8 (Shami 8, Kuldeep 5) Starc, like Cummins before him, is not a bowler these batsmen are capable of dispatching with ease. Five deliveries go for very little but spirits are lifted in the crowd when an attempted yorker becomes a full toss and Shami gets enough bat on it to pierce the covers for four. Slightly off topic, but very interesting nonetheless. 46th over: India 233-8 (Shami 3, Kuldeep 3) India\u2019s tail does its best to keep the runs flowing but Pat Cummins is too good to take on. Three singles off the over leaves Cummins with figures of 2/44 from his ten. Another outstanding performance from the star paceman. Ian Forth, a key contributor to the hive mind, has come good for Martin Fairhurst. \u201cGeorge Lohmann has the best Test strike-rate amongst all bowlers from any country at 34.2 which is a clear 3.6 off second place (qualification: 2,000 balls). Amongst English test bowlers this century it\u2019s Simon Jones at 47.8, while amongst players still active Steve Finn has a 51.2 SR (but hasn\u2019t played since 2016) while Jimmy Anderson\u2019s is 56.1.\u201d And Pete Naylor has done the ODI maths for goo dmeasure. 45th over: India 230-8 (Shami 1, Kuldeep 1) This has been an impressive performance from Australia in the field. Starc, the ODI wizard, now has 3/37. Shardul gets a life. He mistimes a very full toss from Starc that looks to be heading to Richardson at long-on but the fielder is slow to move off the fence and drops what becomes a difficult diving effort. Then it\u2019s Shami\u2019s turn to deny Starc another scalp! The on-field decision is out when Starc appeals for LBW after hitting the batsman\u2019s toes but India review and ball tracking indicates leg stump was not in the missile\u2019s flightpath. Finally, finally Starc has his pole. And that\u2019s the way to do it, remove any chance of a fielder dropping a catch or an LBW appeal not being upheld by making the mess of the stumps with a searing yorker. Sublime pace bowling at the death. 44th over: India 227-7 (Shardul 12, Shami 1) Excellent bouncer from Cummins there on his recall into the attack, too quick for Pant who, I presume, the umpire was expecting to walk. Australia into the bowlers now, but they\u2019re swinging and swinging hard! Consecutive boundaries for Shardul, the first not timed purely over extra cover, the second pulled with the angle down to fine-leg. Scenes! No clear idea what went on there but Pant is quite rightly out, caught at square leg after top-edging a swipe onto his helmet. There was a long delay, and the umpire initially didn\u2019t raise his finger, but then Pant tried to pinch the cheekiest of singles, which ultimately prompted his downfall. 43rd over: India 216-6 (Pant 28, Shardul 2) Excellent over from Kane Richardson, nipping India\u2019s resurgence in the bud and keeping the pressure on with uncomplicated fast bowling. He almost had two wickets for the over but Shardul Thakur\u2019s horribly mistimed pull lands short of mid-on. An email for the hive mind - any ideas? \u201cThe broadcaster showed an interesting stat on strike rates with Mitchell Starc atop the list, emails Martin Fairhurst. \u201cDoes anyone know who England\u2019s top bowler would be for strike rate either active or retired? I\u2019m presuming Sir Jimmy of Lancashire.\u201d Momentum shift followed by momentum shift. Jadeja tries to get too cute with a Richardson delivery just short of a length and instead of middling a ramp he just glances an edge into Carey\u2019s gloves. 42nd over: India 213-5 (Pant 27, Jadeja 25) Rishabh Pant\u2019s just changed his blade - is he doing an MS Dhoni late-inning switcheroo to his biffing bat? YES HE IS! A mighty heave over midwicket after stepping down the pitch sails for six and the crowd is on its feet. Agar is a little rattled and he\u2019s lucky consecutive full tosses don\u2019t go for runs. Instead it\u2019s a decent-enough looking length delivery that Pant drills into the narrowest channel and away to the long-on boundary. India are on the move. 41st over: India 200-5 (Pant 16, Jadeja 24) Aaron Finch is now into his death over combinations and his go-to is Richardson, who still has four overs up his sleeve. Line and length is the uncomplicated strategy to begin with, the right-arm paceman angling the ball across the left-handed batsmen for four singles and a wide, inching India to 200. 40th over: India 195-5 (Pant 14, Jadeja 22) Better from India, runs from five of the six deliveries, including a long overdue boundary cut behind point for four by Jadeja. Could that be the signal for a rise in tempo? 39th over: India 186-5 (Pant 12, Jadeja 15) Nine dot-balls in a row for Australia and the run is only interrupted by a single with Pant flicking the returning Cummins down to fine-leg. Five deliveries into the over and Jadeja tries to go over the in-field but he can\u2019t find any timing. From ball six a sprinted two feels like many more, so constipated have India been in recent overs. There\u2019s energy around the ground when Jadeja returns for his second but Richardson\u2019s direct hit from the boundary is fractionally too late for the speedy allrounder. 38th over: India 183-5 (Pant 11, Jadeja 13) Beautiful from Agar, racing through a maiden over to Jadeja with the batsman unable to work anything away to the leg-side with the bowler targeting his hips. Jadeja gets into an awkward tucked position when he tries to leg-glance that limits his scoring areas, all of which Australia have covered. 37th over: India 183-5 (Pant 11, Jadeja 13) Starc is in good areas for three balls but his fourth is begging to be cut, and Jadeja is not one to decline an invitation like that, and he finds the point boundary. the bowler finishes off the over well though and Australia will feel very pleased with their work so far. 36th over: India 177-5 (Pant 10, Jadeja 8) Agar\u2019s back to bowl his left-arm spin from around the wicket to a pair of left-handers. Pant, as is customary, is eager to get at the Australian but his forceful strokes lack timing and attempts at strike rotation unerringly find fielders. When he does rotate the strike Jadeja plants his front foot down and swings his arms like a pre-industrial farmer might a scythe and sends a full delivery high over midwicket for a much needed six. 35th over: India 169-5 (Pant 9, Jadeja 2) Jadeja is allowing himself time to bed in, seeing off three dots before pushing a single into the covers. Pant then almost makes a mess of his time on strike, nearly succumbing LBW Starc two balls in a row but the first ends up a narrow wide, the second saved by an inside-edge. 34th over: India 166-5 (Pant 8, Jadeja 1) Zampa rattles through his final over to end with figures of 1-53. That one being the most important wicket of Kohli, so he can consider it a good day at the office. 33rd over: India 164-5 (Pant 5, Jadeja 0) India have dug themselves a big old hole, and they need a T20 partnership to get them out of it. Starc returns for his penultimate burst of the innings and he strikes in quick-time. An over largely of length also includes one sharp lifter towards Sheryas\u2019s ribs which means later on when the ball is angled across him he\u2019s flat footed with his drive and can only feather an edge behind. India are going backwards. 32nd over: India 161-4 (Shreyas 3, Pant 5) Pant might have only just walked out into the middle but he\u2019s not going to turn down the opportunity to drive an overpitched delivery to the boundary. 11 runs and a huge wicket from Zampa\u2019s over. What a one-two punch from Adam Zampa! First a long-hop that Kohli larrups mercilessly for six, then the leg-spinner holds onto a very sharp return catch after the Indian skipper tried to force the issue in the V. Australia are wresting control of this contest. 31st over: India 150-3 (Kohli 10, Shreyas 3) Three runs from a typically high quality Pat Cummins over featuring a couple of slippery bouncers and the continued execution of a plan to Kohli to keep the ball wide outside his off stump, inviting him to chase with his hands away from his body. 30th over: India 147-3 (Kohli 9, Shreyas 2) Zampa gets another whirl with two new batsmen at the crease but they\u2019re unruffled. Four singles and a two keeps the scoreboard moving. 29th over: India 141-3 (Kohli 5, Shreyas 0) Couple of quick wickets to Australia after a long spell of controlled disciplined bowling and now India are in a spot of bother if they want to post an intimidating score. Kohli\u2019s arrival to the crease is met with the immediate return to the attack of king-slayer Pat Cummins. The Australian paceman had a good record against Kohli last time India were in Australia and he almost gets his man with a wide tempter that Kohli chases. He eventually gets off strike and Cummins gets the other guy! Dhawan finding a leading edge to a length delivery and Agar making the ground from mid-off to pouch the catch. 28th over: India 137-2 (Dhawan 73, Kohli 2) Excellent reward for Agar for a controlled spell of spin bowling. This match has had more than touch of the old fashioned middle-overs about it in the past hour or so, maybe Kohli will now light the blue touchpaper and wow us? Out of nowhere India are two down. Instead of doing his usual strike rotation to the spinners KL Rahul tries to go a touch bigger, but he picks the wrong ball and ends up squeezing a drive straight so Smith at cover. Very soft and unexpected dismissal. The crowd could not care less: enter King Kohli. 27th over: India 134-1 (Dhawan 73, KL Rahul 47) The long passage of spin from both ends is interrupted by Richardson\u2019s return. Australia will be hoping for some reverse swing. Doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s any on offer. Five singles taken with little ceremony. 26th over: India 129-1 (Dhawan 71, KL Rahul 44) Dhawan\u2019s opened his shoulders a few times today but he hasn\u2019t middled many of them. Another attempted big hit skews off a closed face and out to midwicket. Zampa does well bowling to both batsmen, KL Rahul in particular, and after a couple of dots has an appeal for caught behind dismissed by the third umpire for being a bump ball. Abhijato Sensarma has joined in by email. \u201cKohli is the greatest ODI No3 of all time, but there is one column too empty for someone of his reputation - the one for the great innings played after entering well past midway through the innings. He\u2019s in epic T20 form though, and has the chance to add to his legendary CV with an aggressive masterclass from his willow today...\u201d. The prospect is a frightening one for Australia, that is for sure. 25th over: India 126-1 (Dhawan 70, KL Rahul 42) There we go, shackles broken, and in some style, Dhawan using his feet and lofting Agar over the vacant long-off for the first six of the day. Nine from the over. 24th over: India 117-1 (Dhawan 63, KL Rahul 39) The intent from India ramps up a notch against Zampa but the big hit continues to elude them. Another boundary-less over, but one that includes the 100-partnership for India\u2019s second wicket. 23rd over: India 111-1 (Dhawan 61, KL Rahul 36) Australia are bowling smartly to well-set fields at the moment, keeping India to singles. Dhawan is trying to create space and angles but he\u2019s unable to get anything away. This match is evenly poised as we approach the quarter mark. 22nd over: India 109-1 (Dhawan 60, KL Rahul 35) Four jogged singles from this over. Tighter line from Zampa, bowling smartly to Dhawan in particular, keeping him honest while he tries to manipulate strokes. 21st over: India 105-1 (Dhawan 58, KL Rahul 33) DROP! Very sharp chance at midwicket after Dhawan leathered a swipe off Agar but Warner couldn\u2019t hold on with two hands diving low to his right. India jog singles from all the other deliveries. 20th over: India 100-1 (Dhawan 55, KL Rahul 31) Fifty up for Australian-specialist Shikhar Dhawan, followed by the hundred up for India. Zampa\u2019s unthreatening over is worked around the ground, most pleasingly for the home crowd with a wristy flick against the spin over the leg-side in-field. 19th over: India 93-1 (Dhawan 49, KL Rahul 30) Dhawan threatens to work Agar over after carving a near-four two first ball but the bowler responds cannily, first tying him up them tempting him to unleash. He always comes across a smart thoughtful man Agar, and I think I project that into his cricket. 18th over: India 90-1 (Dhawan 46, KL Rahul 30) Spin from both ends with Zampa recalled, but he offers width to KL Rahul who will be disappointed to earn a two and a one from meaty off-side strokes. Dhawan also misses out when a sweep goes straight to the man at short fine-leg. 17th over: India 86-1 (Dhawan 45, KL Rahul 27) Spin variety No.2 for Australia with Ashton Agar\u2019s left-arm orthodox brought into the attack. The graceful Melbourne-born West Australian starts nicely with three dots but his figures are quickly dirtied by Dhawan manipulating a very fine sweep then nudging into a gap wide enough to run two. 16th over: India 80-1 (Dhawan 39, KL Rahul 27) If you beat the ring it\u2019s four on this ground, the outfield is like a golf ball on a runway. KL Rahul gets another boundary when Richardson slides into his pads, while some neat right-hand/left-hand strike rotation keeps India\u2019s momentum building. 15th over: India 72-1 (Dhawan 37, KL Rahul 21) KL Rahul is dealing in fours now, beating the field behind square on the off-side with a streaky drive after Zampa offered him some width. The bowler recovered well but escapes when his first long-hop isn\u2019t put away by Dhawan. 14th over: India 66-1 (Dhawan 37, KL Rahul 16) The outfield in Mumbai is rapid. KL Rahul collects four with a back-foot push that\u2019s drilled into the pitch, bounces over point, and skips away to the boundary. Not Richardson\u2019s finest over but his subtle variations are proving difficult to get away. Despite India upping the scoring rate there\u2019s still a sense they haven\u2019t figured out the pitch quite yet. 13th over: India 59-1 (Dhawan 36, KL Rahul 11) What can Adam Zampa find in this surface? It\u2019s hard to tell from the off because the leg-spinner bowls full with plenty of flight. Four singles, two dots, handy start. 12th over: India 55-1 (Dhawan 35, KL Rahul 9) Cummins continues, and not for the first time today, tests Dhawan\u2019s outside edge. This one was a yard quicker and shorter than standard, beating the horizontal blade for pace. Not for the first time today Dhawan responds in boundaries, ramping fine for four then guiding a back cut that beats gully and races away to the fence. Time for spin. 11th over: India 47-1 (Dhawan 26, KL Rahul 9) Better from Richardson, hitting good areas with his right-arm fast-medium from over the wicket. He\u2019s landed his yorker well on a couple of occasions, which bodes well for the death overs. 10th over: India 45-1 (Dhawan 25, KL Rahul 8) After that solitary swing-searching over Starc makes way for Cummins to return, but the Australian quick is bowling to a different Dhawan to the one he last challenged a few overs ago. Just the hint of a half-volley is timed effortlessly through extra-cover by India\u2019s moustachioed maestro for four keeping India moving. The powerplay ends pretty evenly after Australia\u2019s excellent start. 9th over: India 38-1 (Dhawan 20, KL Rahul 6) Dhawan started slowly but he\u2019s got the bit between his teeth now, slapping Richardson well in front of midwicket after the bowler dropped toothlessly short. Four more arrive soon after when Richardson again lands on the wrong length and Dhawan helps him round the corner to the fine-leg fence. 8th over: India 30-1 (Dhawan 12, KL Rahul 6) Very smart captaincy from Finch. Richardson\u2019s over was in part to allow Starc to replace Cummins and have a go with the new ball that looks like it might be swinging (there\u2019s two in operation these days, remember). And it almost works immediately when a beautiful full delivery tails away from the left-handed Dhawan, just missing the edge of the bat, and the edge of off stump. Dhawan counterpunches, hitting fours from consecutive balls, first straight down the ground then through midwicket, the latter a fingertip wide of the diving fielder. Australia are on top here, India have yet to settle into the pace of the pitch. 7th over: India 21-1 (Dhawan 3, KL Rahul 6) Kane Richardson gets an early burst with the new ball and he finds decent areas in an over that goes for just a couple of singles. Hi Alex Greggery, thanks for the email. \u201cWith the ongoing talk of whether Root and du Plessis can hack the captaincy, I think we should all appreciate the unstoppable leadership machine that Kohli is. I love his hunger for it all. I wish he was captain of my life.\u201d I would also like a life captain, but I think I\u2019d benefit more from the Mike Brearley arm-round-the-shoulder type more than the bombast of Kohli. Heck of a cricketer though, in all formats. Just loves it, doesn\u2019t he? Imagine the pressure he\u2019s under every single day, and there he is, just keeping on loving it game after game. 6th over: India 19-1 (Dhawan 2, KL Rahul 5) Cummins\u2019s third over almost begins like his second, suckering Dhawan into a soft dismissal. This time a short ball invites the ramp and it carries a long way down to third-man where Zampa gets within inches of taking a difficult chance but the young David Beckham lookalike can only stop the four on the half-volley. A couple of balls later Australia REVIEW! Cummins beats Dhawan\u2019s inside-edge and strikes his front pad with the batsman looking to play to the on-side, but the appeal is declined on the ground - and DRS confirms why - with the ball being shown to pitch outside leg stump. Australia\u2019s solitary review is wasted. 5th over: India 17-1 (Dhawan 1, KL Rahul 4) KL Rahul, not Kohli, strides out at No3 and he accepts a couple of dot-balls before benefiting from Starc leaking onto his pads and glancing for four. Huge early breakthrough for Australia! After that entertaining early over India have struggled to get bat on ball and that\u2019s resulted in Rohit going hard at a cross-seam delivery that confused his timing. It ends with a drive that only just carries to Warner at mid-off. 4th over: India 13-0 (Rohit 10, Dhawan 1) Depending which way you look at it Cummins either a) got away with a wide half-volley or b) almost lured Dhawan into edging behind with the sucker ball. The outcome was an airy whoosh from the batsman and a dot in the scorebook. Three more dots follow as Cummins settles into a fourth stump line just back of a length. Another dot arrives courtesy of a bouncer than Dhawan didn\u2019t feel inclined to go near, before all those dots are joined in a lovely M to complete the maiden. He is a captain\u2019s dream, Pat Cummins. 3rd over: India 13-0 (Rohit 10, Dhawan 1) Better from Starc, still no lateral movement with the white ball he\u2019s using, but the line and length gives India nothing to launch at. 2nd over: India 11-0 (Rohit 9, Dhawan 1) Nothing moved in the air or off the seam for Starc but Pat Cummins has the ball whispering, if not yet talking. He finds some movement in the air to Dhawan, arcing the ball into the left-hander from over the wicket, then after the strike is rotated he whistles one past Rohit\u2019s outside-edge in a manner familiar to sides all around the world in the past couple of years. 1st over: India 8-0 (Rohit 8, Dhawan 0) How\u2019s that for a first ball? Width from Starc first up angling across the right-hander and Rohit just creams it through the covers like he was shadow batting in his slippers. He\u2019s lucky to escape a couple of balls later though when some suicidal running leaves him miles out of his ground after Dhawan correctly declines a single with Warner prowling. Recognising it\u2019s better not to run if he doesn\u2019t have to, Rohit thumps another cover drive to the boundary. A very entertaining start. Mitchell Starc has the new white ball in his hand. Two slips stand behind Rohit Sharma - here we go! \u201cRun-machine (tick), livewire (tick), phenomenal (tick). Ease up with the epithets there, JP. This isn\u2019t a T20. Pace yourself. Get your thesaurus in, or you\u2019ll find yourself referring to \u201cthe above average Kohli\u201d by over 35 , and \u201ccricketer Steve Smith\u201d by the second innings.\u201d Thanks \u2018dreadful first email of the night\u2019 Rowan Sweeney. Did I do that right? The pitch looks flat and full of runs, but it has a bit of grass on it, which will give Australia\u2019s quicks some hope. It\u2019s anthem time in the middle of the Wankhede. Cricket is imminent. The hosts have gone with KL Rahul at No3, meaning the mighty Virat is scheduled down at four, for the time being anyway. It\u2019s a line-up bristling with attacking intent, including the livewire Pant behind the stumps, the phenomenal Bumrah with the new ball, and plenty of variety in between. India 1 Shikhar Dhawan, 2 Rohit Sharma, 3 KL Rahul, 4 Virat Kohli (c), 5 Shreyas Iyer, 6 Rishabh Pant (wk), 7 Ravindra Jadeja, 8 Shardul Thakur, 9 Kuldeep Yadav, 10 Mohammed Shami, 11 Jasprit Bumrah The headline news for the visitors is the inclusion of Test run-machine Marnus Labuschagne who becomes the 229th man to represent Australia in one-day internationals. The adopted Queenslander received his cap from Steve Waugh a short while ago. Otherwise, two spinners in the same line-up is always notable for an Australian XI while Kane Richardson has been preferred to Josh Hazlewood among the pacemen. Australia 1 David Warner, 2 Aaron Finch (c), 3 Steven Smith, 4 Marnus Labuschagne, 5 Ashton Turner, 6 Alex Carey (wk), 7 Ashton Agar, 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Kane Richardson, 11 Adam Zampa The weather in Mumbai is warm (28C) partly cloudy, with a northerly breeze coming through. Rain is not out of the question, but very unlikely indeed according to the forecast. \u201cLooks like a good wicket, and hopefully we\u2019ll chase well,\u201d says chipper skipper Aaron Finch. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the first ODI between India and Australia in Mumbai. The action gets underway at the Wankhede Stadium at 7pm AEST. It\u2019s the middle of January and the Sydney Test finished just over a week ago, so the Australian public can look forward to *checks notes* a three-match ODI overseas tour? That can\u2019t be right, can it? But alas, in cricket\u2019s new world order that\u2019s how things roll, and the first of what Kurt Cobain might have called a radio friendly unit shifter - for all it\u2019s shallow context - promises to be a belting contest between powerful sides. For Australia it is a chance to build on a prosperous summer, one in which the pall of Cape Town has been removed emphatically with five thumping Test victories. It is their first ODI since suffering defeat in the 2019 World Cup semi-final, and the first step on the road to the 2023 World Cup - in India. For the hosts it\u2019s also an opportunity to put World Cup disappointment behind them and chip away at England\u2019s lead on top of the ICC rankings. The formidable top three of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli love this match-up. Borrowing some numbers from ESPNCricinfo, since 2013, that trio have scored 58% of India\u2019s runs against Australia. While in the 21 matches they have played against Australia, 14 of them have featured a century from at least one those batsmen.

Historians and others have repeatedly warned that conversations surrounding the war of independence and the civil war in particular will untangle narratives that we have yet to face ourselves.</p> <p>The complexities of commemorating, well, complexities, was exposed last week when the Irish government defended, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51026428\" title=\"\">then deferred</a>, a commemoration of pre-independence police forces, the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Dublin Metropolitan police (DMP). The makeup of the RIC was bolstered by British recruits, particularly the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Black-and-Tan\" title=\"\">Black and Tans</a>, known for their brutality, and <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/black_and_tans_and_auxiliaries\" title=\"\">the Auxiliaries</a>, a paramilitary unit made up of former British army officers. To say these entities are much maligned in Ireland would be putting it mildly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve had four years of dealing with ignorance and disregard towards Ireland, as English nationalism triumphed in the form of Brexit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All of this is occurring in a shifting environment of Irish nationalism and patriotism, tied to the decade of centenaries itself, a parallel social revolution in women\u2019s and LGBTQ+ rights, the invisible but real border dividing the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland becoming central to European politics, and how Brexit has energised the prospect of a united Ireland.</p> <p>This period of centenaries is discussed in broad, tonal terms: it\u2019s complicated and dark. Participation in their commemoration comes with appeals for maturity, tolerance, respect and inclusion. But we\u2019ve talked less about the actual details of that past. In 2016, the reframing of the events of the Easter Rising as the aspirations of an egalitarian society, including a reinvigorated feminist subtext, may have offered something of a false epiphany. </p> <p>As various politicians spoke out against the RIC/DMP commemoration and some indicated they would boycott such events, the government scrambled to clarify. Its defence was that people were missing a nuanced point. \u201cThe RIC/DMP commemoration is not a celebration,\u201d the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeoVaradkar/status/1214497243685965824\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> before the event was called off. \u201cIt\u2019s about remembering our history, not condoning what happened. We will also remember the terrible burning of Cork, Balbriggan, partition and the atrocities of the Civil War. We should respect all traditions on our island and be mature enough as a State to acknowledge all aspects of our past.\u201d Naturally, when you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing.</p> <p>Varadkar has a tendency to enflame the reaction to controversies of his government\u2019s own making by scolding even reasonable detractors. His subsequent assessment of the controversy as a <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/politics/2020/0108/1105145-united-ireland-ric/\" title=\"\">setback for Irish unity</a> appears to place the blame on the controversy that resulted from the mishandling of the event, rather than the mishandling itself. It was obvious that attempting to commemorate entities containing groups that remain despised in Ireland, such as the Black and Tans, was always going to require a degree of nuance and invention that the proposed event in Dublin Castle was never going to provide.</p> <p>One of Varadkar\u2019s favourite targets, Sinn F\u00e9in, was also gifted an open goal. \u201cIt is those who resisted British rule in Ireland during the Tan War and citizens that suffered at the hands of the those that maintained British rule who the state should be commemorating,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.joe.ie/politics/mary-lou-mcdonald-cancel-ric-commemoration-690226\" title=\"\">Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald</a> stated, \u201cnot the RIC or the Black and Tans.\u201d</p> <p>Until Brexit, the aspiration of a united Ireland was viewed in the Republic as unrealistic and even romantic. Despite positioning themselves as supporters of such a prospect, the Republic\u2019s main parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, now have to balance their derision of Sinn F\u00e9in with their own enthusiasm for Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s main policy.

      "bodyText": "The sense that Irish society would struggle to contain a decade of centenaries marking significant events that occurred between 1912 and 1923 including the suffrage movement, the 1913 Lockout, the Easter Rising of 1916, the Irish war of independence, the Irish civil war and the foundation of the Irish Free State, was appeased somewhat by the successful commemorations that took place throughout 2016. The term 1916 is shorthand for rebellion, resistance, revolution, yet as a nation we have struggled to contextualise impending centenaries as neatly. Historians and others have repeatedly warned that conversations surrounding the war of independence and the civil war in particular will untangle narratives that we have yet to face ourselves. The complexities of commemorating, well, complexities, was exposed last week when the Irish government defended, and then deferred, a commemoration of pre-independence police forces, the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Dublin Metropolitan police (DMP). The makeup of the RIC was bolstered by British recruits, particularly the Black and Tans, known for their brutality, and the Auxiliaries, a paramilitary unit made up of former British army officers. To say these entities are much maligned in Ireland would be putting it mildly. All of this is occurring in a shifting environment of Irish nationalism and patriotism, tied to the decade of centenaries itself, a parallel social revolution in women\u2019s and LGBTQ+ rights, the invisible but real border dividing the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland becoming central to European politics, and how Brexit has energised the prospect of a united Ireland. This period of centenaries is discussed in broad, tonal terms: it\u2019s complicated and dark. Participation in their commemoration comes with appeals for maturity, tolerance, respect and inclusion. But we\u2019ve talked less about the actual details of that past. In 2016, the reframing of the events of the Easter Rising as the aspirations of an egalitarian society, including a reinvigorated feminist subtext, may have offered something of a false epiphany. As various politicians spoke out against the RIC/DMP commemoration and some indicated they would boycott such events, the government scrambled to clarify. Its defence was that people were missing a nuanced point. \u201cThe RIC/DMP commemoration is not a celebration,\u201d the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, tweeted before the event was called off. \u201cIt\u2019s about remembering our history, not condoning what happened. We will also remember the terrible burning of Cork, Balbriggan, partition and the atrocities of the Civil War. We should respect all traditions on our island and be mature enough as a State to acknowledge all aspects of our past.\u201d Naturally, when you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing. Varadkar has a tendency to enflame the reaction to controversies of his government\u2019s own making by scolding even reasonable detractors. His subsequent assessment of the controversy as a setback for Irish unity appears to place the blame on the controversy that resulted from the mishandling of the event, rather than the mishandling itself. It was obvious that attempting to commemorate entities containing groups that remain despised in Ireland, such as the Black and Tans, was always going to require a degree of nuance and invention that the proposed event in Dublin Castle was never going to provide. One of Varadkar\u2019s favourite targets, Sinn F\u00e9in, was also gifted an open goal. \u201cIt is those who resisted British rule in Ireland during the Tan War and citizens that suffered at the hands of the those that maintained British rule who the state should be commemorating,\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald stated, \u201cnot the RIC or the Black and Tans.\u201d Until Brexit, the aspiration of a united Ireland was viewed in the Republic as unrealistic and even romantic. Despite positioning themselves as supporters of such a prospect, the Republic\u2019s main parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, now have to balance their derision of Sinn F\u00e9in with their own enthusiasm for Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s main policy. Previously, the unspoken aspect of deriding Sinn F\u00e9in was that a united Ireland was the ultimate fantasy. Now that the prospect of Irish unity has exited the dream-space, snapped into reality by how Brexit will so irreparably damage Northern Ireland that even unionists might vote to become part of a new, hypothetical all-Ireland entity, Sinn F\u00e9in is primed to expose any cracks in its rivals\u2019 republican credentials. These credentials were bolstered by Varadkar and his deputy, Simon Coveney\u2019s, green-jersey-wearing throughout the Brexit debacle, but are perhaps a little flimsy when they wander into a situation of accidentally memorialising the Black and Tans. While Sinn F\u00e9in may not immediately manage to translate the ongoing rise in Irish nationalism \u2013 particularly among young people \u2013 into electoral success, the party is very much on the front foot with regards to renewed aspirations for a united Ireland, sentiment-wise. There are many legacies of the horrors of colonialism in Ireland, but perhaps the most insidious of all is deference. Many Irish people simultaneously hold an anti-authoritarian streak alongside a tendency towards obedience. But there are moments, illustrated by last week\u2019s events, where it\u2019s clear that particular types of reconciliation need to be collectively agreed upon, and not via instruction or directive from on high.

      "body": "<p>Travel from Exeter to Manchester next Wednesday, and a round trip with the airline Flybe returning the next day would cost you \u00a368, of which air passenger duty amounts to \u00a326. A train ticket for the same journey would cost \u00a3141.</p> \n<p>This kind of price disparity between domestic flights and rail journeys has been the norm for years, the result of under-investment in railways and rail fares allowed to rise at rates much higher than inflation, while regional airports and airlines receive publicly funded incentives and tax breaks on fuel. It comes despite the government\u2019s much-vaunted green policies, and its repeated goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</p> \n<p>Given these price differences, and the woeful state of many of the UK\u2019s railways, it is easy to see why the UK\u2019s aviation sector is set to become the country\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, if left unchecked. That would blow apart the country\u2019s carbon budgets and the net zero commitment.</p> \n<p>The Committee on Climate Change, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/24/frequent-flyers-could-face-extra-tax-under-plans-to-cut-emissions\">writing to the government last year</a>, warned: \u201cPlausible options for how aviation could become zero carbon, even by mid-century, are lacking. Given a population that is anticipated to grow and rising incomes, some growth in [aviation] demand is expected. However, this cannot be unfettered.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the government presses ahead with plans to cut air passenger duty from domestic flights, as it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/flybe-government-talks-airline-tax-bill-sajid-javid\">proposing in attempts to ensure the survival of Flybe</a>, that would also send the wrong signal to the markets, argues Sam Fankhauser, director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. \u201cAir passenger duty is applied as a green tax, based broadly on the principle that the polluter pays. Cutting or removing [it] would essentially reduce or eliminate the carbon price for flying.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Air travel has been regarded as if it is a really precious economic sector'</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Leo Murray</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>As price comparisons show, air passenger duty at its current rate is at nowhere near the price that would be needed to tip the economic balance away from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/08/airlines-ignoring-efficient-planes-carbon-targets-tui-airways-atmosfair-index-virgin-atlantic\">air travel</a>. Indeed, according to the veteran flying campaigner Leo Murray, director of innovation at the climate charity Possible, that was never the intention.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was designed not to have an impact on demand for air travel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [governments] do not want it to reduce demand. Air travel has been regarded as if it is a really precious economic sector.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0928e560-f75b-4540-83f9-fbdd1b782840\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Air passenger duty, or APD, is a British tax on aviation, introduced in 1994. It is charged on each passenger on flights departing from the UK, and set according to the distance of their final destination and the class of travel.</p>\n    <p>It is intended to incentivise passengers to seek alternative arrangements from flying, which is the most carbon-intensive form of transport. By reducing demand for flights, it seeks to decrease carbon emissions from the air industry.</p>\n    <p>Destinations are grouped into two bands, above and below 2,000 miles from London, and charged at three rates \u2013 effectively for economy class, premium economy and business/first-class seats. All short-haul flights to Europe, including domestic, are charged in the same band, rising from \u00a313 in economy to \u00a378 in first class. A long-haul first-class flight now attracts APD of \u00a3528.</p>\n    <p>Airlines have long lobbied against the tax, particularly after the rates were doubled in 2007.</p>\n    <p>Flybe has argued that it is especially hard hit as the tax only applies to UK departures, and is therefore applied to each leg of a domestic return flight. That means, for example, that a return flight from Cardiff to Manchester is taxed at \u00a326, while an international return flight from the UK to Moscow pays \u00a313 in APD.</p>\n    <p>Long-haul flights from Northern Ireland are exempt from APD, as well as departures from remote parts of Scotland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet the entire sector contributes only about \u00a320bn to \u00a330bn to the national economy, according to estimates, and leisure trips taken abroad by UK residents far outnumber those by tourists coming to the UK. Murray points to a deficit of about \u00a323bn when the amount overseas tourists spend in the UK is subtracted from the amount British holidaymakers spend abroad.</p> \n<p>That means, he says, there is economic space for far higher air passenger duty in the leisure sector.

      "bodyText": "Travel from Exeter to Manchester next Wednesday, and a round trip with the airline Flybe returning the next day would cost you \u00a368, of which air passenger duty amounts to \u00a326. A train ticket for the same journey would cost \u00a3141. This kind of price disparity between domestic flights and rail journeys has been the norm for years, the result of under-investment in railways and rail fares allowed to rise at rates much higher than inflation, while regional airports and airlines receive publicly funded incentives and tax breaks on fuel. It comes despite the government\u2019s much-vaunted green policies, and its repeated goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Given these price differences, and the woeful state of many of the UK\u2019s railways, it is easy to see why the UK\u2019s aviation sector is set to become the country\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, if left unchecked. That would blow apart the country\u2019s carbon budgets and the net zero commitment. The Committee on Climate Change, writing to the government last year, warned: \u201cPlausible options for how aviation could become zero carbon, even by mid-century, are lacking. Given a population that is anticipated to grow and rising incomes, some growth in [aviation] demand is expected. However, this cannot be unfettered.\u201d If the government presses ahead with plans to cut air passenger duty from domestic flights, as it is proposing in attempts to ensure the survival of Flybe, that would also send the wrong signal to the markets, argues Sam Fankhauser, director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. \u201cAir passenger duty is applied as a green tax, based broadly on the principle that the polluter pays. Cutting or removing [it] would essentially reduce or eliminate the carbon price for flying.\u201d As price comparisons show, air passenger duty at its current rate is at nowhere near the price that would be needed to tip the economic balance away from air travel. Indeed, according to the veteran flying campaigner Leo Murray, director of innovation at the climate charity Possible, that was never the intention. \u201cIt was designed not to have an impact on demand for air travel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [governments] do not want it to reduce demand. Air travel has been regarded as if it is a really precious economic sector.\u201d Yet the entire sector contributes only about \u00a320bn to \u00a330bn to the national economy, according to estimates, and leisure trips taken abroad by UK residents far outnumber those by tourists coming to the UK. Murray points to a deficit of about \u00a323bn when the amount overseas tourists spend in the UK is subtracted from the amount British holidaymakers spend abroad. That means, he says, there is economic space for far higher air passenger duty in the leisure sector. Long-haul business flyers could also pay far more without being discouraged from flying, as air passenger duty barely makes a difference to them. \u201cWe are bleeding money out of the country, and you could repatriate some of that by encouraging people to stay in the UK,\u201d he says. One of the fairest ways to curb emissions from flying would be a frequent flyer levy. The majority of flights are taken by a small minority of people \u2013 in a given year, most people in the UK do not fly at all, and most of those who do are taking one or perhaps two return flights on holiday. One-fifth of overseas flights are taken by just 1% of the population. The airline industry is kept afloat by well-off people spending more on their leisure, taking advantage of low prices to jet off frequently on short trips. A frequent flyer levy would allow people a small number of flights a year without charge or at a small charge, while each subsequent flight would attract a much higher toll. Critics say it could penalise people in the outer edges of the UK, such as the north of Scotland or Northern Ireland. But there could be ways to manage those impacts while ensuring that the environmental cost of cheap flights is accounted for. Encouraging rail travel could also play a big role in reducing emissions from domestic aviation. Germany has just slashed the price of rail travel, to encourage people to use the lower-carbon form of transport. Even more radically, France is considering restrictions or even a ban on some domestic flights. Both those countries have well developed high-speed rail networks, however, which have benefited from public investment over decades. The UK has only one short stretch of high-speed rail, in the south-east, and plans for HS2 are still mired in controversy. This November, the UK will host the crunch UN climate conference, COP26, in Glasgow, and the government\u2019s green policies will be scrutinised on the international stage.

      "body": "<p>On Friday, Janelle Mon\u00e1e came out as non-binary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JanelleMonae/status/1215782996965355521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">retweeting a post</a> which read: \u201cThere is absolutely nothing better than living outside the gender binary.\u201d</p> <p>Mon\u00e1e\u2019s tweet came after the recent announcement of Sam Smith, who recently said they felt \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sam-smith-on-feeling-just-as-much-woman-as-i-am-man-126638/\">just as much a woman as I am man</a>\u201d. Both celebrities joined the increasing number of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/magazine/gender-nonbinary.html\">young people</a> who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/06/health/teens-gender-nonconforming-study-trnd/index.html\">identify</a> neither as male or female.</p> <p>Non-binary people tend to prefer using they/them pronouns (although not exclusively \u2013 some use she and he interchangeably). If gender neutral pronouns intimidate you, you\u2019re not the only one. As someone who is new to using them (a number of my friends have recently started to identify as non-binary), I confess it can be intimidating when you want to respect someone\u2019s wishes without making any blunders.</p> <p>Putting someone\u2019s dignity before my shyness about how to use a pronoun is, of course, the bare minimum. But I admit to having made mistakes \u2013 even avoiding using pronouns in the past, for fear of getting it wrong.</p> <p>It really isn\u2019t that hard, however, to get it right. </p> <h2>Who uses they/them pronouns, and why?</h2> <p>More and more people are using gender-neutral pronouns. In 2015, of 4,000 students at Harvard who had submitted preferred pronouns, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harvard-university-colleges-gender-free-pronouns-transgender-genderqueer-students/\">around 1% chose pronouns other than \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe</a><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harvard-university-colleges-gender-free-pronouns-transgender-genderqueer-students/\">\u201d</a>. Last year, Merriam-Webster made the singular gender-neutral use of \u201cthey\u201d its word of the year, based on the fact that it had seen a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/merriam-webster-they-word-year.html\">313% increase</a> in searches for its definition that year.</p> <p>Reasons for choosing gender neutral pronouns are complex and personal.

      "bodyText": "On Friday, Janelle Mon\u00e1e came out as non-binary, retweeting a post which read: \u201cThere is absolutely nothing better than living outside the gender binary.\u201d Mon\u00e1e\u2019s tweet came after the recent announcement of Sam Smith, who recently said they felt \u201cjust as much a woman as I am man\u201d. Both celebrities joined the increasing number of young people who identify neither as male or female. Non-binary people tend to prefer using they/them pronouns (although not exclusively \u2013 some use she and he interchangeably). If gender neutral pronouns intimidate you, you\u2019re not the only one. As someone who is new to using them (a number of my friends have recently started to identify as non-binary), I confess it can be intimidating when you want to respect someone\u2019s wishes without making any blunders. Putting someone\u2019s dignity before my shyness about how to use a pronoun is, of course, the bare minimum. But I admit to having made mistakes \u2013 even avoiding using pronouns in the past, for fear of getting it wrong. It really isn\u2019t that hard, however, to get it right. Who uses they/them pronouns, and why? More and more people are using gender-neutral pronouns. In 2015, of 4,000 students at Harvard who had submitted preferred pronouns, around 1% chose pronouns other than \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d. Last year, Merriam-Webster made the singular gender-neutral use of \u201cthey\u201d its word of the year, based on the fact that it had seen a 313% increase in searches for its definition that year. Reasons for choosing gender neutral pronouns are complex and personal. Some people do it because they don\u2019t feel they fit into a gender. For others, it\u2019s a form of protest: they contest rigid gender expectations and would rather live without them. Being gender non-conforming, right down to their pronouns, is how they choose to identify. So please, if you learn someone uses they/them pronouns, don\u2019t respond: \u201cWe get it OK \u2013 she\u2019s gay!\u201d \u2013 as my friend\u2019s parents recently did. Why they/them? It is normal in the English language to use they/them pronouns when we don\u2019t know the gender of the person to which we\u2019re referring, or if we want our sentence to be applicable to all genders. This isn\u2019t new \u2013 the saying \u201cEverybody loves their own mother\u201d has been used since around late 1300. Both Jane Austen and Geoffrey Chaucer \u2013 who died in 1400 - used pronouns that way. But what about the plural? While it is no longer grammatically incorrect to use they/them as singular anymore, people still get confused about it. A friend\u2019s parent recently responded to their pronouns, saying: \u201cBut if I tell Shelly you\u2019re coming round for dinner, she\u2019ll think you\u2019re bringing extra people!\u201d Try this: if you are using the pronoun in a scenario where there is no confusion over singular versus plural, just go ahead and use it (\u201cYou are going to meet my friend Poppy today, I hope you like them\u201d). If you are using it in an instance where it might be misconstrued as plural, you can change the first part of the sentence to make it clear (\u201cI may bring a friend, their name is Poppy\u201d). If you still feel that is confusing, you can be explicit (\u201cI asked Poppy \u2013 who uses they/them pronouns \u2013 they might come\u201d). This also takes the onus off your non-binary friend for having to explain it themselves later. What to avoid Avoid assuming every person\u2019s gender.

It may sound almost impossible, but last year not a single pedestrian, cyclist or child lost their life on the streets of Norway\u2019s capital, Oslo; the only fatality recorded was a motorist crashing into a fence. (By comparison 12 people were killed in Bristol, a city slightly smaller than Oslo, in 2017 \u2013 and over half of them were pedestrians or cyclists.) The catch? The lives saved in Norway seem to have been a byproduct of a bigger plan to become a carbon-neutral city that would probably spark a mutiny if you tried it here. Oslo has closed some streets to traffic entirely, removed parking spaces across the city to deter drivers, introduced measures to stop parents doing the school run by car and reduced speed limits. There\u2019s plentiful public transport and lots of bike lanes but the bottom line is, as Oslo\u2019s mayor says, that while cities will always have traffic, \u201cthe drivers should act as guests\u201d.

The report, published by Scottish Environment Link (SEL), which includes the John Muir Trust, the National Trust for Scotland, RSPB Scotland and the Scottish Wildlife Trust, argues that a dramatic reduction in the country\u2019s wild deer population is needed to tackle accelerating climate and biodiversity crises. The report says deer can cause significant damage to emerging woodlands through grazing, and that they trample fragile peatlands, which are key to carbon absorption. Scotland\u2019s deer population produces 5,500 tonnes of methane each year, the equivalent of 137,500 tonnes of CO2. The report also argues that more active culling could reduce accidents on rural roads. With no existing natural predators, the red deer population reached a peak of 400,000 in 2010. Deer management groups, often on sporting estates, kill certain numbers, but SEL wants the Scottish government to set and enforce higher targets.

The report was published before the release of findings by the independent deer working group, set up by the Scottish government in 2017 to consider changes for management of the species.

Under the codename Wiew\u00f3rka, Polish for squirrel (\u201ca tribute to my red hair\u201d), he gave clandestine lectures, assisted dissident activism, and smuggled banned works (disguised as unused computer discs) into the Soviet bloc. As a result, he was arrested and thrown out of Czechoslovakia several times in the 1980s \u2013 and, after the collapse of communism, was awarded medals by the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary.</p> <p>Scruton held academic posts at Boston University (1992-95) and the Institute of Psychological Sciences, Arlington, Virginia (2007-09); and he was visiting professor at Oxford University from 2010, and a professorial fellow in moral philosophy at St Andrews University (2011-14).</p> <p>He and his second wife, Sophie Jeffreys, and their children, Sam and Lucy, eventually settled down in what he sometimes dubbed Scrutopia, near Malmesbury, in Wiltshire. He was an ardent Green and countryside supporter \u2013 as well as a keen huntsman \u2013 declaring that, while environmentalism has all the hallmarks of a leftwing cause, it is in fact about conservation, equilibrium and \u201coikophilia\u201d (love of home), therefore \u201cquintessentially conservative\u201d.</p> <p>In 1995, he and the campaigner for constitutional reform <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anthonybarnett\" title=\"\">Anthony Barnett</a>, who described the two of them as \u201cat opposite ends of the political spectrum\u201d, set up the Town and Country Forum, to tackle rural issues. Scruton was made a fellow of the British Academy in 2008 and knighted in 2016.</p> <p>He exemplified Nietzsche\u2019s aphorism that \u201cevery philosophy is a sort of memoir\u201d. His was spun out of his life \u2013 often agonisingly.</p> <p>Born in Buslingthorpe, north-east of Lincoln, Roger was the son of Jack Scruton, a teacher, and his wife Beryl (nee Haynes), and was brought up in a somewhat uncultured home. After the family moved to Buckinghamshire, he discovered the delights of high culture in Marlow library and from the Royal grammar school, High Wycombe, he won an open scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge (for which, apparently, his father never forgave him). Having changed from science to philosophy, he gained a double first in 1965, and, in 1973, a PhD in aesthetics. His thesis formed the basis of his book Art and Imagination (1974).</p> <p>At the age of 24, he witnessed the \u00e9v\u00e9nements of 1968 from a first-floor window in Paris, but, unlike his friends, was disgusted by the protesting students\u2019 self-indulgent iconoclasm. \u201cI suddenly realised I was on the other side \u2026 wanted to conserve things, rather than pull them down.\u201d He began to read Edmund Burke, who \u201csummarised ... all my hesitations about progress\u201d, and defended authority and obedience.</p> <p>Scruton was the exact opposite of a champagne socialist: he took terrible risks for his political beliefs, not just literally, in eastern Europe, but in continually expressing outrageously reactionary views, which led him to be ostracised by the \u201cleftwing establishment\u201d.</p> <p>What he said in his younger days opposing feminism, liberalism, egalitarianism, homosexuality and anti-racism could be seen, at the very least, as worrying, and was constantly invoked against him long after his stance had mellowed with age and his happy second marriage, or else it was denounced as self-publicising hyperbole.</p> <p>Indeed, lucid and clear-thinking though he was, it was difficult to know what he really did believe, and what trumped what in his multilayered thinking. He declared Thatcherism, with its free-market libertarianism, philistinism and contempt for education, \u201ca betrayal\u201d of cultivated Burkean conservatism, yet went on to support it.</p> <p>He returned to Anglicanism (\u201cmy tribal religion \u2013 the religion of the English who don\u2019t believe a word of it\u201d), but it is a moot point whether or not he was an atheist (as most of his secular friends insisted) or whether, for him, God was part of what he called \u201cthe web of seeming\u201d, the \u201clife-world\u201d (Husserl\u2019s Lebenswelt).</p> <p>It may sound odd for a serious philosopher and intensely sincere person to exalt illusion, but, quoting Oscar Wilde, Scruton insisted that only someone very shallow does not judge by appearances.</p> <p>In The Aesthetics of Music (1997), he brilliantly described the sense we have of a musical space in which tones are higher and lower, and the \u201cvirtual causality\u201d that makes it seem inevitable for each particular sound in a musical composition to follow the previous one.</p> <p>Permeated by \u201cspatial metaphor\u201d, our experience of music would be impossible without it. \u201cIf someone said that, for him, there is no up and down in music, no movement, no soaring, rising, falling, no running or walking from place to place\u201d, would we count what he is hearing as music?</p> <p>Similarly, said Scruton, with reality itself, or at least human reality. If not experienced through human-made metaphors, meanings and categories, what on earth could it be? Scruton in fact imitated Kant, but by inverting his metaphysics.</p> <p>Kant said that all we can know is phenomena (\u201cappearances\u201d) of the real \u201cthings-in-themselves\u201d which are tantalisingly, inexorably unknowable. Scruton, in a beautiful reversal, relegated knowledge of behind-the-scenes reality to science and declared that the most important task for philosophy now is to \u201cre-enchant the world\u201d. Because it attempts \u201cto explore the \u2018depth\u2019 of human beings\u201d, science \u201cthreatens to destroy our response to the surface\u201d.</p> <p>But it is on the surface that we live and act. A smile is \u201creally\u201d only the movement of facial muscles \u2013 except that it is not, any more (as Scruton insisted in Sexual Desire, 1986) than erotic sex is just the mutual manipulation of body parts.</p> <p>Scruton demanded that we \u201cresurrect the human person\u201d, and \u201creplace the sarcasm which knows that we are merely animals, with the irony which sees that we are not\u201d.</p> <p>For all his logical stringency, he had in some ways less an analytic than a continental style of philosophising. But that style, with its mixture of poetical metaphysics and subjectivity, runs the risk of being sentimental, which Scruton, much as he condemned and eviscerated sentimentality, was sometimes guilty of.</p> <p>Adamant that beauty is essential for everyone, he advocated that any architect of public buildings should consult the aesthetic wishes of their future inhabitants. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/25/would-you-trust-roger-scruton-to-design-your-new-home-commission-building-better-building-beautiful\" title=\"\">Having been appointed honorary chair</a> of the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/15/can-we-trust-the-government-to-judge-whats-beautiful\" title=\"\">Building Better, Building Beautiful</a> commission in 2018, he was sacked a few months later on the strength of <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2019/07/sir-roger-scruton\" title=\"\">an interview he gave to the New Statesman</a>, which was pronounced to be antisemitic, Islamophobic and anti-Chinese. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/23/roger-scruton-gets-job-back-after-regrettable-sacking\" title=\"\">He was afterwards reinstated</a> when a recording of the interview emerged and the New Statesman apologised for the way it had been selectively quoted from on Twitter. He insisted that his interviewer not be sacked.</p> <p>He was capable of tendentiousness himself. In 2002, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jan/24/advertising.tobaccoadvertising\" title=\"\">a leaked email to the company Japanese Tobacco International</a> asked for an increase of \u00a31,000 on the \u00a34,500 a month it was already paying him for the placing of articles in the British press that could be deemed helpful to their marketing. Although Scruton had been a smoker himself, this did not exactly follow Kant\u2019s categorical imperative (we should do only what we would be prepared for everyone else to have to do) of which he was such a clear, fervent expositor.</p> <p>But he lacked nothing in courage, refusing to kowtow to popular piety, even if retaining a piety of his own.</p> <p>Like Dostoevsky\u2019s kindly Grand Inquisitor, he promoted illusions that he loved but could also see through, almost relishing the arcane discernment of reality\u2019s bleakness. \u201cWhatever its defects,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmy life has enabled me to find comfort in uncomfortable truths.\u201d He was a tormented soul, as manifest in his rather laboured way of speaking, but also extremely funny.</p> <p>In 1973 he married Danielle Lafitte; they divorced in 1979. His marriage to Sophie came in 1996. She and their children survive him.</p> <p>\u2022 Roger Vernon Scruton, philosopher, writer and activist, born 27 February 1944; died 12 January 2020</p>",

At the age of 24, he witnessed the \u00e9v\u00e9nements of 1968 from a first-floor window in Paris, but, unlike his friends, was disgusted by the protesting students\u2019 self-indulgent iconoclasm. \u201cI suddenly realised I was on the other side \u2026 wanted to conserve things, rather than pull them down.\u201d He began to read Edmund Burke, who \u201csummarised ... all my hesitations about progress\u201d, and defended authority and obedience. Scruton was the exact opposite of a champagne socialist: he took terrible risks for his political beliefs, not just literally, in eastern Europe, but in continually expressing outrageously reactionary views, which led him to be ostracised by the \u201cleftwing establishment\u201d. What he said in his younger days opposing feminism, liberalism, egalitarianism, homosexuality and anti-racism could be seen, at the very least, as worrying, and was constantly invoked against him long after his stance had mellowed with age and his happy second marriage, or else it was denounced as self-publicising hyperbole. Indeed, lucid and clear-thinking though he was, it was difficult to know what he really did believe, and what trumped what in his multilayered thinking. He declared Thatcherism, with its free-market libertarianism, philistinism and contempt for education, \u201ca betrayal\u201d of cultivated Burkean conservatism, yet went on to support it. He returned to Anglicanism (\u201cmy tribal religion \u2013 the religion of the English who don\u2019t believe a word of it\u201d), but it is a moot point whether or not he was an atheist (as most of his secular friends insisted) or whether, for him, God was part of what he called \u201cthe web of seeming\u201d, the \u201clife-world\u201d (Husserl\u2019s Lebenswelt). It may sound odd for a serious philosopher and intensely sincere person to exalt illusion, but, quoting Oscar Wilde, Scruton insisted that only someone very shallow does not judge by appearances. In The Aesthetics of Music (1997), he brilliantly described the sense we have of a musical space in which tones are higher and lower, and the \u201cvirtual causality\u201d that makes it seem inevitable for each particular sound in a musical composition to follow the previous one. Permeated by \u201cspatial metaphor\u201d, our experience of music would be impossible without it. \u201cIf someone said that, for him, there is no up and down in music, no movement, no soaring, rising, falling, no running or walking from place to place\u201d, would we count what he is hearing as music? Similarly, said Scruton, with reality itself, or at least human reality. If not experienced through human-made metaphors, meanings and categories, what on earth could it be? Scruton in fact imitated Kant, but by inverting his metaphysics. Kant said that all we can know is phenomena (\u201cappearances\u201d) of the real \u201cthings-in-themselves\u201d which are tantalisingly, inexorably unknowable. Scruton, in a beautiful reversal, relegated knowledge of behind-the-scenes reality to science and declared that the most important task for philosophy now is to \u201cre-enchant the world\u201d. Because it attempts \u201cto explore the \u2018depth\u2019 of human beings\u201d, science \u201cthreatens to destroy our response to the surface\u201d. But it is on the surface that we live and act. A smile is \u201creally\u201d only the movement of facial muscles \u2013 except that it is not, any more (as Scruton insisted in Sexual Desire, 1986) than erotic sex is just the mutual manipulation of body parts. Scruton demanded that we \u201cresurrect the human person\u201d, and \u201creplace the sarcasm which knows that we are merely animals, with the irony which sees that we are not\u201d. For all his logical stringency, he had in some ways less an analytic than a continental style of philosophising. But that style, with its mixture of poetical metaphysics and subjectivity, runs the risk of being sentimental, which Scruton, much as he condemned and eviscerated sentimentality, was sometimes guilty of. Adamant that beauty is essential for everyone, he advocated that any architect of public buildings should consult the aesthetic wishes of their future inhabitants. Having been appointed honorary chair of the government\u2019s Building Better, Building Beautiful commission in 2018, he was sacked a few months later on the strength of an interview he gave to the New Statesman, which was pronounced to be antisemitic, Islamophobic and anti-Chinese. He was afterwards reinstated when a recording of the interview emerged and the New Statesman apologised for the way it had been selectively quoted from on Twitter. He insisted that his interviewer not be sacked. He was capable of tendentiousness himself. In 2002, a leaked email to the company Japanese Tobacco International asked for an increase of \u00a31,000 on the \u00a34,500 a month it was already paying him for the placing of articles in the British press that could be deemed helpful to their marketing. Although Scruton had been a smoker himself, this did not exactly follow Kant\u2019s categorical imperative (we should do only what we would be prepared for everyone else to have to do) of which he was such a clear, fervent expositor. But he lacked nothing in courage, refusing to kowtow to popular piety, even if retaining a piety of his own. Like Dostoevsky\u2019s kindly Grand Inquisitor, he promoted illusions that he loved but could also see through, almost relishing the arcane discernment of reality\u2019s bleakness. \u201cWhatever its defects,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmy life has enabled me to find comfort in uncomfortable truths.\u201d He was a tormented soul, as manifest in his rather laboured way of speaking, but also extremely funny. In 1973 he married Danielle Lafitte; they divorced in 1979. His marriage to Sophie came in 1996. She and their children survive him. \u2022 Roger Vernon Scruton, philosopher, writer and activist, born 27 February 1944; died 12 January 2020",

Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 announced plans for Total to move its central treasury, including between 60 and 70 jobs, back to the \u201cheart of Europe\u2019s economic and financial system\u201d in Paris by the end of 2020. \u201cTotal will bring its cash back to Paris,\u201d he told a financial conference in the French capital on Tuesday morning. He later confirmed the move on social media, tweeting that it was \u201ca logical decision\u201d given the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Total\u2019s decision to abandon the City will raise doubts once again over whether London can retain its position as Europe\u2019s most important financial centre against competition from Paris and Frankfurt. Pouyann\u00e9 said that from a legal point of view \u201cit doesn\u2019t change much\u201d, but the company hopes to send a signal that Paris is an attractive place for business. \u201cI think it\u2019s good that the big European groups show their faith in Europe,\u201d he told delegates at the Euronext conference in Paris. Total\u2019s decision to return its financial core to Paris comes six years after the \u20ac128bn (\u00a3110bn) Paris-listed company moved its financial operations to London to be closer to the oil industry\u2019s most important investors, advisers and analysts. At the time the company said it hoped to \u201cget closer to London, which is the oil trading and financial centre of Europe\u201d. Since then, Brexit has raised uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future access to other EU financial centres, and Total has set out plans to plough a fifth of its investment into low-carbon energy within the next 15 years. Total began its retreat from the UK early last year after announcing plans to move its 200-strong energy trading team from London to Geneva in September. It also moved the London-based team tasked with marketing its liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Paris to join the LNG business it bought from the French utility giant Engie. At the time, the company said Brexit was \u201cnot at all\u201d a factor in the plans.

      "bodyText": "The disgraced entrepreneur Dominic Chappell has been ordered to pay \u00a39.5m into BHS pension schemes after his appeal failed. Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience, bought the chain from billionaire Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 in 2015. But it crashed 13 months later, leaving a pensions hole of up to \u00a3571m. The Pensions Regulator (TPR) immediately moved to protect the pensions of 19,000 members and made three requests for information under a section 72 order. It managed to secure a \u00a3363m cash settlement with Green to rescue the scheme. However, Chappell was accused of failing to hand over vital documents to the regulator as it sought to stabilise the pension fund. TPR took him to court and he was charged with three counts of neglecting or refusing to provide documents without a reasonable excuse, contrary to the Pensions Act 2004. During the hearing, the former racing car driver from Blandford Forum in Dorset claimed he was being made a \u201cscapegoat\u201d for the failure of the high street chain and said he wished he had never bought it. Representing himself at Hove crown court, Chappell said that unlike billionaire Green he did not have the money to make the problem go away. \u201cI\u2019m not Philip Green, sitting on a \u00a3100m yacht in the south of France, who just wrote a cheque for \u00a3350m to make the problem go away.\u201d Chappell said during his 13 months at the helm of BHS he had contributed \u00a34.5m to the pension fund.

In January 2018, Chappell was handed a bill of almost \u00a310m to make up the BHS pensions shortfall. But he decided to fight the ruling and appealed against the decision to the upper tribunal. Now TPR has secured a further \u00a39.5m towards the BHS pension fund from Chappell after his appeal was rejected. Nicola Parish, TPR\u2019s executive director of frontline regulation, said: \u201cWe are pleased that the decision to issue two contribution notices to pay money into the BHS pension schemes stands. \u201cThis case illustrates how the Pensions Regulator is willing to pursue a case through the courts to seek redress for pension savers.

      "bodyText": "The UK failed to pass on the details of tens of thousands of foreign criminals to their home EU countries and concealed the scandal, the Guardian has learned. The police national computer (PNC) error went undetected for five years. What is the police national computer? According to the College of Policing, the PNC is used to help investigations and sharing information of both national and local importance. It provides critical services to the police, UK law enforcement and criminal justice agencies throughout the UK and it also links in with the European-wide IT system known as the Schengen Information System (SIS II) that enables all participating member states to share real-time information on persons and objects of interest via a series of alerts. The PNC provides real-time checks on people, vehicles, crimes and property. How does the PNC alert European partners? The PNC generates daily activity files based on all the latest updates and any related to foreign offenders are meant to be forward to the European Criminal Records Information Exchange System (ECRIS) by a body known as ACRO Criminal Records Office. What is ECRIS? According to the European Union website, ECRIS was established in April 2012 to improve the exchange of information on criminal records throughout the EU. All EU countries are connected to ECRIS. The database ensures that information on convictions is exchanged between EU countries quickly and simply and provides judges and prosecutors with easy access to information on the criminal history of persons concerned. It also removes the possibility for offenders to escape convictions by moving from one EU country to another. What is ACRO? ACRO Criminal Records Office is a national police unit that provides a range of services to organise criminal records information and improve the links between criminal records and biometric information. It is also responsible for international police data sharing. What has gone wrong with this system? It has emerged that ACRO failed to pass on details of 75,000 convictions of foreign criminals to their home EU countries via ECRIS. Why has this happened? It appears to be a software glitch. ACRO has responded by developing a \u201csoftware script\u201d to fix the issue. What are the implications of the error? Dangerous foreign offenders once released from prison could return to their home countries without local authorities being aware of their presence. How does this all fit into Brexit? There have been warnings from law enforcement agencies about the impact Brexit could have on cross-border information sharing. But this relates to an error with the domestic PNC, which ACRO is working to correct. However, it has been revealed that the Home Office initially chose to conceal the embarrassing failure from EU partners. It also follows revelations that the British authorities had made \u201cunlawful\u201d full or partial copies of the database that were said by an EU report to pose \u201cserious and immediate risks to the integrity and security of SIS data\u201d. Both have served to undermine trust between the UK and the bloc.",

      "body": "<p>By now, Michael Nguyen expects them: every month or so, someone representing one international real estate investment firm or another crosses the threshold of the Parkdale Intercultural Association, a non-profit immigrant settlement agency he runs on a busy stretch of Toronto\u2019s Queen Street West.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same every time: Who owns the building? How do I get in touch with them? Do they want to sell?\u201d shrugged Nguyen, whose centre has been helping new immigrants adjust to Canadian life for decades. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate \u2014 the owner believes in what we do, so we feel safe. But you know the same questions are being asked of everyone all around here. And not everyone is going to say no.\u201d</p> <p>Toronto\u2019s much-vaunted international brand \u2013 the poster-child for extreme diversity, a global social experiment done right \u2013 has become a faded myth in many of its inner-city neighbourhoods. Property values have soared beyond the most fevered speculators\u2019 imagination, mostly relegating those representing Toronto\u2019s vast swaths of difference to the suburbs.</p> <p>Parkdale, however, an inner-city neighbourhood just six kilometres west of downtown along Lake Ontario\u2019s shore, has long been an outlier. As Nguyen spoke, runny-nosed toddlers fiddled with coloured blocks, while their parents, all recent immigrants, tried to focus on an English as a second language class. Outside, Queen Street bustled with an almost fairy-tale version of multicultural Toronto: Tibetan monks in flowing orange robes slipping into a flow of South Asian, Caribbean and African immigrants; a mom-and-pop grocer sells roasted barley, a favourite Tibetan snack; other restaurants offer roti, a Jamaican/Indian wrap that fuses the spicy flavours of both cultures.</p> <p>But the lively streetscape here masks a threat to what could very well be the last island of diversity in a city swamped by the flood waters of global capital. Huge international real estate investment firms have embedded themselves in Parkdale\u2019s urban fabric, buying dozens of apartment towers and thousands of rental units. Residents claim that threats, intimidation, rampant eviction notices and strategic neglect have become common. So too have tenant protests and rent strikes, where slick corporate offices find themselves occupied by hundreds of angry tenants demanding redress.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec6238c7e7b2662663810e0847ca4660eaf4d20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec6238c7e7b2662663810e0847ca4660eaf4d20/0_176_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A proposal for a new 19-storey condo development, which prompted resident concern.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A proposal for a new 19-storey condo development, which prompted resident concern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those protesting, however, are the lucky ones. In a city famous as a landing pad for immigrants, many recently-arrived residents, often without either English or an understanding of Canadian legal protections around tenancy, simply pack up and leave.</p> <p>\u201cGone are the days of the mom-and-pop slumlord, which was the dominant make-up of the rental housing market in Parkdale for years,\u201d says Cole Webber, a legal aid worker with the Parkdale Community Legal Services (PCLS), a provincially-funded agency for free legal services (which was itself evicted from its long-time Parkdale offices last year). \u201cThe fact of it is that the primary impediment for these corporations increasing their profits is the ongoing tenancy of working-class people who live in Parkdale. The only reason these companies bought these properties is so they can turn over the units. Period.\u201d</p> <p>Parkdale has become one of <em>those</em> neighbourhoods, following a familiar script. Inner-city working-class suburb, the last bastion of affordable rent, becomes popular with artists and students, who lend it a certain zeitgeisty sheen; property speculators follow; rent and property value increase; condos sprout like weeds; neighbourhood becomes a whitewashed nowhere, like so many before it: Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg, London\u2019s Hackney, Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg, San Francisco\u2019s Mission. Indeed, Akelius, the Swedish investment firm that now owns many thousands of apartment units throughout Europe, made that exact comparison about Parkdale in its most recent annual report.</p> <p>\u201cThere goes another community center,\u201d quipped the Instagram account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/parkdalelife/?hl=en\">@parkdalelife</a> about an infamous all-night McDonald\u2019s being demolished to make way for a 700-plus unit luxury condo building, leeringly named \u201cXO.\u201d It was just the kind of hipster fatalism that infects neighbourhoods in the grips of late-stage gentrification. The McDonald\u2019s, at Parkdale\u2019s nexus of Dufferin and King Streets, had served as an informal refuge for Parkdale\u2019s legions of homeless and mentally ill for decade. And by the time blas\u00e9 youth in search of urban grit arrive just in time to become cheekily indignant about displacement, it\u2019s already far too late.</p> <h2>From wealthy getaway to \u2018Crackdale\u2019</h2> <p>I lived in Parkdale\u2019s orbit for almost 20 years, first in the late 1990s on its eastern boundary, and then its west a decade later. </p> <p>The neighbourhood\u2019s infamous liquor store at Queen and Brock Streets was the only one I knew with a full-time police detail. Depending on the night, you could see a scuffle in the whiskey aisle, an arrest, or a fistfight or overdose in its parking lot; often, there would be a solicitation for a low-priced trick from one of the prostitutes who routinely patrolled its perimeter. Once, I was witness to a tooth being knocked out, one homeless man to another, over an allegedly stolen beer. (In one of the few good news stories to come out of Parkdale recently, the city is trying to acquire the site of the store, now closed, to build affordable housing.)</p> <p>In a country like Canada, where we speak smugly of social safety nets and institutionalized humanity, here was a place that made it feel like that was all talk. In the late 1990s, Parkdale could be chilling: group homes housed hundreds battling mental health and addiction issues; the less fortunate were left to the precarious realm of government rent subsidies and dilapidated, poorly-maintained rooming houses \u2013 or, just as often, the street. Along a deadened streetscape of mostly empty storefronts, drug deals happened in broad daylight, addicts raged and twitched, and Parkdale earned another name, Crackdale, day by day.</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to see Parkdale as doomed from the start. It was built in the late 19th century as a summer refuge for the city\u2019s wealthy, with opulent brick mansions on a small bluff overlooking the water. Six kilometres from the smoky and bustling downtown, it was close enough for those with means to easily reach \u2013 and to keep those without away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf544ff2235f49ceeb2b8806bb37e563a14fc219\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf544ff2235f49ceeb2b8806bb37e563a14fc219/0_7_2836_1702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rapid industrialization meant that many of Parkdale\u2019s elegant mansions were hastily sold and repurposed as multiple single-room dwellings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapid industrialization meant that many of Parkdale\u2019s elegant mansions were hastily sold and repurposed as multiple single-room dwellings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boris Spremo/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In less than two decades, rapid industrialization clustering along the water\u2019s edge changed all that. Apartment houses were built to accommodate workers, many of them immigrants, for the nearby factories and abattoirs; hastily-sold grand Victorian homes were repurposed into multiple single-room dwellings.</p> <p>The decline of industry across North America in the 70s and 80s dealt Parkdale another blow, leaving the spartan workers\u2019 housing to rot. The nearby lake \u2013 now toxic \u2013 and the six-lane expressway, built in the 1950s along the shore, ensured its squalor. Around the same time, the province of Ontario deregulated mental health care and shut down psychiatric hospitals, releasing psychiatric patients to seek refuge in privately-run care homes; they found Parkdale\u2019s chopped-up manses ready to receive them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not going to be Little Tibet much longer. We\u2019re losing the community we built over years</p> <footer> <cite>Tenzin Tekan, Parkdale Community Legal Services</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the years, poverty and marginalization became deeply embedded. Social service agencies clustered in Parkdale to serve a disempowered population, and, by their sheer density, drew more into the neighbourhood\u2019s orbit. Addiction made Parkdale a hotbed of a predatory illegal drug trade; prostitution became rampant. Concrete slab apartment towers, built as slum-remediation in the \u201curban renewal\u201d zeitgeist in the 50s and 60s, became vertical manifestations of the social ills they had been intended to erase. Drugs and crime settled into their concrete walls.</p> <p>Gentrification, on the surface, seemed less of a threat than an impossibility. As the rest of Toronto surged upward in the early 2000s, Parkdale was forever \u201cup and coming\u201d \u2013 real estate code for a litany of social ills \u2013 and a target for only the heartiest of speculators. Some did come, sprucing up half a block here, a cluster of houses there, but Toronto\u2019s real estate boom left Parkdale\u2019s intractable poverty largely intact.</p> <h2>Saved by immigrants</h2> <p>The people who did come were new immigrants and refugees, heading to the last inner-city refuge of low rent. The tower units were squalid but cheap. And slowly, the tide of crime and drugs began to recede. Thanks to a long-standing federal policy, Tibetan refugees fleeing persecution in China took particularly strong root through the 2000s and 2010s, opening restaurants and grocery stores along Queen Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9705d8a877179a22662dc32db24e5eaa7d938026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9705d8a877179a22662dc32db24e5eaa7d938026/0_355_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loga and Dolma Yangchen in the kitchen of their Tibetan restaurant, Loga\u2019s Corner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loga and Dolma Yangchen in the kitchen of their Tibetan restaurant, Loga\u2019s Corner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne-Marie Jackson/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Immigrant groups had always filtered through Parkdale, finding their feet in a new country before moving on. But the Tibetans stayed, slowly transforming the broken and neglected district into a bright, vibrant family neighbourhood. Look at Google maps and you\u2019ll see \u201cLittle Tibet\u201d in the crook where Queen Street and Jameson meet. \u201cTibetans really broke the mould here,\u201d Webber said. \u201cThey turned the neighbourhood into their social and cultural hub. They\u2019re a stabilizing force, for sure.\u201d</p> <p>Approximately 8,000 Tibetans call Canada home, and more than 6,000 live in Toronto, the bulk of them in Parkdale. That makes the neighbourhood the largest Tibetan community outside the country\u2019s borders, though for how much longer is anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cAll my family and friends who are in Parkdale, they tell me about people coming to Canada and not able to find a place in their budget in Parkdale anymore,\u201d said Tenzin Tekan, one of Webber\u2019s colleagues at PCLS, who came to Canada in 2006 with her family. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be Little Tibet much longer. We\u2019re losing the community we built over years.\u201d</p> <h2>A global issue</h2> <p>Parkdale\u2019s burgeoning crisis isn\u2019t unique. Working class neighbourhoods in cosmopolitan cities all over the world have been transformed into urbane playgrounds for the moneyed set. And global investors muscling into the rental housing market is no Toronto phenomenon. After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/13/us-home-repossessions-rise\">sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US</a> cratered the property market there, note Canadian professors Martine August and Allan Walks, huge swaths of rental housing were acquired by investment firms willing and able to wait out the market dip to recapitalize on the rent gap as the economy recovered.</p> <p>Last year, one of them, Blackstone, an international private equity firm that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/26/blackstone-group-accused-global-housing-crisis-un\">the UN recently accused of \u201cwreaking havoc\u201d</a> on the global affordable housing market with \u201caggressive evictions\u201d of low and middle income tenants, recently entered an acquisition deal with the Toronto-based firm Starlight Investments. In the fall, Starlight bought a $1.72bn (\u00a31bn) portfolio of apartment towers; one of the largest is in Parkdale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a3b7274fecdad9264ce66bfb9ef8523422f846b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a3b7274fecdad9264ce66bfb9ef8523422f846b/0_0_4864_3520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kreuzberg Berlin, another district in a \u2018desirable\u2019 city that has faced gentrification.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kreuzberg Berlin, another district in a \u2018desirable\u2019 city that has faced gentrification.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a narrative of numbing sameness from which no city \u2013 no desirable city, at least \u2013 is immune. But things were supposed to be different here. As Manhattan became a mall for the global elite, and as San Francisco\u2019s homeless population climbed into the thousands, Torontonians like me were smug civic boosters of our anomaly status. Here we were, a big city that worked, where different kinds of people could choose \u2013 and afford \u2013 to live shoulder to shoulder and be better for it.</p> <p>And for a moment, it was true. But capital moves quickly, and policy much less so. In less than two decades, housing prices in Toronto doubled, then trebled, then quadrupled: the average price of a single-family home went from $251,267 in January 2000 to $1,044,527 in late 2018. Toronto, a fabled city of immigrants, was fast becoming something else entirely. Whole immigrant communities who had gained a toehold in the city\u2019s core were selling high and decamping for the suburbs, which is where the city\u2019s vaunted diversity now lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Homogenous, predictable, corporate and maybe even securitized \u2013 that certainly seems like the fate of Toronto</p> <footer> <cite>Prof. Deborah Cowen, University of Toronto</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Real estate became a bloodsport, and Parkdale became convenient hyperbole for last-resort gentrification narratives. \u201cWe Bought a Crackhouse\u201d read the headline of an infamous 2017 story in Toronto Life magazine, about a young family\u2019s Parkdale renovation journey that included moving on the addicts splayed unconscious in the basement. The story tore open a gash in an urban skin already rubbed raw with rising inequity. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ywzmnb/how-one-story-pissed-off-just-about-every-non-rich-person-in-toronto\">The backlash was intense, vicious and unrelenting</a>. It became an emblematic tale of the city\u2019s escalating class war, pushed past the point of no return.</p> <p>Rising property values have brought about a full-blown housing crisis on all fronts. 8,700 people in Toronto are homeless; 100 now die on the streets each year. The waiting list for social housing sits at 98,000. Residential rents, even in a rent-controlled environment, have more than doubled in three years, according to the research firm UrbaNation. Vacancy hovers at 1%. And Parkdale is the last chapter of an urban narrative fast fading into myth.</p> <p>\u201cI used to say, in a kind of flip way, that I gave up on the inner city years ago,\u201d says Deborah Cowen, a professor of geography who studies cities and social justice at the University of Toronto. Cowen lived in Parkdale in the 90s, when it was bottoming out. Even then, she says, you could see subtle pressures of gentrification building. \u201cIn terms of being homogenous, predictable, corporate and maybe even securitized \u2014 that certainly seems like the fate of Toronto, and without some kind of dramatic change, it will be.\u201d</p> <p>How dramatic? Just last month, Cowen says, the city announced a $24bn affordable housing strategy with provincial and federal support. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced even that is enough to effect the change we need,\u201d she says. Bureaucracies walk, while capital sprints: by the time anything gets built \u2013 eight to 10 years from now, or more \u2013 \u201cwhat kind of city will be left to save?\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Vegandale\u2019: a step too far?</h2> <p>Nerupa Somasale doesn\u2019t need academic studies or government statistics to understand what she\u2019s lost. Somasale, 23, bright and articulate with an engaging laugh in many ways epitomises Toronto\u2019s global brand of harmonious multiculturalism. In the 1990s, her mother, from the Philippines, landed in Parkdale where she met Somasale\u2019s father, a refugee from India.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, I hate that. I hate it so much,\u201d Somasale says, when I ask her about the city\u2019s rosy reputation. \u201cThis whole idea of multiculturalism, diversity \u2013 it\u2019s <em>still</em> used as something we should be proud of. But it suggests equity, like we all have a stake. It\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s branding for politicians and for tourists, nothing more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76476859c3d73fa74a6367dac0d7f850aff3c9b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76476859c3d73fa74a6367dac0d7f850aff3c9b6/0_135_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los Angeles vegan restaurant Doomie\u2019s opened on Queen Street in 2016, swiftly followed by a non-dairy ice cream shop and a lifestyle boutique.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Los Angeles vegan restaurant Doomie\u2019s opened on Queen Street in 2016, swiftly followed by a non-dairy ice cream shop and a lifestyle boutique.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vince Talotta/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Somasale, an undergraduate student in her final year of history and curatorial studies at Ryerson University, was born on the 19th floor of the building at 103 West Lodge Avenue in Parkdale \u2013 where recently the elevators stopped working, prompting raucous protest at the landlord\u2019s offices over its alleged mass-eviction campaign. For better or worse, Parkdale has always been her home: through the 90s, when the crack trade was brisk and relentless; through the 2000s, when adventurous urbanites were drawn further westward to a growing array of nightclubs and late-night restaurants; and finally the last decade, where change was inflicted most visibly by a particularly aggressive corporate newcomer that saw the opportunity to craft a new identity for Parkdale entirely.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It had that feeling: \u2018There\u2019s nothing here, so let\u2019s just make it into whatever we want'</p> <footer> <cite>Nerupa Somasale, former resident</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It started in 2016, when an outpost of the Los Angeles vegan restaurant Doomie\u2019s opened on Queen Street, swiftly followed by a non-dairy ice cream shop and a lifestyle boutique. Last year, 5700, which owned all these ventures, announced it was \u201crebranding\u201d the neighbourhood \u201cVegandale,\u201d with a slate of international food events under that banner.</p> <p>\u201cVegandale,\u201d to many, was the same brutal invasion at street-level that was happening in the towers just a few blocks away. \u201cIt was a really tumultuous moment, like everything that had been happening here the past few years just burst out on to the street,\u201d Somasale said. It shifted things for her. She became more engaged in activist efforts, more involved in the protest movement. \u201cIt was an erasure of history, and an intentional one,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted to change a chunk of the neighbourhood in a way that didn\u2019t benefit anybody that had lived here for years. It had that feeling: \u2018There\u2019s nothing here, so let\u2019s just make it into whatever we want.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There is, of course, a great deal here, which makes Parkdale\u2019s quick transformation so alarming. But for Somasale, there\u2019s little reason for hope. \u201cHalf the people I grew up with, whether they were my age or they were family members that were much older who had lived there for decades, have been displaced,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause they can\u2019t afford it \u2013 me included.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1d6f7441fb098254e3d8fde66112f9a42892ce3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1d6f7441fb098254e3d8fde66112f9a42892ce3/0_0_4364_3105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Vegandale Brewery, one of a number of businesses billed as part of a \u2018rebranding\u2019 of Parkdale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Vegandale Brewery, one of a number of businesses billed as part of a \u2018rebranding\u2019 of Parkdale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Randy Risling/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a bright, early autumn day, Somasale asked that we meet in Kensington Market, a vibrant, ramshackle cluster of Victorian houses converted into cafes, fruit stands and vintage shops on the western fringe of Toronto\u2019s downtown. Earlier this year, Somasale left her lifelong home, finally broken by non-functional elevators, floods and the enveloping chaos of the landlord-tenant war. In Kensington, she shares a one bedroom apartment with two friends \u2013 there is no escaping Toronto\u2019s merciless rental rates.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted so, so badly to stay in the neighbourhood. I looked for a year-and-a-half. It was like a horror story. For $600, I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw. It was disgusting, terrifying. But they\u2019d get away with it because someone would be desperate.\u201d</p> <p>She sighs. \u201cI have a weird relationship to this feeling of home, because I can\u2019t even live there,\u201d she says. \u201cI visit every other week. But it changes so fast. It feels like neighbourhood amnesia.\u201d</p> <h2>A haven for the vulnerable?</h2> <p>By 2016, the last time the Canadian government collected census data, on paper, Parkdale had changed little: Almost 90% of its residents were renters, versus less than half for the city as a whole, making its 35,000 people more vulnerable to rental market swings than anywhere else. More than a third lived below the poverty line, 50% more than the broader city. While the immigrant population had grown to almost 50%, the data still showed that Parkdale was very much what it had always been: A haven for the vulnerable, reliant on the density of social services that had long clustered there. Nearly half of Parkdale\u2019s residents were seniors, living alone, often in the rooming houses now under threat of reinvestment and renovation.</p> <p>What the data didn\u2019t pick up was how the neighbourhood had changed on street level, and the three-year gap between then and now might as well be a lifetime. When Akelius, the Swedish real estate juggernaut with some $8bn in global assets settled its gaze on Toronto in 2011, Parkdale was a low-income immigrant neighbourhood. But it was no longer a bleak urban sinkhole. Thanks to the Tibetan community, and the hipster incursion that the Tibetans\u2019 stabilising presence had drawn, it was an opportunity.</p> <p>In 2012, the firm started acquiring mid and high rise concrete slab apartment buildings in Toronto; by 2016, it had amassed 37, and more than 3,000 apartment units. Many of them were along Jameson Avenue, which links Parkdale to the Gardiner Expressway, shuttling commuters to and from the city\u2019s core.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"139aa446c7655de98c9b26e75799a9ae11495ca3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/139aa446c7655de98c9b26e75799a9ae11495ca3/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Community anger is strong and has resulted in a number of protests and campaigns.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Community anger is strong and has resulted in a number of protests and campaigns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rene Johnston/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Akelius had already developed a successful business model in Sweden, Germany and the UK: identify neighbourhoods adjacent to fully gentrified districts \u2013 like Kreuzberg, a longstanding haven for Berlin\u2019s Turkish population \u2013 and exploit the undercapitalization of its rental housing.</p> <p>The company had identified a weakness in the city\u2019s rent control regulations, which typically tie annual rent increases to inflation, usually less than 2%. In its most recent annual report to investors, Akelius demonstrated its loophole: \u201cWhen properties are modernized, the rent for existing tenants can be increased by up to 9% above the guideline over a period of three years.\u201d By 2014, Akelius was improving things like lobbies and balconies, and serving large rent increases or eviction notices en masse. In 2015, when tenants, many of them Tibetan refugees, complained of back-to-back annual rent increases as much as five times higher than the provincial guideline, Akelius spokesman Ben Scott, in a statement to the Toronto Star, explained that the increases were intended to subsidize costs to the company from taxes, utilities and extensive renovations. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not \u2018how do we stop it'. It\u2019s \u2018how do we capture some of the benefits of the changes for people who live here now?'</p> <footer> <cite>Joshua Barndt, Parkdale land trust</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other landlords took Akelius as a model. MetCap Living, Parkdale\u2019s biggest landlord with more than 20 apartment buildings, was accused of starving out tenants in 2017 on unheeded maintenance requests and issuing heavy rent increases in an effort to drive out low income tenants and attract new ones. Current rents on new units are said to often be double those paid by longtime tenants. MetCap president Brent Merrill, also speaking to the Star, said he had made every effort to manage maintenance requests, including a tenant hotline.</p> <p>Tenants pushed back with a rent strike at 12 buildings. The conflict peaked when a video emerged of Merrill narrowly missing a protester with his pickup truck. Merrill told the Toronto Star he was rescuing a terrified property manager from an angry mob.</p> <p>When the strike stretched out over two months, the company agreed to reduce its above-guideline rent increases to the provincially-mandated levels.</p> <p>As the rental market tightened, the presence of private equity firms grew. Timbercreek, with $10bn in assets across North America, Europe and Asia, bought several Parkdale buildings in the fall of 2018, including the two hulking towers on West Lodge Avenue where Somasale grew up . Tenants there had endured semi-functional heat and hot water for years, as well as leaks, floods and pest infestations. Elevators in the two 19-storey towers were often out of service for weeks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d6bcd10793bf4b34637d5817c6d02312b1f0622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d6bcd10793bf4b34637d5817c6d02312b1f0622/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsering Dorjee a community volunteer in the Milky Way vegetable garden, created by a local land trust.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsering Dorjee a community volunteer in the Milky Way vegetable garden, created by a local land trust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vince Talotta/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the winter of 2019, tenants reported a rash of eviction notices. In March, dozens of hired a bus to take them to Timbercreek\u2019s corporate head office in Toronto to serve their new landlord with hundreds of maintenance requests and a notice of their own. In a video of the event, one of the protestors made clear their chief concern: that the company was taking people to the landlord-tenant tribunal to evict them, and that, internally, Timbercreek had likened tenant removal to \u201cputting a building through a car wash\u201d. \u201cThis is the dirt you\u2019re trying to wash away,\u201d the protestor continued, gesturing to her protest sign-holding neighbours. \u201cWe are here to put you on notice: You have no idea the neighbourhood you are messing with.\u201d</p> <p>Colleen Krempulec, Timbercreek\u2019s executive director of marketing told the Guardian that the company had evicted some tenants, usually for non-payment of rent, but the number was small: 17, in a property with more than 700 units. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not talking about a few weeks of arrears \u2014we\u2019re talking about months and months,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In the months that followed Timbercreek\u2019s acquistion, Krempulec said, the enormity of the maintenance challenge emerged. \u201cThese buildings were neglected for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say West Lodge was in the worst state of repair we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Since taking ownership, Krempulec said the company had worked through more than 2,500 tenant maintenance requests, and had replaced all eight of the buildings\u2019 elevators, as well as the heat and hot water systems.</p> <p>\u201cThe accusation that we\u2019re deferring maintenance to encourage people to leave \u2013 nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenging project, there is no doubt \u2013 more challenging than we had originally bargained for. But we\u2019re a long-term investor. We\u2019re not coming in to flip the property. We have a long-term horizon.\u201d</p> <p>In November 2019, Starlight \u2013 Blackstone\u2019s Canadian partner firm \u2013 found itself on now-familiar ground: tenants, angry at rent hikes they claimed were well above the guideline rate, occupied its head office with a stack of unheeded maintenance demands. For Katrina Potts, who led the protest, the gap between tenant and landlord was stark. \u201cThe office was all waterfalls and glass and luxury,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re arguing with them over $100, $200, $300 a month, and they\u2019ve just spent $1.72bn. You have to wonder if that\u2019s a war we can win.\u201d</p> <p>Parkdale, though, is not the kind of place where people give up. Tenant groups are organized and armed with legal aid, and new ideas incubate here among academics and activists. The pace of change, however, is something none seem able to solve. In 2010, Kuni Kamizaki, then a graduate student at the University of Toronto\u2019s urban planning department doing a placement at a community agency and social hub for Parkdale\u2019s low-income residents, developed an idea. He wanted to build a non-profit community land trust, in order to bank land and housing and rent it back to low-income residents at fixed rates below market value. Government had long-since abandoned building affordable housing itself, choosing instead to subsidize rent for qualified tenants in privately owned buildings. That meant public money was being used to pay off private mortgages, with nothing to show for it at the end. Wouldn\u2019t that money be better spent paying for a permanent community asset? Kamizaki thought so, and the trust was born.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/11/blind-spots-a-story-about-displacement-in-berlin-a-cartoon\">Blind spots: a story about displacement in Berlin \u2013\u00a0a cartoon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2010, its goals seemed reasonable. Land values were rising, but Parkdale\u2019s built-in buffers \u2013 the towers, a welter of social service agencies, dilapidated housing stock \u2013 made the pace seem manageable. There was time. When the trust finally secured seed funding and undertook a community-based planning initiative, it was 2015, and the landscape in Parkdale had shifted intensely. Akelius was ensconced; others had followed and were applying its techniques with ruthless efficiency. And no fewer than a dozen new luxury condo developments were on the horizon.</p> <p>\u201cEverything was just happening so, so fast,\u201d Kamizaki said. \u201cBig corporate investors were suddenly everywhere \u2013 how could we even start to grapple with that?\u201d</p> <p>The land trust is still up and running, and can claim some small victories: a community garden; 15 refreshed apartments it rents to vulnerable tenants at rates well below the market rate.</p> <p>Joshua Barndt, the trust\u2019s development coordinator, is clear-eyed about what the trust can achieve in this climate, and what it cannot. In the face of multi-billion dollar acquisitions, \u201cit\u2019s not \u2018how do we stop it\u2019\u201d, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018how do we capture some of the benefits of the changes for people who live here now?\u2019 How are we intentionally a part of it? Instead of being pushed down the river, how do we ride along with it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Many others are struggling to simply leave the river behind. On a bright day far from Parkdale, Somasale is haunted by a past to which she can no longer connect. \u201cFor my family, Parkdale wasn\u2019t a choice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was all we had. So it\u2019s hard to move on.. I don\u2019t feel like I can make it here in Toronto any more,\u201d she says, musing about new horizons \u2013 Montreal, maybe, where rent is lower. \u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d she says. \u201cParkdale will always feel like home, but it doesn\u2019t look like any home I ever knew anymore. My Parkdale is gone.\u201d</p> <p>For Somasale and thousands of others, the loss is absolute \u2013 a place knit into your psyche, torn out and walled off, forever. For the rest of us, the loss is more abstract: of a city we were foolish enough to believe was different, or better, that was more than land values and profit margins \u2013 that, against all reason and odds, worked. A city we dared to love, and believe in, never more to be.</p> <p><em>Murray Whyte, the long-time art critic at the Toronto Star, is now the art critic at the Boston Globe</em></p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion or catch up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">our best stories</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "By now, Michael Nguyen expects them: every month or so, someone representing one international real estate investment firm or another crosses the threshold of the Parkdale Intercultural Association, a non-profit immigrant settlement agency he runs on a busy stretch of Toronto\u2019s Queen Street West. \u201cIt\u2019s the same every time: Who owns the building? How do I get in touch with them? Do they want to sell?\u201d shrugged Nguyen, whose centre has been helping new immigrants adjust to Canadian life for decades. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate \u2014 the owner believes in what we do, so we feel safe. But you know the same questions are being asked of everyone all around here. And not everyone is going to say no.\u201d Toronto\u2019s much-vaunted international brand \u2013 the poster-child for extreme diversity, a global social experiment done right \u2013 has become a faded myth in many of its inner-city neighbourhoods. Property values have soared beyond the most fevered speculators\u2019 imagination, mostly relegating those representing Toronto\u2019s vast swaths of difference to the suburbs. Parkdale, however, an inner-city neighbourhood just six kilometres west of downtown along Lake Ontario\u2019s shore, has long been an outlier. As Nguyen spoke, runny-nosed toddlers fiddled with coloured blocks, while their parents, all recent immigrants, tried to focus on an English as a second language class. Outside, Queen Street bustled with an almost fairy-tale version of multicultural Toronto: Tibetan monks in flowing orange robes slipping into a flow of South Asian, Caribbean and African immigrants; a mom-and-pop grocer sells roasted barley, a favourite Tibetan snack; other restaurants offer roti, a Jamaican/Indian wrap that fuses the spicy flavours of both cultures. But the lively streetscape here masks a threat to what could very well be the last island of diversity in a city swamped by the flood waters of global capital. Huge international real estate investment firms have embedded themselves in Parkdale\u2019s urban fabric, buying dozens of apartment towers and thousands of rental units. Residents claim that threats, intimidation, rampant eviction notices and strategic neglect have become common. So too have tenant protests and rent strikes, where slick corporate offices find themselves occupied by hundreds of angry tenants demanding redress. Those protesting, however, are the lucky ones. In a city famous as a landing pad for immigrants, many recently-arrived residents, often without either English or an understanding of Canadian legal protections around tenancy, simply pack up and leave. \u201cGone are the days of the mom-and-pop slumlord, which was the dominant make-up of the rental housing market in Parkdale for years,\u201d says Cole Webber, a legal aid worker with the Parkdale Community Legal Services (PCLS), a provincially-funded agency for free legal services (which was itself evicted from its long-time Parkdale offices last year). \u201cThe fact of it is that the primary impediment for these corporations increasing their profits is the ongoing tenancy of working-class people who live in Parkdale. The only reason these companies bought these properties is so they can turn over the units. Period.\u201d Parkdale has become one of those neighbourhoods, following a familiar script. Inner-city working-class suburb, the last bastion of affordable rent, becomes popular with artists and students, who lend it a certain zeitgeisty sheen; property speculators follow; rent and property value increase; condos sprout like weeds; neighbourhood becomes a whitewashed nowhere, like so many before it: Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg, London\u2019s Hackney, Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg, San Francisco\u2019s Mission. Indeed, Akelius, the Swedish investment firm that now owns many thousands of apartment units throughout Europe, made that exact comparison about Parkdale in its most recent annual report. \u201cThere goes another community center,\u201d quipped the Instagram account @parkdalelife about an infamous all-night McDonald\u2019s being demolished to make way for a 700-plus unit luxury condo building, leeringly named \u201cXO.\u201d It was just the kind of hipster fatalism that infects neighbourhoods in the grips of late-stage gentrification. The McDonald\u2019s, at Parkdale\u2019s nexus of Dufferin and King Streets, had served as an informal refuge for Parkdale\u2019s legions of homeless and mentally ill for decade. And by the time blas\u00e9 youth in search of urban grit arrive just in time to become cheekily indignant about displacement, it\u2019s already far too late. From wealthy getaway to \u2018Crackdale\u2019 I lived in Parkdale\u2019s orbit for almost 20 years, first in the late 1990s on its eastern boundary, and then its west a decade later. The neighbourhood\u2019s infamous liquor store at Queen and Brock Streets was the only one I knew with a full-time police detail. Depending on the night, you could see a scuffle in the whiskey aisle, an arrest, or a fistfight or overdose in its parking lot; often, there would be a solicitation for a low-priced trick from one of the prostitutes who routinely patrolled its perimeter. Once, I was witness to a tooth being knocked out, one homeless man to another, over an allegedly stolen beer. (In one of the few good news stories to come out of Parkdale recently, the city is trying to acquire the site of the store, now closed, to build affordable housing.) In a country like Canada, where we speak smugly of social safety nets and institutionalized humanity, here was a place that made it feel like that was all talk. In the late 1990s, Parkdale could be chilling: group homes housed hundreds battling mental health and addiction issues; the less fortunate were left to the precarious realm of government rent subsidies and dilapidated, poorly-maintained rooming houses \u2013 or, just as often, the street. Along a deadened streetscape of mostly empty storefronts, drug deals happened in broad daylight, addicts raged and twitched, and Parkdale earned another name, Crackdale, day by day. It\u2019s not hard to see Parkdale as doomed from the start. It was built in the late 19th century as a summer refuge for the city\u2019s wealthy, with opulent brick mansions on a small bluff overlooking the water. Six kilometres from the smoky and bustling downtown, it was close enough for those with means to easily reach \u2013 and to keep those without away. In less than two decades, rapid industrialization clustering along the water\u2019s edge changed all that. Apartment houses were built to accommodate workers, many of them immigrants, for the nearby factories and abattoirs; hastily-sold grand Victorian homes were repurposed into multiple single-room dwellings. The decline of industry across North America in the 70s and 80s dealt Parkdale another blow, leaving the spartan workers\u2019 housing to rot. The nearby lake \u2013 now toxic \u2013 and the six-lane expressway, built in the 1950s along the shore, ensured its squalor. Around the same time, the province of Ontario deregulated mental health care and shut down psychiatric hospitals, releasing psychiatric patients to seek refuge in privately-run care homes; they found Parkdale\u2019s chopped-up manses ready to receive them. Over the years, poverty and marginalization became deeply embedded. Social service agencies clustered in Parkdale to serve a disempowered population, and, by their sheer density, drew more into the neighbourhood\u2019s orbit. Addiction made Parkdale a hotbed of a predatory illegal drug trade; prostitution became rampant. Concrete slab apartment towers, built as slum-remediation in the \u201curban renewal\u201d zeitgeist in the 50s and 60s, became vertical manifestations of the social ills they had been intended to erase. Drugs and crime settled into their concrete walls. Gentrification, on the surface, seemed less of a threat than an impossibility. As the rest of Toronto surged upward in the early 2000s, Parkdale was forever \u201cup and coming\u201d \u2013 real estate code for a litany of social ills \u2013 and a target for only the heartiest of speculators. Some did come, sprucing up half a block here, a cluster of houses there, but Toronto\u2019s real estate boom left Parkdale\u2019s intractable poverty largely intact. Saved by immigrants The people who did come were new immigrants and refugees, heading to the last inner-city refuge of low rent. The tower units were squalid but cheap. And slowly, the tide of crime and drugs began to recede. Thanks to a long-standing federal policy, Tibetan refugees fleeing persecution in China took particularly strong root through the 2000s and 2010s, opening restaurants and grocery stores along Queen Street. Immigrant groups had always filtered through Parkdale, finding their feet in a new country before moving on. But the Tibetans stayed, slowly transforming the broken and neglected district into a bright, vibrant family neighbourhood. Look at Google maps and you\u2019ll see \u201cLittle Tibet\u201d in the crook where Queen Street and Jameson meet. \u201cTibetans really broke the mould here,\u201d Webber said. \u201cThey turned the neighbourhood into their social and cultural hub. They\u2019re a stabilizing force, for sure.\u201d Approximately 8,000 Tibetans call Canada home, and more than 6,000 live in Toronto, the bulk of them in Parkdale. That makes the neighbourhood the largest Tibetan community outside the country\u2019s borders, though for how much longer is anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cAll my family and friends who are in Parkdale, they tell me about people coming to Canada and not able to find a place in their budget in Parkdale anymore,\u201d said Tenzin Tekan, one of Webber\u2019s colleagues at PCLS, who came to Canada in 2006 with her family. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be Little Tibet much longer. We\u2019re losing the community we built over years.\u201d A global issue Parkdale\u2019s burgeoning crisis isn\u2019t unique. Working class neighbourhoods in cosmopolitan cities all over the world have been transformed into urbane playgrounds for the moneyed set. And global investors muscling into the rental housing market is no Toronto phenomenon. After the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US cratered the property market there, note Canadian professors Martine August and Allan Walks, huge swaths of rental housing were acquired by investment firms willing and able to wait out the market dip to recapitalize on the rent gap as the economy recovered. Last year, one of them, Blackstone, an international private equity firm that the UN recently accused of \u201cwreaking havoc\u201d on the global affordable housing market with \u201caggressive evictions\u201d of low and middle income tenants, recently entered an acquisition deal with the Toronto-based firm Starlight Investments. In the fall, Starlight bought a $1.72bn (\u00a31bn) portfolio of apartment towers; one of the largest is in Parkdale. It\u2019s a narrative of numbing sameness from which no city \u2013 no desirable city, at least \u2013 is immune. But things were supposed to be different here. As Manhattan became a mall for the global elite, and as San Francisco\u2019s homeless population climbed into the thousands, Torontonians like me were smug civic boosters of our anomaly status. Here we were, a big city that worked, where different kinds of people could choose \u2013 and afford \u2013 to live shoulder to shoulder and be better for it. And for a moment, it was true. But capital moves quickly, and policy much less so. In less than two decades, housing prices in Toronto doubled, then trebled, then quadrupled: the average price of a single-family home went from $251,267 in January 2000 to $1,044,527 in late 2018. Toronto, a fabled city of immigrants, was fast becoming something else entirely. Whole immigrant communities who had gained a toehold in the city\u2019s core were selling high and decamping for the suburbs, which is where the city\u2019s vaunted diversity now lives. Real estate became a bloodsport, and Parkdale became convenient hyperbole for last-resort gentrification narratives. \u201cWe Bought a Crackhouse\u201d read the headline of an infamous 2017 story in Toronto Life magazine, about a young family\u2019s Parkdale renovation journey that included moving on the addicts splayed unconscious in the basement. The story tore open a gash in an urban skin already rubbed raw with rising inequity. The backlash was intense, vicious and unrelenting. It became an emblematic tale of the city\u2019s escalating class war, pushed past the point of no return. Rising property values have brought about a full-blown housing crisis on all fronts. 8,700 people in Toronto are homeless; 100 now die on the streets each year. The waiting list for social housing sits at 98,000. Residential rents, even in a rent-controlled environment, have more than doubled in three years, according to the research firm UrbaNation. Vacancy hovers at 1%. And Parkdale is the last chapter of an urban narrative fast fading into myth. \u201cI used to say, in a kind of flip way, that I gave up on the inner city years ago,\u201d says Deborah Cowen, a professor of geography who studies cities and social justice at the University of Toronto. Cowen lived in Parkdale in the 90s, when it was bottoming out. Even then, she says, you could see subtle pressures of gentrification building. \u201cIn terms of being homogenous, predictable, corporate and maybe even securitized \u2014 that certainly seems like the fate of Toronto, and without some kind of dramatic change, it will be.\u201d How dramatic? Just last month, Cowen says, the city announced a $24bn affordable housing strategy with provincial and federal support. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced even that is enough to effect the change we need,\u201d she says. Bureaucracies walk, while capital sprints: by the time anything gets built \u2013 eight to 10 years from now, or more \u2013 \u201cwhat kind of city will be left to save?\u201d \u2018Vegandale\u2019: a step too far? Nerupa Somasale doesn\u2019t need academic studies or government statistics to understand what she\u2019s lost. Somasale, 23, bright and articulate with an engaging laugh in many ways epitomises Toronto\u2019s global brand of harmonious multiculturalism. In the 1990s, her mother, from the Philippines, landed in Parkdale where she met Somasale\u2019s father, a refugee from India. \u201cOh my God, I hate that. I hate it so much,\u201d Somasale says, when I ask her about the city\u2019s rosy reputation. \u201cThis whole idea of multiculturalism, diversity \u2013 it\u2019s still used as something we should be proud of. But it suggests equity, like we all have a stake. It\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s branding for politicians and for tourists, nothing more.\u201d Somasale, an undergraduate student in her final year of history and curatorial studies at Ryerson University, was born on the 19th floor of the building at 103 West Lodge Avenue in Parkdale \u2013 where recently the elevators stopped working, prompting raucous protest at the landlord\u2019s offices over its alleged mass-eviction campaign. For better or worse, Parkdale has always been her home: through the 90s, when the crack trade was brisk and relentless; through the 2000s, when adventurous urbanites were drawn further westward to a growing array of nightclubs and late-night restaurants; and finally the last decade, where change was inflicted most visibly by a particularly aggressive corporate newcomer that saw the opportunity to craft a new identity for Parkdale entirely. It started in 2016, when an outpost of the Los Angeles vegan restaurant Doomie\u2019s opened on Queen Street, swiftly followed by a non-dairy ice cream shop and a lifestyle boutique. Last year, 5700, which owned all these ventures, announced it was \u201crebranding\u201d the neighbourhood \u201cVegandale,\u201d with a slate of international food events under that banner. \u201cVegandale,\u201d to many, was the same brutal invasion at street-level that was happening in the towers just a few blocks away. \u201cIt was a really tumultuous moment, like everything that had been happening here the past few years just burst out on to the street,\u201d Somasale said. It shifted things for her. She became more engaged in activist efforts, more involved in the protest movement. \u201cIt was an erasure of history, and an intentional one,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted to change a chunk of the neighbourhood in a way that didn\u2019t benefit anybody that had lived here for years. It had that feeling: \u2018There\u2019s nothing here, so let\u2019s just make it into whatever we want.\u2019\u201d There is, of course, a great deal here, which makes Parkdale\u2019s quick transformation so alarming. But for Somasale, there\u2019s little reason for hope. \u201cHalf the people I grew up with, whether they were my age or they were family members that were much older who had lived there for decades, have been displaced,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause they can\u2019t afford it \u2013 me included.\u201d On a bright, early autumn day, Somasale asked that we meet in Kensington Market, a vibrant, ramshackle cluster of Victorian houses converted into cafes, fruit stands and vintage shops on the western fringe of Toronto\u2019s downtown. Earlier this year, Somasale left her lifelong home, finally broken by non-functional elevators, floods and the enveloping chaos of the landlord-tenant war. In Kensington, she shares a one bedroom apartment with two friends \u2013 there is no escaping Toronto\u2019s merciless rental rates. \u201cI wanted so, so badly to stay in the neighbourhood. I looked for a year-and-a-half. It was like a horror story. For $600, I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw. It was disgusting, terrifying. But they\u2019d get away with it because someone would be desperate.\u201d She sighs. \u201cI have a weird relationship to this feeling of home, because I can\u2019t even live there,\u201d she says. \u201cI visit every other week. But it changes so fast. It feels like neighbourhood amnesia.\u201d A haven for the vulnerable? By 2016, the last time the Canadian government collected census data, on paper, Parkdale had changed little: Almost 90% of its residents were renters, versus less than half for the city as a whole, making its 35,000 people more vulnerable to rental market swings than anywhere else. More than a third lived below the poverty line, 50% more than the broader city. While the immigrant population had grown to almost 50%, the data still showed that Parkdale was very much what it had always been: A haven for the vulnerable, reliant on the density of social services that had long clustered there. Nearly half of Parkdale\u2019s residents were seniors, living alone, often in the rooming houses now under threat of reinvestment and renovation. What the data didn\u2019t pick up was how the neighbourhood had changed on street level, and the three-year gap between then and now might as well be a lifetime. When Akelius, the Swedish real estate juggernaut with some $8bn in global assets settled its gaze on Toronto in 2011, Parkdale was a low-income immigrant neighbourhood. But it was no longer a bleak urban sinkhole. Thanks to the Tibetan community, and the hipster incursion that the Tibetans\u2019 stabilising presence had drawn, it was an opportunity. In 2012, the firm started acquiring mid and high rise concrete slab apartment buildings in Toronto; by 2016, it had amassed 37, and more than 3,000 apartment units. Many of them were along Jameson Avenue, which links Parkdale to the Gardiner Expressway, shuttling commuters to and from the city\u2019s core. Akelius had already developed a successful business model in Sweden, Germany and the UK: identify neighbourhoods adjacent to fully gentrified districts \u2013 like Kreuzberg, a longstanding haven for Berlin\u2019s Turkish population \u2013 and exploit the undercapitalization of its rental housing. The company had identified a weakness in the city\u2019s rent control regulations, which typically tie annual rent increases to inflation, usually less than 2%. In its most recent annual report to investors, Akelius demonstrated its loophole: \u201cWhen properties are modernized, the rent for existing tenants can be increased by up to 9% above the guideline over a period of three years.\u201d By 2014, Akelius was improving things like lobbies and balconies, and serving large rent increases or eviction notices en masse. In 2015, when tenants, many of them Tibetan refugees, complained of back-to-back annual rent increases as much as five times higher than the provincial guideline, Akelius spokesman Ben Scott, in a statement to the Toronto Star, explained that the increases were intended to subsidize costs to the company from taxes, utilities and extensive renovations. Other landlords took Akelius as a model. MetCap Living, Parkdale\u2019s biggest landlord with more than 20 apartment buildings, was accused of starving out tenants in 2017 on unheeded maintenance requests and issuing heavy rent increases in an effort to drive out low income tenants and attract new ones. Current rents on new units are said to often be double those paid by longtime tenants. MetCap president Brent Merrill, also speaking to the Star, said he had made every effort to manage maintenance requests, including a tenant hotline. Tenants pushed back with a rent strike at 12 buildings. The conflict peaked when a video emerged of Merrill narrowly missing a protester with his pickup truck. Merrill told the Toronto Star he was rescuing a terrified property manager from an angry mob. When the strike stretched out over two months, the company agreed to reduce its above-guideline rent increases to the provincially-mandated levels. As the rental market tightened, the presence of private equity firms grew. Timbercreek, with $10bn in assets across North America, Europe and Asia, bought several Parkdale buildings in the fall of 2018, including the two hulking towers on West Lodge Avenue where Somasale grew up . Tenants there had endured semi-functional heat and hot water for years, as well as leaks, floods and pest infestations. Elevators in the two 19-storey towers were often out of service for weeks. By the winter of 2019, tenants reported a rash of eviction notices. In March, dozens of hired a bus to take them to Timbercreek\u2019s corporate head office in Toronto to serve their new landlord with hundreds of maintenance requests and a notice of their own. In a video of the event, one of the protestors made clear their chief concern: that the company was taking people to the landlord-tenant tribunal to evict them, and that, internally, Timbercreek had likened tenant removal to \u201cputting a building through a car wash\u201d. \u201cThis is the dirt you\u2019re trying to wash away,\u201d the protestor continued, gesturing to her protest sign-holding neighbours. \u201cWe are here to put you on notice: You have no idea the neighbourhood you are messing with.\u201d Colleen Krempulec, Timbercreek\u2019s executive director of marketing told the Guardian that the company had evicted some tenants, usually for non-payment of rent, but the number was small: 17, in a property with more than 700 units. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not talking about a few weeks of arrears \u2014we\u2019re talking about months and months,\u201d she said. In the months that followed Timbercreek\u2019s acquistion, Krempulec said, the enormity of the maintenance challenge emerged. \u201cThese buildings were neglected for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say West Lodge was in the worst state of repair we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Since taking ownership, Krempulec said the company had worked through more than 2,500 tenant maintenance requests, and had replaced all eight of the buildings\u2019 elevators, as well as the heat and hot water systems. \u201cThe accusation that we\u2019re deferring maintenance to encourage people to leave \u2013 nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenging project, there is no doubt \u2013 more challenging than we had originally bargained for. But we\u2019re a long-term investor. We\u2019re not coming in to flip the property. We have a long-term horizon.\u201d In November 2019, Starlight \u2013 Blackstone\u2019s Canadian partner firm \u2013 found itself on now-familiar ground: tenants, angry at rent hikes they claimed were well above the guideline rate, occupied its head office with a stack of unheeded maintenance demands. For Katrina Potts, who led the protest, the gap between tenant and landlord was stark. \u201cThe office was all waterfalls and glass and luxury,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re arguing with them over $100, $200, $300 a month, and they\u2019ve just spent $1.72bn. You have to wonder if that\u2019s a war we can win.\u201d Parkdale, though, is not the kind of place where people give up. Tenant groups are organized and armed with legal aid, and new ideas incubate here among academics and activists. The pace of change, however, is something none seem able to solve. In 2010, Kuni Kamizaki, then a graduate student at the University of Toronto\u2019s urban planning department doing a placement at a community agency and social hub for Parkdale\u2019s low-income residents, developed an idea. He wanted to build a non-profit community land trust, in order to bank land and housing and rent it back to low-income residents at fixed rates below market value. Government had long-since abandoned building affordable housing itself, choosing instead to subsidize rent for qualified tenants in privately owned buildings. That meant public money was being used to pay off private mortgages, with nothing to show for it at the end. Wouldn\u2019t that money be better spent paying for a permanent community asset? Kamizaki thought so, and the trust was born. In 2010, its goals seemed reasonable. Land values were rising, but Parkdale\u2019s built-in buffers \u2013 the towers, a welter of social service agencies, dilapidated housing stock \u2013 made the pace seem manageable. There was time. When the trust finally secured seed funding and undertook a community-based planning initiative, it was 2015, and the landscape in Parkdale had shifted intensely. Akelius was ensconced; others had followed and were applying its techniques with ruthless efficiency. And no fewer than a dozen new luxury condo developments were on the horizon. \u201cEverything was just happening so, so fast,\u201d Kamizaki said. \u201cBig corporate investors were suddenly everywhere \u2013 how could we even start to grapple with that?\u201d The land trust is still up and running, and can claim some small victories: a community garden; 15 refreshed apartments it rents to vulnerable tenants at rates well below the market rate. Joshua Barndt, the trust\u2019s development coordinator, is clear-eyed about what the trust can achieve in this climate, and what it cannot. In the face of multi-billion dollar acquisitions, \u201cit\u2019s not \u2018how do we stop it\u2019\u201d, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018how do we capture some of the benefits of the changes for people who live here now?\u2019 How are we intentionally a part of it? Instead of being pushed down the river, how do we ride along with it?\u2019\u201d Many others are struggling to simply leave the river behind. On a bright day far from Parkdale, Somasale is haunted by a past to which she can no longer connect. \u201cFor my family, Parkdale wasn\u2019t a choice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was all we had. So it\u2019s hard to move on.. I don\u2019t feel like I can make it here in Toronto any more,\u201d she says, musing about new horizons \u2013 Montreal, maybe, where rent is lower. \u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d she says. \u201cParkdale will always feel like home, but it doesn\u2019t look like any home I ever knew anymore. My Parkdale is gone.\u201d For Somasale and thousands of others, the loss is absolute \u2013 a place knit into your psyche, torn out and walled off, forever. For the rest of us, the loss is more abstract: of a city we were foolish enough to believe was different, or better, that was more than land values and profit margins \u2013 that, against all reason and odds, worked. A city we dared to love, and believe in, never more to be.

The presenter denies the allegations. His lawyer told Die Zeit that his client \u201cwould like to repeat that he never molested anyone or would molest them.

The manager did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.</p> <p>George Walden, a contracted journalist at Deutsche Welle, described other examples of racism and bullying in a letter to DW management seen by the Guardian. He claimed that another presenter was verbally abusive to staff, and was only forced to leave, in 2018, after Walden brought the issue to senior managers and threatened to speak to the media about the issue. Another staff member claims 15 other complaints against this presenter were not examined.</p> <p>\u201cOn my first day, there was an intern sitting at the desk, and the presenter turned to the intern and said \u2018why the fuck are you sitting there\u2019 and \u2018get the fuck out of my seat\u2019 with management present,\u201d Walden said. \u201cIt was absolute chaos.\u201d</p> <p>This presenter, who was appointed to train Walden, \u201cconstantly abused me with verbal threats, F-bombs, and berated me in public for just asking questions concerning what I was there to learn,\u201d said Walden. \u201cHe thrived on an air of intimidation which you [the network] allowed to happen in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>He and other members of staff accused the presenter of being antisemitic.

We made the subject a top priority. We invited everyone to talk about having zero tolerance not only regarding sexual harassment but to any abuse of power. We followed up every allegation that was made, some of which were critical and serious.\u201d</p> <p>Jumpelt added: \u201cBut we are aware and need to be careful that it doesn\u2019t lead to a campaign which colleagues use as an excuse for personal vendettas against each other. We are in a German legal context, and to be honest, first you have to prove that there\u2019s something to an allegation. False allegations can easily be made. We cannot terminate contracts on the basis of allegations. We need to prove it and make sure there is a fair process.\u201d</p> <p>Deutsche Welle denies the party was held for the presenter accused of rape, saying it was to \u201cmark the conclusion of production of that particular show\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a wrap-up party after two and a half years for that show, not a farewell party to anybody,\u201d Jumpelt said. At the party, \u201cthe presenter and his team were thanked for their work because they had done good work\u201d.</p> <p>Asked about the presenter accused of using antisemitic insults, Jumpelt said: \u201cWe cannot comment on individual cases due to the protection of personal rights. We can only say that the freelancer mentioned no longer works for us. Our HR department makes use of the full range of labour law tools, including warning letters and termination without notice, if necessary. In cases when we conclude that we may be faced with a serious problem, we initiate an intensive dialogue and workshops with the department, highlighting the importance of a respectful and appreciative working environment and raising employee awareness of all forms of potential misconduct. This is what we have initiated in the sports section.\u201d</p> <p>Jumpelt said the company had implemented workshops to address what they claim are isolated incidents of interpersonal conflict, but staff claim the management team has repeatedly overlooked abuses of power.</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest in a big organisation like ours \u2013 with 3,000 workers, 1,500 of them on fixed-term [staff] contracts, the others on freelance employee contracts from 60 different nations \u2013 problems can happen, but we are dealing with all of them,\u201d Jumpelt said.</p> <p>Ver.di, the union representing media workers, told the Guardian that staff who had reported abusive behaviour had suffered reprisals.</p> <p>\u201cSadly we had to discover that colleagues who came forward and revealed abusive behaviour, now are being disparaged and intimidated,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cIn one particular case, this led to one colleague\u2019s termination.\u201d</p> <p>The union spokesperson added: \u201cAt least one editorial department is ruled by a climate of fear.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2020 to more accurately describe some of the locations where racist incidents were alleged to have occurred. It was further amended on 24 January 2020 to clarify that the matters referred to in this report were alleged to have taken place in 2018 and to remove a description of the management team as \u201call-white, all male\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Additional reporting by Kate Connolly and Chavala Madlena.

Ver.di, the union representing media workers, told the Guardian that staff who had reported abusive behaviour had suffered reprisals. \u201cSadly we had to discover that colleagues who came forward and revealed abusive behaviour, now are being disparaged and intimidated,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cIn one particular case, this led to one colleague\u2019s termination.\u201d The union spokesperson added: \u201cAt least one editorial department is ruled by a climate of fear.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2020 to more accurately describe some of the locations where racist incidents were alleged to have occurred. It was further amended on 24 January 2020 to clarify that the matters referred to in this report were alleged to have taken place in 2018 and to remove a description of the management team as \u201call-white, all male\u201d.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The country\u2019s tourism industry has also been affected by the crisis. Tourism Australia was forced to withdraw an advertising campaign featuring Kylie Minogue. <a href=\"https://www.2gb.com/disappointing-tourists-drop-aussie-destinations-untouched-by-bushfires/\">Speaking to radio station 2GB</a>, the tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, said: \u201cI have anecdotal evidence from right across the country of cancellations, and that\u2019s disappointing, annoying, frustrating.\u201d</p> \n<p>According to Dean Stewart, senior forecaster for the Bureau of Meteorology, the south-west winds on Wednesday should start lifting the smoke haze but could also bring sporadic thunderstorms.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cAmerica will not see herself in full\u201d when the seventh Democratic debate takes place in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday night, Deval Patrick said, citing an absence of candidates of colour. The former governor of Massachusetts is the only African American candidate left in the primary, after the New Jersey senator Cory Booker withdrew on Monday. Patrick entered late and remains well off the pace in both poll results and donations, criteria used by the Democratic National Committee to determine debate qualification. On Monday, he responded to Booker\u2019s departure by tweeting: \u201cWhether it\u2019s behind closed doors or screaming it from the rooftops \u2013 every candidate in this race needs to say it out loud: women and people of colour can win. To say otherwise expresses a lack of faith in the American people who deserve more from their leaders.\u201d In a statement on Tuesday, Patrick slammed the debates as \u201can episode of reality TV\u201d divorced from the concerns of everyday Americans, particularly the impact of racism. \u201cThe debates have become an end in themselves,\u201d he said, \u201can episode of reality TV with candidates paying more attention to polling numbers and donations than issues and people.\u201d The debate in Iowa on Tuesday night will be contested by former vice-president Joe Biden; Vermont senator Bernie Sanders; Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren; Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar; former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg; and Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge fund founder and climate activist. Patrick said those who would debate were all \u201cremarkable public servants. Yet tonight, America will not see herself in full. \u201cThe racial and ethnic diversity of the Democratic field and our willingness to speak directly to issues of racism, has made me proud to be a Democrat and an American. But the debates have stopped either showcasing the field or representing the nation.\u201d Booker followed the California senator Kamala Harris and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro in dropping out of the race. Booker and Castro failed to qualify to appear in later contests. Patrick said \u201cit concerns me that not being on the debate stage has contributed to that\u201d. Criticism of the Democratic field for being too white has been widespread, particularly since the downfall of Harris, who showed strongly after challenging Biden on racial issues in an early debate but could not build on her place in the polls. \u201cIt\u2019s galling for people that are on the stage to not acknowledge and speak to black women\u2019s issues,\u201d Aimee Allison, founder and president of She the People, told the Guardian after Harris withdrew. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a black woman like Kamala Harris to carry issues important to us. But you do need to acknowledge you\u2019re not going to get anywhere without our vote.\u201d Patrick echoed that concern, saying Democrats could not beat Donald Trump in November \u201cwithout voters of colour, nor should we\u201d. Among black Democratic voters, Biden, boosted by his eight years as vice-president to Barack Obama, holds a strong national lead over Sanders. Patrick cited key issues to voters of colour including environmental justice, gun safety, health disparities and mass incarceration. None of the candidates onstage in Iowa, he added, \u201cknows what it\u2019s like to fear for their safety when pulled over for a routine traffic stop. \u201cNo one on that stage has ever been questioned about their citizenship or if they\u2019re a \u2018real\u2019 American or been followed by store security when shopping. No one has ever asked themselves whether a rejection for an apartment or a loan was because of their race \u2026 \u201cSurely the leadership of the Democratic party must now see that the criteria chosen have not served to demonstrate to Democratic voters or to the nation the breadth and depth of diverse talent in the field, and must reconsider the criteria for participating in, as well as the format for, future debates.\u201d",

However, the green toothpaste, which is on sale in Waitrose and Boots, comes at a high price. At \u00a35 for 75ml, Smile for Goods costs more than six times as much as a regular tube of Colgate. Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s chief executive, Noel Wallace, said: \u201cColgate wants to make tubes a part of the circular economy by keeping this plastic productive and eliminating waste. If we can standardise recyclable tubes among all companies, we all win. We can align on these common standards for tubes and still compete with what\u2019s inside them.\u201d Colgate has also taken the unusual step of listing the toothpaste\u2019s ingredients on the tube alongside a simple explanation of their function. Consumers trying to buy greener products were confused by the role of the various ingredients, the company said. While the role of fluoride is probably well understood, the tube explains that silica cleans and polishes while glycerin prevents the paste from drying out. As concern grows about the impact of single-use plastic on the environment, manufacturers and retailers have begun to tackle their substantial footprints. Colgate-Palmolive, which also owns the Palmolive and Sanex brands, has said the packaging on all its products will be 100% recyclable by 2025. Last year Unilever said it would halve its use of virgin plastic by creating greener versions of its household products, a shift that could make shampoo refill stations, cardboard deodorant sticks and toothpaste tablets the norm in supermarkets.",

      "body": "<p>We hunger for happiness in queer stories. Many critically acclaimed novels about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/lgbt-rights\">LGBTQ life</a> have explored and challenged homophobia: James Baldwin\u2019s Giovanni\u2019s Room, Alice Walker\u2019s The Color Purple, and Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s The Swimming-Pool Library are all classics, with more recent examples including 2019\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/14/on-earth-we-are-briefly-gorgeous-ocean-vuong-review\">On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous</a><em> </em>by Ocean Vuong and I Wish You All the Best by Mason Deaver. There are moments of joy in all of these books, but undeniably queerness is paired with homophobia. Now, though, a new spate of science-fiction and fantasy novels are quietly and gracefully opting instead to imagine worlds where homophobia does not exist.</p> <p>Fantasy\u2019s default mode still tends to be a faux-medieval past matched with archaic sexual and social codes, while sci-fi authors often imagine brave new worlds where a man will happily have sex with an alien, but not another man. However, many writers are solving one of the largest blocks for queer romance by simply doing away with homophobia in their fictional universes. In 2019 alone, we had Ann Leckie\u2019s The Raven Tower, with a trans protagonist whose trans-ness is interrogated as important but not other; Tamsyn Muir\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/755170550/smart-snarky-gideon-the-ninth-swears-her-way-through-the-stars\">Gideon the Ninth</a>, starring the best cast of lesbians the world has ever seen; Arkady Martine\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/arkady-martine/a-memory-called-empire/9781529001570\">A Memory Called Empire</a>, which makes space in its epic sci-fi plot for a romance between two women; and Jennifer Giesbrecht\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2019/09/24/book-reviews-the-monster-of-elendhaven-by-jennifer-giesbrecht/\">The Monster</a><a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2019/09/24/book-reviews-the-monster-of-elendhaven-by-jennifer-giesbrecht/\"> of Elendhaven</a>, in which the central gay couple break every norm \u2013 except their universe\u2019s rules on sexuality, because there aren\u2019t any.</p> <p>And more will come this year: 2020 promises AK Larkwood\u2019s The Unspoken Name, with a sweetly deadpan queer orc heroine Csorwe, and the second novel in Muir\u2019s trilogy, Harrow the Ninth, which somehow manages to get even gayer. And 2021 will see the launch of bestselling Captive Prince author CS Pacat\u2019s new YA trilogy, set in a version of Victorian England where queerness is just as accepted as heterosexuality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A fantasy editor said, \u2018I love this book, but in order for me to publish it in my line, Alec has to be a girl.\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Ellen Kushner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This burst of bigotry-free universes hasn\u2019t come from nowhere. Malinda Lo published Ash, a YA lesbian retelling of Cinderella with a happy-ever-after, in 2009. Two decades before that was Ellen Kushner\u2019s Swordspoint, set in a universe where everybody is bisexual. Bisexuality-as-norm is a common feature in Jacqueline Carey\u2019s Kushiel\u2019s Legacy series, which began in 2001 and took as its internal motto \u201cLove as thou wilt\u201d, and, since 2010, NK Jemisin\u2019s work has consistently featured queer characters in universes with shifting norms around sexuality. And that\u2019s just western media: in Japan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/05/boys-love-to-pokemon-british-museum-host-major-show-manga\">yaoi manga</a><em> </em>set in queer-normative universes have been common since the 70s.</p> <p>These books may look good in a list, but they were few and far between. For the authors, finding publishers was often a struggle. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d Kushner says now of selling Swordspoint. \u201cIt was terribly hard to get it published. A very good friend of mine who was a fantasy editor said, \u2018I love this book, but in order for me to publish it in my line, you have to put magic in \u2026 and I think Alec has to be a girl.\u2019\u201d Kushner fought back and eventually found a publisher who would accept the manuscript as it stood. Others weren\u2019t so lucky; many queer characters metamorphosed into heterosexuals or had their sexuality relegated to subtext.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up reading fantasy novels in which there were few or no queer characters,\u201d says Pacat. \u201cThose that we had were often hidden, coded and subtextual. If they were explicit they always had the same quote-unquote gay storyline, which was, \u2018I come out, I face an enormous amount of oppressive backlash, I\u2019m forced to live my life on the fringes of social acceptability, until at the end I die tragically.\u2019 It\u2019s as though discrimination is just a fact of queerness that can\u2019t be separated from it. It\u2019s trans-historic, it\u2019s trans-cultural, and now it\u2019s even across fantasy worlds.\u201d</p> <p>Captive Prince, which began as a self-published online serial in 2013 and was picked up by Penguin Random House in 2015, was one of the tipping points for this rise of queer-normative fantasy universes. With its heavy emphasis on warring kingdoms and court politics, the trilogy had common ground with Game of Thrones. In other ways, it was revolutionary, with a gay male romance at its centre that was questioned in just about every way except on the basis of it being gay. Sexuality in Captive Prince was complicated and restricted, just as it is in our world; it offered different versions of sexuality across different cultures (including one where extramarital heterosexual sex was taboo, for fear of children born outside marriage), but it removed the automatic assumption that queerness in itself would be stigmatised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"906b3513bf521df5a5300169e3c352c07a416e94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/906b3513bf521df5a5300169e3c352c07a416e94/0_28_1600_2000/800.jpg\" alt=\"CS Pacat, author of Captive Prince books.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CS Pacat, author of the Captive Prince books.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alise Black</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point I yearn for,\u201d Pacat says, \u201cwhere if you have a queer character they could have a romance narrative where [their queerness] is not the romantic obstacle. They could have a more exciting obstacle, like, \u2018You killed my brother but I\u2019m falling in love with you\u2019,\u201d she laughs, describing Captive Prince. \u201cOr a mystery detective narrative.

If I\u2019m telling my young adult reader, \u2018you can travel back into the past on this passport of your young adulthood and believe that you, as a young adult, could have existed in this setting\u2019, then why would I close the door to a queer person and say, \u2018but <em>you </em>cannot travel there\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Once they removed homophobia, the authors I speak to express a sense of relief and freedom in what they can now do with their stories and characters. \u201cIt was intuitive,\u201d Kushner says, while Pacat describes writing within a queer-normative universe as a \u201cwondrous, free land where my imagination could just go wild\u201d.</p> <p>Muir says of Gideon the Ninth, which is part space opera, part murder mystery and part quest narrative: \u201cI wanted my lesbians to be completely [unaware] of homophobia.\u201d (She says she \u201cset out to write lesbian epic\u201d.) There are nearly a dozen major female characters and though the action centres on Gideon and Harrow, who merrily hate-flirt their way through the novel, it\u2019s hard to think of one woman in Gideon who isn\u2019t queer \u2013 and completely unconcerned about it. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could have written Gideon <em>qua </em>Gideon as someone who was raised within a breath of homophobia. I mean, she\u2019s such a dickhead.\u201d</p> <p>Readers have met these queer universes with such joy that it\u2019s unsurprising to find commercial publishing embracing them, too.

It was a miserable thought at the time, but then I got bought by Tor.com Publishing and realised they were just going to go full-steam-ahead lesbian.

      "bodyText": "We hunger for happiness in queer stories. Many critically acclaimed novels about LGBTQ life have explored and challenged homophobia: James Baldwin\u2019s Giovanni\u2019s Room, Alice Walker\u2019s The Color Purple, and Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s The Swimming-Pool Library are all classics, with more recent examples including 2019\u2019s On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong and I Wish You All the Best by Mason Deaver. There are moments of joy in all of these books, but undeniably queerness is paired with homophobia. Now, though, a new spate of science-fiction and fantasy novels are quietly and gracefully opting instead to imagine worlds where homophobia does not exist. Fantasy\u2019s default mode still tends to be a faux-medieval past matched with archaic sexual and social codes, while sci-fi authors often imagine brave new worlds where a man will happily have sex with an alien, but not another man. However, many writers are solving one of the largest blocks for queer romance by simply doing away with homophobia in their fictional universes. In 2019 alone, we had Ann Leckie\u2019s The Raven Tower, with a trans protagonist whose trans-ness is interrogated as important but not other; Tamsyn Muir\u2019s Gideon the Ninth, starring the best cast of lesbians the world has ever seen; Arkady Martine\u2019s A Memory Called Empire, which makes space in its epic sci-fi plot for a romance between two women; and Jennifer Giesbrecht\u2019s The Monster of Elendhaven, in which the central gay couple break every norm \u2013 except their universe\u2019s rules on sexuality, because there aren\u2019t any. And more will come this year: 2020 promises AK Larkwood\u2019s The Unspoken Name, with a sweetly deadpan queer orc heroine Csorwe, and the second novel in Muir\u2019s trilogy, Harrow the Ninth, which somehow manages to get even gayer. And 2021 will see the launch of bestselling Captive Prince author CS Pacat\u2019s new YA trilogy, set in a version of Victorian England where queerness is just as accepted as heterosexuality. This burst of bigotry-free universes hasn\u2019t come from nowhere. Malinda Lo published Ash, a YA lesbian retelling of Cinderella with a happy-ever-after, in 2009. Two decades before that was Ellen Kushner\u2019s Swordspoint, set in a universe where everybody is bisexual. Bisexuality-as-norm is a common feature in Jacqueline Carey\u2019s Kushiel\u2019s Legacy series, which began in 2001 and took as its internal motto \u201cLove as thou wilt\u201d, and, since 2010, NK Jemisin\u2019s work has consistently featured queer characters in universes with shifting norms around sexuality. And that\u2019s just western media: in Japan, yaoi manga set in queer-normative universes have been common since the 70s. These books may look good in a list, but they were few and far between. For the authors, finding publishers was often a struggle. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d Kushner says now of selling Swordspoint. \u201cIt was terribly hard to get it published. A very good friend of mine who was a fantasy editor said, \u2018I love this book, but in order for me to publish it in my line, you have to put magic in \u2026 and I think Alec has to be a girl.\u2019\u201d Kushner fought back and eventually found a publisher who would accept the manuscript as it stood. Others weren\u2019t so lucky; many queer characters metamorphosed into heterosexuals or had their sexuality relegated to subtext. \u201cI grew up reading fantasy novels in which there were few or no queer characters,\u201d says Pacat. \u201cThose that we had were often hidden, coded and subtextual. If they were explicit they always had the same quote-unquote gay storyline, which was, \u2018I come out, I face an enormous amount of oppressive backlash, I\u2019m forced to live my life on the fringes of social acceptability, until at the end I die tragically.\u2019 It\u2019s as though discrimination is just a fact of queerness that can\u2019t be separated from it. It\u2019s trans-historic, it\u2019s trans-cultural, and now it\u2019s even across fantasy worlds.\u201d Captive Prince, which began as a self-published online serial in 2013 and was picked up by Penguin Random House in 2015, was one of the tipping points for this rise of queer-normative fantasy universes. With its heavy emphasis on warring kingdoms and court politics, the trilogy had common ground with Game of Thrones. In other ways, it was revolutionary, with a gay male romance at its centre that was questioned in just about every way except on the basis of it being gay. Sexuality in Captive Prince was complicated and restricted, just as it is in our world; it offered different versions of sexuality across different cultures (including one where extramarital heterosexual sex was taboo, for fear of children born outside marriage), but it removed the automatic assumption that queerness in itself would be stigmatised. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point I yearn for,\u201d Pacat says, \u201cwhere if you have a queer character they could have a romance narrative where [their queerness] is not the romantic obstacle. They could have a more exciting obstacle, like, \u2018You killed my brother but I\u2019m falling in love with you\u2019,\u201d she laughs, describing Captive Prince. \u201cOr a mystery detective narrative. Or a hero\u2019s journey.\u201d Pacat\u2019s next series, Dark Rise, is a YA fantasy set in a version of our historical past, but where queer relationships are freely accepted. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a young adult in Victorian England,\u201d Pacat says. \u201cVictorians believed that adulthood began when childhood ended.

Neither the judges nor the public could believe the brass of this Cher from Malvern, Worcestershire, who appeared convincingly older than her 16 years, \u201cin a pair of homemade ripped jeans, hair up in a crazy bun, crazy eyebrows\u201d, as she remembers it now.</p> <p>Perched on the sofa of her PR\u2019s home in north London, swimming in an outsized orange hoodie and Doc Martens with jeans, Lloyd seems younger than she did then, softer \u2013 defences not exactly down, but softened by a disarming humour.</p> <p>The eyebrows are looking great, I say. \u201cThanks,\u201d she deadpans. \u201cMe and my eyebrows have gone on a journey \u2013 a transformation. We are better now.\u201d The steel returns to her voice. \u201cBut truly, if you can imagine the shit that I got, just for my eyebrows. Would you go up to a 16-year-old girl in the street and say: \u2018I don\u2019t know you, but you look disgusting, with your disgusting eyebrows\u2019? That\u2019s what people did to me.\u201d</p> <p>Lloyd is now 26, with a young family and a third album, finally, on the way \u2013 yet, still, she is being called on to explain her teenage self. From 2010 she was portrayed, obliquely on The X Factor and explicitly by the media, either as a stroppy diva and desperate copycat of her mentor Cheryl Cole, or as a fragile little girl, struggling with the spotlight.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie; at the time I was very hormonal, a naughty teenager,\u201d says Lloyd now. \u201cI wanted so desperately to be heard for who I was, and didn\u2019t understand why now a million people had something to say about me.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JglWZ-wC3Vk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JglWZ-wC3Vk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch Cher Lloyd\u2019s audition on The X Factor in 2010</figcaption> </figure>   <p>She hadn\u2019t yet learned how to express herself, she says.

She was the eldest of four, a protective big sister who would \u201chave something to say\u201d about any bullying of her siblings. Their mother is a Romani Gypsy, and the first year of Lloyd\u2019s life was spent travelling in a caravan; she later lived on a council estate. Her family \u201cwent through certain times when there was judgment,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the Gypsy community, there\u2019s definitely still a stigma.\u201d</p> <p>That was perhaps even more pronounced 10 years ago, when the term \u201cchavs\u201d was in common parlance and there was little positive working-class representation in the media. A popular Facebook page dubbed Lloyd \u201cthe Primark Cheryl Cole\u201d; when My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding aired on Channel 4, she was made the butt of jokes on social media.</p> <p>Scrutiny of her family peaked about halfway through The X Factor, when her uncle died from a methadone overdose. (The coroner accepted that Edward Smith had been \u201cdeceived\u201d into taking the drug, recording an open verdict.) Lloyd did not attend the funeral for fear of attracting the paparazzi, and gave a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xEqgnAmywA\" title=\"\">tearful performance on the show of Stay</a> by Shakespears Sister \u2013 regarded as one of her best. \u201cI love that song, and that performance was great, but I was grieving and I didn\u2019t know how to cope,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Lloyd remembers being taken earlier in the competition, along with the other contestants, to talk to two mental health professionals about how she was coping \u2013 but she still felt unsupported and sometimes exploited. \u201cI look back on it and I think, God, that put me in such a position.\u201d Even now she feels guilty that she missed the service. \u201cThe headlines would have been: \u2018Big Fat Gypsy Funeral.\u2019 I know I\u2019m right \u2013 I\u2019ve been around long enough. I know what people want from me.\u201d</p> <p>When Lloyd eventually came fourth with the fewest public votes, the Mail cast her as the \u201cungrateful X Factor failure\u201d.</p> <p>Far from making her career as a musician, the \u201creality-TV baggage\u201d nearly scuppered it. \u201cWhat baffles me is that they created a character but then, after the show, expected me to be a fully fledged, respected artist. I had to do damage control. And still, at 26 years old, I have to do damage control. Years later, I do have some anger towards people for doing that to me.\u201d She chuckles. \u201cI definitely don\u2019t say hello and shake hands with certain people.\u201d She even refuses to perform <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdbyG2MrBHk\" title=\"\">Swagger Jagger</a>, her first single post-X Factor and a UK No 1, because it reminds her of her \u201cangry, afraid\u201d teenage self: \u201cI look back and I think it\u2019s a sad song.\u201d</p> <p>Yet she is hopeful that audiences are now more aware of the way reality TV can turn participants into caricatures, and \u2013 after the suicide of a former Jeremy Kyle guest \u2013 of the stakes involved. \u201cThat awareness will continue, hopefully \u2013 where people think: \u2018D\u2019you know what, I don\u2019t want to have any involvement in this process of destroying another person.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lloyd herself was able to start afresh in the US, where she relocated in 2012 after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPgvNlrBfb0\" title=\"\">Want U Back</a> peaked at No 9 on the Billboard pop chart. That December, she performed at Madison Square Garden, the moment she says she felt furthest away from the council estate she grew up on \u2013 \u201clike being on another planet\u201d, she says, dreamily.</p> <p>It was the best time in her life to date. In the US, \u201cit wasn\u2019t \u2018Cher Lloyd, the Gypsy chav, blah blah blah\u2019. It\u2019s literally, \u2018Singer-songwriter Cher Lloyd goes on the Today Show\u2019.\u201d Word of her success made its way back across the Atlantic, too: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of pride when your own country is supportive of you doing well somewhere else.\u201d</p> <p>By then Lloyd had started seeing Craig Monk, a hairdresser she had first laid eyes on at a \u201cswanky\u201d Mayfair salon; they married in 2013. She credits him with keeping her humble at the height of her success, even though being a wife at 20 (not unusual within Traveller families, she notes) shut her off from some professional opportunities. \u201cThere was this thing of, \u2018If she\u2019s married, she\u2019s off the market,\u2019 and that angle\u2019s taken away from being able to sell my music.\u201d</p> <p>There have been other comments. \u201c\u2018If you were to wear slightly more slinky clothes, if you wore your skirt a little shorter, maybe you\u2019d get a bit more recognition\u2019 \u2013 yeah, that happened.\u201d It was even suggested that being romantically linked to another celebrity would help her career. \u201c\u2018If you go to this club, bump into somebody and hook up with them, that would be a great way to kick off the next single.\u2019 I can\u2019t even count how many times I\u2019ve seen a hook-up for the sake of a boost of a single.\u201d Lloyd makes fun of me for being shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s the joys of being a female in the music industry,\u201d she says, drily. When her second album, Sorry I\u2019m Late, peaked at No 12 on the Billboard 200 in 2014, Lloyd felt it had not been sufficiently pushed by Epic Records, and left the label. It was another daunting new start. But this time, she felt in charge.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4veL9hP4HR0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4veL9hP4HR0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for Cher Lloyd\u2019s single M.I.A.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lloyd spent her break from the industry in the studio, trying to land on a new sound; doing up a house in Essex to sell on (\u201cReally fun. Very stressful\u201d); and becoming a mother. Her daughter was born in May 2018.</p> <p>That October she released her comeback single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMeFI0eVk2w\" title=\"\">None of My Business</a>, to positive reviews, and a year later came <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4veL9hP4HR0\" title=\"\">M.I.A.</a> \u2013 a slick, smart pop song and the lead single from her third album. Lloyd was determined, she says, not to give in to the fear that motherhood would halt her career. \u201cTwo weeks after I had the baby, I went back into meetings and took the baby with me.\u201d Six weeks later, she had a photoshoot.</p> <p>On her recent tour of regional radio, a \u201crunning theme\u201d was faux-concern about \u201cbalancing\u201d motherhood and music. \u201cOf <em>course</em> I can do both,\u201d she says with disdain. \u201cThere are thousands of women across the country who do really tough jobs \u2013 and they balance motherhood as well.\u201d Monk and her family in Malvern (where she intends to buy a house) make it possible. When I ask Lloyd if she is a feminist, she looks at me and mimes \u201cduh\u201d. A lot of celebrities shy from the label, I say, suitably chastened.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was a bloke, d\u2019you think they would have asked me if I was able to make it on tour? Hmm? Can my husband not look after the baby?\u201d Lloyd is so laser-focused in her interrogation that all I can say, meekly, is: \u201cYes, Cher, I agree.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"210735353805bad38e97db7261992feeeda03a55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/210735353805bad38e97db7261992feeeda03a55/0_275_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cher Lloyd performing in Los Angeles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big in America: performing in Los Angeles in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before she had her baby, she says, she was in talks for a big promotional opportunity which fell through. \u201cThe comment that I got back was: \u2018It could be seen negatively, her coming back so soon after having a baby.\u2019 I remember thinking: \u2018Wow, OK, so I can\u2019t decide when my body is ready, when my baby\u2019s ready?\u2019 I remember being blown away by that \u2026 a career opportunity that I didn\u2019t get because of becoming a mother. But it\u2019s not stopped me,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to know what would. As she sets out on this latest stage of her career she is hopeful she is allowed to move on from her past. A recent interview referred to her as \u201cthe most hated teen in Britain\u201d, she says, with something between incredulity and frustration. \u201cI\u2019m mother to a little girl. I\u2019ve released two albums and I\u2019ve got a top 10 hit in America. I\u2019m not \u2018the most hated teen\u2019, I\u2019m 26 years old! We\u2019ve moved on!\u201d</p> <p>Interviewers will still put to her comments she made then, too, \u201cin the hopes of triggering a certain reaction\u201d, she says. What remark is it that they keep trying to hold her to? \u201cI can\u2019t even mention it, because you know what would happen \u2013 that will be the headline.\u201d She raises those perfect eyebrows, taps her temple. \u201cNine years on, I\u2019ve grown smarter.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 You can hear Cher Lloyd\u2019s new songs None of My Business and M.I.A. on Spotify and Apple Music</p>",

She credits him with keeping her humble at the height of her success, even though being a wife at 20 (not unusual within Traveller families, she notes) shut her off from some professional opportunities. \u201cThere was this thing of, \u2018If she\u2019s married, she\u2019s off the market,\u2019 and that angle\u2019s taken away from being able to sell my music.\u201d There have been other comments. \u201c\u2018If you were to wear slightly more slinky clothes, if you wore your skirt a little shorter, maybe you\u2019d get a bit more recognition\u2019 \u2013 yeah, that happened.\u201d It was even suggested that being romantically linked to another celebrity would help her career. \u201c\u2018If you go to this club, bump into somebody and hook up with them, that would be a great way to kick off the next single.\u2019 I can\u2019t even count how many times I\u2019ve seen a hook-up for the sake of a boost of a single.\u201d Lloyd makes fun of me for being shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s the joys of being a female in the music industry,\u201d she says, drily. When her second album, Sorry I\u2019m Late, peaked at No 12 on the Billboard 200 in 2014, Lloyd felt it had not been sufficiently pushed by Epic Records, and left the label. It was another daunting new start. But this time, she felt in charge. Lloyd spent her break from the industry in the studio, trying to land on a new sound; doing up a house in Essex to sell on (\u201cReally fun. Very stressful\u201d); and becoming a mother. Her daughter was born in May 2018. That October she released her comeback single, None of My Business, to positive reviews, and a year later came M.I.A. \u2013 a slick, smart pop song and the lead single from her third album. Lloyd was determined, she says, not to give in to the fear that motherhood would halt her career. \u201cTwo weeks after I had the baby, I went back into meetings and took the baby with me.\u201d Six weeks later, she had a photoshoot. On her recent tour of regional radio, a \u201crunning theme\u201d was faux-concern about \u201cbalancing\u201d motherhood and music. \u201cOf course I can do both,\u201d she says with disdain. \u201cThere are thousands of women across the country who do really tough jobs \u2013 and they balance motherhood as well.\u201d Monk and her family in Malvern (where she intends to buy a house) make it possible. When I ask Lloyd if she is a feminist, she looks at me and mimes \u201cduh\u201d. A lot of celebrities shy from the label, I say, suitably chastened. \u201cIf I was a bloke, d\u2019you think they would have asked me if I was able to make it on tour? Hmm? Can my husband not look after the baby?\u201d Lloyd is so laser-focused in her interrogation that all I can say, meekly, is: \u201cYes, Cher, I agree.\u201d Before she had her baby, she says, she was in talks for a big promotional opportunity which fell through. \u201cThe comment that I got back was: \u2018It could be seen negatively, her coming back so soon after having a baby.\u2019 I remember thinking: \u2018Wow, OK, so I can\u2019t decide when my body is ready, when my baby\u2019s ready?\u2019 I remember being blown away by that \u2026 a career opportunity that I didn\u2019t get because of becoming a mother. But it\u2019s not stopped me,\u201d she adds. It\u2019s hard to know what would. As she sets out on this latest stage of her career she is hopeful she is allowed to move on from her past. A recent interview referred to her as \u201cthe most hated teen in Britain\u201d, she says, with something between incredulity and frustration. \u201cI\u2019m mother to a little girl. I\u2019ve released two albums and I\u2019ve got a top 10 hit in America. I\u2019m not \u2018the most hated teen\u2019, I\u2019m 26 years old! We\u2019ve moved on!\u201d Interviewers will still put to her comments she made then, too, \u201cin the hopes of triggering a certain reaction\u201d, she says. What remark is it that they keep trying to hold her to? \u201cI can\u2019t even mention it, because you know what would happen \u2013 that will be the headline.\u201d She raises those perfect eyebrows, taps her temple. \u201cNine years on, I\u2019ve grown smarter.\u201d \u2022 You can hear Cher Lloyd\u2019s new songs None of My Business and M.I.A. on Spotify and Apple Music",

Johnson wrote that Sturgeon had previously promised that the 2014 referendum, in which Scottish voters rejected independence by 55% to 45%, would be a \u201conce in a generation\u201d vote, adding: \u201cThe UK government will continue to uphold the democratic decision of the Scottish people and the promise you made to them.\u201d Responding to Johnson\u2019s letter, Sturgeon accused the Tories of being \u201cterrified of Scotland having the right to choose our own future\u201d and lacking any positive case for the union. \u201cWhile today\u2019s response is not surprising \u2013 indeed we anticipated it \u2013 it will not stand. It is not politically sustainable for any Westminster government to stand in the way of the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future and to seek to block the clear democratic mandate for an independence referendum\u201d. Sturgeon said the Scottish government would set out its response and next steps later this month, when it will also ask the Holyrood parliament to again endorse the staging of a second independence referendum. Despite Westminster\u2019s chaotic handling of Brexit and Johnson\u2019s unpopularity among Scottish voters, the anticipated long-term boost to support for independence has not materialised, with polls showing support averaging at around 48%. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, responded to Johnson\u2019s letter by describing home rule for Scotland within a federal UK as \u201cthe only viable option\u201d. In a strongly worded statement, he attacked Johnson\u2019s \u201chistory of demagoguery and division\u201d, and described the decision to block a second independence referendum as \u201cspectacular naivety\u201d. Leonard, who has faced strong criticism for his party\u2019s equivocal position on the constitution following a disastrous general election result in which Scottish Labour lost all but one of its MPs, said: \u201cThe people of Scotland rejected independence in 2014, but Scotland remains divided. I believe that home rule within the UK is the only viable option that stands a chance of healing the divisions in our society. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for a UK Labour government to deliver this, so we must demand it now and mobilise for radical change.\u201d",

Friction between progressive candidates as first 2020 votes loom The progressive senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have long considered each other friends. The two even met in Washington in late 2018 to discuss maintaining good relations as they prepared to launch their 2020 presidential campaigns. But as the first primary votes approach, tensions between the two camps have spilled into the open, with Warren claiming a resurgent Sanders told her at that meeting that he did not believe a woman could beat Donald Trump \u2013 a claim Sanders described as \u201cludicrous\u201d. Cory Booker. The New Jersey senator on Monday became the latest high-profile candidate to drop out of the 2020 presidential race, citing a lack of funds \u2013 and leaving the little-fancied late entrant Deval Patrick as the only African American in the field. Russian hackers. A US cybersecurity firm has claimed Russian military hackers tried to steal internal emails from Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm that employed Hunter Biden which was at the centre of attempts by Trump last July to pressure Ukrainian authorities to announce an investigation into the Bidens for purported corruption, an effort that has led to the president being impeached. Pompeo claims Suleimani killing is part of bigger strategy The Trump administration has again altered its justification for the killing of Qassem Suleimani, with the US secretary of state saying the Iranian general\u2019s assassination was part of a broader strategy to deter US foes, including China and Russia. Speaking at Stanford University on Monday, Mike Pompeo made no mention of the White House\u2019s original assertion that Suleimani had been plotting imminent attacks on US assets. Pompeo has declined to attend a House foreign affairs committee hearing on the killing, set for Tuesday. Canadian victims. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said the 176 victims of the jetliner accidentally downed by Iran last week \u2013 57 of them Canadian \u2013 would still be alive if not for the recent escalation of tensions partly triggered by the US. Iran arrests. Tehran says arrests have been made over the shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, which has led to days of protests and driven at least two hosts for the state broadcaster to quit.

Cheat sheet A Wisconsin judge has ruled that state election officials must purge 200,000 people from the voter rolls, to the dismay of voting rights activists, who said the ruling is designed to make it harder for students and minority populations to vote. More than 300 human rights activists were killed in 2019 while working to protect the environment, free speech, LGBTQ rights and indigenous lands, a report has found. The killings took place across 31 countries, but two-thirds of them occurred in Latin America alone.

Here are the main themes of his interview with Dan Walker:</p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>What he said: he suggested Donald Trump should come up with an alternative deal to the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA), which limits Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/23/us-pullout-from-iran-nuclear-deal-leaves-trump-lost-in-history-khamenei\">The US abandoned the deal in 2018</a>, which had been brokered by President Barack Obama and was considered one of his foreign policy achievements. In a blatant show of support for Trump, Johnson said: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to get rid of it, let\u2019s replace it with the Trump deal. That\u2019s what we need to see. President Trump is a great dealmaker by his own account and many others.\u201d</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t say: whether he believed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions\">the killing of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions\">Qassem Suleimani was lawful</a> and his thoughts on not being told about the US action in advance and what that shows about the special relationship.</p> <h2>Brexit</h2> <p>What he said: a trade deal before 31 December was \u201cepically likely\u201d, the prime minister said when pushed during the interview. Yet he added that it was only common sense to budget for a \u201ccomplete failure\u201d. This is a significant step away from his typical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\">\u201cdo or die\u201d</a> style language when talking about the the EU and he may be laying the groundwork for diminished expectations.</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t say: with 100% certainty whether Britain will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of December 2020.</p> <h2>Social care</h2> <p>What he said: no date was given for when a plan might be implemented to improve social care, but he said: \u201cWe will certainly do it in this parliament\u201d. This vague answer will do little to dissuade critics that this is an area of significant weakness for the government as he claimed when he was elected Conservative party leader that he would roll out a \u201cclear plan we have prepared\u201d. He said social care solutions involve moral and social issues, including whether taxpayers should be paying for people who might be able to afford their own care. Interestingly, he pledged that people will not have to sell their home to pay for their care.</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t say: what his social care plan actually entails in practice.</p> <h2>Northern England</h2> <p>What he said: broad-brush suggestions to improve the lives of northern voters who backed the Tories at the general election included investment in the NHS, education, police, transport and broadband. \u201cThis would give people the chances to exploit their talents,\u201d he said. He also promised to wind up the illegal county lines drugs trade.</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t say: he failed to name a single infrastructure project or specific investment that would benefit the region.</p> <h2>The royal family</h2> <p>What he said: on Harry and Meghan\u2019s decision to step back as senior members of the royal family, Johnson said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d the issue could be resolved. He refrained from giving any opinion on the matter, saying it could be dealt with \u201cmuch more easily without running commentary from politicians\u201d.</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t say: whether media intrusion into the royal family has been a negative factor on the couple and if the government is happy to continue paying for their security when they are in the UK.</p> <h2>Flybe</h2> <p>What he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not for government to step in and save companies that simply run into trouble,\u201d he said of the news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/13/flybe-in-rescue-talks-to-stave-off-collapse\">the airline is struggling financially</a>. However, the prime minister said he understood the importance of regional connectivity. \u201cPeople will understand that there are limits commercially to what a government can do to rescue any particular firm. But what we will do is ensure we have the regional connectivity that this country needs. That is part of our agenda of uniting and levelling up.\u201d</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t say: exactly how he will make sure places such as Cornwall and the Isle of Man that rely heavily on Flybe will be protected if the airline collapses.</p> <h2>Harry Dunn</h2> <p>What he said: \u201cI\u2019ll be clear with you, the chances of America responding by sending Anne Sacoolas to this country are very low. That\u2019s not what they do,\u201d said Johnson, in a frank moment of the interview. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/10/harry-dunn-death-officials-demand-return-suspect-anne-sacoolas\">The UK has issued the US with an extradition order for Sacoolas</a> so she can stand trial for causing the death of the 19-year-old by dangerous driving.</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t say: what pressure he will be putting on the US to insist they return her.</p> <h2>Big Ben </h2> <p>What he said: he suggested crowdfunding could provide the \u00a3500,000 needed to make the bell sound when Britain leaves the EU on 31 January. \u201cBung a bob for a Big Ben bong,\u201d was his suggestion for a marketing line.</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t say: whether he personally wants the bell to chime and if it\u2019s all a colossal waste of money, whoever pays for it.</p> <h2>Low profile</h2> <p>What he said: he has been accused at times of operating as a \u201csubmarine-like\u201d PM, doing minimal interviews both during the general election and since he won his majority in December. He said: \u201cThe submarine is crashing through the ice floes. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conning_tower\">The Conning tower</a> is emerging through the ice floes right now. Here I am. I gave two press conferences yesterday.

I take my hat off to vegans who can handle it. You can\u2019t eat cheese, can you, if you\u2019re a vegan? I mean that\u2019s just a crime against cheese lovers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t say: the word vegan properly. Insisted on pronouncing it ve-GAN.</p>",

He still does.</p> <p>Ironically, I did not know at the time of our brief Twitter beef that Newark police department was under a federal consent decree. The American Civil Liberties Union was pursuing more than 400 cases of police brutality against the Newark police, and the city has paid millions of dollars to victims of police violence. When Vice-President Joe Biden called out Booker\u2019s police department\u2019s misconduct during a debate, Booker explained: \u201cYou\u2019re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don\u2019t even know the flavor.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/13/cory-booker-drops-out-2020-presidential-race-democrats\">Cory Booker drops out of 2020 race and promises to 'carry this fight forward'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here\u2019s the flavor of the month: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2019/12/04/obama-administration-ordered-newark-fix-its-police-force-heres-what-has-hasnt-happened/?arc404=true\">as of December 2019,</a> the Newark police department disproportionately stops, frisks, and arrests poor, black people.</p> <p>I\u2019d been following Booker for a little while because I saw him as the Superman mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Snowed in at your house? Tweet Cory. Electricity out on your block? DM the mayor. Traditional public schools need support? Well, it\u2019s complicated. In one of his recent tales from living in the Newark projects, he met a mother who asked him to get her son into a private school. Booker carries this story with him as mayor, where he worked with corporations and the Republican governor Chris Christie to expand the charter school landscape, a public enemy of teachers\u2019 unions, who typically back Democrats in elections. Today, Newark\u2019s charters are \u201cthriving\u201d and traditional public schools are still <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/13/18223129/2020-presidential-candidates-policies-cory-booker-newark-schools-2020\">suffering</a> budget constraints.</p> <p>Beyond education, Senator Booker also gained a less-than-stellar reputation for being in the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry. He\u2019s taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical companies and donors throughout his career, though he did return at least one donation after he said that he did not accept any funds from the industry during a presidential debate last year. In the same debate, he suggested that pharmaceutical executives responsible for the opioid crisis should be held criminally liable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Senator Booker\u2019s criminal justice outlook was not particularly inspiring</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Senator Booker\u2019s criminal justice outlook was not particularly inspiring. His Next Step Act, for example, proposed shorter mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders instead of simply freeing that group. Instead of decriminalizing crack or cocaine use, he offered to end the sentencing disparity. Refusing to side with Senator Bernie Sanders and argue that all prisoners should be allowed to vote, Booker instead wanted to end mass incarceration not by enfranchising the most politically vulnerable people in prison or freeing anyone from cages, but in the same way all centrist Democrats aim to fix the carceral state: one non-violent, low-level drug user at a time.</p> <p>Similar to Senator Harris, Senator Booker especially struggled to gain traction with young voters of color. In this political moment, Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum have been the only two black candidates who garnered their levels of national momentum while having modestly liberal platforms. Booker, and his diverse political peers including Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 who was the only Latinx candidate \u2013 Deval Patrick and Senator Harris, are caught between moving further left to capture young people of color, or further right to prove their potential as future establishment candidates. Harris\u2019s, Castro\u2019s and Booker\u2019s liberal platforms were not enough to cultivate a Black and Latinx voting base. I doubt Patrick will emerge as a favorite. Senator Sanders is currently polling the highest among young people of color.</p> <p>Senator Booker\u2019s plan to use \u201cour common pain to reignite our common purpose\u201d has ended. Hopefully, through more nuanced study and relationships, he will come to see that America <em>has</em> reignited a common purpose: to make America great again. What we need is for America to discover and create a new and better purpose.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a social movement lawyer and writer based in Washington DC<br></p></li> </ul>",

When Vice-President Joe Biden called out Booker\u2019s police department\u2019s misconduct during a debate, Booker explained: \u201cYou\u2019re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don\u2019t even know the flavor.\u201d Here\u2019s the flavor of the month: as of December 2019, the Newark police department disproportionately stops, frisks, and arrests poor, black people. I\u2019d been following Booker for a little while because I saw him as the Superman mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Snowed in at your house? Tweet Cory. Electricity out on your block? DM the mayor. Traditional public schools need support? Well, it\u2019s complicated. In one of his recent tales from living in the Newark projects, he met a mother who asked him to get her son into a private school. Booker carries this story with him as mayor, where he worked with corporations and the Republican governor Chris Christie to expand the charter school landscape, a public enemy of teachers\u2019 unions, who typically back Democrats in elections. Today, Newark\u2019s charters are \u201cthriving\u201d and traditional public schools are still suffering budget constraints. Beyond education, Senator Booker also gained a less-than-stellar reputation for being in the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry. He\u2019s taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical companies and donors throughout his career, though he did return at least one donation after he said that he did not accept any funds from the industry during a presidential debate last year. In the same debate, he suggested that pharmaceutical executives responsible for the opioid crisis should be held criminally liable. Senator Booker\u2019s criminal justice outlook was not particularly inspiring. His Next Step Act, for example, proposed shorter mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders instead of simply freeing that group. Instead of decriminalizing crack or cocaine use, he offered to end the sentencing disparity. Refusing to side with Senator Bernie Sanders and argue that all prisoners should be allowed to vote, Booker instead wanted to end mass incarceration not by enfranchising the most politically vulnerable people in prison or freeing anyone from cages, but in the same way all centrist Democrats aim to fix the carceral state: one non-violent, low-level drug user at a time. Similar to Senator Harris, Senator Booker especially struggled to gain traction with young voters of color. In this political moment, Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum have been the only two black candidates who garnered their levels of national momentum while having modestly liberal platforms. Booker, and his diverse political peers including Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 who was the only Latinx candidate \u2013 Deval Patrick and Senator Harris, are caught between moving further left to capture young people of color, or further right to prove their potential as future establishment candidates. Harris\u2019s, Castro\u2019s and Booker\u2019s liberal platforms were not enough to cultivate a Black and Latinx voting base. I doubt Patrick will emerge as a favorite. Senator Sanders is currently polling the highest among young people of color. Senator Booker\u2019s plan to use \u201cour common pain to reignite our common purpose\u201d has ended. Hopefully, through more nuanced study and relationships, he will come to see that America has reignited a common purpose: to make America great again. What we need is for America to discover and create a new and better purpose. Derecka Purnell is a social movement lawyer and writer based in Washington DC",

Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to \u201cavoid dangerous climate change\u201d, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way.

In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time&nbsp;to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.</p>\n    <p>The negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials.

      "body": "<p>The disgraced paedophile bishop Peter Ball made himself apparently \u201cimpregnable\u201d by cultivating friendships with Prince Charles and other senior establishment figures who later rushed to support him when he was accused of sexual abuse, according to a BBC documentary.</p> <p>Ball, the former bishop of both Lewes and Gloucester who died last year, boasted of his role as \u201ccounsellor to royalty\u201d, Cliff James, one of his victims, says in the programme. He cultivated friendships with Margaret Thatcher, peers of the realm, senior judges and headmasters of leading public schools.</p> <p>The former bishop was investigated by police in the early 1990s, which resulted in a police caution. In 2015, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/07/bishop-peter-ball-escaped-charges-mps-royal-family-intervened-court\">convicted of sexual offences</a> against 17 teenagers and young men and jailed for 32 months. He was released in February 2017 after serving half his sentence.</p> <p>The second episode of the BBC\u2019s two-part documentary, to be broadcast on Tuesday evening, draws on the testimonies of survivors and material and evidence given to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), which conducted a case study into how the Church of England handled allegations against Ball.</p> <p>James said Ball boasted of his connections. \u201cHe kept mentioning his friendship with Prince Charles in a flippant way, [as] anyone would talk about a friend \u2013 but he\u2019s talking about Prince Charles,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHere he was having a friendship with someone as low down as me \u2026 The next minute he\u2019s dropping into the conversation, \u2018oh, he\u2019s counsellor to royalty\u2019.

      "bodyText": "The disgraced paedophile bishop Peter Ball made himself apparently \u201cimpregnable\u201d by cultivating friendships with Prince Charles and other senior establishment figures who later rushed to support him when he was accused of sexual abuse, according to a BBC documentary. Ball, the former bishop of both Lewes and Gloucester who died last year, boasted of his role as \u201ccounsellor to royalty\u201d, Cliff James, one of his victims, says in the programme. He cultivated friendships with Margaret Thatcher, peers of the realm, senior judges and headmasters of leading public schools. The former bishop was investigated by police in the early 1990s, which resulted in a police caution. In 2015, he was convicted of sexual offences against 17 teenagers and young men and jailed for 32 months. He was released in February 2017 after serving half his sentence. The second episode of the BBC\u2019s two-part documentary, to be broadcast on Tuesday evening, draws on the testimonies of survivors and material and evidence given to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), which conducted a case study into how the Church of England handled allegations against Ball. James said Ball boasted of his connections. \u201cHe kept mentioning his friendship with Prince Charles in a flippant way, [as] anyone would talk about a friend \u2013 but he\u2019s talking about Prince Charles,\u201d he said. \u201cHere he was having a friendship with someone as low down as me \u2026 The next minute he\u2019s dropping into the conversation, \u2018oh, he\u2019s counsellor to royalty\u2019. It just reinforced his specialness and the idea he was impregnable.\u201d The family of Neil Todd, who made the first allegation of abuse in 1993 and killed himself in 2012, said he had been portrayed as a liar and a \u201cmischief-maker\u201d by Ball\u2019s friends in high places. At a hearing last year, the independent inquiry heard how members of the establishment, including the heir to the throne, the then archbishop of Canterbury and a senior member of the judiciary, rallied to support Ball. \u201cThe story of Peter Ball is the story of the establishment at work in modern times,\u201d William Chapman, representing survivors, told the inquiry. \u201cIt is the story of how the establishment minimised the nature of Peter Ball\u2019s misdeeds \u2026 and silenced and harassed those who tried to complain.\u201d Prince Charles told Ball in a letter in February 1995, two years after the bishop had accepted the police caution, which was read to the inquiry: \u201cI wish I could do more. I feel so desperately strongly about the monstrous wrongs that have been done to you and the way you have been treated.\u201d Charles later arranged for the Duchy of Cornwall to buy a house to be rented by Ball and his identical twin, Michael, also a bishop. In a six-page statement to the inquiry, Charles said he had been deceived over a long period of time \u201cabout the true nature\u201d of Ball\u2019s activities, but denied he had sought to influence the outcome of police investigations. He said he was unsure whether he was told about Ball\u2019s caution until 2009. In its report published last year, the IICSA concluded that the church had put its own reputation above the needs of victims of sexual abuse, and that Charles and other members of the establishment were misguided in their expressions of support for Ball.

Or would I just put up with them for a dog?</p> <h2><strong>\u2018No Vacancy\u2019</strong><br></h2> <p>They say that they are looking for a relationship, but as you get to know them it increasingly becomes clear that this spot in their life is, in fact, already occupied \u2013 usually by the spectre of an ex, who they find cause to bring up all the time. Being with them brings to mind that Black Mirror episode where new partners have preordained expiry dates, and dating is merely a self-serving means of getting over somebody else.</p> <p>It is not always romantic baggage \u2013 sometimes there is an overly involved best friend or, heaven forbid, parent. Reddit\u2019s relationships forum of 2.7 million members is full of threads questioning the closeness of grown adults to their mother or father. One representative summary reads: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if this closeness between my boyfriend and his mom is normal, or if this is ultimately going to destroy our relationship.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Fantasists</strong><br></h2> <p>The polar opposite of the above are those looking explicitly for A Boyfriend, or A Girlfriend \u2013 any one will do. They will hint about your moving in and \u201cjoke\u201d about your wedding, uncomfortably early on. You\u2019d have beautiful children together, they say, before they even know your middle name.</p> <p>They are usually Piscean, if you have any truck with that sort of thing. The most compelling case for astrology is that author Jonathan Safran Foer is a Pisces and he allegedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/t-magazine/natalie-portman-jonathan-safran-foer-emails.html?_r=1\" title=\"\">left his wife for Natalie Portman</a> \u2026 without conferring with Portman first.</p> <h2><strong>Domestic blitzed</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7889fca13a88183f5f1eaf2c0bfa3f3b96bd7373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7889fca13a88183f5f1eaf2c0bfa3f3b96bd7373/0_0_2079_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"THE WIRE - SEASON ONEPicture shows: l-r Wallace (Michael B Jordan), Malik \u201cPoot\u201d Carr (Tray Chaney), D Angelo Barksdale (Larry Gilliard, Jr.) and Preston \u201cBodie\u201d Broadus (JD Williams).

Have you ever been in the presence of a third party?</p> <p>Relationships can get surprisingly far on food, sex and the mutual consumption of content alone. It may be that, months in, you may not even have had an actual conversation \u2013 which is how I once came to discover that I had been going out with a 9/11 \u201ctruther\u201d conspiracy theorist.</p> <h2><strong>The makeover candidate</strong><br></h2> <p>At the other end of the spectrum are people who will put a chair in front of a TV in an otherwise empty room, and call it a home; who own precisely enough crockery and bedlinen to serve their needs (just about) alone. Their only domestic concession to the jump from student living to adulthood has been putting their Reservoir Dogs poster in a frame.

A couple of friends have ended promising relationships with night owls because they prefer being in bed by 9pm. Many people are also reluctant to compromise their diet or exercise regimen for a potential partner, meaning your choice of dating venue or activity might be determined by whether they are fasting, or cutting, or currently in ketosis or out.

Or would I just put up with them for a dog? \u2018No Vacancy\u2019 They say that they are looking for a relationship, but as you get to know them it increasingly becomes clear that this spot in their life is, in fact, already occupied \u2013 usually by the spectre of an ex, who they find cause to bring up all the time. Being with them brings to mind that Black Mirror episode where new partners have preordained expiry dates, and dating is merely a self-serving means of getting over somebody else. It is not always romantic baggage \u2013 sometimes there is an overly involved best friend or, heaven forbid, parent. Reddit\u2019s relationships forum of 2.7 million members is full of threads questioning the closeness of grown adults to their mother or father. One representative summary reads: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if this closeness between my boyfriend and his mom is normal, or if this is ultimately going to destroy our relationship.\u201d Fantasists The polar opposite of the above are those looking explicitly for A Boyfriend, or A Girlfriend \u2013 any one will do. They will hint about your moving in and \u201cjoke\u201d about your wedding, uncomfortably early on. You\u2019d have beautiful children together, they say, before they even know your middle name. They are usually Piscean, if you have any truck with that sort of thing. The most compelling case for astrology is that author Jonathan Safran Foer is a Pisces and he allegedly left his wife for Natalie Portman \u2026 without conferring with Portman first. Domestic blitzed Some fantasies, of course, are co-created. There are some pairings where you so easily construct a cosy world for two \u2013 getting takeaway and watching telly, moving between the bed and the sofa \u2013 it is as if you have been together for years after a few weeks of dating. It\u2019s not until you\u2019ve finished all of The Wire that it dawns on you: have you gone anywhere or done anything together, beyond get brunch? Have you ever been in the presence of a third party? Relationships can get surprisingly far on food, sex and the mutual consumption of content alone. It may be that, months in, you may not even have had an actual conversation \u2013 which is how I once came to discover that I had been going out with a 9/11 \u201ctruther\u201d conspiracy theorist. The makeover candidate At the other end of the spectrum are people who will put a chair in front of a TV in an otherwise empty room, and call it a home; who own precisely enough crockery and bedlinen to serve their needs (just about) alone. Their only domestic concession to the jump from student living to adulthood has been putting their Reservoir Dogs poster in a frame. Substitute Le Chat Noir for women, because women can slum it, too \u2013 though let\u2019s be honest: they usually don\u2019t. These are the men (I\u2019m just going to say it) whose friends and family, privately despairing over their living standards, might once have hoped some hapless woman would come along and \u201csort out\u201d. Now, in these more enlightened times, they appeal to Queer Eye, as Laurie Penny wrote in The Baffler, to teach \u201cbasic life-skills like learning to clean your room and deal with your childhood traumas\u201d. To quote the Queer Eye star Jonathan Van Ness: \u201cWhat? You just said you have never shopped for a fucking mattress?!\u201d Born performers All the world\u2019s a stage for this lot. With the slightest encouragement \u2013 and quite often none at all \u2013 they will be delighted to read aloud to you, or perform Under the Bridge on their acoustic guitar. The best-case scenario is that they find one another: think of the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s happy reminiscence of her honeymoon period with our elected leader, where mutual quoting of Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 29 had \u201ca weird sense of foreplay\u201d. Not that that ended especially well. Sexists The biggest challenge of dating as a straight feminist woman, assuming you are looking for a life partner, is identifying a properly feminist man. There is a vast expanse of questionable grey area to navigate before you get to the unapologetic pick-up artists and misogynists \u2013 and even those are not always easy to identify from three old photos and an emoji bio. \u201cSoftbois\u201d, for instance, present as emotionally open and in tune, and may simply be attempting to bond over bands and your mutual \u201cbrokenness\u201d \u2013 or may be masters of emotional manipulation. (@beam_me_up_softboi, on Instagram, is a mind-boggling resource.) Routiners After you have been single for any length of time, you tend to become an expert in how to make yourself happy. This is a mixed blessing. Yes, it is probably necessary for lifelong contentment, and certainly for happy and healthy relationships. But when you could write a user manual of many pages for yourself \u2013 down to optimum mealtimes, bedtimes and downtimes \u2013 you can get a bit, uh, rigid about sticking to it. One of the most enjoyable parts of dating, anthropologically speaking, is the insight into the highly specific ways that other people live their lives. You would be surprised at how many people cannot get to sleep without an episode of Friends on Netflix, or white noise on Spotify, or the comfort of a cuddly toy \u2013 even when someone else is sleeping over, even for the first time. Though they may sound fairly superficial, these preferences or quirks can easily prove the hurdles at which new partners fall. A couple of friends have ended promising relationships with night owls because they prefer being in bed by 9pm. Many people are also reluctant to compromise their diet or exercise regimen for a potential partner, meaning your choice of dating venue or activity might be determined by whether they are fasting, or cutting, or currently in ketosis or out. That\u2019s not even to mention the teetotallers. How they do it, I\u2019ve got no idea.",

      "body": "<p>A winding road. Two bickering siblings in a cemetery. And a dark-suited, silver-haired zombie. The immortal opening minutes of the 1968 film Night of the Living Dead are unfolding onscreen at Leeds Playhouse. Meanwhile, scattered around the stage beneath, a small team work furiously, switching between the jobs of actor and camera operator. A second, adjacent screen above them reveals the results of their efforts to recreate, live and in real time, every shot in George Romero\u2019s classic horror movie.</p> <p>With more than 1,000 shots in Romero\u2019s film, it\u2019s clear that the company, <a href=\"https://www.imitatingthedog.co.uk/\">imitating the dog</a>, have their hands full with Night of the Living Dead \u2013 Remix. As the technical team watch from the stalls in this first week of full rehearsal, actor William James Holstead is playing the ill-fated Johnny, who is gnawed by a zombie in that opening graveyard scene. But Holstead soon shrugs off that role and wheels a camera around to capture footage projected through a live feed.

Director Andrew Quick explains that the film itself is \u201cshot in that sort of quasi-documentary style \u2013 black and white, grainy, slightly amateurish. So you feel: \u2018Are these real people? Are they actors?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Quick first saw Night of the Living Dead in a late-night horror double-bill at the Scala cinema in London. He was struck by \u201chow much more of an art film it was, how much more complex than I imagined it would be. I\u2019d seen other zombie films which were more conventional and schlockier.\u201d Romero\u2019s film would provide a new template for horror and inspire a new wave of American independent cinema. There is a parallel between Romero and his small band of outsiders, whose experimental, low-budget film held a mirror to modern society, and Wainwright and Quick\u2019s own experiment, where the news references may be 50 years old but reverberate in our age of intolerance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fa6f0654512ced1d8b5b1f40b8eea6cfda7eb13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fa6f0654512ced1d8b5b1f40b8eea6cfda7eb13/0_219_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morgan Bailey plays Ben: \u2018As a performer, you want to give your own personal stamp.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morgan Bailey plays Ben: \u2018As a performer, you want to give your own personal stamp.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Waring</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The starting point, however, was an altogether different horror film: Psycho. Wainwright explains that they played around with remaking the Hitchcock classic but couldn\u2019t get the rights. Living Dead reared its head because of its unusual copyright situation. It was originally named Night of the Flesh Eaters but when the title was changed for distribution, the copyright notice in the film was mistakenly omitted. The movie ended up in the public domain. The production company behind the film, Image Ten, have authorised this stage version.</p> <p>As part of his research, Quick interviewed Russ Streiner, the actor who played Johnny and was one of the original producers. Quick, who is co-directing the show with Pete Brooks, wants to steep the show in the film\u2019s own production history. They are experimenting with meta techniques, such as actors reading out scholarly writings about the movie and offering behind-the-scenes stories, giving a strange parallel with the DVD commentary format. There\u2019s a comic potential to these asides and Wainwright acknowledges the impulse to embrace the absurdity of the whole undertaking. There is an inherent wit, he says, in this Herculean task. \u201cBut we\u2019re wary of pushing the humour too far.\u201d Some scenes will be shot using model sets, with defaced Barbie dolls cast as zombies.</p> <p>In rehearsals, they continue their discussions from the previous day about how to approach the scene in which Johnny\u2019s sister, Barbara, slaps Ben and he punches her. Actor Morven Macbeth explains: \u201cDuane Jones spoke to George Romero and Russ Streiner about the significance of a black man punching a white woman, [suggesting] that they hadn\u2019t thought it through sufficiently.\u201d It\u2019s possible that this background detail will be shared with audiences in the final version.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cda07d68ba7f71ee82547682f855299797aba025\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cda07d68ba7f71ee82547682f855299797aba025/0_283_6500_3900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Prendergast and Keicha Greenidge in Heart of Darkness, imitating the dog\u2019s previous production.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Prendergast and Keicha Greenidge in Heart of Darkness, imitating the dog\u2019s previous production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Waring</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morgan Bailey is playing Ben and says he has to balance mimicking the performance of Jones, as seen on screen above him, while giving his own portrayal of the character. \u201cThere has to be an element of you mirroring the actor and the choices that were made in the movie. But at the same time, as a performer, you want to give your own personal stamp.\u201d Macbeth acknowledges that, moment to moment on stage: \u201cThere is a lot to think about! In a conventional stage play you have to remember your lines, remember where you\u2019re supposed to stand and your character\u2019s arc in that scene. In this, you\u2019re also thinking about your relationship to the camera, operating a camera, preparing for the next shot. You\u2019re hearing the lines and the soundtrack in your ear.\u201d It\u2019s unlike any other acting gig, says Bailey. \u201cWhat really threw me is the choreography \u2013 it\u2019s more of a dance.\u201d Everyone is striving to stay in sync and the original film acts as a sort of metronome for them.</p> <p>Quick draws a contrast between the world on stage and what we see them create on the screen: \u201cThe actors have to move in very unnatural ways, to create a very natural moment on film.\u201d Moreover, adds Wainwright, they need to make sure that the movements of the characters on stage are interesting in themselves, rather than just serving the purpose of capturing the film.</p> <p>As they approach opening night and a five-week tour, Quick already has his mind on their next show, which will have a similarly sophisticated interweaving of storylines. It\u2019s an adaptation of Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover that will include the story of the trial and also explore issues around the enactment of sex on stage and screen in the #MeToo era. Quick says that the heart of his productions is found in this collision of multiple story strands and styles. He points from his seat in the stalls at the melee of cameras and actors: \u201cIt\u2019s the relationship between those two screens and the vibrancy of the stage.\u201d</p> <p>The company is named after a painting by the American artist Eric Fischl. \u201cA lot of our work has been about imitation,\u201d explains Quick. \u201cA lot of theatre is. You repeat and imitate what you do in rehearsal or the sources you\u2019re looking at.\u201d But the canine is key. \u201cDogs are out of control,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t imitate a dog.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Night of the Living Dead \u2013 Remix is at <a href=\"https://leedsplayhouse.org.uk/events/night-of-the-living-dead-remix/\">Leeds Playhouse</a>, 24 January-15 February.

I\u2019d seen other zombie films which were more conventional and schlockier.\u201d Romero\u2019s film would provide a new template for horror and inspire a new wave of American independent cinema. There is a parallel between Romero and his small band of outsiders, whose experimental, low-budget film held a mirror to modern society, and Wainwright and Quick\u2019s own experiment, where the news references may be 50 years old but reverberate in our age of intolerance. The starting point, however, was an altogether different horror film: Psycho. Wainwright explains that they played around with remaking the Hitchcock classic but couldn\u2019t get the rights. Living Dead reared its head because of its unusual copyright situation. It was originally named Night of the Flesh Eaters but when the title was changed for distribution, the copyright notice in the film was mistakenly omitted. The movie ended up in the public domain. The production company behind the film, Image Ten, have authorised this stage version. As part of his research, Quick interviewed Russ Streiner, the actor who played Johnny and was one of the original producers. Quick, who is co-directing the show with Pete Brooks, wants to steep the show in the film\u2019s own production history. They are experimenting with meta techniques, such as actors reading out scholarly writings about the movie and offering behind-the-scenes stories, giving a strange parallel with the DVD commentary format. There\u2019s a comic potential to these asides and Wainwright acknowledges the impulse to embrace the absurdity of the whole undertaking. There is an inherent wit, he says, in this Herculean task. \u201cBut we\u2019re wary of pushing the humour too far.\u201d Some scenes will be shot using model sets, with defaced Barbie dolls cast as zombies. In rehearsals, they continue their discussions from the previous day about how to approach the scene in which Johnny\u2019s sister, Barbara, slaps Ben and he punches her. Actor Morven Macbeth explains: \u201cDuane Jones spoke to George Romero and Russ Streiner about the significance of a black man punching a white woman, [suggesting] that they hadn\u2019t thought it through sufficiently.\u201d It\u2019s possible that this background detail will be shared with audiences in the final version. Morgan Bailey is playing Ben and says he has to balance mimicking the performance of Jones, as seen on screen above him, while giving his own portrayal of the character. \u201cThere has to be an element of you mirroring the actor and the choices that were made in the movie. But at the same time, as a performer, you want to give your own personal stamp.\u201d Macbeth acknowledges that, moment to moment on stage: \u201cThere is a lot to think about! In a conventional stage play you have to remember your lines, remember where you\u2019re supposed to stand and your character\u2019s arc in that scene. In this, you\u2019re also thinking about your relationship to the camera, operating a camera, preparing for the next shot. You\u2019re hearing the lines and the soundtrack in your ear.\u201d It\u2019s unlike any other acting gig, says Bailey. \u201cWhat really threw me is the choreography \u2013 it\u2019s more of a dance.\u201d Everyone is striving to stay in sync and the original film acts as a sort of metronome for them. Quick draws a contrast between the world on stage and what we see them create on the screen: \u201cThe actors have to move in very unnatural ways, to create a very natural moment on film.\u201d Moreover, adds Wainwright, they need to make sure that the movements of the characters on stage are interesting in themselves, rather than just serving the purpose of capturing the film. As they approach opening night and a five-week tour, Quick already has his mind on their next show, which will have a similarly sophisticated interweaving of storylines. It\u2019s an adaptation of Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover that will include the story of the trial and also explore issues around the enactment of sex on stage and screen in the #MeToo era. Quick says that the heart of his productions is found in this collision of multiple story strands and styles. He points from his seat in the stalls at the melee of cameras and actors: \u201cIt\u2019s the relationship between those two screens and the vibrancy of the stage.\u201d The company is named after a painting by the American artist Eric Fischl. \u201cA lot of our work has been about imitation,\u201d explains Quick. \u201cA lot of theatre is. You repeat and imitate what you do in rehearsal or the sources you\u2019re looking at.\u201d But the canine is key. \u201cDogs are out of control,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t imitate a dog.\u201d Night of the Living Dead \u2013 Remix is at Leeds Playhouse, 24 January-15 February. Then touring until 21 March.",

      "body": "<p>When Eliza Khuner, a former data scientist at Facebook, asked HR if she could work from home part-time after the birth of her third child, the response was swift and firm: no to working from home, no to working part-time, and no to taking extra leave. </p> <p>Khuner felt she had little choice but to resign. In frustration, she posted in a Facebook group for employees worldwide describing her predicament. Within seconds, her phone started buzzing with more than 5,500 employees voicing their support. Later, she would write about this experience for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/i-am-a-data-scientist-and-mom-but-facebook-made-me-choose/\">Wired</a>. Once again people reached out, but this time from a range of companies across the tech sector. It was clear this problem was industry wide.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/\">Half of women working in tech say they have experienced gender bias</a> or discrimination, according to the Women in Tech\u2019s latest survey and, at board level, only <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianvigo/2019/02/23/women-in-tech/#6108b1d145d7\">13% of the global Fortune 500 senior tech executives are female</a>.</p> <p>Christine Armstrong, speaker and author of Mother of All Jobs, which features anonymous interviews with senior-level women on career and family, says the fact the tech sector is overtly masculine, young and has a prevalent long-hours culture is alienating women.</p> <p>\u201cTech companies should be leading the way around productivity and helping to combat the \u2018always on\u2019 culture by setting clearer boundaries around work and life, but that is rarely the case,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, companies such as Facebook don\u2019t even have a policy around working from home. What sort of message does that send?\u201d</p> <p>Sanchita Saha, founder of <a href=\"https://www.citysocializer.com/\">Citysocializer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.shello.com/\">Shello</a> app, says tech firms are in the ideal position to champion the flexible working that working parents need. \u201cIt should be an easy one to implement as standard policy because the online collaboration, project management and communication tools that are already being used (Slack, Trello, Google Docs etc) are ideal for successful remote and flexible working,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The culture of presenteeism is, however, all too prevalent. Khuner says she was not surprised Facebook denied her request for part-time hours. \u201cI had already noticed that those options were missing from Facebook\u2019s family-friendly policy. But if you want to change the status quo you start by asking,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Khuner also feels that she, and millions of other women like her, are being penalised for having children. \u201cI think there\u2019s a stigma associated with caring for your own children. I have internalised this, and often feel if I\u2019m not working a paid job then I\u2019m wasting my potential,\u201d she says. But raising a family is challenging, skilled work and should be recognised as such. \u201cSociety shouldn\u2019t tell you you\u2019re not valuable just because your work isn\u2019t paid,\u201d Khuner says.</p> <p>So how can mothers in tech continue to advance their careers? More flexibility, better training for returners, more comprehensive childcare or a change in organisational culture?</p> <p>Armstrong isn\u2019t convinced that flexible working is the answer. \u201cWe need to look at the link between the total number of hours worked and productivity,\u201d she says. \u201cIf someone is nominally working four days a week but doing a full-time job in that time and being paid less, they shouldn\u2019t have to just suck it up.\u201d</p> <p>It is, says Armstrong, the nine-to-five culture that needs addressing and the fact that the way we work has changed considerably. Many people are now expected to respond to work emails 24 hours a day. \u201cWhether that\u2019s been implemented by the patriarchy or not, it\u2019s not working for any of us, especially mothers, and it\u2019s having a major impact on our mental health and wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>A big part of the problem is that <a href=\"https://www.yourmoney.com/insurance/women-still-primary-carer-households/\">two-thirds of mothers are still the primary carers for their children</a> and there is often a drop-off at middle management level or when women take a career break to have a family.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.weareumi.co.uk/news/sectors/education/digital-training-to-tackle-mum-skills-gap\">report</a> by training provider <a href=\"https://digitalmums.com/\">Digital Mums</a>, published in November last year, indicated that one in four (28%) mothers faced a skills gap that prevented them from going back to work after having children.</p> <p>Half (49%) of the 2,000 mums surveyed said they had done no formal training in the past three years, with cost being the biggest barrier.</p> <p>Gabriela Hersham, co-founder of Huckletree, a co-working space for tech and creative startups, says, however, that helping working parents doesn\u2019t have to come with a whopping price tag. \u201cWe offer all primary caregivers the right to work a four-day week on full pay until their child turns one,\u201d she says. \u201cWe believe that these parents will work to a more productive shortened schedule and that they\u2019ll massively appreciate this support and the flexibility it offers them.\u201d</p> <p>Sheridan Ash, women in tech leader at PwC UK, says returners programmes, while very important, should just be one part of a process of supporting women who want to have a family. \u201cEmployers need to look in detail at the whole journey of women in their organisation, including attracting, retaining, developing and advancing them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>One of the biggest challenges is that girls and young women are put off pursuing tech careers in school. \u201cWe need to really understand what was turning girls and young women away at such an early stage in their lives \u2013 lack of knowledge about a tech career or a lack of clear role models,\u201d Ash says.</p> <p>It, ultimately, comes down to overcoming stereotypes and deeply held prejudices in the tech sector, Saha says. \u201cWomen who are working in tech have already defied the gender \u2018norms\u2019 by the fact they are there in the first place and they should be given the same respect that men who have kids get, with the added kudos and support of having another important job as caregivers alongside fulfilling their work commitments.\u201d</p> <p>This was something Saha struggled with when she had her children. \u201cEven as CEO I felt under pressure to prove myself to my all-male board and deliver more than before.

      "bodyText": "When Eliza Khuner, a former data scientist at Facebook, asked HR if she could work from home part-time after the birth of her third child, the response was swift and firm: no to working from home, no to working part-time, and no to taking extra leave. Khuner felt she had little choice but to resign. In frustration, she posted in a Facebook group for employees worldwide describing her predicament. Within seconds, her phone started buzzing with more than 5,500 employees voicing their support. Later, she would write about this experience for Wired. Once again people reached out, but this time from a range of companies across the tech sector. It was clear this problem was industry wide. Half of women working in tech say they have experienced gender bias or discrimination, according to the Women in Tech\u2019s latest survey and, at board level, only 13% of the global Fortune 500 senior tech executives are female. Christine Armstrong, speaker and author of Mother of All Jobs, which features anonymous interviews with senior-level women on career and family, says the fact the tech sector is overtly masculine, young and has a prevalent long-hours culture is alienating women. \u201cTech companies should be leading the way around productivity and helping to combat the \u2018always on\u2019 culture by setting clearer boundaries around work and life, but that is rarely the case,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, companies such as Facebook don\u2019t even have a policy around working from home. What sort of message does that send?\u201d Sanchita Saha, founder of Citysocializer and Shello app, says tech firms are in the ideal position to champion the flexible working that working parents need. \u201cIt should be an easy one to implement as standard policy because the online collaboration, project management and communication tools that are already being used (Slack, Trello, Google Docs etc) are ideal for successful remote and flexible working,\u201d she says. The culture of presenteeism is, however, all too prevalent. Khuner says she was not surprised Facebook denied her request for part-time hours. \u201cI had already noticed that those options were missing from Facebook\u2019s family-friendly policy. But if you want to change the status quo you start by asking,\u201d she says. Khuner also feels that she, and millions of other women like her, are being penalised for having children. \u201cI think there\u2019s a stigma associated with caring for your own children. I have internalised this, and often feel if I\u2019m not working a paid job then I\u2019m wasting my potential,\u201d she says. But raising a family is challenging, skilled work and should be recognised as such. \u201cSociety shouldn\u2019t tell you you\u2019re not valuable just because your work isn\u2019t paid,\u201d Khuner says. So how can mothers in tech continue to advance their careers? More flexibility, better training for returners, more comprehensive childcare or a change in organisational culture? Armstrong isn\u2019t convinced that flexible working is the answer. \u201cWe need to look at the link between the total number of hours worked and productivity,\u201d she says. \u201cIf someone is nominally working four days a week but doing a full-time job in that time and being paid less, they shouldn\u2019t have to just suck it up.\u201d It is, says Armstrong, the nine-to-five culture that needs addressing and the fact that the way we work has changed considerably. Many people are now expected to respond to work emails 24 hours a day. \u201cWhether that\u2019s been implemented by the patriarchy or not, it\u2019s not working for any of us, especially mothers, and it\u2019s having a major impact on our mental health and wellbeing.\u201d A big part of the problem is that two-thirds of mothers are still the primary carers for their children and there is often a drop-off at middle management level or when women take a career break to have a family. A report by training provider Digital Mums, published in November last year, indicated that one in four (28%) mothers faced a skills gap that prevented them from going back to work after having children. Half (49%) of the 2,000 mums surveyed said they had done no formal training in the past three years, with cost being the biggest barrier. Gabriela Hersham, co-founder of Huckletree, a co-working space for tech and creative startups, says, however, that helping working parents doesn\u2019t have to come with a whopping price tag. \u201cWe offer all primary caregivers the right to work a four-day week on full pay until their child turns one,\u201d she says. \u201cWe believe that these parents will work to a more productive shortened schedule and that they\u2019ll massively appreciate this support and the flexibility it offers them.\u201d Sheridan Ash, women in tech leader at PwC UK, says returners programmes, while very important, should just be one part of a process of supporting women who want to have a family. \u201cEmployers need to look in detail at the whole journey of women in their organisation, including attracting, retaining, developing and advancing them,\u201d she says. One of the biggest challenges is that girls and young women are put off pursuing tech careers in school. \u201cWe need to really understand what was turning girls and young women away at such an early stage in their lives \u2013 lack of knowledge about a tech career or a lack of clear role models,\u201d Ash says. It, ultimately, comes down to overcoming stereotypes and deeply held prejudices in the tech sector, Saha says. \u201cWomen who are working in tech have already defied the gender \u2018norms\u2019 by the fact they are there in the first place and they should be given the same respect that men who have kids get, with the added kudos and support of having another important job as caregivers alongside fulfilling their work commitments.\u201d This was something Saha struggled with when she had her children. \u201cEven as CEO I felt under pressure to prove myself to my all-male board and deliver more than before. So I returned to the office within six to eight weeks of having children, which placed huge time pressures on me \u2013 especially as I chose to breastfeed them both for the first six months, meaning I had to pump and freeze milk at work.\u201d Finding accessible and affordable childcare is also a significant barrier for working parents, especially women. \u201cIf quality childcare is in place, and there is a sense of support from management, then acquiring new skills and building confidence should not prevent women from progressing,\u201d Saha says.

      "bodyText": "Up to 52 children may have been victims of a sex abuse scandal in Greater Manchester, with most offenders getting away with their crimes because of errors by police and children\u2019s services, the Guardian has learned. Some of the police officers involved in the 2004 case are still serving and the police watchdog has been called in to re-examine if there was any wrongdoing. The revelations came as an independent report found that the police investigation into child sexual exploitation failed vulnerable girls in care after being shut down prematurely \u2014 partly because senior officers prioritised solving burglaries and car crime. Operation Augusta was launched in 2004 by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) following the death of 15-year-old Victoria Agoglia, who died of an overdose in 2003 after being injected with heroin by a 50-year-old man. The report was ordered by Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, and released on Tuesday morning. It found failings by police and children\u2019s services. Greater Manchester police assistant chief constable Mabs Hussain said that victims attacked as children had been denied justice. He said that detectives reinvestigating the allegations from those who say they were sexually abused as children in the original investigation have identified many more suspected victims. He said that further lines of inquiry were being pursued in 38 of the 52 cases to have come to light, with new alleged attackers in some cases. \u201cThere are lines of inquiry we have established into further offenders and victims,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chief [constable of GMP] wanted assurances \u2026 that any lines of inquiry from 2004 should be pursued and the justice [victims] were denied in 2004 should be obtained.\u201d The report found that although Augusta identified 16 child victims and 97 potential perpetrators \u2014 mostly men working in the restaurant trade \u2014 only three were convicted at court. The operation was shut down prematurely in July 2005, with the force blaming a lack of resources. As a result, most of the affected children \u2014 white girls aged 12 to 16 in care in Manchester \u2014 were \u201cfailed\u201d by police and children\u2019s services, the authors concluded. Despite this, the entire investigation team received commendations from the chief superintendent and was nominated for a force excellence award, according to the new report, written by child protection specialist Malcolm Newsam and former senior police officer Gary Ridgway. Hussain denied any suggestion that the original inquiry was inadequate because offenders were mostly from an Asian background: \u201cThere was no suggestion that there was any fear, from the evidence I have seen.\u201d GMP responded on Tuesday by apologising to the victims and saying it had established a major investigation team to look again at the abuse of Victoria and the other girls. The report suggested GMP failed to learn lessons from the curtailed operation, noting that nine years after Victoria\u2019s death, nine Asian men in Rochdale were found guilty of sexually exploiting vulnerable young white girls. Burnham commissioned the research after Margaret Oliver, a detective on the Augusta team, went public criticising GMP in the aftermath of the Rochdale case. \u201cDon\u2019t believe any of this rubbish that police have learned from their mistakes. I worked on an almost identical operation in 2004, Operation Augusta, which had identified dozens of young victims and dozens of suspects. \u201d she said in a media interview in 2017.

In a wide-ranging interview, Johnson also said a trade deal with the EU in the next 11 months is \u201cepically likely\u201d but did not rule out difficulty in meeting the legal timetable he has set. On the likelihood of a comprehensive trade deal by 31 December, he said it was: \u201cEnormously likely, epically likely\u201d. He said: \u201cI mean obviously you cannot, you always have to budget for a complete failure of common sense but I\u2019m very, very, very confident we will get \u2026 this is not about a deal, this is about building a great new partnership.\u201d On his low profile over the festive break where he spent time holidaying in the Caribbean, and which led to criticism of a \u201csubmarine-like\u201d image when it comes to public scrutiny, he said the submarine is now \u201ccrashing through the ice floes\u201d. In a message to northern voters who switched from Labour to the Conservatives at the general election, he said he would help them by putting 20,000 extra police officers on the streets and would work to wind up the county lines drugs trade, as well as invest in health and education. He said: \u201cThere are too many towns, parts of our country, where people don\u2019t feel they have opportunity.\u201d On the report into alleged interference in the EU referendum by Russia, conducted by parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee, he said it would be released \u201cwithin weeks\u201d. The government was severely criticised by the former committee chair and ex-MP Dominic Grieve for not publishing it during the general election. Johnson said: \u201cThere is absolutely no reason why it should not be published. I happen to have read it and I think after all that clamour in the election campaign I think people are going to be disappointed.\u201d There was also a suggestion the public may be asked to crowdfund the cost of Big Ben chiming at 11pm on 31 January to mark Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Johnson said he was working on a scheme along the lines of \u201cbung a bob for a Big Ben bong\u201d. The House of Commons Commission decided not to look into sounding the bell despite a request from MPs because of the \u00a3500,000 cost.",

      "body": "<p>When Holly Whitaker looks back on the many nights that would disappear in a boozy haze, it wasn\u2019t the anxiety and regret that made her realise she needed to get help for her drinking, but sheer exhaustion. Each weekend, while hungover, she would wearily erase all evidence of her drinking binges: the stains on her bed, the empty bottles, the rubbish bags. She was holding it together with a lucrative job as the director of a healthcare startup, had a great flat in San Francisco and a busy social life, but suddenly she just couldn\u2019t do it any more.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I binged, I would close my eyes while I did it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was trying to not see how horrific it was. I would go through this process of scrubbing it away, then presenting myself to the world and pretending that nothing was wrong. Then I had this moment when I couldn\u2019t not see it.\u201d</p> <p>She did what many people with a drinking problem do: she went to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). But, after several months of attending meetings, she realised that the 12-step programme wasn\u2019t working for her. The programme\u2019s guidelines, created in 1939, centre on appealing to a higher power and renouncing the ego. How, she wondered, could this possibly serve women or minorities who historically have been powerless? \u201cThese are rules written for men in the 1930s. They\u2019re not written for women. They\u2019re for the people who sit at the top of our society. The archetype is a man with an overdeveloped sense of owning the world. That\u2019s not women or any other marginalised human.\u201d</p> <p>Since it was founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio, AA has become the most popular addiction recovery programme in the world. While Whitaker is keen to point out that \u201cplenty of my friends have gotten sober through AA\u201d, it is not without its critics. Some have challenged its belief that alcoholism is a disease, while others have questioned the religious aspect of the organisation, which asks members to turn their lives over to a higher power as part of the 12 steps.</p> <p>Its success rate has also been disputed. A long-term <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3860535/\" title=\"\">study on AA</a> (a free mutual-aid society that has about <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/alcoholics-anonymous-12-step-program\" title=\"\">40,000 members</a> in the UK) by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in 2011 found that 49% of its members were still abstinent after eight years. Getting accurate figures for alcohol treatment programmes is hard because many participants want to remain anonymous, but a former Harvard psychiatry professor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/29/alcoholics-anonymous-saved-my-life-but-i-lost-my-faith\" title=\"\">Lance Dodes</a> claimed in his 2014 book, The Sober Truth: Debunking the Bad Science Behind 12-Step Programs and the Rehab Industry, that it was effective for between only 5% and 8% of people.</p> <p>Whitaker, now 40, details her own path to recovery in Quit Like a Woman, which is part examination of how patriarchy drives women to drink and part practical guide on how to tackle addiction. She credits Allen Carr\u2019s manual The Easy Way to Control Alcohol with helping her break free aged 33, as well as therapy and meditation. Breathing exercises, using mantras, not drinking caffeine after noon, and getting at least seven hours of sleep are just some of the tips she recommends.</p> <p>Dejected by her experience with AA, she decided to create <a href=\"https://www.jointempest.com/\" title=\"\">Tempest, an online sobriety school</a> aimed at women and minority groups. She says it has a gentler approach, which focuses on seeing its users as \u201cwhole and perfect\u201d people living in a broken system. But it\u2019s not cheap \u2013 its eight-week programme costs $547 (\u00a3416), although it does offer a reduced rate of $197 for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p> <p>\u201cThere are very few things that are inherently built around the unique experience of what it means to be a woman,\u201d she says. \u201cWe assume our clients need to be built up, that they need love over punishment, that they need to learn how to exist within their bodies and feel safe within this world. It\u2019s a feminine-centric system, but men do very well in our programme.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Alcohol is the No 1 date rape drug. It is tied to sexual assault and a large portion of domestic violence</p> <footer> <cite>Holly Whitaker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rather than demanding that addicts go cold turkey and chastising them for slipping up, Tempest regards any lapses as part of the process. AA has been described as expecting<strong> </strong>total abstinence from its members, which Whitaker claims \u201ccreates too high a bar\u201d and people end up feeling \u201chelpless\u201d and \u201cdefeated\u201d if they fail to achieve this. A \u201cstop doing it\u201d approach, Whitaker believes, is \u201cmasculine-centric\u201d and implies that if you do slip up \u201cyou are kind of stupid\u201d. \u201cIn our model, it is about being trusted to make your own mistakes and to learn from them.\u201d</p> <p>Whether alcoholics should quit drinking completely or can drink in moderation has been much discussed. Researchers at the University of Gothenburg in <a href=\"https://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/news-calendar/News_detail/more-difficult-to-achieve-controlled-drinking-than-to-give-up-alcohol-entirely.cid1401674\" title=\"\">2016</a> found that 90% of patients who abstained were still sober two and a half years after treatment, compared with 50% of those who tried moderate drinking.</p> <p>One thing is clear: women are drinking more than ever. High-risk drinking, defined as having four or more drinks at least one day a week, rose for women by 58% from 2001 to 2013, according to a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2647079\" title=\"\">2017 study</a> by the journal JAMA Psychiatry. British women were found to drink an average of three drinks (defined as 10g of alcohol) a day in a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45283401\" title=\"\">2018 survey</a> and were ranked eighth in the world for high levels of drinking.</p> <p>Whitaker blames alcohol companies for this increased consumption. \u201cVery smart people with assloads of money, power and access benefit from \u2026 our believing that drinking is an act of empowerment for women, instead of what it is: a drug designed to keep us down, no matter how much we drink,\u201d she writes. For instance, there\u2019s the glorification of \u201cwine o\u2019clock\u201d \u2013 where women are encouraged to relax with some hard-earned drinks after a hectic day. Advertising campaigns focus on cosy girls\u2019 nights in, while busy parents refer to their daily glass of pinot grigio as \u201cmummy juice\u201d.</p> <p>Baileys sponsored the Women\u2019s prize for fiction between 2014 and 2017 while <a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/03/08/budweiser-inks-first-ever-sponsorship-women-s-football\" title=\"\">Budweiser is a partner</a> of the England women\u2019s football team. Smirnoff\u2019s Equalising Music initiative has been promoting gender equality in the music industry while Diageo, the alcoholic-drinks company (which owns Baileys and Smirnoff) is an official supporter of International Women\u2019s Day. This can backfire: BrewDog, a brewery based in Scotland, was derided after it relaunched its <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-alcohol-companies-are-using-international-womens-day-to-sell-more-drinks-to-women-113081\" title=\"\">Punk IPA as Pink IPA, and called it \u201cbeer for girls\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e15519c34e6715118d3fa6f548930b142c98e3a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e15519c34e6715118d3fa6f548930b142c98e3a2/0_61_5301_3180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holly Whitaker has not had a drink since 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holly Whitaker has not had a drink since 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there\u2019s the threat it poses to women\u2019s safety. \u201cIt\u2019s the No 1 date rape drug,\u201d says Whitaker. \u201cIt is tied to sexual assault and a large portion of domestic violence. It\u2019s something that we use without understanding the consequences of it.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/sep/22/alcohol-date-rape-drug-facilitated-sexual-assault-dfsa\" title=\"\">2005 study</a> into drug-facilitated sexual assault found that alcohol was the most commonly used substance in more than 1,000 cases. <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/compendium/focusonviolentcrimeandsexualoffences/2015-02-12/chapter5violentcrimeandsexualoffencesalcoholrelatedviolence\" title=\"\">Home Office figures</a> from 2013/14 revealed that 36% of domestic violence incidents were alcohol-related. For Whitaker, a patriarchal society has created an unbearable bind for women that drives many to drink. \u201cThere is this essential quality to a woman\u2019s existence where our roles are carved out for us. We are swimming in this cesspool of our own subservience. We know what we should look like. We know all of these things about what it means to make it.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Making it\u2019 looks like having a specific career, a marriage, being a mother or having all of those things and balancing them. If we can\u2019t or if we don\u2019t even fit into that picture, there\u2019s just this sense of consistently growing up with a wrongness. Trying to become what we\u2019re told we should become leads to an impossible situation that we have to manage with other external tools like drinking, drugs or food to make it work.\u201d</p> <p>Alcohol, she is convinced, will go the way of cigarettes. Once considered an innocuous habit, smoking is now banned in enclosed public spaces and packets come with graphic health warnings. But until then \u201cthere\u2019s a very large industry run by men where women and other demographics are targeted specifically, in ways that tell us that drinking is normal. If you can\u2019t drink, it\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Whitaker is content. She is not looking for anything or anyone to fill the void. Addiction, she says, is the best thing that ever happened to her. \u201cThis was an opportunity to look at the ways that I was in pain. It allowed me to unpack that and to start to heal.\u201d</p> <p>It took her six months to get sober, and she has not had a drink since 2013. Has she ever been tempted to relapse? \u201cI can say with certainty, I\u2019ll never have a drink again. I don\u2019t want to. I prefer this so much more.

      "bodyText": "When Holly Whitaker looks back on the many nights that would disappear in a boozy haze, it wasn\u2019t the anxiety and regret that made her realise she needed to get help for her drinking, but sheer exhaustion. Each weekend, while hungover, she would wearily erase all evidence of her drinking binges: the stains on her bed, the empty bottles, the rubbish bags. She was holding it together with a lucrative job as the director of a healthcare startup, had a great flat in San Francisco and a busy social life, but suddenly she just couldn\u2019t do it any more. \u201cWhen I binged, I would close my eyes while I did it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was trying to not see how horrific it was. I would go through this process of scrubbing it away, then presenting myself to the world and pretending that nothing was wrong. Then I had this moment when I couldn\u2019t not see it.\u201d She did what many people with a drinking problem do: she went to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). But, after several months of attending meetings, she realised that the 12-step programme wasn\u2019t working for her. The programme\u2019s guidelines, created in 1939, centre on appealing to a higher power and renouncing the ego. How, she wondered, could this possibly serve women or minorities who historically have been powerless? \u201cThese are rules written for men in the 1930s. They\u2019re not written for women. They\u2019re for the people who sit at the top of our society. The archetype is a man with an overdeveloped sense of owning the world. That\u2019s not women or any other marginalised human.\u201d Since it was founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio, AA has become the most popular addiction recovery programme in the world. While Whitaker is keen to point out that \u201cplenty of my friends have gotten sober through AA\u201d, it is not without its critics. Some have challenged its belief that alcoholism is a disease, while others have questioned the religious aspect of the organisation, which asks members to turn their lives over to a higher power as part of the 12 steps. Its success rate has also been disputed. A long-term study on AA (a free mutual-aid society that has about 40,000 members in the UK) by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in 2011 found that 49% of its members were still abstinent after eight years. Getting accurate figures for alcohol treatment programmes is hard because many participants want to remain anonymous, but a former Harvard psychiatry professor Lance Dodes claimed in his 2014 book, The Sober Truth: Debunking the Bad Science Behind 12-Step Programs and the Rehab Industry, that it was effective for between only 5% and 8% of people. Whitaker, now 40, details her own path to recovery in Quit Like a Woman, which is part examination of how patriarchy drives women to drink and part practical guide on how to tackle addiction. She credits Allen Carr\u2019s manual The Easy Way to Control Alcohol with helping her break free aged 33, as well as therapy and meditation. Breathing exercises, using mantras, not drinking caffeine after noon, and getting at least seven hours of sleep are just some of the tips she recommends. Dejected by her experience with AA, she decided to create Tempest, an online sobriety school aimed at women and minority groups. She says it has a gentler approach, which focuses on seeing its users as \u201cwhole and perfect\u201d people living in a broken system. But it\u2019s not cheap \u2013 its eight-week programme costs $547 (\u00a3416), although it does offer a reduced rate of $197 for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cThere are very few things that are inherently built around the unique experience of what it means to be a woman,\u201d she says. \u201cWe assume our clients need to be built up, that they need love over punishment, that they need to learn how to exist within their bodies and feel safe within this world. It\u2019s a feminine-centric system, but men do very well in our programme.\u201d Rather than demanding that addicts go cold turkey and chastising them for slipping up, Tempest regards any lapses as part of the process. AA has been described as expecting total abstinence from its members, which Whitaker claims \u201ccreates too high a bar\u201d and people end up feeling \u201chelpless\u201d and \u201cdefeated\u201d if they fail to achieve this. A \u201cstop doing it\u201d approach, Whitaker believes, is \u201cmasculine-centric\u201d and implies that if you do slip up \u201cyou are kind of stupid\u201d. \u201cIn our model, it is about being trusted to make your own mistakes and to learn from them.\u201d Whether alcoholics should quit drinking completely or can drink in moderation has been much discussed. Researchers at the University of Gothenburg in 2016 found that 90% of patients who abstained were still sober two and a half years after treatment, compared with 50% of those who tried moderate drinking. One thing is clear: women are drinking more than ever. High-risk drinking, defined as having four or more drinks at least one day a week, rose for women by 58% from 2001 to 2013, according to a 2017 study by the journal JAMA Psychiatry. British women were found to drink an average of three drinks (defined as 10g of alcohol) a day in a 2018 survey and were ranked eighth in the world for high levels of drinking. Whitaker blames alcohol companies for this increased consumption. \u201cVery smart people with assloads of money, power and access benefit from \u2026 our believing that drinking is an act of empowerment for women, instead of what it is: a drug designed to keep us down, no matter how much we drink,\u201d she writes. For instance, there\u2019s the glorification of \u201cwine o\u2019clock\u201d \u2013 where women are encouraged to relax with some hard-earned drinks after a hectic day. Advertising campaigns focus on cosy girls\u2019 nights in, while busy parents refer to their daily glass of pinot grigio as \u201cmummy juice\u201d. Baileys sponsored the Women\u2019s prize for fiction between 2014 and 2017 while Budweiser is a partner of the England women\u2019s football team. Smirnoff\u2019s Equalising Music initiative has been promoting gender equality in the music industry while Diageo, the alcoholic-drinks company (which owns Baileys and Smirnoff) is an official supporter of International Women\u2019s Day. This can backfire: BrewDog, a brewery based in Scotland, was derided after it relaunched its Punk IPA as Pink IPA, and called it \u201cbeer for girls\u201d. Then there\u2019s the threat it poses to women\u2019s safety. \u201cIt\u2019s the No 1 date rape drug,\u201d says Whitaker. \u201cIt is tied to sexual assault and a large portion of domestic violence. It\u2019s something that we use without understanding the consequences of it.\u201d A 2005 study into drug-facilitated sexual assault found that alcohol was the most commonly used substance in more than 1,000 cases. Home Office figures from 2013/14 revealed that 36% of domestic violence incidents were alcohol-related. For Whitaker, a patriarchal society has created an unbearable bind for women that drives many to drink. \u201cThere is this essential quality to a woman\u2019s existence where our roles are carved out for us. We are swimming in this cesspool of our own subservience. We know what we should look like. We know all of these things about what it means to make it. \u201c\u2018Making it\u2019 looks like having a specific career, a marriage, being a mother or having all of those things and balancing them. If we can\u2019t or if we don\u2019t even fit into that picture, there\u2019s just this sense of consistently growing up with a wrongness. Trying to become what we\u2019re told we should become leads to an impossible situation that we have to manage with other external tools like drinking, drugs or food to make it work.\u201d Alcohol, she is convinced, will go the way of cigarettes. Once considered an innocuous habit, smoking is now banned in enclosed public spaces and packets come with graphic health warnings. But until then \u201cthere\u2019s a very large industry run by men where women and other demographics are targeted specifically, in ways that tell us that drinking is normal. If you can\u2019t drink, it\u2019s your fault.\u201d For now, Whitaker is content. She is not looking for anything or anyone to fill the void. Addiction, she says, is the best thing that ever happened to her. \u201cThis was an opportunity to look at the ways that I was in pain. It allowed me to unpack that and to start to heal.\u201d It took her six months to get sober, and she has not had a drink since 2013.

The film plays with colour palette and aspect ratio, which, combined with a sleek, bassy soundtrack from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/trent-reznor\">Trent Reznor</a> and Atticus Ross, captures the rush of teenage abandon.

That tour-de-force moment, which we can\u2019t get into without breaking the law of spoilers, would alter the direction of the film entirely, abruptly switching its lead from Harrison to fellow newcomer Taylor Russell, and transforming a joyful tale of young romance into a bruising one of violence and its consequences. If Waves is a film of two halves, then this jaw-dropping scene, lasting just a few minutes, is its crucial pivot. \u201cEven A24 was scared!\u201d says Harrison. (That\u2019s A24 \u2013 the risk-taking production company behind Moonlight and Shults\u2019s second film, It Comes at Night.) \u201cBut I was like: \u2018No!

      "body": "<p>It was a few hours into his first <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ayahuasca#uses\">ayahuasca treatment</a> that Kerry Rhodes vomited a foetus into a bucket and found truth. The former <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/player/kerryrhodes/2506460/careerstats\">New York Jets and Arizona Cardinals star</a> began the treatment, a ceremony that goes overnight and typically lasts seven to eight hours, with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. \u201cI didn\u2019t really knowing what I was doing,\u201d he says on the phone from his home in LA. Within minutes the hallucinations had begun. \u201cOnce it kicks in there are prisms and shapes and stuff like that, I could see visually stunning stuff. I literally had to tell myself, \u2018You\u2019re OK, you\u2019re good, this is what you signed up for.\u2019\u201d The first \u201cpurge\u201d \u2013 vomit \u2013 into a bucket brought a particularly bizarre vision: Rhodes, at his playing peak one of the NFL\u2019s pre-eminent safeties, was brought face to face with a foetus. At the conclusion of the eight-hour ceremony, Rhodes\u2019s shaman assured him the vision had been a \u201cgood thing\u201d and that he needed to connect with the foetus during the next treatment the following night.</p> <p>The next night, Rhodes began vomiting again - \u201cyou\u2019re pretty coherent, you go in and out of it\u201d - and the emetic foetus reappeared. Describing what happened next, he says: \u201cI go in and I connect with it. Cut to: I wake up and I\u2019m a baby in the crib, and I\u2019m looking out, and I\u2019m crying, and in that moment nobody picked me up. And I had a moment, half in the hallucination, half in the treatment room, where I was like, \u2018Oh shit, I don\u2019t need anyone to pick me up,\u2019 and I put my thumb in my mouth, and I stopped crying. I realized that I didn\u2019t need anyone. The thumb grew and it killed that moment \u2013 it killed that need.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/13/houston-texans-kansas-city-chiefs-nfl-playoffs-mahomes-watson\">Chiefs-Texans was a classic, the future ... and a coaching apocalypse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was, Rhodes says, an especially important realization to come to. \u201cNeediness\u201d was the word that punctuated his nine-year career in the NFL. Pro Football Focus <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/10477666/kerry-rhodes-believe-was-blacklisted\">named</a> him the fourth-best safety in the league at the conclusion of the 2012 season, but Rhodes refused a new deal from the Cardinals (\u201cIt was a pay cut so I said no\u201d) and trialed, unsuccessfully, with the Cincinnati Bengals and the New York Giants. He never played professional football again, and the words of a former coach followed him into retirement. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t work, and he was a Hollywood type, flashy and needing attention,\u201d former Jets coach Rex Ryan <a href=\"https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/27/jets-rex-ryan-dogs-giants-kerry-rhodes-in-new-book/\">wrote</a> of his former charge in the 2011 memoir Play Like You Mean It.</p> <p>Rhodes does not necessarily agree that neediness was the proximate cause of the slightly abrupt end to his NFL career (\u201cIt was a difficult market for safeties at that time, and once you get to a certain age your value dips pretty suddenly,\u201d he offers by way of an alternative explanation), but he does concede that it\u2019s held him back in other parts of his life. Ayahuasca allowed him to see that. \u201cMy idea of love was [other people] picking me up, showing up, telling me I\u2019m great,\u201d he says. \u201cAll those things showed themselves in one ceremony. I realized I was dependent on others when I didn\u2019t need to be.\u201d</p> <p>Rhodes\u2019s experiences with ayahuasca are the subject of <a href=\"https://themedicinedocumentary.com/\">The Medicine</a>, a new documentary which documents his journey to Costa Rica for a two-day treatment program under the guidance of Colombian shaman Taita Juanito Guillermo Chindoy Chindoy. Disappointingly the documentary doesn\u2019t show Rhodes purging his imaginary baby into the bucket \u2013 the vision cuts out just as his treatment begins, in accordance with the shaman\u2019s instructions \u2013 but it does give viewers a glimpse into the preparatory rituals: in one memorable scene the shaman blows tobacco into Rhodes\u2019s nostrils and we see the 200lbs former defensive back with tears streaming down his face, utterly vulnerable. (The main ceremony, Rhodes says, was \u201cmuch more difficult.\u201d) Ayahuasca, often mislabeled as a drug, is an entheogenic plant tea made with the stalks of the <em>Banisteriopsis caapi</em> vine and other ingredients. The ayahuasca plant itself <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jpag4p/america-is-getting-its-first-legal-ayahuasca-church\">is not illegal</a> in the US but its psychoactive component, DMT, is. Rhodes has been back to Costa Rica, where ayahuasca treatments are legal, once since his introduction to the brew, and maintains regular contact with Taita Juanito.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bhZAvMXugQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6bhZAvMXugQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Rhodes has kept busy in the years since his playing days came to an end: he plays the role of police office Rick Connor on the O Network\u2019s ongoing soap opera If Loving You Is Wrong, he produced and acted in the 2017 comedy horror film Tragedy Girls, and he\u2019s working on the script for his next film. But as for many former athletes, filling the void left after a young adulthood of full commitment to professional sporting competition has not always been easy. He\u2019s battled depression, forgetfulness and mood swings, and is naturally concerned about <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/health/cte-nfl-players-brains-study/index.html\">the potential trauma done to his brain</a> from a decade of pro football. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a control freak in every aspect of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cThe success I had in sport was all about control.\u201d Once he retired, \u201cI knew that I couldn\u2019t control things about how my body would react to years on the field. I\u2019m aware of <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/cte/about/frequently-asked-questions/\">the symptoms of CTE</a> [chronic traumatic encephalopathy] so I monitor for those \u2013 I do a lot of puzzles and mind games to keep my mind sharp, I do baseline tests with the doctor to monitor my cognitive health.\u201d</p> <p>Ayahuasca, Rhodes says, offered another way to reinvigorate his mind and insure against the onset of CTE. The real power of ayahuasca, some believe is in its effect on hippocampal neurogenesis: recent research led by <a href=\"https://beckleyfoundation.org/science/collaborations/beckley-sant-pau-hospital-research-programme/\">Dr Jordi Riba</a>, a Barcelona-based pharmacologist, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05407-9\">suggests</a> that certain compounds present in the psychedelic brew actually stimulate the birth of new neurons, potentially offering a treatment that can help replace damaged or dead brain cells. This aspect of ayahuasca remains relatively unexplored, however, and approved pharmaceutical applications are not yet available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even after a handful of exposures, Rhodes says he has seen a marked improvement in his health: he now suffers far fewer mood swings than previously and feels generally \u201cway more alert, way more open, way more present\u201d (it should also be noted that, like all hallucinogens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/canadian-who-killed-brit-on-spiritual-retreat-says-it-was-kill-or-be-killed\">ayahuasca has associated risks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/31/ayahuasca-tourists-risk-death-henry-miller-colombia\">should be treated with caution</a>). But the larger benefit has been in the realm of emotion and self-understanding to which, Rhodes says, ayahuasca has given him access: \u201cYou have all these answers that are revealed to you. During the treatment, you\u2019re peeled away and you have no choice but to confront the truth. And once it\u2019s over, you get this knowledge, this access to this space that you\u2019d forgotten about.\u201d For an athlete who was, in his own words, \u201ctaught to hide my emotions, to bury my feelings about everything deep inside,\u201d the cognitive opening engineered by ayahuasca has been \u201cincredibly powerful.\u201d</p> <p>Rhodes concedes that \u201cthings were always a little weird for me with the NFL: it\u2019s such a macho league, it\u2019s such a toxic masculine environment.\u201d But he hopes his example, quite apart from providing an advertisement for the neurological benefits of ayahuasca, will also help players \u2013 both current and former \u2013 unlock all the non-footballing parts of their potential and creativity that years at the line of scrimmage may have suppressed. \u201cOnce your career is done, it\u2019s done - and for many of us it can be a real struggle to come to terms with that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there are other things we can do, we have other talents we can contribute to the world. We are not robots.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a few hours into his first ayahuasca treatment that Kerry Rhodes vomited a foetus into a bucket and found truth. The former New York Jets and Arizona Cardinals star began the treatment, a ceremony that goes overnight and typically lasts seven to eight hours, with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. \u201cI didn\u2019t really knowing what I was doing,\u201d he says on the phone from his home in LA. Within minutes the hallucinations had begun. \u201cOnce it kicks in there are prisms and shapes and stuff like that, I could see visually stunning stuff. I literally had to tell myself, \u2018You\u2019re OK, you\u2019re good, this is what you signed up for.\u2019\u201d The first \u201cpurge\u201d \u2013 vomit \u2013 into a bucket brought a particularly bizarre vision: Rhodes, at his playing peak one of the NFL\u2019s pre-eminent safeties, was brought face to face with a foetus. At the conclusion of the eight-hour ceremony, Rhodes\u2019s shaman assured him the vision had been a \u201cgood thing\u201d and that he needed to connect with the foetus during the next treatment the following night. The next night, Rhodes began vomiting again - \u201cyou\u2019re pretty coherent, you go in and out of it\u201d - and the emetic foetus reappeared. Describing what happened next, he says: \u201cI go in and I connect with it. Cut to: I wake up and I\u2019m a baby in the crib, and I\u2019m looking out, and I\u2019m crying, and in that moment nobody picked me up. And I had a moment, half in the hallucination, half in the treatment room, where I was like, \u2018Oh shit, I don\u2019t need anyone to pick me up,\u2019 and I put my thumb in my mouth, and I stopped crying. I realized that I didn\u2019t need anyone. The thumb grew and it killed that moment \u2013 it killed that need.\u201d This was, Rhodes says, an especially important realization to come to. \u201cNeediness\u201d was the word that punctuated his nine-year career in the NFL. Pro Football Focus named him the fourth-best safety in the league at the conclusion of the 2012 season, but Rhodes refused a new deal from the Cardinals (\u201cIt was a pay cut so I said no\u201d) and trialed, unsuccessfully, with the Cincinnati Bengals and the New York Giants. He never played professional football again, and the words of a former coach followed him into retirement. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t work, and he was a Hollywood type, flashy and needing attention,\u201d former Jets coach Rex Ryan wrote of his former charge in the 2011 memoir Play Like You Mean It. Rhodes does not necessarily agree that neediness was the proximate cause of the slightly abrupt end to his NFL career (\u201cIt was a difficult market for safeties at that time, and once you get to a certain age your value dips pretty suddenly,\u201d he offers by way of an alternative explanation), but he does concede that it\u2019s held him back in other parts of his life. Ayahuasca allowed him to see that. \u201cMy idea of love was [other people] picking me up, showing up, telling me I\u2019m great,\u201d he says. \u201cAll those things showed themselves in one ceremony. I realized I was dependent on others when I didn\u2019t need to be.\u201d Rhodes\u2019s experiences with ayahuasca are the subject of The Medicine, a new documentary which documents his journey to Costa Rica for a two-day treatment program under the guidance of Colombian shaman Taita Juanito Guillermo Chindoy Chindoy. Disappointingly the documentary doesn\u2019t show Rhodes purging his imaginary baby into the bucket \u2013 the vision cuts out just as his treatment begins, in accordance with the shaman\u2019s instructions \u2013 but it does give viewers a glimpse into the preparatory rituals: in one memorable scene the shaman blows tobacco into Rhodes\u2019s nostrils and we see the 200lbs former defensive back with tears streaming down his face, utterly vulnerable. (The main ceremony, Rhodes says, was \u201cmuch more difficult.\u201d) Ayahuasca, often mislabeled as a drug, is an entheogenic plant tea made with the stalks of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine and other ingredients. The ayahuasca plant itself is not illegal in the US but its psychoactive component, DMT, is. Rhodes has been back to Costa Rica, where ayahuasca treatments are legal, once since his introduction to the brew, and maintains regular contact with Taita Juanito. Rhodes has kept busy in the years since his playing days came to an end: he plays the role of police office Rick Connor on the O Network\u2019s ongoing soap opera If Loving You Is Wrong, he produced and acted in the 2017 comedy horror film Tragedy Girls, and he\u2019s working on the script for his next film. But as for many former athletes, filling the void left after a young adulthood of full commitment to professional sporting competition has not always been easy. He\u2019s battled depression, forgetfulness and mood swings, and is naturally concerned about the potential trauma done to his brain from a decade of pro football. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a control freak in every aspect of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cThe success I had in sport was all about control.\u201d Once he retired, \u201cI knew that I couldn\u2019t control things about how my body would react to years on the field. I\u2019m aware of the symptoms of CTE [chronic traumatic encephalopathy] so I monitor for those \u2013 I do a lot of puzzles and mind games to keep my mind sharp, I do baseline tests with the doctor to monitor my cognitive health.\u201d Ayahuasca, Rhodes says, offered another way to reinvigorate his mind and insure against the onset of CTE. The real power of ayahuasca, some believe is in its effect on hippocampal neurogenesis: recent research led by Dr Jordi Riba, a Barcelona-based pharmacologist, suggests that certain compounds present in the psychedelic brew actually stimulate the birth of new neurons, potentially offering a treatment that can help replace damaged or dead brain cells. This aspect of ayahuasca remains relatively unexplored, however, and approved pharmaceutical applications are not yet available. Even after a handful of exposures, Rhodes says he has seen a marked improvement in his health: he now suffers far fewer mood swings than previously and feels generally \u201cway more alert, way more open, way more present\u201d (it should also be noted that, like all hallucinogens, ayahuasca has associated risks and should be treated with caution). But the larger benefit has been in the realm of emotion and self-understanding to which, Rhodes says, ayahuasca has given him access: \u201cYou have all these answers that are revealed to you. During the treatment, you\u2019re peeled away and you have no choice but to confront the truth. And once it\u2019s over, you get this knowledge, this access to this space that you\u2019d forgotten about.\u201d For an athlete who was, in his own words, \u201ctaught to hide my emotions, to bury my feelings about everything deep inside,\u201d the cognitive opening engineered by ayahuasca has been \u201cincredibly powerful.\u201d Rhodes concedes that \u201cthings were always a little weird for me with the NFL: it\u2019s such a macho league, it\u2019s such a toxic masculine environment.\u201d But he hopes his example, quite apart from providing an advertisement for the neurological benefits of ayahuasca, will also help players \u2013 both current and former \u2013 unlock all the non-footballing parts of their potential and creativity that years at the line of scrimmage may have suppressed. \u201cOnce your career is done, it\u2019s done - and for many of us it can be a real struggle to come to terms with that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there are other things we can do, we have other talents we can contribute to the world. We are not robots.\u201d",

Meghan was due to join by conference call from Canada, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/10/harry-meghan-returns-canada-queen-demands-workable-solution\">where she has been since Friday</a>, with the couple\u2019s son, Archie, and their two dogs.</p> \n<p>The couple want to \u201cstep back\u201d as senior royals, perform royal duties \u201cas called upon\u201d, continue their charitable work and, crucially, be allowed to earn a income.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/duke-and-duchess-of-sussex-defied-queen-over-statement-release\">The palace had been blindsided by the timing of the couple\u2019s announcement</a>, made without warning, which left family members feeling \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201churt\u201d according to sources.</p> \n<p>Ahead of Monday\u2019s meeting William and Harry broke their silence over the royal crisis to condemn speculation about their relationship as \u201coffensive and potentially harmful\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a show of unity, the brothers jointly attacked a UK newspaper report, thought to be in the Times, though senior aides did not specify. A statement, issued through the princes\u2019 respective offices, said: \u201cDespite clear denials, a false story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of such inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful\u201d.</p> \n<p>Monday\u2019s Times cited a source claiming Harry and Meghan regarded themselves as having been pushed away by what they saw as a \u201cbullying\u201d attitude from William. It reported the source, said to be close to the couple, as saying William was insufficiently welcoming to Meghan when she first started dating Harry. The source claimed that William\u2019s attitude resulted from the competitive nature of his relationship with his younger brother.</p> \n<p>The last year has seen repeated reports of a suspected rift between the brothers. Harry then appeared to confirm the speculation when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/20/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-warned-tabloids-destroy-my-life\">he told an ITV documentary in October</a> that the brothers, once so close, were on \u201cdifferent paths\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is unusual for palace aides to issue such vehement public denials on such personal matters. The fact they did so is indicative of just how sensitive feelings are within the family as they seek to reconcile differences and contain the crisis to prevent further damage to the monarchy. The palace is also desperate to avoid a repeat of any narrative such as the so-called \u201cWar of the Waleses\u201d, which accompanied the breakdown of Charles and Diana\u2019s marriage.</p> \n<p>Final decisions yet to be made on the Sussex\u2019s severance from full-time royal duties will have huge implications for the shape of the monarchy, and for the future roles of young royals including Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, the youngest of the Cambridge\u2019s three children.</p> \n<p>No details were given of issues discussed, but they were likely to have included how much time the couple intend to spend in Canada, where their son will be raised, what royal duties they will still perform, and what commercial activities would it be feasible for them to undertake in order to become self-funding yet not risk tarnishing the royal brand.</p> \n<p>One possible blueprint regarding how the couple could approach commercial enterprises are guidelines devised almost 20 years ago after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/08/monarchy.focus\">Countess of Wessex was accused of cashing in on her royal status</a> in a bid to win business for her PR firm from a \u201cfake sheikh\u201d undercover reporter.</p> \n<p>Those rules advise royals to first consult the Lord Chamberlain \u2013 the most senior official of the royal household \u2013 before taking on any new business activity. They also require that anyone connected with a business activity \u201cshould be carefully briefed not to try to exploit , either deliberately or inadvertently, the member of the royal family\u2019s position, associations or access.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both Edward, who worked in television, and Sophie, who worked in PR, stepped down from their jobs after aides accepted they worked in areas prone to accusations of exploitation.</p> \n<p>The move has raised questions over whether Canadian taxpayers would have to pay for the couple\u2019s security costs during their time in North America but the country\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau said no discussions had taken place.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c7070b8d-ed1b-4632-9ffa-36232a38c862\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ed7wGcuM5rk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking to Canadian broadcaster Global News on Monday, he said: \u201cThere will be many discussions to come on how that works.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of decisions to be taken by the royal family and by the Sussexes themselves as to what level of engagement they choose to have and these are things that we are supportive of.\u201d </p> \n<p>Earlier, Penny Junor, a royal biographer, said the Queen\u2019s statement on Monday was \u201cfriendly and warm\u201d and gave the couple space to find some perspective.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it will take the pressure off them. I think they\u2019re in a very vulnerable state at the moment. I think they\u2019re unhappy, they feel isolated and unloved, unappreciated and they needed careful handling,\u201d she said. \u201cMy reading from that statement is that the family has been sensitive to their vulnerability.\u201d <br></p>",

But there were \u201ccomplex matters\u201d still to resolve, and \u201cmore work to be done\u201d as she said she wants final decisions to be reached in the coming days. The Queen\u2019s statement came after 90 minutes of talks, which began against the backdrop of Prince William and Prince Harry attempting to stem rancorous speculation about their relationship in a joint statement. Shortly after the Sandringham summit ended, the Queen issued a personal and informal statement in which she also struck a conciliatory tone. \u201cToday my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family. \u201cMy family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan\u2019s desire to create a new life as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the royal family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family\u201d. \u201cHarry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives. \u201cIt has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK. \u201cThese are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days\u201d. In a highly unusual move Harry and Meghan were not referred to as the duke and duchess in the statement, only as the Sussexes and by their first names, raising questions about whether they will retain their titles in the future. Monday\u2019s unprecedented summit was attended by the Queen, Charles, William and Harry, and was the first time the senior royals had met since the Sussexes made their shock statement last Wednesday. Meghan was due to join by conference call from Canada, where she has been since Friday, with the couple\u2019s son, Archie, and their two dogs. The couple want to \u201cstep back\u201d as senior royals, perform royal duties \u201cas called upon\u201d, continue their charitable work and, crucially, be allowed to earn a income. The palace had been blindsided by the timing of the couple\u2019s announcement, made without warning, which left family members feeling \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201churt\u201d according to sources. Ahead of Monday\u2019s meeting William and Harry broke their silence over the royal crisis to condemn speculation about their relationship as \u201coffensive and potentially harmful\u201d. In a show of unity, the brothers jointly attacked a UK newspaper report, thought to be in the Times, though senior aides did not specify. A statement, issued through the princes\u2019 respective offices, said: \u201cDespite clear denials, a false story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge\u201d. \u201cFor brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of such inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful\u201d. Monday\u2019s Times cited a source claiming Harry and Meghan regarded themselves as having been pushed away by what they saw as a \u201cbullying\u201d attitude from William. It reported the source, said to be close to the couple, as saying William was insufficiently welcoming to Meghan when she first started dating Harry. The source claimed that William\u2019s attitude resulted from the competitive nature of his relationship with his younger brother. The last year has seen repeated reports of a suspected rift between the brothers. Harry then appeared to confirm the speculation when he told an ITV documentary in October that the brothers, once so close, were on \u201cdifferent paths\u201d. It is unusual for palace aides to issue such vehement public denials on such personal matters. The fact they did so is indicative of just how sensitive feelings are within the family as they seek to reconcile differences and contain the crisis to prevent further damage to the monarchy. The palace is also desperate to avoid a repeat of any narrative such as the so-called \u201cWar of the Waleses\u201d, which accompanied the breakdown of Charles and Diana\u2019s marriage. Final decisions yet to be made on the Sussex\u2019s severance from full-time royal duties will have huge implications for the shape of the monarchy, and for the future roles of young royals including Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, the youngest of the Cambridge\u2019s three children. No details were given of issues discussed, but they were likely to have included how much time the couple intend to spend in Canada, where their son will be raised, what royal duties they will still perform, and what commercial activities would it be feasible for them to undertake in order to become self-funding yet not risk tarnishing the royal brand. One possible blueprint regarding how the couple could approach commercial enterprises are guidelines devised almost 20 years ago after the Countess of Wessex was accused of cashing in on her royal status in a bid to win business for her PR firm from a \u201cfake sheikh\u201d undercover reporter. Those rules advise royals to first consult the Lord Chamberlain \u2013 the most senior official of the royal household \u2013 before taking on any new business activity. They also require that anyone connected with a business activity \u201cshould be carefully briefed not to try to exploit , either deliberately or inadvertently, the member of the royal family\u2019s position, associations or access.\u201d Both Edward, who worked in television, and Sophie, who worked in PR, stepped down from their jobs after aides accepted they worked in areas prone to accusations of exploitation. The move has raised questions over whether Canadian taxpayers would have to pay for the couple\u2019s security costs during their time in North America but the country\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau said no discussions had taken place. Speaking to Canadian broadcaster Global News on Monday, he said: \u201cThere will be many discussions to come on how that works. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of decisions to be taken by the royal family and by the Sussexes themselves as to what level of engagement they choose to have and these are things that we are supportive of.\u201d Earlier, Penny Junor, a royal biographer, said the Queen\u2019s statement on Monday was \u201cfriendly and warm\u201d and gave the couple space to find some perspective. \u201cI think it will take the pressure off them. I think they\u2019re in a very vulnerable state at the moment. I think they\u2019re unhappy, they feel isolated and unloved, unappreciated and they needed careful handling,\u201d she said. \u201cMy reading from that statement is that the family has been sensitive to their vulnerability.\u201d",

At least $70m has been raised for the RFS, other state fire services, the Red Cross and wildlife charities, as part of a global fundraising effort during Australia\u2019s horror bushfire season. The RFS has received tens of millions of dollars \u2013 including Barber\u2019s $50m fund and money raised through fundraisers promoted by Chris Hemsworth, Margot Robbie, and Prince Harry and Meghan. But legal experts say donors should be aware that money given to the RFS trustee cannot be used to help bushfire victims or recovery efforts.

The Victorian and South Australian governments have set up centralised funds that can collect donations and distribute charitable grants to a range of causes. The Victorian Bushfire Appeal is a fund endorsed by the Victorian government and managed by Bendigo Bank that will give out grants approved by an advisory panel. In South Australia, a similar fund has been created, called the State Emergency Relief Fund. Other celebrities and organisations have donated to the bushfire relief effort in various ways. Publicly announced donations \u2013 not including donations from individual members of the public, or ongoing pledges based on future events \u2013 have totalled more than $70m. The mining billionaire Andrew Forrest announced a $10m donation to the Red Cross and Salvation Army. He is also spending $10m to build a \u201cvolunteer army\u201d of people to help rebuild communities, and $50m for research on bushfire prevention through his Minderoo Foundation. The Amazon chief executive and billionaire Jeff Bezos announced his company would donate $1m, spread across a range of charities including the Red Cross, Salvation Army, the NSW animal rescue service Wires, and non-specific \u201cRural and Country Fire Services\u201d. The AFL has donated $2.5m \u2013 $1m to the Red Cross and $1.5m into a new Community Relief Fund set up by the league that will help local communities rebuild football clubs. The rock band Metallica donated $750,000 \u2013 split between the RFS and the Victorian CFA, Kylie Jenner has donated $1m split across five firefighting services, while the Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton donated $750,000 to Wires, WWF Australia and the Rural Fire Service.",

The decision to drop the designation comes ahead of the announcement of a trade deal between the two sides, expected on Wednesday. The trade dispute has rocked US manufacturing and caused an economic slowdown in China. The treasury department made the move in its currency report on Monday afternoon, its first public analysis since the US labeled Beijing a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d last August. That designation, the first the US had made against China since 1994, escalated the long-running trade dispute between the two countries with Beijing accusing the US of \u201cdeliberately destroying international order\u201d and undermining world stability. Senior Chinese officials arrived in Washington on Monday to finalize the \u201cphase one\u201d trade agreement, which will be signed at the White House. Last month, the US and China agreed to a partial trade deal with Beijing pledging to purchase up to $200bn of American products over the next two years, including agricultural goods from the US\u2019s hard-hit farmers. Donald Trump has long argued that China undervalues its currency in order to game international trade, charging the country was perpetrating one of the \u201cgreatest thefts in the history of the world\u201d. But the dispute has hurt both sides. On Monday the car giant Ford said its China sales had fallen for the third year in a row in 2019, dropping to less than half of what it sold at its peak in 2016.

Colombia, where targeted violence against community leaders opposing environmentally destructive mega-projects has spiraled since the 2016 peace accords, was the bloodiest nation with 106 murders in 2019. The Philippines was the second deadliest country with 43 killings, followed by Honduras, Brazil and Mexico. 2019 was characterized by waves of social uprisings demanding political and economic changes across the globe from Iraq and Lebanon in the Middle East to Hong Kong and India in Asia and Chile in the Americas. The report by Front Line Defenders (FLD) details the physical assaults, defamation campaigns, digital security threats, judicial harassment, and gender-based attacks faced by human rights defenders across the world, who were on the frontline of protests against deep seated inequalities, corruption and authoritarianism. In the cases for which the data is available, the report found: 85% of those killed last year had previously been threatened either individually or as part of the community or group in which they worked. 13% of those reported killed were women. 40% of those killed worked on land, indigenous peoples and environmental issues. In nearly all countries that experienced mass protests last year, human rights defenders \u2013 who mobilized marches, documented police and military abuses, and helped citizens who were injured or arrested \u2013 were specifically targeted. For instance, in Chile, in the biggest anti-government protests since the end of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship, at least 23 people were killed and 2,300 injured, with scores blinded by non-lethal projectiles.

      "bodyText": "Two of Australia\u2019s biggest insurers, Suncorp and IAG, have temporarily stopped selling insurance policies across large swathes of Victoria and some areas in New South Wales affected by bushfires. As of 1.30pm on Tuesday, Suncorp, which sells insurance under its own name and other brands including Aami and GIO, had 41 postcodes in Victoria and six in NSW under embargo, a spokeswoman said. An IAG spokesman said that yesterday afternoon the company, which operates under brand names including NRMA Insurance and CGU, had 20 postcodes under embargo across the two states. Embargoes are a common industry practice when insurers decide either not to sell new policies in disaster areas or to deny claims on new policies in such areas. This is done to stop people from panic-buying insurance at the last moment before their homes are destroyed. Both Suncorp and IAG review their embargoes daily and Suncorp\u2019s spokeswoman stressed that the number of embargoes could change quickly, telling Guardian Australia that 90 were lifted on Monday and another 18 on Tuesday. \u201cWe are constantly reviewing areas that are embargoed and aim to lift restrictions once the imminent threat has passed,\u201d she said. IAG\u2019s spokesman said the company would still sell insurance policies to embargoed areas. \u201cHowever, they won\u2019t be able to make a claim for the specific risk that is included in the embargo until that embargo is lifted,\u201d he said Since 8 November, 13,750 bushfire insurance claims have been made, totalling $1.34bn, Insurance Council of Australia statistics show. The ratings agency Moody\u2019s has pointed to Suncorp and IAG as the two insurers likely to take the biggest financial hits from the fires. On Tuesday Moody\u2019s issued a detailed report on Suncorp in which it said the company was taking heavy losses from the fires but \u201cSuncorp\u2019s reinsurance programs will mitigate the risk of further losses in the second half\u201d of the year. Another big insurer, QBE, declined to say how many areas it had under embargo. \u201cThere are no bushfire-prone areas in Australia where QBE would not provide insurance and we welcome customers from these locales,\u201d a spokeswoman said. A Comminsure spokeswoman said the company had no areas under embargo. \u201cThese are constantly monitored and only put in place as a measure of last resort where a bushfire is reaching an emergency warning level,\u201d she said. Westpac said it did not use embargoes but instead imposed a seven-day waiting period before new customers could claim on home, contents and landlord insurance policies. \u201cThese waiting periods apply irrespective of whether there is a current natural disaster,\u201d Sue Houghton, Westpac\u2019s general manager of insurance, said. As Guardian Australia reported on Friday, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is closely monitoring bushfire insurance, demanding a list of information about individual property claims from the industry.",

      "body": "<p>Gambling businesses are to be banned from allowing consumers in Britain to use credit cards to bet from 14 April, the Gambling Commission has announced.</p> <p>The move comes two years after charity groups including GambleAware and Citizens Advice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/ban-credit-cards-for-online-gambling-says-government-review\">urged the government to implement the policy</a> to protect people from sliding into addiction.</p> <p>Major betting websites including PokerStars, Betfair, 888 and Bet365 all allow their customers to make deposits online using credit cards, which has led to warnings from campaigners that gamblers risk racking up huge debts.</p> <p>Estimates from UK Finance, the trade body for banks and the finance industry, suggest that 800,000 consumers use credit cards to gamble. According to the commission, 22% of people paying for online bets with credit cards are classed as problem gamblers. </p> <p>Last year, the Guardian reported on the case of a problem gambler who used nine credit cards to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/22/online-casinos-ignored-obvious-signs-addiction-gambler\">spend hundreds of thousands of pounds</a> with online casinos, who she claimed ignored her obvious signs of a spiralling addiction. Her losses included \u00a354,000 in an overnight spree when she was allowed to place bets worth more than \u00a3380,000 on one website in a single session.</p> <p>Neil McArthur, the Gambling Commission\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cCredit card gambling can lead to significant financial harm. The ban that we have announced today should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have.\u201d</p> <p>The consultation that led to the commission\u2019s decision included e-wallets, indicating that payment services such as PayPal will probably be included in the ban. The Guardian revealed last year that such providers had allowed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/17/paypal-problem-gamblers-misuse-avoid-bank-limits\">problem gamblers to circumvent banking limits</a> and spend up to \u00a3150,000 a day.</p> <p>The culture minister, Helen Whately, said: \u201cThere is clear evidence of harm from consumers betting with money they do not have, so it is absolutely right that we act decisively to protect them.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past year we have introduced a wave of tougher measures, including cutting the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, bringing in tighter age and identity checks for online gambling and expanding national specialist support through the NHS Long Term Plan.</p> <p>\u201cWe have also secured a series of commitments from five leading gambling operators that will include \u00a3100m funding towards treatment for problem gamblers.</p> <p>\u201cBut there is more to do. We will be carrying out a review of the Gambling Act to ensure it is fit for the digital age and we will be launching a new nationwide addiction strategy in 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Eytan Alexander, the managing director of the addiction treatment firm UKAT and a former gambling addict, welcomed the move to ban credit cards, but said other measures were needed to protect consumers.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a relief to hear that positive steps are being taken and I truly believe it will help current and future problem gamblers who are gambling with money they don\u2019t necessarily have.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, at UKAT, what we\u2019re keen to see are steps being taken to target the VIP schemes which reward gamblers with celebrity-lifestyle perks for their high and regular bets. This could encourage younger, more vulnerable gamblers to gamble to excess in order to reach VIP status. We\u2019d encourage the Gambling Commission to take a hard and fast line on this<em>.\u201d </em></p> <p>Brigid Simmonds, the head of the Betting and Gaming Council, which represents the industry, said: \u201cWe will implement a ban on credit cards and indeed our members will go further to study and improve the early identification of those at risk.</p> <p>\u201cThe use of credit cards were previously used as a potential marker of harm which might lead to further intervention with customers.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gambling businesses are to be banned from allowing consumers in Britain to use credit cards to bet from 14 April, the Gambling Commission has announced. The move comes two years after charity groups including GambleAware and Citizens Advice urged the government to implement the policy to protect people from sliding into addiction. Major betting websites including PokerStars, Betfair, 888 and Bet365 all allow their customers to make deposits online using credit cards, which has led to warnings from campaigners that gamblers risk racking up huge debts. Estimates from UK Finance, the trade body for banks and the finance industry, suggest that 800,000 consumers use credit cards to gamble. According to the commission, 22% of people paying for online bets with credit cards are classed as problem gamblers. Last year, the Guardian reported on the case of a problem gambler who used nine credit cards to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds with online casinos, who she claimed ignored her obvious signs of a spiralling addiction. Her losses included \u00a354,000 in an overnight spree when she was allowed to place bets worth more than \u00a3380,000 on one website in a single session. Neil McArthur, the Gambling Commission\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cCredit card gambling can lead to significant financial harm. The ban that we have announced today should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have.\u201d The consultation that led to the commission\u2019s decision included e-wallets, indicating that payment services such as PayPal will probably be included in the ban. The Guardian revealed last year that such providers had allowed problem gamblers to circumvent banking limits and spend up to \u00a3150,000 a day. The culture minister, Helen Whately, said: \u201cThere is clear evidence of harm from consumers betting with money they do not have, so it is absolutely right that we act decisively to protect them. \u201cIn the past year we have introduced a wave of tougher measures, including cutting the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, bringing in tighter age and identity checks for online gambling and expanding national specialist support through the NHS Long Term Plan. \u201cWe have also secured a series of commitments from five leading gambling operators that will include \u00a3100m funding towards treatment for problem gamblers. \u201cBut there is more to do. We will be carrying out a review of the Gambling Act to ensure it is fit for the digital age and we will be launching a new nationwide addiction strategy in 2020.\u201d Eytan Alexander, the managing director of the addiction treatment firm UKAT and a former gambling addict, welcomed the move to ban credit cards, but said other measures were needed to protect consumers. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a relief to hear that positive steps are being taken and I truly believe it will help current and future problem gamblers who are gambling with money they don\u2019t necessarily have. \u201cHowever, at UKAT, what we\u2019re keen to see are steps being taken to target the VIP schemes which reward gamblers with celebrity-lifestyle perks for their high and regular bets. This could encourage younger, more vulnerable gamblers to gamble to excess in order to reach VIP status. We\u2019d encourage the Gambling Commission to take a hard and fast line on this.\u201d Brigid Simmonds, the head of the Betting and Gaming Council, which represents the industry, said: \u201cWe will implement a ban on credit cards and indeed our members will go further to study and improve the early identification of those at risk. \u201cThe use of credit cards were previously used as a potential marker of harm which might lead to further intervention with customers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On the December morning that Jo Phoenix, professor of criminology at the Open University, was to give a lecture at Essex University on trans rights in prisons, Twitter roared into action, with several Essex staff and students tweeting allegations that a \u201ctransphobe\u201d would be on campus. By 10am Phoenix was warned by a member of university staff that some students were threatening to shut down her lecture, as they said LGBT+ staff and students wouldn\u2019t feel safe if Phoenix gave her talk. At midday the university decided to cancel it because disruption looked inevitable, and proper academic discussion unlikely. \u201cI was furious,\u201d Phoenix says. \u201cIt was very clear to me that those agitating were fundamentally anti-academic because they condemned me and my research without hearing what I had to say.\u201d Phoenix, who is adamant she is not transphobic, had given the same talk at the University of Newfoundland in Canada a month earlier, to an audience that included trans scholars, without controversy. \u201cThey all liked it. So there is something unique about what is going on in the UK,\u201d she says. The talk explored tensions around placing trans women in British prisons, and argued that there are problems with applying trans rights to criminal justice. Universities are negotiating a minefield, trying to maintain free speech while faced with two groups of people who both argue they are being made to feel unsafe. The vice-chancellor of Essex, Anthony Forster, has promised a review into what happened in December, and says the university expects its community not to interfere with \u201cthe rights of others to express views with which they might disagree profoundly\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Insomnia is the long night\u2019s journey into day, where the repetitive cycles of sleep are reduced to a single, unending interlude that can go on and on \u2013 in the case of novelist Samantha Harvey, for 40 or 50 excruciating hours. In a 2018 online essay, which appears to have served as a taster for her new memoir, The Shapeless Unease, she likens sleeplessness to the kind of reflective postmortem that follows the end of a relationship. \u201cWhat did I do to make it leave? What can I do to get it back?\u201d Not unlike Marina Benjamin\u2019s elegant 2018 study, Insomnia, Harvey\u2019s examination of her year-long insomnia is an excavation of the emotions that might cause sleeplessness. It\u2019s a kind of philosophical detective story strewn with submerged clues. Lying awake at 3am, she circles the shrinking perimeter of her mind for answers, like \u201ca polar bear in its grubby blue-white plastic enclosure with fake icecaps and water that turns out to have no depth\u201d. How, Harvey wonders, do you go from 40 years of blissful slumbering to the common but misunderstood condition that doesn\u2019t even afford the sufferer the \u201csad prestige of being unwell\u201d? Clues are there from her book\u2019s first pages when she mourns the sudden death of a cousin who suffered from, and succumbed to, epileptic seizures: death came for him; sleep left her. One sleepless night soon after, she\u2019s lured, through her computer\u2019s search engine, into addressing the stages of her cousin\u2019s decomposing corpse, clumsily put back together after the postmortem with his windpipe missing, bacteria feeding on his gut and skin. Heightened thoughts of her own mortality and myriad other candidates for insomnia, including the menopause, are considered as Harvey edges towards a psychological root, which she can\u2019t name confidently. But what\u2019s the point of being awake, she asks, on permanent amber alert, for no good physical reason? Though a friend tells her that \u201cthere is no grace for the imagination. You cannot be saved from an assailant that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d, Harvey argues that sleep deprivation is a real threat to good health. Fear of not sleeping renews and increases the fear such that it becomes \u201ca vicious circle of Euclidean perfection\u201d. Just as much as insomnia, though, The Shapeless Unease is a meditation on the nature of creativity (writing in particular); how it emerges even in the course of a fractured life. Harvey takes comfort from and marvels at lines in poetry such as Philip Larkin\u2019s \u201cthe million-petalled flower of being here\u201d in The Old Fools for their uncanny, revelatory ability to \u201cknock a solitary life a fraction off its axis\u201d.

The campaigners against the booths are largely driven by [Jean Jacques] <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/#Educ\" title=\"\">Rousseau\u2019s</a> ideology that all children are fundamentally good and if they misbehave, then they have an unmet need. But that is not how children are,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe ban the booth campaign is another front for the progressive approach to education, which feels it is losing ground. Not only are they wrong but their views are unpopular, because when you talk to parents, students and teachers, they want safe, orderly classrooms.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Bennett, the government-appointed behaviour tsar for England, says \u201cremoval rooms\u201d are a common feature in schools so children can learn in safe, calm environments. \u201cThey aren\u2019t isolation rooms \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a school leave a child unattended. They\u2019re supervised, and more often than not, accompanied by other students. So claims that these are isolation spaces is nonsense. These are safe spaces, run by adults,\u201d he says.</p> <p>However, headteachers such as Simon Flowers, of Carr Manor Community school in Leeds, take an alternative approach, working with children to help them recognise and understand their feelings and make the right decisions. His school, for pupils aged 4-19, has a high proportion of children with additional needs and challenging behaviour but hasn\u2019t permanently excluded a pupil for 15 years.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t take the quick way out. We don\u2019t have a punitive system with isolation rooms, we resolve things and the children leave us rounded, engaged and self-regulated. If something happens we pull together. Adults model the behaviour that shapes children, they don\u2019t try to control them with laminated sheets of rules and punishments,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Proponents of zero tolerance need to think beyond the school walls, Flowers says. \u201cIf I exclude the child who brings a knife into school, I have lost any impact on that child and they can be walking into a shop with the knife, down the street or on to a bus with it.\u201d</p> <p><em>Children\u2019s names have been changed</em></p>",

The campaigners against the booths are largely driven by [Jean Jacques] Rousseau\u2019s ideology that all children are fundamentally good and if they misbehave, then they have an unmet need. But that is not how children are,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ban the booth campaign is another front for the progressive approach to education, which feels it is losing ground. Not only are they wrong but their views are unpopular, because when you talk to parents, students and teachers, they want safe, orderly classrooms.\u201d Tom Bennett, the government-appointed behaviour tsar for England, says \u201cremoval rooms\u201d are a common feature in schools so children can learn in safe, calm environments. \u201cThey aren\u2019t isolation rooms \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a school leave a child unattended. They\u2019re supervised, and more often than not, accompanied by other students. So claims that these are isolation spaces is nonsense. These are safe spaces, run by adults,\u201d he says. However, headteachers such as Simon Flowers, of Carr Manor Community school in Leeds, take an alternative approach, working with children to help them recognise and understand their feelings and make the right decisions. His school, for pupils aged 4-19, has a high proportion of children with additional needs and challenging behaviour but hasn\u2019t permanently excluded a pupil for 15 years. \u201cWe don\u2019t take the quick way out. We don\u2019t have a punitive system with isolation rooms, we resolve things and the children leave us rounded, engaged and self-regulated. If something happens we pull together. Adults model the behaviour that shapes children, they don\u2019t try to control them with laminated sheets of rules and punishments,\u201d he says. Proponents of zero tolerance need to think beyond the school walls, Flowers says. \u201cIf I exclude the child who brings a knife into school, I have lost any impact on that child and they can be walking into a shop with the knife, down the street or on to a bus with it.\u201d Children\u2019s names have been changed",

      "bodyText": "Last year, Guardian Cities reported an exclusive story: that a new housing development in London had erected a wall to prevent children in the social housing section from using the communal playground. Within hours of the story being published, news reporters from across the UK turned up on the doorstep of the Baylis Old School development in Lambeth. All the major political parties condemned this \u201csegregated playground\u201d, and a few days later the developer, Henley Homes, backed down. Workers came in to tear down the wall. The story had not just an immediate impact but an ongoing one \u2013 and not just politically but also among architects, urban planners and developers. At Guardian Cities, we were contacted by other people living on segregated developments. Many of those have since been desegregated. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, responded by outlawing segregated playgrounds in the city \u2013 and then the Conservative housing minister, James Brokenshire, went further, saying he wanted an end to all forms of segregated play across the UK. None of this would have come to light if not for the women on the estate, who had been fighting for their children\u2019s right to play. Despite the Baylis Old School development being advertised as \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d, many of their neighbours considered play to be a noisy intrusion. When mothers living in the private apartments discovered their social-housing neighbours weren\u2019t allowed to join them in the playground \u2013 let alone encourage their kids to play \u2013 they were furious. \u201cOur industry should be grateful that these women stepped up and drew attention to what was happening,\u201d said architect Dinah Bornat, an expert on child-friendly design who has given talks on the segregated playgrounds scandal to architects and planners. \u201cThe story now comes up frequently,\u201d she added. \u201cPeople recognise it now as something to avoid.\u201d But while developers might be steering clear of something as obviously and literally offensive as walls in playgrounds, it\u2019s clear that our cities are steadily being divided in many other ways. Private developers now have almost total control over the building of affordable homes in the UK. That\u2019s affordable in all senses: truly affordable homes for social rent, as well as \u201cshared ownership\u201d homes that remain out of reach to most buyers. These developers, and the housing associations that manage the affordable homes, invariably point the finger of blame at one culprit: service charges. If you have a gym and a cinema and a rooftop lounge, they argue, you should pay more. (That thinking is now regularly applied to even the more expensive shared-ownership homes: as the Guardian reported last year, those residents are being locked out of communal facilities, too.) But the families who argued for access to shared gardens say the service charge on a small garden or play area should not be used to keep children out. The extra cost added to a service charge for a playground is often minuscule. On the Baylis Old School site, the social housing residents who now share the space they have discovered that it doesn\u2019t cost them much at all. The same has proved true on other segregated developments. The London Plan might call for mixed communities, but the reality is that many developers want separate blocks, and actively pursue them, so that they can sell \u201cluxury\u201d to higher-end buyers. They argue that they need to maximise profit in order to pay for the affordable homes they are required to build as part of the planning agreement. Housing associations, to their credit, would love to have more freedom to build homes outside of this model. And some councils are indeed building their own homes where they get the chance. Because when homes become more important as expensive assets than as places to live, and when security is prioritised over community, children \u2013 who might want to use communal play spaces for, say, playing \u2013 are seen as an unwelcome intrusion. One segregated garden we reported on was the London Square development in Streatham. The garden has since been opened up to all residents, but a woman living there said she still feels unwelcome. \u201cI took my daughter out for a picnic with her friends on her birthday, and a man from the private side came up and started filming us with his camera,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Just making sure you don\u2019t do anything wrong.\u2019\u201d This incident is a painful example of how ordinary families are sometimes unwelcome on luxury-style developments.

      "bodyText": "For the millions of Japanese people living with dementia, diagnosis is often the beginning of a journey into a life of seclusion. When dementia is covered by the media, it is in the form of news about experimental therapies, or reports on the latest police campaign to encourage older people to surrender their driving licences. The voices of people living with the condition \u2013 in ever rising numbers among an ageing population \u2013 are often missing from the public debate. About 5 million Japanese people live with Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia, and 7.3 million \u2013 or one in five people aged 65 or over \u2013 will be affected by 2025, according to government estimates. Most live at home, cared for by relatives, 40% of whom warned they could not continue as caregivers due to stress and the impact on household finances, according to a 2015 survey. There are signs of change, however. The city of Matsudo, east of Tokyo, won recognition at home and abroad for its groundbreaking approach to dementia several years before the national government released its \u201corange plan\u201d \u2013 a 22.5bn yen (\u00a3160m) programme to hire more specialists, improve early diagnosis and expand community-based care \u2013 in 2015. Matsudo made dementia a public health priority almost a decade ago, raising awareness of the condition among residents as well as businesses that regularly come into contact with older people. Several times a month, volunteer \u201cdementia supporters\u201d wearing bright orange bibs patrol neighbourhoods to distribute leaflets with information about dementia services and, occasionally, to help people in distress. In the Sapporo and Eniwa areas of Hokkaido, Japan\u2019s northernmost island, the Megumi-no-ie and Komorebi-no-ie \u201cgroup homes\u201d cater for a total of 36 people with dementia. Here, food and general care are provided, but residents are also encouraged to take a leading role in their daily routines, whether it be gardening, preparing meals, food shopping or cleaning. Some sell vegetables they have grown to give them a sense of financial independence. Fumiko Ito, 69, ran a restaurant-bar with her husband for three decades. Ito, a resident of the care home in Eniwa, recalls that her husband, who died seven years ago, was married when they met. \u201cI met him at my friends\u2019 bar. I was drinking there and so was he \u2026 He was sitting behind me and he pushed me from behind and said: \u2018Hi\u2019. It was love at first sight. I was 18 or 19. He was 10 years older than me.\u201d \u201cI often think about him and often dream about us together \u2026 he died from cancer,\u201d Ito says. \u201cHe had a really difficult time coping with that. I sometimes think about that.\u201d Asked what makes her worry, she replies: \u201cMy health. I hope to stay fit for a long time \u2026 I hope to stay here with my friends and have a happy life here.\u201d And what makes her happy? \u201cI like food. I\u2019m happiest when I\u2019m sharing good food with friends.\u201d Ito\u2019s fellow resident, 89 year-old Masanori Nohara, says he can be forgetful, but claims he \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a damn\u201d about the state of his health. \u201cI sometimes forget things,\u201d he says. \u201cI know about dementia, but I don\u2019t think I have it.\u201d He recalls the joy he felt when he qualified as a joiner in his early 20s. \u201cI became an apprentice when I was 18 and trained for four years.

Full live and daily coverage of the negotiations on the future relationship between the bloc and its first ex-member will, of course, continue in the Guardian as talks advance, while our Brexit Means \u2026 podcast will provide monthly in-depth insights. As Britain gradually disengages from the EU, the Guardian\u2019s European coverage will be developing and deepening. In the meantime, tap into the continental conversation on our Europe Now pages here, and subscribe to our fortnightly Europe newsletter. Top stories Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen had a \u201cpositive\u201d exploratory meeting on the next round of Brexit talks, making a concerted effort to put the divisions of the past three years behind them. The new president of the European commission said the two sides should focus on mutual interests, and both leaders reportedly agreed that there could be common ground on the climate crisis, human rights and security. But the British prime minister, who has made it clear he does not want the UK to remain aligned with EU rules and regulations, said he was aiming for a fast Canada-style free trade agreement and would not be requesting an extension to the transition period. Von der Leyen said in a speech before the meeting that such a timeframe was essentially impossible if Britain wanted a comprehensive agreement, and reiterated that the UK would not be allowed to have its cake and eat it: The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be. Without free movement of people, you cannot have free movement of capital, goods and services. Without a level playing field on environment, labour, taxation and state aid, you cannot have highest-quality access to the world\u2019s largest single market. Meanwhile, the prime minister\u2019s Brexit bill cleared the House of Commons, passing at third reading by a majority of 330 to 231 and heading to the House of Lords, where peers could give it a more challenging hearing but are unlikely to block its passage. But in signs of potential problems ahead, MEP\u2019s expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the UK government\u2019s attitude to the 3.3 million EU citizens in Britain, and the UK was accused of behaving \u201clike a bunch of cowboys\u201d after a confidential EU report accused it of \u201cdeliberate violations and abuse\u201d of the Schengen Information System database. Croatia\u2019s prime minister, Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, whose country is taking over the presidency of the EU, said the EU would block the City\u2019s access to EU markets if Johnson tried to exempt the UK from its laws, while Northern Ireland\u2019s new customs arrangements would not be ready by the end of the year, an expert report said, exposing the UK to EU legal action. What next The Johnson-Von der Leyen meeting may have been all smiles but the faultlines \u2013 and not just over the impossibility of reaching a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of the future relationship in just 11 months \u2013 are clear: By the end of June, the EU will need to unilaterally decide on equivalence in 26 areas in the financial services sector in order to allow the City to continue to operate largely as it does today for EU clients The British fishing industry wants radical change from the common fisheries policy under which nearly 60% of fish in UK waters is caught by EU-based boats; the large European fishing nations insist on their historical rights of access. A \u201czero tariff, zero quotas\u201d deal on goods will require UK alignment with EU environmental, labour, social and state aid rules, which Johnson has rejected. Von der Leyen made clear the alternative implies fundamental change for the UK car and pharmaceutical industries. Best of the rest \u201cFestival of Brexit\u201d boss says \u00a3120m event will prove cynics wrong. UK \u201ccommitted\u201d to maintaining Erasmus+ exchange scheme.

      "body": "<p>Sonos has finally made a portable wifi and Bluetooth speaker that sounds great \u2013 but it\u2019s not quite what most will have imagined.</p> <p>For years Sonos has made some of the very best wifi speakers, recently adding optional voice assistants from Google and Amazon. But they have never been truly wireless, needing to be plugged in and on your home wifi network.</p> <p>The Move changes that, essentially taking the excellent Sonos One and adding a battery to the bottom. But it comes at a hefty \u00a3399 price tag, although some retailers already have it at \u00a3329.</p> <h2>One + battery = Move</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"546174ce25bde7ee9df65dd02802a0ad0e867759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/546174ce25bde7ee9df65dd02802a0ad0e867759/251_189_4437_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"sonos move review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sitting on its charging ring the Move behaves like a One.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Move is slightly larger than the One. It is taller, wider and more of an oval shape than a squircle. The top still has the microphone array and mute button for your chosen voice assistant. The touch-sensitive pause/play and volume buttons still work great.</p> <p>In the back is a handle for carrying the speaker, plus a power button, a connection button used for setting it up and the new wifi/Bluetooth switch button.</p> <p>The battery sits in a large rubberised base. The whole thing drops neatly into a small oval ring pedestal for charging but there is also a USB-C socket for charging on the go.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 240 x 160 x 126mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weigh:</strong> 3kg</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> wifi b/g/n/a, Bluetooth, USB-C, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect</p></li> <li><p><strong>Battery:</strong> 2,500mAh for 10 hours playback, 120 hours standby, three hours to charge (900 cycles/three-year lifespan, replaceable)</p></li> <li><p><strong>USB-C charging:</strong> USB-PD 36W at 12V/3A or 15V/2.4A or 45W at 15V/3A or 20V/2.25A</p></li> <li><p><strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP56 (heavy rain/snow/fine dust), UV, extreme temperature, shocks</p></li> </ul> <h2>Portable, sort of</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2da6d9d18b27337cef3bb5a688a3155f916d7e9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2da6d9d18b27337cef3bb5a688a3155f916d7e9e/0_153_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"sonos move review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The integrated handle is solid, which is good as at 3kg the Move is no lightweight speaker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To say this is a portable Bluetooth speaker would be simultaneously over- and underselling the Move. The Move is water and dust resistant, and durable enough to survive the odd drop, so you absolutely could take it to the beach or the park. But it weighs 3kg, so you are not going to want to lug the Move around in quite the same way you might a 608g <a href=\"https://www.ultimateears.com/en-gb/wireless-speakers/boom-3.html\">Ultimate Ears Boom 3</a> Bluetooth speaker.</p> <p>Instead, you are more likely to carry it around the house with you or into the garden for a bit of outdoors music.

Download the Sonos app on your iPhone, iPad or Android device, sign up for an account and add the speaker to your wifi network by pressing the connection button on the back of the speaker and following the instructions.</p> <p>Then add any music streaming accounts you have \u2013 Sonos supports practically everything including multiple Spotify accounts and playback from local network drives \u2013 and start playing music. The beauty of the Sonos system is that it can search all of your music services at once, so you do not need to remember where your music is stored.</p> <p>Bluetooth playback is equally simple: press the Bluetooth button on the back and pair it with your phone, tablet or computer just like any other Bluetooth device.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78a599d0a9a364bd66775008f48d732873c35a09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78a599d0a9a364bd66775008f48d732873c35a09/116_263_4749_2851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"sonos move review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The back of the Move has a power button, plus the setup button and a Bluetooth/wifi button for switching between modes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Sonos app will also guide you through adding a voice assistant to the Move, although it is purely optional. If you do, the Move works just as well as a One, which makes it one of the most adaptable and best-sounding smart speakers available, with the ability to switch between Alexa and Google Assistant.</p> <p>If you want to control the speaker directly, it supports Spotify Connect and Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2 as well.</p> <h2>Premium sound</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3a938a6c5e027f1a0f0270126717ad767cbbe1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3a938a6c5e027f1a0f0270126717ad767cbbe1b/86_287_4695_2818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"sonos move review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The LED on top shines blue when on Bluetooth, while the pause, volume and track skip buttons work as they do on wifi \u2013 only the smart speaker functionality is disabled.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Move is designed to sound like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/15/sonos-one-review-best-smart-speaker-audiophiles-amazon-alexa\">excellent One</a>, which is a very good thing. You get punchy lows and mids, sparkling highs and a well-balanced, rich sound that is perfectly at home blasting you with high-energy EDM before mastering the subtleties of Holst\u2019s The Planets. It is actually a bit more forward and louder than the One, which makes it better suited for jaunts outside.</p> <p>It is also the first Sonos speaker to have automatic Trueplay tuning, which adjusts the audio output to sound its best when you move the speaker to a new location. Previous Sonos speakers can do a similar thing but it requires you manually waving an iPhone or iPad about your room as the speaker blasts you with what sounds like alien weapons from a sci-fi film.</p> <p>Trueplay only works on wifi, not Bluetooth, but the Move sounds great indoors or out without any tweaks.

      "bodyText": "Sonos has finally made a portable wifi and Bluetooth speaker that sounds great \u2013 but it\u2019s not quite what most will have imagined. For years Sonos has made some of the very best wifi speakers, recently adding optional voice assistants from Google and Amazon. But they have never been truly wireless, needing to be plugged in and on your home wifi network. The Move changes that, essentially taking the excellent Sonos One and adding a battery to the bottom. But it comes at a hefty \u00a3399 price tag, although some retailers already have it at \u00a3329. One + battery = Move The Move is slightly larger than the One. It is taller, wider and more of an oval shape than a squircle. The top still has the microphone array and mute button for your chosen voice assistant. The touch-sensitive pause/play and volume buttons still work great. In the back is a handle for carrying the speaker, plus a power button, a connection button used for setting it up and the new wifi/Bluetooth switch button. The battery sits in a large rubberised base. The whole thing drops neatly into a small oval ring pedestal for charging but there is also a USB-C socket for charging on the go. Specifications Dimensions: 240 x 160 x 126mm Weigh: 3kg Connectivity: wifi b/g/n/a, Bluetooth, USB-C, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect Battery: 2,500mAh for 10 hours playback, 120 hours standby, three hours to charge (900 cycles/three-year lifespan, replaceable) USB-C charging: USB-PD 36W at 12V/3A or 15V/2.4A or 45W at 15V/3A or 20V/2.25A Water resistance: IP56 (heavy rain/snow/fine dust), UV, extreme temperature, shocks Portable, sort of To say this is a portable Bluetooth speaker would be simultaneously over- and underselling the Move. The Move is water and dust resistant, and durable enough to survive the odd drop, so you absolutely could take it to the beach or the park. But it weighs 3kg, so you are not going to want to lug the Move around in quite the same way you might a 608g Ultimate Ears Boom 3 Bluetooth speaker. Instead, you are more likely to carry it around the house with you or into the garden for a bit of outdoors music. Carrying it about the house, the wifi connection is rock solid. It even managed to get a strong enough signal on the patio but a trip down to the end of the garden required switching to Bluetooth. Setup and controls As with all Sonos speakers, setting up the Move and controlling it with the app is easy. Download the Sonos app on your iPhone, iPad or Android device, sign up for an account and add the speaker to your wifi network by pressing the connection button on the back of the speaker and following the instructions. Then add any music streaming accounts you have \u2013 Sonos supports practically everything including multiple Spotify accounts and playback from local network drives \u2013 and start playing music. The beauty of the Sonos system is that it can search all of your music services at once, so you do not need to remember where your music is stored. Bluetooth playback is equally simple: press the Bluetooth button on the back and pair it with your phone, tablet or computer just like any other Bluetooth device. The Sonos app will also guide you through adding a voice assistant to the Move, although it is purely optional. If you do, the Move works just as well as a One, which makes it one of the most adaptable and best-sounding smart speakers available, with the ability to switch between Alexa and Google Assistant. If you want to control the speaker directly, it supports Spotify Connect and Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2 as well. Premium sound The Move is designed to sound like the excellent One, which is a very good thing. You get punchy lows and mids, sparkling highs and a well-balanced, rich sound that is perfectly at home blasting you with high-energy EDM before mastering the subtleties of Holst\u2019s The Planets. It is actually a bit more forward and louder than the One, which makes it better suited for jaunts outside. It is also the first Sonos speaker to have automatic Trueplay tuning, which adjusts the audio output to sound its best when you move the speaker to a new location. Previous Sonos speakers can do a similar thing but it requires you manually waving an iPhone or iPad about your room as the speaker blasts you with what sounds like alien weapons from a sci-fi film. Trueplay only works on wifi, not Bluetooth, but the Move sounds great indoors or out without any tweaks. It is arguably the best-sounding portable speaker you can buy. Observations Slide your finger from one volume button to the other to skip track The USB-C socket takes up to 45W for fast charging You can pair two Moves for stereo sound but they cannot be linked to a Sub or Beam/Playbar as surround speakers There is no analogue line-in Voice assistants only work on wifi The rubber base is very good at preventing vibrations passing through the speaker to the surface, even at high volumes Price The Sonos Move costs \u00a3399 and comes in black only but is frequently discounted by as much as \u00a370 from its RRP. For comparison, the Sonos One costs \u00a3169, the Play 5 costs \u00a3499, the Amazon Echo Studio costs \u00a3190, the Google Home Max costs \u00a3199, Apple HomePod costs \u00a3279 and the UE Boom 3 costs \u00a3130. Verdict The Sonos Move is an excellent, smart, great-sounding speaker that is truly wireless. Packing wifi and Bluetooth, a 10-hour battery, easy charging, a durable case, weather resistance and loud, punchy sound, you could take this portable powerhouse practically anywhere. But you are probably not going to as it is massive and heavy compared with most portable speakers, and more than three times the price of some of the best. In fact, price is its biggest downfall.

And people in Northern Ireland \u2013 despite collective weariness \u2013 are once again defiantly willing to hope that it could succeed. \u2022 Katy Hayward is a reader in sociology at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and the author of Bordering on Brexit",

      "bodyText": "The hormone melatonin should not be available on the NHS to help treat jet lag, a review of the evidence has concluded. Melatonin is a hormone produced in the body during darkness that plays a role in the body clock and helps to regulate sleep cycles. It is available on the NHS as a treatment for some sleep problems, including in older people and children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Whether it helps with jet lag is less clear . However in 2019 two melatonin products were licensed as a prescription medication for managing short-term jet lag by the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency Now an independent drug review for the hormone by the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin \u2013 a publication that summarises and weighs the evidence for medicines and treatments \u2013 has concluded the hormone should not be prescribed for jet lag on the NHS. \u201cWe would suggest that melatonin for jet lag is added to the list of drugs that may not be ordered under a General Medical Services Contract,\u201d the authors wrote. The authors looked at the same collection of 14 studies (including 10 randomised placebo-controlled trials) that were submitted to the MHRC, as well as Cochrane reviews \u2013 the gold standard for looking at evidence \u2013 and other studies of previous research on melatonin for jet lag or to improve sleep. Most of the clinical trials on melatonin for jet lag, the team noted, were published between 1986 and 2005, and many were small. But as the hormone has been licensed for this purpose for more than 10 years elsewhere in the EU, more modern data was not required by the MHRC. The team concluded the evidence suggests melatonin does have a modest effect on reducing the symptoms of jet lag \u2013 one analysis based on four previously published studies with a total of 232 participants suggested those given melatonin rated their jet lag as 27 on a 100-point scale compared with 45 for those given a placebo. It also appears generally safe, although it can have side effects including nausea and dizziness. It may also increase the rate of seizures in those with epilepsy and cause problems for those with autoimmune diseases, and is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The team said 30 melatonin tablets of 3mg each costs \u00a365 while 150ml of a 1mg/ml solution costs \u00a3130. However the authors said the evidence base for using the hormone for jet lag remains poor \u2013 and in any case jet lag goes away on its own within a few days, and is not a major priority for the NHS. \u201cThe question is, should NHS resources be used to support a short term, self-limiting condition that is generally associated with travel for pleasure and holidays?,\u201d said David Phizackerley, the deputy editor of the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin. Phizackerley said the team\u2019s recommendation does not change the fact that doctors could at present prescribe melatonin for jet lag \u2013 although a clinical knowledge summary forthe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence does not advise melatonin for this purpose. But, he said, the review could help to shape guidance should Nice decide to issue it. Phizackerley said the review was not a criticism of the MHRA. \u201cWe are not questioning whether it should have a license, because it is shown to do something and it appears to be relatively safe,\u201d he said. He added that restricting prescriptions of melatonin so that it is not available for jet lag would prevent a postcode lottery. \u201cIt would make it a lot easier for patients, because everyone would know then that it is not available [on the NHS],\u201d he said.

In February last year Naval Group asked for the extension to turn in its work in order to minimise delays down the track, which would extend the design completion date from July 2022 to September 2023. Defence and Naval Group settled on a nine-month extension to the project, which has already been delayed.

      "bodyText": "The election campaign is now in a bygone decade but we are still not much clearer about what the Tories have in store for education over the next five years. The relevant section of the Conservative manifesto was, at just 646 words, deliberately vague, and seemed oriented towards perceived Labour policy weaknesses \u2013 on Ofsted and discipline \u2013 rather than on any real plans for education. Not a word on the future use of the pupil premium, nor the burden of the teacher workload, or on university fees, or grammar schools. That can\u2019t be it. Not from a government that has, at its heart, two of the most flamboyant players from the coalition years, Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings, and a circle of advisers \u2013 including Munira Mirza, head of the No 10 policy unit, and Rachel Wolf, who co-wrote the election manifesto \u2013 with an interest in (and distinct approach to) education. And don\u2019t forget that whopping majority of 80. So what do we know about Boris Johnson\u2019s intentions? The early smoke signals out of Downing Street \u2013 considered much more strategically significant than Gavin Williamson at the DfE \u2013 indicate a sober commitment to deliver major, visible change, particularly in the newly won northern seats. The biggest push will be on technical and further education, which has been starved of money and effective reform for decades. At the end of his first term Johnson will want to point to a plethora of shiny new projects, from souped-up further education colleges to brand new institutes of technology and selective sixth forms, in newly Conservative areas such as Bassetlaw and Bishop Auckland. Tory insiders also believe there is the appetite to complete the structural revolution that began in 2010, reflecting a long-held feeling in rightwing circles that no education secretary has been sufficiently radical since Gove. More free schools have been promised and there will be a concerted push to convert all schools to academies over the next five years, mostly by herding schools into larger multi-academy trusts. Yes, school funding will rise, but not enough to reverse the cuts since 2010. Given the emphasis already being put by Johnson\u2019s government on heeding public opinion, it is salutary to remember that both the funding promise, and more discrete commitments such as the new arts premium, were not the product of sudden Tory largesse but the result of sustained campaigning by local communities, teachers, heads and the teacher trade unions, which won public sympathy. There will be no wholesale return to selection at 11 but the slow, steady expansion of grammar schools will continue to wreak damage on comprehensives, and on provision for disadvantaged communities, in the areas that have selection. Even in its short manifesto, heavy weather was made of strong discipline and a knowledge-rich curriculum \u2013 buzzwords of increasingly influential traditionalist groups, such as the Parents and Teachers for Excellence. This government is convinced that parents thrill to such old-fashioned ideas, even if the resultant regimes don\u2019t actually suit their children.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: US stance contradicts MI5\u2019s advice</h2> \n<p>Good morning and welcome to this Tuesday briefing with Alison Rourke.</p> \n<p>A blunt briefing from Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser has put Boris Johnson in a difficult position. Matt Pottinger has told British ministers that transatlantic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/using-huawei-in-uk-5g-networks-would-be-madness-us-says\">intelligence sharing would be at risk</a> if Huawei technology was used in the UK\u2019s 5G networks. The intense lobbying from Washington comes as Johnson is expected to make a final decision about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/why-the-controversy-over-huawei-technology-in-uk-networks\">controversial deal</a> within weeks. On the weekend, the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, said he saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/12/huawei-technology-poses-no-threat-to-uk-security-ex-mi5-head\">\u201cno reason to think\u201d</a> that using Huawei technology should threaten intelligence sharing with the US, suggesting that Britain was poised to give the Chinese company the go-ahead. Huawei denies it has ever been asked by Beijing to introduce secret \u201cback doors\u201d into its technology, and has offered to sign a \u201cno spy agreement\u201d with countries adopting it. The US delegation claimed that Chinese spies, working for the People\u2019s Liberation Army, also worked simultaneously for Huawei. The Chinese telco is one of three companies that supply equipment to Vodafone, BT and other mobile phone companies for high-speed 5G networks, alongside Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia from Finland.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Bigger strategy\u2019</strong> \u2013 The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, says targeting Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/pompeo-says-killing-of-suleimani-is-part-of-bigger-strategy-to-deter-us-foes\"> part of a bigger strategy</a> of deterring challenges by US foes that also applies to China and Russia. His assertions sit uncomfortably with earlier insistence from the Trump administration that killing the Iranian general was about preventing an imminent attack on American assets. Yesterday the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said he had seen no intelligence forewarning of imminent attacks on embassies.

      "bodyText": "Top story: US stance contradicts MI5\u2019s advice Good morning and welcome to this Tuesday briefing with Alison Rourke. A blunt briefing from Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser has put Boris Johnson in a difficult position. Matt Pottinger has told British ministers that transatlantic intelligence sharing would be at risk if Huawei technology was used in the UK\u2019s 5G networks. The intense lobbying from Washington comes as Johnson is expected to make a final decision about the controversial deal within weeks. On the weekend, the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, said he saw \u201cno reason to think\u201d that using Huawei technology should threaten intelligence sharing with the US, suggesting that Britain was poised to give the Chinese company the go-ahead. Huawei denies it has ever been asked by Beijing to introduce secret \u201cback doors\u201d into its technology, and has offered to sign a \u201cno spy agreement\u201d with countries adopting it. The US delegation claimed that Chinese spies, working for the People\u2019s Liberation Army, also worked simultaneously for Huawei. The Chinese telco is one of three companies that supply equipment to Vodafone, BT and other mobile phone companies for high-speed 5G networks, alongside Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia from Finland. * * * \u2018Bigger strategy\u2019 \u2013 The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, says targeting Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, was part of a bigger strategy of deterring challenges by US foes that also applies to China and Russia. His assertions sit uncomfortably with earlier insistence from the Trump administration that killing the Iranian general was about preventing an imminent attack on American assets. Yesterday the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said he had seen no intelligence forewarning of imminent attacks on embassies. But Trump said \u201cit really doesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether Suleimani posed an imminent threat. Pompeo described Washington\u2019s strategy as \u201cre-establishing deterrence, real deterrence, against the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d. In Iran itself, at least two journalists at the state broadcaster have quit, citing a cover-up over the downing of the Ukrainian passenger plane. Protests against the regime have continued in Tehran with authorities using live ammunition to disperse demonstrators. * * * \u2018Complex matters\u2019 \u2013 Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said no discussions have taken place about whether Canadians will foot the bill for Harry and Meghan\u2019s time in the country, after the Queen signed off on the couple\u2019s desire to split their time between there and the UK. \u201cI think most Canadians are very supportive of having royals be here, but how that looks and what kind of costs are involved, there are still lots of discussions to have,\u201d Trudeau said in an interview with the Canadian broadcaster, Global News. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of decisions to be taken by the royal family and by the Sussexes themselves as to what level of engagement they choose to have and these are things that we are supportive of.\u201d * * * Diagnosis delay \u2013 Nearly half of parents whose children are referred for assessment for autism face an 18-month wait for a formal diagnosis. In some cases, families wait three years, according to the charity Ambitious about Autism. \u201cMany parents say they feel isolated and helpless as they wait to find out if their child has autism,\u201d said Jolanta Lasota, the chief executive. The charity says about one in 100 children in the UK have autism, with boys diagnosed four times as often as girls. About 70% of the 4,000 parents surveyed said they were not offered adequate support after their child\u2019s diagnosis. * * * Democratic spat \u2013 Elizabeth Warren has said Bernie Sanders, one of her main 2020 rivals, told her in a private meeting that he didn\u2019t think a woman could beat Donald Trump to become president. \u201cI thought a woman could win; he disagreed,\u201d she said in a statement last night, adding: \u201cI have no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry.\u201d Sanders vehemently denied the comments, in a back and forth that represents a dramatic break from the party\u2019s leading progressives after a months-long truce. * * * Eat, don\u2019t snap \u2013 The celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has criticised diners for being more interested in photographing their food than eating it.

      "bodyText": "The Tasmanian premier, Will Hodgman, has announced he will resign from politics to spend more time with his family, in a shock announcement on Tuesday afternoon. Hodgman, who has been premier since 2014, said he believed now was the \u201cright time to allow for new leadership\u201d. \u201cI have this morning informed my cabinet colleagues and the prime minister of what is a very difficult decisions,\u201d he told media on Tuesday. \u201cI have been premier for just on six years and leader of the Liberal party for 14. I have given this job, which is an enormous honour and privilege, absolutely everything, and it is a job I have loved. \u201cIt is undeniable that it had an impact on my family and I want to thank them for their amazing support for the 17 and a half years that I have been a member of parliament \u2013 our children\u2019s whole lives. \u201cAs we approach the halfway mark, with two more years of government, I believe that now is the right time for me to allow for new leadership.\u201d Hodgman had previously told media in December he had no plans to step down, but he revealed on Tuesday he changed his mind after discussing it with family over Christmas. \u201cI didn\u2019t finally arrive to it until the last day or so,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken time to reflect with my family over the Christmas period [and realised] it was unlikely, indeed would not be the case, that I would want to contest the next election. \u201cThis gives new leadership an opportunity, at this point in time with the foundations well set.\u201d He said his replacement as premier would be a matter for the state parliamentary Liberal party, which would meet next week to determine the new party leader. Hodgman was first elected as a state MP for the seat of Franklin, in the state\u2019s south, in 2002, and was elected leader of the Tasmanian Liberal party in 2006. At the 2018 state election, his government was returned with a majority of 13 seats out of 25 in the lower house, making him the second Liberal premier to win consecutive elections in the state\u2019s history. \u201cI leave this job with Tasmania in a better place than when we started,\u201d he said on Tuesday. The outgoing premier listed his achievements in education, renewable energy and the establishment of the state\u2019s first minister for the prevention of family and sexual violence. \u201cAs we face the reality of climate change, we are delivering a Tasmanian climate action plan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are on track to 100% self-sufficient in renewable energy generation by 2022 [and] Tasmania is ready to play its part in Australia\u2019s response to climate change by becoming the renewable energy powerhouse of the nation.\u201d He said school retention rates had increased by 10% since 2014 and his government had boosted access for disadvantaged communities and students with disabilities. \u201cI have given this job everything but I do believe it is the right time for someone else to do it,\u201d Hodgman said. \u201cOur children have grown up with me in the public spotlight and it often hasn\u2019t been easy.\u201d Election analyst Kevin Bonham said Hodgman\u2019s seat will likely to be filled by Nic Street \u2013 a fellow Liberal and a former MP for the same seat of Franklin. Under Tasmania\u2019s Hare-Clark electoral system \u2013 in which each lower house state seat is represented by five MPs \u2013 casual vacancies are determined by a countback of the previous election, not a byelection. \u201cThis is a system that virtually always elects a person of the same party as the person who resigned,\u201d Bonham said. \u201cIn this case, first preferences for Will Hodgman will go the second preference. If that is someone who is not contesting the recount \u2013 for example if they were already elected, it moves on the third, and so on.\u201d At the 2018 election, Hodgman was elected with 27,184 primary votes \u2013 more than all Labor candidates received in the seat (24,464). \u201cI think it is very likely that Hodgman will be replaced by Nic Street \u2013 if he contests,\u201d Bonham said. \u201cHe was one of the sitting MPs for Franklin and he very narrowly lost his seat in the 2018 election, which makes him eligible for this election.\u201d Only those who ran in the previous election are eligible to contest the recount. \u201cThe electoral commission notifies them there is vacancy and they say have to yes to be included,\u201d said Bonham. \u201cSome of them won\u2019t. Claire Chandler, for example, will be eligible to recontest, but she won\u2019t because she is now a federal senator.\u201d On Tuesday, prime minister Scott Morrison praised Hodgman as \u201ca Tasmanian and Liberal legend\u201d. Tasmania\u2019s Labor leader, Rebecca White, said she respected Hodgman\u2019s decision to spend more time with his family. \u201cOutside the cut and thrust of parliament, Will and I have always respected each other despite our political differences,\u201d she said. \u201cI recognise Will\u2019s love for Tasmania and his passion for this great state and I know that has driven him. It\u2019s a passion we share. \u201cI give my best regards to Will and his family and wish him all the best for the next challenge.\u201d The Tasmanian Greens leader, Cassy O\u2019Connor, said there was \u201cno question Will has left his mark as a popular Liberal premier\u201d even though they had clashed politically at times. \u201cOn behalf of the Tasmanian Greens, I acknowledge Will Hodgman\u2019s many years of service to the people of Franklin, and to Tasmania as premier,\u201d she said. \u201cOn a personal note, I\u2019ve always found Will to be very likeable and excellent company outside parliament. \u201cI note Will Hodgman says he is proud of his government\u2019s emissions profile. In a very significant part, Tasmania\u2019s measure as a net carbon sink since 2013 is due to the protection of forests and transition to plantations that was made possible because of Greens in government. \u201cMy colleague, Rosalie Woodruff, and I wish Will, Nicky and their three children a very happy life together post-Parliament whatever direction it takes them.\u201d The former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett also paid tribute to Hodgman, tweeting that he had \u201cbeen a great servant of his state\u201d. A federal Liberal senator for Tasmania Jonathon Duniam, who was a former staffer for Hodgman, said he was a \u201ctremendous man\u201d. Bridget Archer, the federal Liberal MP for Bass, said Hodgman\u2019s leadership was \u201cone of the reasons I first stood for election\u201d, while another federal Tasmanian Liberal senator, Claire Chandler, said she was \u201cvery thankful for Will\u2019s friendship and support throughout my political career\u201d.",

Charles is never going to be much loved; William must see his fate when he looks at his father. And Harry, like his mother, sees another life. That life may well be a form of whistleblowing on the firm\u2019s secrets \u2026 Things are falling apart. The United Kingdom is one of them. The union bit is inevitably going. And the kingdom? Well, if this family (its dysfunction is hardly news) is to represent us then it has to change. We have no need of titles when we have self-made celebrities. Yes, Meghan and Harry told their celeb mates before they told the Queen, because that is their world. Harry will never be king. He has watched his father, whose life has been an endless gap year and who was cruel to his mother, and he wants out. I don\u2019t blame him. The much-admired sense of duty of the monarch will die when the Queen is dead. Meghan and Harry owe us nothing, and we owe them nothing. Let them go and finance themselves. One day we may actually be a sovereign nation. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>On Ilkley Moor in west Yorkshire on a Tuesday evening in May, 200 people milled about in glorious sunshine, ready to run the five-mile Jack Bloor race over moors recently blackened in a fire, but still beautiful. The air was clear, the good cheer was tangible, the moor birds clucked high up on the hill that we would soon have to climb.</p> <p>We gathered at the start, and everything proceeded as it does at fell races: someone gave inaudible instructions and then said something like: \u201cRight then, off you go.\u201d Fell running \u2013 making your own way between checkpoints over moorland, hill or mountain \u2013 thinks itself a pure yet humble sport. Fell runners have no truck with fancy gear like road runners do, or shiny poles like ultrarunners. We don\u2019t even need paths. Some of this purist attitude comes from where we run, through thigh-deep bogs and leg-scraping bracken, down scree and boulders at the pace of a fearless child. We run against the elements as much as against other runners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/14/kudos-leaderboards-qoms-how-fitness-app-strava-became-a-religion-podcast\">Kudos, leaderboards, QOMs: how fitness app Strava became a religion \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet, at the start of the race, two things happened: 400 feet started to move, and 200 fingers pressed a button on a wristwatch equipped with GPS, setting the devices to record. The moor birds\u2019 cheeps were now accompanied by beeps. When it comes to tracking and measuring runs, and being obsessed with data, we are right up there with the rest of the field. But tracking and measuring were just the start. Soon after finishing the race, most of the runners would upload that GPS data to a digital platform that has changed the world of amateur sport. The fell runners knew, as millions of people worldwide do, that if it isn\u2019t on Strava, it didn\u2019t happen.</p> <p>Strava is a fitness and sports tracking platform that launched in 2009 and bills itself the \u201cnumber one app for runners and cyclists\u201d. As long as you have a smartphone, watch or bike computer that records your activities using GPS, you can sync it with Strava, then upload your run, cycle, ski or almost any other activity, and be rewarded with astonishing levels of data analysis. For an amateur, the data available from Strava is like having a Team GB coach in your phone, for free.</p> <p>Strava tells me how fast I ran in May 2015 or last Thursday, and how much improvement I have made. Every run I do is recognised and automatically matched to anyone else who has run the same route, or part of it. Athletes \u2013 as Strava flatteringly calls its users \u2013 can create a \u201csegment\u201d, a portion of a route, perhaps featuring a hill or a stretch of lake, against which other athletes can then match their own efforts. In my local park, I can see how my 2017 self did on a segment someone has named Up the Bloody Hill, or on Stairway to Heaven (actually steps to the car park), or on #Weeeeeeeeeee! My efforts can be scored on \u201cleaderboards\u201d so that I can compare myself with myself, with my Strava followers and friends, or with strangers from Korea to Kansas.</p> <p>Because of Strava, I know how many miles my shoes have covered and whether I need new ones, as the app will email me to tell me (without sending me ads for shoes). After a race, I can launch Strava\u2019s Flyby feature, an ingenious interactive map, and watch my digital self rerun the race route alongside anyone else who ran it. It is addictive, to watch these ghosts in the machine, and see where they got away, or where I caught them up, to see if they went wrong and how badly. For my efforts, I can be given \u201ckudos\u201d by anyone who follows me \u2013 the Strava \u201clike\u201d, signified by a thumbs up \u2013 and I can do the same for them. I can leave supportive comments and add photos. I can change the name of my activity from the default \u201cmorning run\u201d or \u201clunch ride\u201d to something witty and punning, and it is one of the unwritten rules of Strava that I should.</p> <p>Because of Strava, I also have a ringside seat into how elite athletes train and race: more than half of the Tour de France peloton last year uploaded their stages. I can follow the training of <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/pros/5452411\" title=\"\">K</a><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/pros/5452411\" title=\"\">\u00edlian Jornet</a>, the world\u2019s best mountain runner, or champion distance runner <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/pros/3167729\" title=\"\">Aly Dixon</a>. Strava has been downloaded by 49 million people in 195 countries, and the company claims it attracts a million new users a month. In total, these people upload 25 activities a second, or 15.3m a week. They share 4 million photos a week and last year gave each other 3.6bn kudos. In the reward loop of Strava, activities get kudos, which encourages more activities. Adding funny names, emojis or photos increases the number of kudos by up to a third. More kudos, more exercise. The more people share their data, the better the experience.</p> <p>There are now many thousands of apps available that can track your weight, calorie intake, hormones, sleep patterns, insulin levels and water intake. The number of Americans who own a smartphone (defined as a device that combines a phone with some computing ability and internet access) jumped from 56% of the population in 2013 to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/\" title=\"\">about 80% today</a>, or 299 million. There are apps that buzz you when you slouch, or remind you to stand up. You can buy headbands and clip-on cameras that monitor your heart rate, temperature and menstrual cycle. Market projections state that this year, the health and fitness wearable tech market <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/paullamkin/2016/02/17/wearable-tech-market-to-be-worth-34-billion-by-2020/#69601c763cb5\" title=\"\">will be worth $34bn</a>.</p> <p>The essential goal of any tech platform is to make you use it again. This is called \u201cstickiness\u201d. But one step beyond stickiness is community: the key is to embed a tech platform into someone\u2019s life, including their friends and wider circle of acquaintances and fellow athletes they haven\u2019t even met. Group encouragement is proven to have a positive effect on fitness: users who belong to a club (including virtual ones) upload three times more activities than non-members.</p> <p>Ben Mounsey is a top mountain runner from Yorkshire, and formerly a school photography teacher in Elland, near Halifax. Before he discovered Strava, he was a good enough runner to make national teams. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have any focus. I was just running on natural fumes,\u201d he says. He never kept a diary and could not remember his run times. In 2014, a friend mentioned Strava. He signed up, got a GPS watch and started recording his times. \u201cI became obsessed, from day one,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I don\u2019t consider myself addicted to Strava: I don\u2019t check in unless I\u2019ve done an activity. I don\u2019t get notifications. I have never created a segment and don\u2019t know how to. I would never log into Strava just to browse. And yet, looking at the data has become an essential part of my exercise regime. Once, my phone broke when I was travelling without a computer to hand, and my first action when I got a new one was to manually upload to Strava the runs I had done without it. My data shows I have done 171 runs in the past 12 months: my memory has recorded that I did fewer than half a dozen that weren\u2019t logged. What I don\u2019t know is how a middling, menopausal fell runner, who only began running at the age of 41, and will never win much, got to care so much about any of this.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the mid-90s, two former college friends, Michael Horvath and Mark Gainey, met to discuss an idea. They had been competitive rowers at Harvard, and both missed rowing life: its competition and camaraderie were hard to recreate when they no longer had time for team sports. Gainey and Horvath\u2019s idea was to create a \u201cvirtual locker room\u201d where people who exercised alone could still find a community. But the technology wasn\u2019t good enough to build what they wanted. Instead, they founded Kana, a company selling email and marketing software which, at its height, was valued at $10bn (\u00a37.7bn).</p> <p>In 2006, they came up with the idea for a social network for athletes, with \u201cathlete\u201d meaning anyone who took fitness seriously. (Strava\u2019s CEO until November last year, James Quarles, defines an athlete as \u201canyone who sweats\u201d.) They chose the name Strava, from the Swedish \u201cto strive\u201d. By then, technology had progressed enough for people to carry GPS devices in their pockets, and strap on lightweight heart monitors.</p> <p>Gainey and Horvath had observed that digital sharing was rising at the same time as communal activity was declining. They targeted what they called \u201cavids\u201d \u2013 cyclists who rode frequently \u2013 and hoped that word would spread. From the beginning, the big hook was the leaderboard, a ranking of anyone who has cycled a particular route. This was not unique, but was borrowed from online gaming. The difference was that this scoreboard was linked to real-world physical activity. Strava offered the competitive draw of segments and the gratification of kudos. There were also rewards: as the quickest rider of any segment, you would be labelled King of the Mountain (KOM) or Queen of the Mountain (QOM). That these prizes are fleeting, lasting only as long as it takes for someone to beat your time, only increased the addictiveness.</p> <p>These features \u2013 lures, rewards, competition \u2013 are now considered standard in gamification, which apps use to get us to return. Strava\u2019s ace was to combine the competitive appeal of the segment with a community of likeminded people who knew how much it meant to come back from injury or miss a personal best. Add an interface that is widely accepted to be clever, clean and extremely simple to use \u2013 along with the increasingly rare situation of being free from ads \u2013 and Strava was a hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76aaa6377b1944b6b5ee32a16143104570d8858a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76aaa6377b1944b6b5ee32a16143104570d8858a/0_143_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strava art: a Welsh dragon created on the app.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strava art: a Welsh dragon created on the app.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first Strava user was David Belden, a cyclist from California. (He is still on Strava and, in 2019, he covered 1,455.8 miles and climbed almost 40,000 metres.) For the first years, the main users of Strava looked similar to Belden, in that most of them were male and on a bike. Growth was steady. In 2011, Strava offered a separate running app, before merging everything in 2014. Strava staff like to call their product \u201cagnostic\u201d because it doesn\u2019t care what device or app is used to upload data. \u201cWe are the Switzerland of tracking platforms,\u201d says Gareth Nettleton, vice-president of marketing at Strava\u2019s UK base in Bristol.</p> <p>Strava accepts data from devices made by Suunto, Zwift, Garmin, Polar, Fitbit or Apple, and is equally broadminded in which activity it allows you to upload. The current menu includes in-line skating, rock climbing and standup paddling. (Although Public Health England includes gardening as an accepted physical activity, Strava does not.) Strava\u2019s annual report of stats suggests that still men make up 75% of users. Women\u2019s most popular activity is running; men still prefer cycling.</p> <p>Strava data has shown that older people work out more than younger; that women are better at pacing a marathon than men; and that cyclists over the age of 50 go 50% further than cyclists in their 20s on an average ride.<strong> </strong>Strava has also given rise to another trend. Since others can look at their routes, athletes have started making Strava performance art \u2013 riding or running a route that, once mapped, becomes an image or message. Top efforts so far: a New Forest pony, <a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/five-best-strava-art-139034\" title=\"\">a marriage proposal</a> (she said yes in the comments) and an impressive Father Christmas, created by \u201cpedalling Picasso\u201d Anthony Hoyte from Cheltenham (his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/news/a25578459/strava-art-anthony-hoyte-santa/\" title=\"\">Fowl Play 2</a>\u201d image of several birds required a ride of 51 miles and a climb of 1,200 metres).</p> <p>Strava is not the most-used fitness app in the world. Runkeeper has 50 million users; Runtastic claims more than 147 million registered users and is popular in Europe. Other strong competitors are MapMyRun, Endomondo, Nike+ and Google Fit. Most offer some variety of tracking, recording and sociability. Many are owned by big sports shoe and clothing corporations (Asics, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/02/asics-buys-runkeeper-in-another-shoe-and-software-team-up/\" title=\"\">bought Runkeeper in 2016</a> for $83m; Under Armor <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/14/under-armour-puts-down-150m-to-acquire-fitness-tracking-platform-maymyfitness-and-its-20m-users/\" title=\"\">bought MapMyRun</a> and its 20 million users for $150m).</p> <p>Strava does not sell clothes or shoes. Quarles, former CEO, came from Instagram, where he had introduced ads, but there are no plans to do the same at Strava. More important is building goodwill in the community. \u201cI worked for a long time at the intersection of technology and communities,\u201d he told me on the phone from the US last spring, \u201cand at how technology brings people closer together, not turns into this dystopian thing of them spending time apart.\u201d</p> <p>Strava users may start as loners, only tracking their own activities, but the hope is that they will soon be hooked into tracking friends and peers, and that this will push them to go further and faster. But the friendly competition of a supportive, likeminded community can sometimes lead to darker impulses.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Mounsey, the mountain runner, found the segment a powerful addiction. For months, he \u201cwent crazy\u201d trying to win every segment within a 10-mile radius. \u201cEveryone hated me for a long time in Elland.\u201d Once, he says, a clubmate took a segment off him on a local steep hill called Trooper Lane. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I tried not to be bothered by it, I saw it at 7.30pm and by 8pm I was analysing it.\u201d The next morning, he got up an hour earlier than normal, ate nothing, stopped off at Trooper Lane, did a hard session of 35 minutes, beat his clubmate by five minutes, then went to work and fell asleep in the classroom. \u201cI felt really ill, I\u2019d pushed myself so hard, all for a bloody segment, for male pride,\u201d he says. Then adds: \u201cI\u2019m portraying myself as a bit of a psychopath here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>When he found himself running miles on a Sunday just because he hadn\u2019t reached his self-imposed weekly target, he pulled back. \u201cI can see the good and bad in Strava.\u201d (He\u2019s still on it, though. Disclaimer: he is an unpaid Strava ambassador.)</p> <p>Strava says segments don\u2019t just appeal to men, although I have never seen a female runner suddenly set off at speed shouting \u201csegment!\u201d as a male clubmate once did. This pursuit of a record can encourage dangerous impulses. In 2010, a cyclist named William \u201cKim\u201d Flint was killed chasing a fast downhill segment when his bike, travelling at 40mph, crashed into a car in Oakland, California. (His family sued Strava and lost.) Forbes magazine called this \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/06/20/a-quantified-self-fatality-family-says-cyclists-death-is-fault-of-ride-tracking-company-strava/#78c86f3f3eec\" title=\"\">a quantified-self fatality</a>\u201d. Mountain bikers frequently report being pushed off trails by other bikers descending at speed and yelling \u201cSTRAVA!\u201d. In 2016, alarmed by the speeds recorded on Strava segments, a council in Los Altos, California, <a href=\"https://www.losaltosonline.com/news/sections/news/199-city-affairs/52265-\" title=\"\">banned mountain bikers from Byrne Preserve.</a> Strava now lets users flag a segment as hazardous, and its terms of service absolve the company of any responsibility for \u201cknown or unknown risks associated with these activities even if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction or negligence of Strava\u201d.</p> <p>Once, I got a CR \u2013 course record, the equivalent of Queen of the Mountain \u2013 on a random stretch of trail in south-west France. This is a rare enough event that I remember it vividly. Within hours, a Strava email alerted me that I had lost the record; I immediately logged in to see who had taken it. Then I checked how fast she had run it and compared her time to mine. Then I went to her profile and checked how old she was and all her other activities. A year later, I am still planning to go back to that unremarkable forest track up the hill from Belesta and sprint up a random 400 metres as fast as I possibly can.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strava forums have plenty of fuming users enraged about cheating. E-bike users who \u201cforget\u201d to mark their rides as an e-bike and end up on leaderboard are a growing problem. Taking your GPS watch for a drive is another. In Hong Kong, one user wrote on Strava\u2019s forum: \u201cA large percentage of segments is polluted by people using cars or electric scooters.\u201d</p> <p>Some of this is accidental, as e-bike users have to manually change a setting on Strava to mark their rides as assisted. Some of it is not. An e-biker named Matt May has a profile picture of a bottle of vodka attached to his bike, and delights in annoying Strava purists. There are legitimate third-party apps that claim to help people improve their Strava stats by alerting them, for example, to wind conditions. Then there was the short-lived website Digital EPO (named after erythropoietin, a common illegal drug in sport) that allowed people to alter the GPS data to show they had gone faster than they had in reality. This inflamed plenty of cycling and running forums.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/mark-gainey-and-michael-horvath-435/\" title=\"\">On his podcast</a>, the California-based ultra-endurance athlete Rich Roll hints at why what people post on Strava matters: \u201cThere\u2019s something uniquely special about being privy to the daily grind of my favorite multi-sport athletes. Their transparency holds me accountable. In turn, I help hold my community accountable. And openly sharing our collective fitness experience \u2013 the highs and the lows \u2013 makes all of us better.\u201d</p> <p>I did once report a cheat. Strava lets you do this by \u201cflagging\u201d a suspect activity, such as a ride or run that has clearly been done in a car, or on an e-bike. Why did I care? It was a woman who had apparently run a stretch of my local park in about 10 seconds. I cared because I had just run that same stretch and it had taken more than two minutes. I cared because it was physically impossible to do what her upload said. I am never going to be an elite athlete. I am competitive, but only with myself, and only because I want to disprove the idea that a 50-year-old woman cannot improve. Yet, suddenly, when I saw that improbable segment, I was seven years old again and someone had cheated in the playground. My emotions had the purity of childish rage, that white heat of unfairness. I flagged the segment, which meant she would have been given an option to delete it, which she did. I\u2019m not sure if I felt bigger or smaller for doing it. (I\u2019m lying. I would do it again.)</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Strava is growing, though probably not as fast as the company would like. Over 80% of Strava\u2019s users are outside the US, and Brazil is now its second biggest national market after the US. It is also big in the rest of Europe and getting big enough in Japan to have a country representative there. These country reps can deliver insights into how the world exercises.</p> <p>Brazilians are social, and they also love sport, making Brazil a perfect society for Strava (they also like to work out with their family, unlike any other country). The French are equally into running and cycling; Germans prefer bikes. Strava\u2019s yearly data report offers other revelations. The most active day of 2018 for German cyclists was 6 May; for French cyclists it was 9 September. Americans ran more on 23 November than on any other day in 2018; Japanese runners were busiest on 16 September. Globally, most people exercise on a Sunday except in the UK and Ireland, where we prefer Tuesday. Runners talk about beer in their activity uploads; cyclists talk more about coffee. From Strava data, the media concluded that the second week in January is \u201cquitters\u2019 week\u201d, when newly active users give up (although women will last two days longer than men).</p> <p>This data also offers a \u201cheat map\u201d \u2013 a record of activities in any given area. In 2018 Strava\u2019s global heat map, a record of 1bn activities worldwide, accidentally revealed the location of secret US military bases, because personnel had uploaded their activities to Strava and failed to opt out of heat maps. Fitness tracking data can have other uses: one user concluded her boyfriend was cheating by noticing how often his Strava rides were done in the company of another woman. Fitbit and Apple Watch data has been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43629255\" title=\"\">used to solve murders</a> (in one case, showing that the victim\u2019s heart rate had spiked during the suspect\u2019s visit and been silent thereafter). </p> <p>Those that opt in to Strava heat maps become a saleable product. Under a project called Metro, Strava sells anonymised data to cities about where and when its users ride and run and exercise. More than 70 cities have used Metro in the US states of Colorado, New Hampshire, and in the UK; as have academic and non-profit organisations such as Glasgow University\u2019s Urban Big Data Centre. Strava offers a paid subscription called Summit with additional features \u2013 more heart data, the ability to filter leaderboards by age and weight, and a useful location-tracking feature called Beacon \u2013 for about \u00a34.50 a month. The company doesn\u2019t release figures about how many of its athletes pay for Summit, but it is thought to be a percentage in single figures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b5287eee2d1124a0de0281e777a0b08d14cf7ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b5287eee2d1124a0de0281e777a0b08d14cf7ab/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Strava heat map of the UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Strava heat map of the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Strava</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Athletes who use products from companies with whom Strava has set up commercial partnerships now find their activities attached to a banner proclaiming that they \u201cran with Suunto\u201d or cycled with Zwift.

It is not an ad, but it smells like one. \u201cWahoo doesn\u2019t sponsor me,\u201d said one user in Strava\u2019s forum, among many objectors. \u201cThere is no reason I should be forced to sponsor them.\u201d</p> <p>When we spoke in early 2019, Quarles was optimistic that profitability wasn\u2019t far off, but he was suddenly replaced in November 2019<strong> </strong>by co-founder Michael Horvath, with Mark Gainey also returning to an active role. Strava also lost its high-profile chief technology officer, Stephanie Hannon, who had been digital chief for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, after only a year. There are a few options for Strava to make money: becoming a subscription-only service, selling up, selling its users to advertisers, or selling more data than it does currently (Metro data is anonymised, and Strava\u2019s terms of service say that users own their data, but that they grant Strava a huge licence to use it).</p> <p>Perhaps the golden years of this clever, uncommercial app being available for free are numbered. But Strava is still a beacon of positivity among the bile and manipulation of other social media. Trolling is rare and usually only takes the form of excessive kudos from randoms \u2013 and what\u2019s wrong with that? I get regular abuse on Twitter; on Strava, I have never had anything but encouragement. The company says its currency is effort, but it is also largely goodwill. The platform\u2019s privacy controls now are good enough that I can hide my home and my place of work, and I can stay off leaderboards. I could stay off Strava, too, but I don\u2019t intend to. It is a guidebook and a corkboard (posting photos, Strava believes, enables powerful \u201cmemorialisation\u201d of activities). It is training log, chat room and map room. And in these days of public carping and rage, it is something I prize more than race prizes: it is a refuge.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Richard Askwith, a British writer and fell runner, is the author of Running Free, a book about the over-commercialisation and datafication of running. He gave up running with a smartwatch years ago. \u201cI think if I was constantly wanting to tell other people about my runs I would be losing out on the experience of the run itself. If you\u2019re running off-road, then you\u2019re inhabiting your environment and you\u2019re sensing how your step feels and you\u2019re thinking about where your next step is going to go. Then if you want to think about how much effort you\u2019re putting in, you just sort put your foot on the pedal a bit, but it\u2019s all subjectively measured.\u201d</p> <p>Or, as one cyclist who had given up quantifying wrote: \u201cI remember when cycling used to be fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b6c12668f080a76425edf7cc263041381d92499f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c12668f080a76425edf7cc263041381d92499f/0_104_2572_3212/801.jpg\" alt=\"Rose George during the Shepherds Skyline fell race in the Calder Valley, West Yorkshire.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose George during the Shepherds Skyline fell race in the Calder Valley, West Yorkshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Smith Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The British Medical Journal provides a service assessing some fitness apps. Its entry on Strava lists the obvious pros (it\u2019s free, it\u2019s easy to set up, it encourages users to push harder than they would alone). The writer also warned of the cons: \u201cOwing to the competitive nature installed in users of the app, risk-taking behaviours may be increased that could lead to musculoskeletal injury or road traffic collisions.\u201d Also, \u201cone may forget what a leisurely bike ride or jog used to feel like.\u201d A paper presented at the Royal Geographical Society in London in 2013 by Dr Paul Barratt of Staffordshire University suggested that Strava was, perversely, making group rides antisocial, as riders concentrated on winning segments from virtual strangers rather than focusing on their fellow riders in real life.</p> <p>Fell runner Tim Dempsey gave up using technology on the hills three years ago. \u201cThinking forward to the completed run on-screen while running, only to finish and use the screen to look back. It removes you utterly from the moment. Two years on. I still look at my naked wrist for cues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love it and hate it in equal measure,\u201d says the runner and coach Anji Andrews. \u201cIt\u2019s great for logging training and keeping track of pace, routes, mileage. It\u2019s horrific in being, to many, just an online log of excuses and encouraging comparison (the thief of joy).\u201d</p> <p>Recently, on occasion, I have forgotten to wear my GPS watch at races and runs. At races, I experienced mild concern: if it is not recorded, then how will I know how fast I have run? How will my miles count towards my yearly 1,000-mile target? But then I set off, on a recreational or competitive run, and something happens. I feel freer. I run across moorland and stop to look around, and don\u2019t worry about pausing my watch, about someone later looking at my data and seeing that I stopped for a gawp of the purple heather and the eerie calm of the stone circle. I walk for a bit and revel in not being recorded. No one is looking. No one cares.</p> <p>At the biggest race in my calendar, the Yorkshire Three Peaks, I didn\u2019t dare leave my watch behind. I had certain cut-offs \u2013 set times \u2013 to reach, so I needed to know what the time was. But as I set off up Pen-y-Ghent, I did something strange, and turned my watch to the inside of my wrist. That made it slightly harder to check, and so I hardly checked it. I ran according to feel, as the training term goes, and despite hailstorms and cramp and only looking at my watch three times over 23 miles, I got the best time I had ever done.</p> <p>Maybe I had learned to pace myself so well by using tech that I could do it without? I was a fell running equivalent of Luke Skywalker in his X-wing fighter, switching off the targeting system and feeling the Force. Unchained from data, I felt free and powerful. And within a couple of hours of finishing, after sitting among my real life running friends in the race marquee, all of us glowing with achievement, and scoffing stew in likeminded company, I uploaded the run to Strava. How else would I get any kudos?</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2020.

      "bodyText": "On Ilkley Moor in west Yorkshire on a Tuesday evening in May, 200 people milled about in glorious sunshine, ready to run the five-mile Jack Bloor race over moors recently blackened in a fire, but still beautiful. The air was clear, the good cheer was tangible, the moor birds clucked high up on the hill that we would soon have to climb. We gathered at the start, and everything proceeded as it does at fell races: someone gave inaudible instructions and then said something like: \u201cRight then, off you go.\u201d Fell running \u2013 making your own way between checkpoints over moorland, hill or mountain \u2013 thinks itself a pure yet humble sport. Fell runners have no truck with fancy gear like road runners do, or shiny poles like ultrarunners. We don\u2019t even need paths. Some of this purist attitude comes from where we run, through thigh-deep bogs and leg-scraping bracken, down scree and boulders at the pace of a fearless child. We run against the elements as much as against other runners. Yet, at the start of the race, two things happened: 400 feet started to move, and 200 fingers pressed a button on a wristwatch equipped with GPS, setting the devices to record. The moor birds\u2019 cheeps were now accompanied by beeps. When it comes to tracking and measuring runs, and being obsessed with data, we are right up there with the rest of the field. But tracking and measuring were just the start. Soon after finishing the race, most of the runners would upload that GPS data to a digital platform that has changed the world of amateur sport. The fell runners knew, as millions of people worldwide do, that if it isn\u2019t on Strava, it didn\u2019t happen. Strava is a fitness and sports tracking platform that launched in 2009 and bills itself the \u201cnumber one app for runners and cyclists\u201d. As long as you have a smartphone, watch or bike computer that records your activities using GPS, you can sync it with Strava, then upload your run, cycle, ski or almost any other activity, and be rewarded with astonishing levels of data analysis. For an amateur, the data available from Strava is like having a Team GB coach in your phone, for free. Strava tells me how fast I ran in May 2015 or last Thursday, and how much improvement I have made. Every run I do is recognised and automatically matched to anyone else who has run the same route, or part of it. Athletes \u2013 as Strava flatteringly calls its users \u2013 can create a \u201csegment\u201d, a portion of a route, perhaps featuring a hill or a stretch of lake, against which other athletes can then match their own efforts. In my local park, I can see how my 2017 self did on a segment someone has named Up the Bloody Hill, or on Stairway to Heaven (actually steps to the car park), or on #Weeeeeeeeeee! My efforts can be scored on \u201cleaderboards\u201d so that I can compare myself with myself, with my Strava followers and friends, or with strangers from Korea to Kansas. Because of Strava, I know how many miles my shoes have covered and whether I need new ones, as the app will email me to tell me (without sending me ads for shoes). After a race, I can launch Strava\u2019s Flyby feature, an ingenious interactive map, and watch my digital self rerun the race route alongside anyone else who ran it. It is addictive, to watch these ghosts in the machine, and see where they got away, or where I caught them up, to see if they went wrong and how badly. For my efforts, I can be given \u201ckudos\u201d by anyone who follows me \u2013 the Strava \u201clike\u201d, signified by a thumbs up \u2013 and I can do the same for them. I can leave supportive comments and add photos. I can change the name of my activity from the default \u201cmorning run\u201d or \u201clunch ride\u201d to something witty and punning, and it is one of the unwritten rules of Strava that I should. Because of Strava, I also have a ringside seat into how elite athletes train and race: more than half of the Tour de France peloton last year uploaded their stages. I can follow the training of K\u00edlian Jornet, the world\u2019s best mountain runner, or champion distance runner Aly Dixon. Strava has been downloaded by 49 million people in 195 countries, and the company claims it attracts a million new users a month. In total, these people upload 25 activities a second, or 15.3m a week. They share 4 million photos a week and last year gave each other 3.6bn kudos. In the reward loop of Strava, activities get kudos, which encourages more activities. Adding funny names, emojis or photos increases the number of kudos by up to a third. More kudos, more exercise. The more people share their data, the better the experience. There are now many thousands of apps available that can track your weight, calorie intake, hormones, sleep patterns, insulin levels and water intake. The number of Americans who own a smartphone (defined as a device that combines a phone with some computing ability and internet access) jumped from 56% of the population in 2013 to about 80% today, or 299 million. There are apps that buzz you when you slouch, or remind you to stand up. You can buy headbands and clip-on cameras that monitor your heart rate, temperature and menstrual cycle. Market projections state that this year, the health and fitness wearable tech market will be worth $34bn. The essential goal of any tech platform is to make you use it again. This is called \u201cstickiness\u201d. But one step beyond stickiness is community: the key is to embed a tech platform into someone\u2019s life, including their friends and wider circle of acquaintances and fellow athletes they haven\u2019t even met. Group encouragement is proven to have a positive effect on fitness: users who belong to a club (including virtual ones) upload three times more activities than non-members. Ben Mounsey is a top mountain runner from Yorkshire, and formerly a school photography teacher in Elland, near Halifax. Before he discovered Strava, he was a good enough runner to make national teams. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have any focus. I was just running on natural fumes,\u201d he says. He never kept a diary and could not remember his run times. In 2014, a friend mentioned Strava. He signed up, got a GPS watch and started recording his times. \u201cI became obsessed, from day one,\u201d he says. I don\u2019t consider myself addicted to Strava: I don\u2019t check in unless I\u2019ve done an activity. I don\u2019t get notifications. I have never created a segment and don\u2019t know how to. I would never log into Strava just to browse. And yet, looking at the data has become an essential part of my exercise regime. Once, my phone broke when I was travelling without a computer to hand, and my first action when I got a new one was to manually upload to Strava the runs I had done without it. My data shows I have done 171 runs in the past 12 months: my memory has recorded that I did fewer than half a dozen that weren\u2019t logged. What I don\u2019t know is how a middling, menopausal fell runner, who only began running at the age of 41, and will never win much, got to care so much about any of this. * * * In the mid-90s, two former college friends, Michael Horvath and Mark Gainey, met to discuss an idea. They had been competitive rowers at Harvard, and both missed rowing life: its competition and camaraderie were hard to recreate when they no longer had time for team sports. Gainey and Horvath\u2019s idea was to create a \u201cvirtual locker room\u201d where people who exercised alone could still find a community. But the technology wasn\u2019t good enough to build what they wanted. Instead, they founded Kana, a company selling email and marketing software which, at its height, was valued at $10bn (\u00a37.7bn). In 2006, they came up with the idea for a social network for athletes, with \u201cathlete\u201d meaning anyone who took fitness seriously. (Strava\u2019s CEO until November last year, James Quarles, defines an athlete as \u201canyone who sweats\u201d.) They chose the name Strava, from the Swedish \u201cto strive\u201d. By then, technology had progressed enough for people to carry GPS devices in their pockets, and strap on lightweight heart monitors. Gainey and Horvath had observed that digital sharing was rising at the same time as communal activity was declining. They targeted what they called \u201cavids\u201d \u2013 cyclists who rode frequently \u2013 and hoped that word would spread. From the beginning, the big hook was the leaderboard, a ranking of anyone who has cycled a particular route. This was not unique, but was borrowed from online gaming. The difference was that this scoreboard was linked to real-world physical activity. Strava offered the competitive draw of segments and the gratification of kudos. There were also rewards: as the quickest rider of any segment, you would be labelled King of the Mountain (KOM) or Queen of the Mountain (QOM). That these prizes are fleeting, lasting only as long as it takes for someone to beat your time, only increased the addictiveness. These features \u2013 lures, rewards, competition \u2013 are now considered standard in gamification, which apps use to get us to return. Strava\u2019s ace was to combine the competitive appeal of the segment with a community of likeminded people who knew how much it meant to come back from injury or miss a personal best. Add an interface that is widely accepted to be clever, clean and extremely simple to use \u2013 along with the increasingly rare situation of being free from ads \u2013 and Strava was a hit. The first Strava user was David Belden, a cyclist from California. (He is still on Strava and, in 2019, he covered 1,455.8 miles and climbed almost 40,000 metres.) For the first years, the main users of Strava looked similar to Belden, in that most of them were male and on a bike. Growth was steady. In 2011, Strava offered a separate running app, before merging everything in 2014. Strava staff like to call their product \u201cagnostic\u201d because it doesn\u2019t care what device or app is used to upload data. \u201cWe are the Switzerland of tracking platforms,\u201d says Gareth Nettleton, vice-president of marketing at Strava\u2019s UK base in Bristol. Strava accepts data from devices made by Suunto, Zwift, Garmin, Polar, Fitbit or Apple, and is equally broadminded in which activity it allows you to upload. The current menu includes in-line skating, rock climbing and standup paddling. (Although Public Health England includes gardening as an accepted physical activity, Strava does not.) Strava\u2019s annual report of stats suggests that still men make up 75% of users. Women\u2019s most popular activity is running; men still prefer cycling. Strava data has shown that older people work out more than younger; that women are better at pacing a marathon than men; and that cyclists over the age of 50 go 50% further than cyclists in their 20s on an average ride. Strava has also given rise to another trend. Since others can look at their routes, athletes have started making Strava performance art \u2013 riding or running a route that, once mapped, becomes an image or message. Top efforts so far: a New Forest pony, a marriage proposal (she said yes in the comments) and an impressive Father Christmas, created by \u201cpedalling Picasso\u201d Anthony Hoyte from Cheltenham (his \u201cFowl Play 2\u201d image of several birds required a ride of 51 miles and a climb of 1,200 metres). Strava is not the most-used fitness app in the world. Runkeeper has 50 million users; Runtastic claims more than 147 million registered users and is popular in Europe. Other strong competitors are MapMyRun, Endomondo, Nike+ and Google Fit. Most offer some variety of tracking, recording and sociability. Many are owned by big sports shoe and clothing corporations (Asics, bought Runkeeper in 2016 for $83m; Under Armor bought MapMyRun and its 20 million users for $150m). Strava does not sell clothes or shoes. Quarles, former CEO, came from Instagram, where he had introduced ads, but there are no plans to do the same at Strava. More important is building goodwill in the community. \u201cI worked for a long time at the intersection of technology and communities,\u201d he told me on the phone from the US last spring, \u201cand at how technology brings people closer together, not turns into this dystopian thing of them spending time apart.\u201d Strava users may start as loners, only tracking their own activities, but the hope is that they will soon be hooked into tracking friends and peers, and that this will push them to go further and faster. But the friendly competition of a supportive, likeminded community can sometimes lead to darker impulses. * * * Mounsey, the mountain runner, found the segment a powerful addiction. For months, he \u201cwent crazy\u201d trying to win every segment within a 10-mile radius. \u201cEveryone hated me for a long time in Elland.\u201d Once, he says, a clubmate took a segment off him on a local steep hill called Trooper Lane. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I tried not to be bothered by it, I saw it at 7.30pm and by 8pm I was analysing it.\u201d The next morning, he got up an hour earlier than normal, ate nothing, stopped off at Trooper Lane, did a hard session of 35 minutes, beat his clubmate by five minutes, then went to work and fell asleep in the classroom. \u201cI felt really ill, I\u2019d pushed myself so hard, all for a bloody segment, for male pride,\u201d he says. Then adds: \u201cI\u2019m portraying myself as a bit of a psychopath here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d When he found himself running miles on a Sunday just because he hadn\u2019t reached his self-imposed weekly target, he pulled back. \u201cI can see the good and bad in Strava.\u201d (He\u2019s still on it, though. Disclaimer: he is an unpaid Strava ambassador.) Strava says segments don\u2019t just appeal to men, although I have never seen a female runner suddenly set off at speed shouting \u201csegment!\u201d as a male clubmate once did. This pursuit of a record can encourage dangerous impulses. In 2010, a cyclist named William \u201cKim\u201d Flint was killed chasing a fast downhill segment when his bike, travelling at 40mph, crashed into a car in Oakland, California. (His family sued Strava and lost.) Forbes magazine called this \u201ca quantified-self fatality\u201d. Mountain bikers frequently report being pushed off trails by other bikers descending at speed and yelling \u201cSTRAVA!\u201d. In 2016, alarmed by the speeds recorded on Strava segments, a council in Los Altos, California, banned mountain bikers from Byrne Preserve. Strava now lets users flag a segment as hazardous, and its terms of service absolve the company of any responsibility for \u201cknown or unknown risks associated with these activities even if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction or negligence of Strava\u201d. Once, I got a CR \u2013 course record, the equivalent of Queen of the Mountain \u2013 on a random stretch of trail in south-west France. This is a rare enough event that I remember it vividly. Within hours, a Strava email alerted me that I had lost the record; I immediately logged in to see who had taken it. Then I checked how fast she had run it and compared her time to mine. Then I went to her profile and checked how old she was and all her other activities. A year later, I am still planning to go back to that unremarkable forest track up the hill from Belesta and sprint up a random 400 metres as fast as I possibly can. Strava forums have plenty of fuming users enraged about cheating. E-bike users who \u201cforget\u201d to mark their rides as an e-bike and end up on leaderboard are a growing problem. Taking your GPS watch for a drive is another. In Hong Kong, one user wrote on Strava\u2019s forum: \u201cA large percentage of segments is polluted by people using cars or electric scooters.\u201d Some of this is accidental, as e-bike users have to manually change a setting on Strava to mark their rides as assisted. Some of it is not. An e-biker named Matt May has a profile picture of a bottle of vodka attached to his bike, and delights in annoying Strava purists. There are legitimate third-party apps that claim to help people improve their Strava stats by alerting them, for example, to wind conditions. Then there was the short-lived website Digital EPO (named after erythropoietin, a common illegal drug in sport) that allowed people to alter the GPS data to show they had gone faster than they had in reality. This inflamed plenty of cycling and running forums. On his podcast, the California-based ultra-endurance athlete Rich Roll hints at why what people post on Strava matters: \u201cThere\u2019s something uniquely special about being privy to the daily grind of my favorite multi-sport athletes. Their transparency holds me accountable. In turn, I help hold my community accountable. And openly sharing our collective fitness experience \u2013 the highs and the lows \u2013 makes all of us better.\u201d I did once report a cheat. Strava lets you do this by \u201cflagging\u201d a suspect activity, such as a ride or run that has clearly been done in a car, or on an e-bike. Why did I care? It was a woman who had apparently run a stretch of my local park in about 10 seconds. I cared because I had just run that same stretch and it had taken more than two minutes. I cared because it was physically impossible to do what her upload said. I am never going to be an elite athlete. I am competitive, but only with myself, and only because I want to disprove the idea that a 50-year-old woman cannot improve. Yet, suddenly, when I saw that improbable segment, I was seven years old again and someone had cheated in the playground. My emotions had the purity of childish rage, that white heat of unfairness. I flagged the segment, which meant she would have been given an option to delete it, which she did. I\u2019m not sure if I felt bigger or smaller for doing it. (I\u2019m lying. I would do it again.) * * * Strava is growing, though probably not as fast as the company would like. Over 80% of Strava\u2019s users are outside the US, and Brazil is now its second biggest national market after the US. It is also big in the rest of Europe and getting big enough in Japan to have a country representative there. These country reps can deliver insights into how the world exercises. Brazilians are social, and they also love sport, making Brazil a perfect society for Strava (they also like to work out with their family, unlike any other country). The French are equally into running and cycling; Germans prefer bikes. Strava\u2019s yearly data report offers other revelations. The most active day of 2018 for German cyclists was 6 May; for French cyclists it was 9 September. Americans ran more on 23 November than on any other day in 2018; Japanese runners were busiest on 16 September. Globally, most people exercise on a Sunday except in the UK and Ireland, where we prefer Tuesday. Runners talk about beer in their activity uploads; cyclists talk more about coffee. From Strava data, the media concluded that the second week in January is \u201cquitters\u2019 week\u201d, when newly active users give up (although women will last two days longer than men). This data also offers a \u201cheat map\u201d \u2013 a record of activities in any given area. In 2018 Strava\u2019s global heat map, a record of 1bn activities worldwide, accidentally revealed the location of secret US military bases, because personnel had uploaded their activities to Strava and failed to opt out of heat maps. Fitness tracking data can have other uses: one user concluded her boyfriend was cheating by noticing how often his Strava rides were done in the company of another woman. Fitbit and Apple Watch data has been used to solve murders (in one case, showing that the victim\u2019s heart rate had spiked during the suspect\u2019s visit and been silent thereafter). Those that opt in to Strava heat maps become a saleable product. Under a project called Metro, Strava sells anonymised data to cities about where and when its users ride and run and exercise. More than 70 cities have used Metro in the US states of Colorado, New Hampshire, and in the UK; as have academic and non-profit organisations such as Glasgow University\u2019s Urban Big Data Centre. Strava offers a paid subscription called Summit with additional features \u2013 more heart data, the ability to filter leaderboards by age and weight, and a useful location-tracking feature called Beacon \u2013 for about \u00a34.50 a month. The company doesn\u2019t release figures about how many of its athletes pay for Summit, but it is thought to be a percentage in single figures. Athletes who use products from companies with whom Strava has set up commercial partnerships now find their activities attached to a banner proclaiming that they \u201cran with Suunto\u201d or cycled with Zwift. For the first time this year, Strava\u2019s Year in Sport report included a section on \u201cthe world\u2019s hottest gear\u201d, a list of the most popular brands used by people on the platform. It is not an ad, but it smells like one. \u201cWahoo doesn\u2019t sponsor me,\u201d said one user in Strava\u2019s forum, among many objectors. \u201cThere is no reason I should be forced to sponsor them.\u201d When we spoke in early 2019, Quarles was optimistic that profitability wasn\u2019t far off, but he was suddenly replaced in November 2019 by co-founder Michael Horvath, with Mark Gainey also returning to an active role. Strava also lost its high-profile chief technology officer, Stephanie Hannon, who had been digital chief for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, after only a year. There are a few options for Strava to make money: becoming a subscription-only service, selling up, selling its users to advertisers, or selling more data than it does currently (Metro data is anonymised, and Strava\u2019s terms of service say that users own their data, but that they grant Strava a huge licence to use it). Perhaps the golden years of this clever, uncommercial app being available for free are numbered. But Strava is still a beacon of positivity among the bile and manipulation of other social media. Trolling is rare and usually only takes the form of excessive kudos from randoms \u2013 and what\u2019s wrong with that? I get regular abuse on Twitter; on Strava, I have never had anything but encouragement. The company says its currency is effort, but it is also largely goodwill. The platform\u2019s privacy controls now are good enough that I can hide my home and my place of work, and I can stay off leaderboards. I could stay off Strava, too, but I don\u2019t intend to. It is a guidebook and a corkboard (posting photos, Strava believes, enables powerful \u201cmemorialisation\u201d of activities). It is training log, chat room and map room. And in these days of public carping and rage, it is something I prize more than race prizes: it is a refuge. * * * Richard Askwith, a British writer and fell runner, is the author of Running Free, a book about the over-commercialisation and datafication of running. He gave up running with a smartwatch years ago. \u201cI think if I was constantly wanting to tell other people about my runs I would be losing out on the experience of the run itself. If you\u2019re running off-road, then you\u2019re inhabiting your environment and you\u2019re sensing how your step feels and you\u2019re thinking about where your next step is going to go. Then if you want to think about how much effort you\u2019re putting in, you just sort put your foot on the pedal a bit, but it\u2019s all subjectively measured.\u201d Or, as one cyclist who had given up quantifying wrote: \u201cI remember when cycling used to be fun.\u201d The British Medical Journal provides a service assessing some fitness apps. Its entry on Strava lists the obvious pros (it\u2019s free, it\u2019s easy to set up, it encourages users to push harder than they would alone). The writer also warned of the cons: \u201cOwing to the competitive nature installed in users of the app, risk-taking behaviours may be increased that could lead to musculoskeletal injury or road traffic collisions.\u201d Also, \u201cone may forget what a leisurely bike ride or jog used to feel like.\u201d A paper presented at the Royal Geographical Society in London in 2013 by Dr Paul Barratt of Staffordshire University suggested that Strava was, perversely, making group rides antisocial, as riders concentrated on winning segments from virtual strangers rather than focusing on their fellow riders in real life. Fell runner Tim Dempsey gave up using technology on the hills three years ago. \u201cThinking forward to the completed run on-screen while running, only to finish and use the screen to look back. It removes you utterly from the moment. Two years on. I still look at my naked wrist for cues.\u201d \u201cI love it and hate it in equal measure,\u201d says the runner and coach Anji Andrews. \u201cIt\u2019s great for logging training and keeping track of pace, routes, mileage. It\u2019s horrific in being, to many, just an online log of excuses and encouraging comparison (the thief of joy).\u201d Recently, on occasion, I have forgotten to wear my GPS watch at races and runs. At races, I experienced mild concern: if it is not recorded, then how will I know how fast I have run? How will my miles count towards my yearly 1,000-mile target? But then I set off, on a recreational or competitive run, and something happens. I feel freer. I run across moorland and stop to look around, and don\u2019t worry about pausing my watch, about someone later looking at my data and seeing that I stopped for a gawp of the purple heather and the eerie calm of the stone circle. I walk for a bit and revel in not being recorded. No one is looking. No one cares. At the biggest race in my calendar, the Yorkshire Three Peaks, I didn\u2019t dare leave my watch behind. I had certain cut-offs \u2013 set times \u2013 to reach, so I needed to know what the time was. But as I set off up Pen-y-Ghent, I did something strange, and turned my watch to the inside of my wrist. That made it slightly harder to check, and so I hardly checked it. I ran according to feel, as the training term goes, and despite hailstorms and cramp and only looking at my watch three times over 23 miles, I got the best time I had ever done. Maybe I had learned to pace myself so well by using tech that I could do it without? I was a fell running equivalent of Luke Skywalker in his X-wing fighter, switching off the targeting system and feeling the Force. Unchained from data, I felt free and powerful. And within a couple of hours of finishing, after sitting among my real life running friends in the race marquee, all of us glowing with achievement, and scoffing stew in likeminded company, I uploaded the run to Strava. How else would I get any kudos? \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2020.

In fact it was Horvath who became CEO, and Gainey who returned to an active role in the company. This has been corrected.",

Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Probation has painted a picture of a service in crisis with hundreds of vacancies, overstretched officers and managers, and crumbling, overcrowded buildings, including hostels for recently released offenders. An inspection of the central functions supporting the National Probation Service (NPS), the publicly run arm of the probation sector, which supervises about 105,000 high-risk offenders, found that some officers were not properly reviewing their cases. The report follows a number of high-profile cases with links to probation, including those of the London Bridge terrorist Usman Khan and the serial rapist Joseph McCann.

      "body": "<p>When she was a little girl in Essex in the 50s, Linda Miller would go over to her neighbour Barbara\u2019s house every Friday night and together they would sit on the front step eating crisps. There was only one flavour widely available back then \u2013 Smith\u2019s plain potato crisps, which came with a small blue sachet of salt that could be sprinkled over them. One Friday night, the two friends struck upon an idea. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d invented a new crisp,\u201d says 68-year-old Miller. Inspired by their weekly fish and chip takeaway, the pair \u201csaturated\u201d their plain crisps with a bottle of vinegar. \u201cIt was lovely, lovely \u2013 very tasty,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWhen salt and vinegar crisps came out, I remember thinking: \u2018They\u2019re not as good as what we do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Crisps were first mass-produced in the early 20th century, but the first flavoured crisp was released only in the late 50s, after Joe \u201cSpud\u201d Murphy, the owner of the Irish company Tayto, developed a technique to add cheese and onion seasoning during production. Salt and vinegar crisps were <a href=\"https://www.saga.co.uk/magazine/entertainment/nostalgia/a-brief-history-of-crisps\" title=\"\">launched throughout the UK </a><a href=\"https://www.saga.co.uk/magazine/entertainment/nostalgia/a-brief-history-of-crisps\" title=\"\">a decade later</a>, in 1967, when Miller was 16.</p> <p>In her lifetime, a transformation has taken place on supermarket shelves. Should you want to, you can now buy not only bacon, chicken, chilli and pickled onion crisps, but truffle, pink peppercorn gin, baked camembert, masala chicken, brie, Aberdeen Angus beef, salted caramel, katsu curry and sriracha. (To this day, Miller prefers to vinegar her own crisps.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because the UK is so multicultural ... it gives us more leeway to use more unusual or interesting flavours</p> <footer> <cite>Tassy Goodall</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How is it possible that, in 60 years, British shops have gone from selling one crisp flavour to selling hundreds \u2013 and why are seasonings becoming more unusual? What led Kettle Chips to release a \u201ctruffled cheese and a splash of English sparkling wine\u201d flavour in October? Was there a mad scientific breakthrough that caused Walkers to release bratwurst, paella, haggis and spaghetti bolognese crisps in 2010?</p> <p>In the beginning, says the food historian Nadia Berenstein, industry experts thought of crisps as potatoes. What this means, she explains, is that early seasonings mimicked the flavours that would accompany traditional potato dishes \u2013 salt and vinegar, cheese and onion, and barbecue sauce in the US. Although synthetic chemical compounds for flavouring were developed in the middle of the 19th century, Berenstein says the industry exploded after the second world war with the invention of a device called the gas chromatograph, or GC.</p> <p>\u201cThe GC was a really powerful tool for identifying the volatile compounds that are present in and contribute to flavours,\u201d Berenstein says. \u201cJust being able to figure out, isolate and identify these things prior to the GC took a long time. To study the flavour chemistry of apples, you\u2019d have to start with a literal tonne of apples and then process those down to a concentrate of a couple of milligrams.\u201d For the first time, gas chromatography allowed food scientists to quickly understand the chemical compounds behind complex flavours such as cheese.</p> <p>In an October 1955 issue of a US industry magazine called Potato Chipper, \u201cBar-B-Q\u201d flavouring was described as \u201cthe most sensational new development in the industry\u201d. The excitement around the new possibilities was palpable. In a later issue, an X-ray nurse from Cincinnati was crowned \u201cMiss Potato Chip of 1956\u201d (\u201cShe is five feet eight inches, blonde, and weighs 125 pounds,\u201d declared the magazine). Pete Cardy, a 63-year-old from Hertfordshire, recalls visiting the Ideal Home Exhibition at Olympia in London as a child in the 60s and seeing a vendor selling smoky bacon crisps. \u201cIt really blew my mind,\u201d he says of sampling the snack. \u201cIt was: \u2018Wow,\u2019 it was just so exotic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b26097fbd70944aead4a728b66f097cfd0957106\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b26097fbd70944aead4a728b66f097cfd0957106/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Left: Tayto's Joe \u2018Spud\u2019 Murphy (second left) launched the first flavoured crisps in the late 50s.

When I contact Walkers to ask for a rough timeline of when its flavours were released, I am sent a document with \u201c????\u201d written between the 70s and the 00s. Amateur archivists paint a fuller picture. Wayne Tomlinson, a 51-year-old from Doncaster who has collected more than 8,000 crisp packets since the 80s, stores them, neatly pressed, in cardboard boxes around his home.

Berenstein concurs: \u201cIn contrast, something like yoghurt or a beverage can be challenging to flavour because you have to design flavours that go along with the acid and the dairy.\u201d</p> <p>You could argue, then, that crisp flavours have gone from being inspired by lunch to being inspired by dinner, while at the same time our dinner options have expanded exponentially. \u201cWe know 36% of young people want to explore new flavours all or most of the time, and 51% of snackers are always on the lookout to try new snacks,\u201d says Lexie Mackintosh, a Sainsbury\u2019s product developer. \u201cIt\u2019s that sort of customer insight that\u2019s driving our push to develop new flavours.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to creating those flavours, things get a little trickier. Matt Cullingworth, a research and development director at PepsiCo who runs sensory panels for brands such as Walkers, says Christmas pudding flavour was \u201cexceptionally challenging\u201d to make. \u201cThink about how many ingredients there are in a dish \u2013 and the complexity of flavour in individual ingredients.

      "bodyText": "When she was a little girl in Essex in the 50s, Linda Miller would go over to her neighbour Barbara\u2019s house every Friday night and together they would sit on the front step eating crisps. There was only one flavour widely available back then \u2013 Smith\u2019s plain potato crisps, which came with a small blue sachet of salt that could be sprinkled over them. One Friday night, the two friends struck upon an idea. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d invented a new crisp,\u201d says 68-year-old Miller. Inspired by their weekly fish and chip takeaway, the pair \u201csaturated\u201d their plain crisps with a bottle of vinegar. \u201cIt was lovely, lovely \u2013 very tasty,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWhen salt and vinegar crisps came out, I remember thinking: \u2018They\u2019re not as good as what we do.\u2019\u201d Crisps were first mass-produced in the early 20th century, but the first flavoured crisp was released only in the late 50s, after Joe \u201cSpud\u201d Murphy, the owner of the Irish company Tayto, developed a technique to add cheese and onion seasoning during production. Salt and vinegar crisps were launched throughout the UK a decade later, in 1967, when Miller was 16. In her lifetime, a transformation has taken place on supermarket shelves. Should you want to, you can now buy not only bacon, chicken, chilli and pickled onion crisps, but truffle, pink peppercorn gin, baked camembert, masala chicken, brie, Aberdeen Angus beef, salted caramel, katsu curry and sriracha. (To this day, Miller prefers to vinegar her own crisps.) How is it possible that, in 60 years, British shops have gone from selling one crisp flavour to selling hundreds \u2013 and why are seasonings becoming more unusual? What led Kettle Chips to release a \u201ctruffled cheese and a splash of English sparkling wine\u201d flavour in October? Was there a mad scientific breakthrough that caused Walkers to release bratwurst, paella, haggis and spaghetti bolognese crisps in 2010? In the beginning, says the food historian Nadia Berenstein, industry experts thought of crisps as potatoes. What this means, she explains, is that early seasonings mimicked the flavours that would accompany traditional potato dishes \u2013 salt and vinegar, cheese and onion, and barbecue sauce in the US. Although synthetic chemical compounds for flavouring were developed in the middle of the 19th century, Berenstein says the industry exploded after the second world war with the invention of a device called the gas chromatograph, or GC. \u201cThe GC was a really powerful tool for identifying the volatile compounds that are present in and contribute to flavours,\u201d Berenstein says. \u201cJust being able to figure out, isolate and identify these things prior to the GC took a long time. To study the flavour chemistry of apples, you\u2019d have to start with a literal tonne of apples and then process those down to a concentrate of a couple of milligrams.\u201d For the first time, gas chromatography allowed food scientists to quickly understand the chemical compounds behind complex flavours such as cheese. In an October 1955 issue of a US industry magazine called Potato Chipper, \u201cBar-B-Q\u201d flavouring was described as \u201cthe most sensational new development in the industry\u201d. The excitement around the new possibilities was palpable. In a later issue, an X-ray nurse from Cincinnati was crowned \u201cMiss Potato Chip of 1956\u201d (\u201cShe is five feet eight inches, blonde, and weighs 125 pounds,\u201d declared the magazine). Pete Cardy, a 63-year-old from Hertfordshire, recalls visiting the Ideal Home Exhibition at Olympia in London as a child in the 60s and seeing a vendor selling smoky bacon crisps. \u201cIt really blew my mind,\u201d he says of sampling the snack. \u201cIt was: \u2018Wow,\u2019 it was just so exotic.\u201d Crisp history is remarkably spotty: debate rages about which company invented which flavour. When I contact Walkers to ask for a rough timeline of when its flavours were released, I am sent a document with \u201c????\u201d written between the 70s and the 00s. Amateur archivists paint a fuller picture. Wayne Tomlinson, a 51-year-old from Doncaster who has collected more than 8,000 crisp packets since the 80s, stores them, neatly pressed, in cardboard boxes around his home. He also has four boxes of new, unopened flavours waiting to be tried. Over Christmas, he tasted and reviewed a new packet every day, including lobster cocktail, ham with spiced cola and even roast potato flavour. \u201cA big 80s flavour was spring onion,\u201d says Tomlinson. \u201cNow virtually no brands do it.\u201d Tomlinson \u2013 who helps run the 972-follower Facebook page Crazy Bout Crisps and is on the Seabrook Crisps taste-test panel \u2013 says the 80s were \u201cexperimental\u201d; he started collecting crisp packets after enjoying unusual limited-edition flavours such as Smith\u2019s gammon and pineapple. He reminisces fondly about unusual early flavours such as Tudor\u2019s limited-edition chocolate (he posted the flattened purple and brown foil packet to the Facebook page) and Smith\u2019s novelty run of hedgehog flavour, although he shudders at the memory of Seabrook\u2019s sweetcorn. As a teenager, he was allowed a packet of KP cheese and onion crisps for supper at exactly 8.30pm. \u201cEvery night, we would eagerly await it.\u201d Tomlinson points to the amalgamation of crisp companies as a reason for the decline in unusual flavours after the 80s (Smith\u2019s, for example, was bought in the 90s by PepsiCo, which owns Walkers; its Bovril flavour didn\u2019t make the cut). From there, crisp flavours became fairly standardised. Sarah Lawson, the marketing manager for the British brand Tyrrells, says 70% to 80% of its sales come from four flavours: lightly salted, salt and vinegar, cheddar and chive, and sweet chilli. But the market changed again, Berenstein says, roughly a decade ago. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s been any kind of technological breakthrough that has allowed for these things that were previously only dreamed of,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a new understanding of consumer desires and a new pace of production.

For Walkers, novelty arrived in 2009 in the form of its \u201cDo us a flavour\u201d competition, which asked the public to come up with seasoning ideas. The winners \u2013 among them chilli and chocolate, cajun squirrel and builder\u2019s breakfast \u2013 led the way for the brand\u2019s 2010 World Cup range, including yorkshire pudding, bratwurst, garlic bread, salsa, paella and haggis flavours. Tassy Goodall, a chef who works with Sainsbury\u2019s to develop its Taste the Difference crisps, says that the UK crisp market has been influenced by global food trends. \u201cBecause the UK is so multicultural and we\u2019re quite well connected with different cultures through restaurants specialising in different cuisines like Middle Eastern food and regional Indian dishes, it gives us more leeway to use more unusual or interesting flavours.\u201d In the past few years, a number of studies have found that Britons and Americans are increasingly replacing their meals with snacks, with a 2018 survey by Listerine reporting that one-third of Britons eat only one meal a day.

      "body": "<p>Katlyn Carter got her first cam girl job in 2014 after responding to an ad posted on Craigslist by a fetish modeling studio in Van Nuys, California. Carter and her partner, Kayden, were struggling to make ends meet despite working full-time office jobs, and she was intrigued by the potential for financial security.</p> <p>From a nondescript office building in a studio with about five rooms, Carter and other models broadcast live sex shows for online audiences. Fans paid them in virtual tokens (online currency that cam sites use to get around financial institution regulations regarding the purchase of adult content) to strip, masturbate and chat in real time, with the option for a private show away from other viewers at a higher price.</p> <p>\u201cThe set-up was, essentially, showing up for 12-hour shifts, during which I had to be ready and on camera the whole time,\u201d says Carter, who is now 27. Studio managers monitored her broadcasts from down the hall and gave her feedback through an online messaging service. In exchange for a built-in audience and workspace, the studio took a 40% cut of her revenue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/08/my-life-in-sex-woman-who-grew-up-in-porn-industry\">My life in sex: the woman who grew up in the porn industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On most cam sites models use to stream from home, performers can choose to accept or turn down audience requests at their own discretion, and set their own rates for private shows or fetish requests such as foot worship, role-play or penis humiliation. They can also block viewers who are rude or overly demanding from their chat rooms. But at the studio, management wanted Carter to accept any and all requests from viewers, including vomiting and urination. Carter says she got in trouble for turning down these requests, and on multiple occasions.</p> <p>The demanding viewers, pressure from management and grueling hours took a toll, and Carter left the studio after only two months.</p> <p>About 20 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, in southern California\u2019s \u201cPorn Valley\u201d, webcamming has become a popular form of adult entertainment. Big-name traditional porn studios struggle to compete not only with the rise of free porn, but with the rise of the amateur porn star. Streaming sites such as MyFreeCams, Camsoda and Chaturbate allow models to stream live sex shows from their own bedrooms and interact with their viewers in chatroom communities, offering fans an intimate connection with performers playing the role of both porn star and virtual girlfriend.</p> <p>Webcam studios and streaming sites are capitalizing on the trend. But the payout for the cam girl isn\u2019t always as lucrative. Since major credit card companies don\u2019t process payments from adult entertainment sites, cam sites rely on third-party platforms that often charge <a href=\"https://medium.com/spankchain/behind-the-scenes-the-economics-of-cam-sites-aa6af8b40599\">5-10% of the model\u2019s revenue</a>. Also, cam sites that allow viewers to tip performers typically require a 65-75% cut of the model\u2019s earnings, sometimes on top of other processing fees.</p> <p>Strains on the performers\u2019 end doesn\u2019t seem to impact viewers \u2013 they\u2019re still getting exactly what they want. \u201cCamming is growing because it\u2019s live,\u201d says Rickey Ray, assistant manager of <a href=\"https://www.studio20.live/\">Studio 20</a>, a 24/7 webcam studio franchise with 20 locations worldwide including Los Angeles. \u201cYou\u2019re typing and she\u2019s responding to you directly. There\u2019s a real-life relationship with that person that you\u2019re not going to get from someone watching a video.\u201d</p> <p>Studio 20 cam girls are contracted to work eight hours a day, five days a week. In exchange, they can use high-end streaming equipment, get tips from professionals on hair and makeup styling, and specialized courses to help models \u201cevolve personally and professionally\u201d, according to Ray. While smaller webcam studios like the one Carter left can be found across southern California \u2013 often hidden inside nondescript office buildings and advertised discreetly on Craigslist \u2013 Studio 20\u2019s high-end appeal makes it unique in Los Angeles.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of these other agencies are not so much focused on the branding of the models that we have here,\u201d Ray says. \u201cI think we\u2019re the only glamour studio. There may be other cam studios in the area, but they\u2019re not at the level of allowing a full 360 package that we have.\u201d Ray declined to share exact figures, but the Studio 20 website states their models can earn between $1,000 and $10,000 a month, depending on their \u201ceffort and involvement\u201d in the job.</p> <p>The website also states that \u201cbecoming a cam girl can make all your dreams come true\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to buy anything you want, you\u2019ll gain confidence in yourself, you will feel sexy and you can seduce any man you desire\u201d. According to Ray, this isn\u2019t entirely untrue. For models working at Studio 20 locations in Romania and Columbia, Ray says, webcam modeling can offer a path toward financial independence. \u201cThat happens for quite a bit of models that work here, and a lot more so internationally.\u201d</p> <p>Even with the \u201cfull 360 package\u201d, however, the job itself can be far from glamorous, and the emotional demands of working as a cam model are much broader than sex.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Webcam performers have to establish connections with clients and grow a fanbase, and tap into clients\u2019 fantasies all while protecting their own boundaries</p> <footer> <cite>Heather Berg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWebcam performers have to establish connections with clients and grow a fanbase, and tap into clients\u2019 fantasies all while protecting their own boundaries,\u201d says Heather Berg, professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at Washington University in St Louis. \u201cMany clients want an interaction that feels authentic to them and seek out performers who seem not to be obviously money-motivated, so performers do a lot of work to make sure they\u2019re getting paid without disrupting the illusion of an unmediated connection. In addition, clients are often quite lonely.\u201d</p> <p>Isa Mazzei, who writes about her experience as a cam model in her 2019 memoir Camgirl, developed one-on-one relationships with many of the fans she entertained from her home nightly on MyFreeCams. \u201cIt becomes kind of this communal thing where you\u2019re just very regularly involved in someone\u2019s life, and they\u2019re really regularly involved in yours. Often I would work the whole night, so that\u2019s like five, six days a week that I\u2019m spending with a lot of the same people,\u201d Mazzei, 28, tells me over coffee in Los Angeles.</p> <p>For Mazzei, the close relationships she built with her fans were one of the more rewarding aspects of the job, and she often embraced her role as a virtual confidant. \u201cI think a lot of of my viewers really needed an outlet where they can be emotionally vulnerable. A lot of them had partners that they weren\u2019t comfortable being vulnerable to, a lot of them had kinks, or fetishes, or insecurities about their bodies that they felt like they couldn\u2019t share with their partners. I was a safe person to share that with,\u201d she tells me.</p> <p>However, Mazzei also recalls the hours she spent playing referee during spats between fans, soothing jealous admirers and struggling to maintain professional boundaries with viewers who demanded access to her personal information. \u201cI had viewers who would say, \u2018I need to know your real name, I need to know real facts about your life. I want to feel like I\u2019m getting more access to your life than everyone else,\u2019\u201d she says. She stopped camming in 2016 after a year and a half, and went on to write the screenplay for the 2018 Netflix horror movie Cam. She now works as a writer for TV.</p> <p>Carter says similar demands from her viewers started negatively affecting her mental and emotional health. \u201cCamming was taking all of my emotional and physical energy, and eventually put a strain on all of my relationships,\u201d Carter says. She felt isolated, and struggled to cope with the exhausting emotional work and harassment that came with the job, as well as the constant body shaming that often bordered on abuse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Camming was taking all of my emotional and physical energy, and eventually put a strain on all of my relationships</p> <footer> <cite>Katlyn Carter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA lot of viewers do not grasp that at any given time there are hundreds to thousands of other viewers,\u201d Carter says. \u201cSure, most of them are saying crap like \u2018show bobs bb\u2019, but they still require emotional energy.\u201d Carter developed an eating disorder, and without outside support, her alcohol dependency relapsed.</p> <p>For two years after she left the studio, Carter worked for a website that took a 70% cut of her pay, and when constant glitches and bugs on the site started affecting her income, she left it for good. Carter is now in recovery and no longer camming. She believes that recent conversations about <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adult-film-performers-say-the-state-of-mental-health-in-the-industry-needs-more-attention/\">mental health in the adult industry</a> do make a positive difference for performers struggling with stress on the job.</p> <p>However, as Berg explains, the way many cam streaming sites set up payment structures can intensify the emotional demands of the job, leaving cam performers particularly vulnerable. \u201cCompanies typically treat performers as independent contractors, so there are no guarantees, and one could work for hours and make very little,\u201d Berg says. \u201cLike customers in non-sex industries, clients come with ideas about how much a given worker\u2019s labor is worth, and cam performers of color, who are gender queer, fat or disabled have to navigate some clients\u2019 perceptions that their labor is worth less.\u201d</p> <p>While corporate cam studios like Studio 20 and big-name streaming sites are creating space in porn to recognize cam performers\u2019 work, such as new categories for cam performers at the biggest awards ceremonies in the industry including the PornHub awards, Carter believes there\u2019s much more that can be done. For Carter, that means less involvement and interference from studios and legislation looking to regulate or co-opt sex workers\u2019 labor and agency. \u201cThere is not a superior form of sex work, and I feel like that\u2019s important to note,\u201d Carter says, \u201cbut for me, the best option is the one without corporations telling me what I can and cannot do.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Katlyn Carter got her first cam girl job in 2014 after responding to an ad posted on Craigslist by a fetish modeling studio in Van Nuys, California. Carter and her partner, Kayden, were struggling to make ends meet despite working full-time office jobs, and she was intrigued by the potential for financial security. From a nondescript office building in a studio with about five rooms, Carter and other models broadcast live sex shows for online audiences. Fans paid them in virtual tokens (online currency that cam sites use to get around financial institution regulations regarding the purchase of adult content) to strip, masturbate and chat in real time, with the option for a private show away from other viewers at a higher price. \u201cThe set-up was, essentially, showing up for 12-hour shifts, during which I had to be ready and on camera the whole time,\u201d says Carter, who is now 27. Studio managers monitored her broadcasts from down the hall and gave her feedback through an online messaging service. In exchange for a built-in audience and workspace, the studio took a 40% cut of her revenue. On most cam sites models use to stream from home, performers can choose to accept or turn down audience requests at their own discretion, and set their own rates for private shows or fetish requests such as foot worship, role-play or penis humiliation. They can also block viewers who are rude or overly demanding from their chat rooms. But at the studio, management wanted Carter to accept any and all requests from viewers, including vomiting and urination. Carter says she got in trouble for turning down these requests, and on multiple occasions. The demanding viewers, pressure from management and grueling hours took a toll, and Carter left the studio after only two months. About 20 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, in southern California\u2019s \u201cPorn Valley\u201d, webcamming has become a popular form of adult entertainment. Big-name traditional porn studios struggle to compete not only with the rise of free porn, but with the rise of the amateur porn star. Streaming sites such as MyFreeCams, Camsoda and Chaturbate allow models to stream live sex shows from their own bedrooms and interact with their viewers in chatroom communities, offering fans an intimate connection with performers playing the role of both porn star and virtual girlfriend. Webcam studios and streaming sites are capitalizing on the trend. But the payout for the cam girl isn\u2019t always as lucrative. Since major credit card companies don\u2019t process payments from adult entertainment sites, cam sites rely on third-party platforms that often charge 5-10% of the model\u2019s revenue. Also, cam sites that allow viewers to tip performers typically require a 65-75% cut of the model\u2019s earnings, sometimes on top of other processing fees. Strains on the performers\u2019 end doesn\u2019t seem to impact viewers \u2013 they\u2019re still getting exactly what they want. \u201cCamming is growing because it\u2019s live,\u201d says Rickey Ray, assistant manager of Studio 20, a 24/7 webcam studio franchise with 20 locations worldwide including Los Angeles. \u201cYou\u2019re typing and she\u2019s responding to you directly. There\u2019s a real-life relationship with that person that you\u2019re not going to get from someone watching a video.\u201d Studio 20 cam girls are contracted to work eight hours a day, five days a week. In exchange, they can use high-end streaming equipment, get tips from professionals on hair and makeup styling, and specialized courses to help models \u201cevolve personally and professionally\u201d, according to Ray. While smaller webcam studios like the one Carter left can be found across southern California \u2013 often hidden inside nondescript office buildings and advertised discreetly on Craigslist \u2013 Studio 20\u2019s high-end appeal makes it unique in Los Angeles. \u201cA lot of these other agencies are not so much focused on the branding of the models that we have here,\u201d Ray says. \u201cI think we\u2019re the only glamour studio. There may be other cam studios in the area, but they\u2019re not at the level of allowing a full 360 package that we have.\u201d Ray declined to share exact figures, but the Studio 20 website states their models can earn between $1,000 and $10,000 a month, depending on their \u201ceffort and involvement\u201d in the job. The website also states that \u201cbecoming a cam girl can make all your dreams come true\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to buy anything you want, you\u2019ll gain confidence in yourself, you will feel sexy and you can seduce any man you desire\u201d. According to Ray, this isn\u2019t entirely untrue. For models working at Studio 20 locations in Romania and Columbia, Ray says, webcam modeling can offer a path toward financial independence. \u201cThat happens for quite a bit of models that work here, and a lot more so internationally.\u201d Even with the \u201cfull 360 package\u201d, however, the job itself can be far from glamorous, and the emotional demands of working as a cam model are much broader than sex. \u201cWebcam performers have to establish connections with clients and grow a fanbase, and tap into clients\u2019 fantasies all while protecting their own boundaries,\u201d says Heather Berg, professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at Washington University in St Louis. \u201cMany clients want an interaction that feels authentic to them and seek out performers who seem not to be obviously money-motivated, so performers do a lot of work to make sure they\u2019re getting paid without disrupting the illusion of an unmediated connection. In addition, clients are often quite lonely.\u201d Isa Mazzei, who writes about her experience as a cam model in her 2019 memoir Camgirl, developed one-on-one relationships with many of the fans she entertained from her home nightly on MyFreeCams. \u201cIt becomes kind of this communal thing where you\u2019re just very regularly involved in someone\u2019s life, and they\u2019re really regularly involved in yours. Often I would work the whole night, so that\u2019s like five, six days a week that I\u2019m spending with a lot of the same people,\u201d Mazzei, 28, tells me over coffee in Los Angeles. For Mazzei, the close relationships she built with her fans were one of the more rewarding aspects of the job, and she often embraced her role as a virtual confidant. \u201cI think a lot of of my viewers really needed an outlet where they can be emotionally vulnerable. A lot of them had partners that they weren\u2019t comfortable being vulnerable to, a lot of them had kinks, or fetishes, or insecurities about their bodies that they felt like they couldn\u2019t share with their partners. I was a safe person to share that with,\u201d she tells me. However, Mazzei also recalls the hours she spent playing referee during spats between fans, soothing jealous admirers and struggling to maintain professional boundaries with viewers who demanded access to her personal information. \u201cI had viewers who would say, \u2018I need to know your real name, I need to know real facts about your life. I want to feel like I\u2019m getting more access to your life than everyone else,\u2019\u201d she says. She stopped camming in 2016 after a year and a half, and went on to write the screenplay for the 2018 Netflix horror movie Cam. She now works as a writer for TV. Carter says similar demands from her viewers started negatively affecting her mental and emotional health. \u201cCamming was taking all of my emotional and physical energy, and eventually put a strain on all of my relationships,\u201d Carter says. She felt isolated, and struggled to cope with the exhausting emotional work and harassment that came with the job, as well as the constant body shaming that often bordered on abuse. \u201cA lot of viewers do not grasp that at any given time there are hundreds to thousands of other viewers,\u201d Carter says. \u201cSure, most of them are saying crap like \u2018show bobs bb\u2019, but they still require emotional energy.\u201d Carter developed an eating disorder, and without outside support, her alcohol dependency relapsed. For two years after she left the studio, Carter worked for a website that took a 70% cut of her pay, and when constant glitches and bugs on the site started affecting her income, she left it for good. Carter is now in recovery and no longer camming. She believes that recent conversations about mental health in the adult industry do make a positive difference for performers struggling with stress on the job. However, as Berg explains, the way many cam streaming sites set up payment structures can intensify the emotional demands of the job, leaving cam performers particularly vulnerable. \u201cCompanies typically treat performers as independent contractors, so there are no guarantees, and one could work for hours and make very little,\u201d Berg says. \u201cLike customers in non-sex industries, clients come with ideas about how much a given worker\u2019s labor is worth, and cam performers of color, who are gender queer, fat or disabled have to navigate some clients\u2019 perceptions that their labor is worth less.\u201d While corporate cam studios like Studio 20 and big-name streaming sites are creating space in porn to recognize cam performers\u2019 work, such as new categories for cam performers at the biggest awards ceremonies in the industry including the PornHub awards, Carter believes there\u2019s much more that can be done. For Carter, that means less involvement and interference from studios and legislation looking to regulate or co-opt sex workers\u2019 labor and agency. \u201cThere is not a superior form of sex work, and I feel like that\u2019s important to note,\u201d Carter says, \u201cbut for me, the best option is the one without corporations telling me what I can and cannot do.\u201d",

Tsai\u2019s landslide electoral victory on Saturday has been embarrassing for China, where state media spent most of the past year isolating Taiwan on the diplomatic stage, deriding Tsai and highlighting the popularity of her opponent, Han Kuo-yu, of the pro-China Kuomintang party. Her win, after a campaign that leaned heavily on Hong Kong as a cautionary tale for Taiwan, is widely seen as a repudiation of Beijing\u2019s attempts to draw Taiwan into its fold through military intimidation, economic incentives, cultural exchanges and other means. Beijing views Taiwan, a functionally independent country, as part of its territory. Beijing has sought to downplay the election results which also saw the ruling Democratic Progressive party maintain its majority in the legislature, giving Tsai\u2019s administration a stronger mandate over the next four years. In an editorial on Sunday, Xinhua said Tsai\u2019s party had used \u201cdirty tactics\u201d, including fake news, repression and intimidation. Mainland commentators said Tsai had \u201cwon by fear\u201d while the Global Times blamed infighting within Han\u2019s Kuomintang party. \u201cYet no matter how much uncertainty there is across the straits, the fact that the Chinese mainland is getting increasingly stronger and the Taiwan island is getting weaker is an inevitable reality,\u201d an editorial late on Saturday said. Following the election, Chinese social media was flooded with comments from internet users calling for unification by force. But experts say Beijing prizes stability and would likely remain cool-headed in its approach to Taiwan. \u201cThe ultimate goal for China government is to keep its power. Stability in the mainland is always much more important than the unification,\u201d said Austin Wang, assistant professor of Political Science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas who focuses on East Asia. \u201cIf China\u2019s economy is good, it may harden its hardline policy and may raise more conflict against Taiwan,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if China\u2019s economy goes down, it may need Taiwan\u2019s help\u2026 In such a scenario, China may be willing to engage with Taiwan.\u201d This week, Chinese authorities have tried to highlight the potential of economic links. On Tuesday the international version of the People\u2019s Daily, the mouthpiece of the party, criticised the DPP for focusing on politics rather than Taiwan\u2019s struggling economy, a common argument made by Beijing and pro-China groups in Taiwan that closer ties would help stagnant wage and job growth. \u201cThe people of Taiwan must tighten their belts and continue to live a hard life,\u201d the paper said. State media have also accused \u201cexternal dark forces\u201d, such as the US, an ally of Taiwan\u2019s, of having a hand in the election. Experts say China is likely to double down on its strategy of punishing Taiwan. During Tsai\u2019s first term, Beijing cut off a dialogue mechanism, independent travel to Taiwan, and persuaded several of Taiwan\u2019s few remaining allies to switch diplomatic recognition. In her victory speech on Saturday, Tsai she was committed to maintaining peaceful cross-strait relations but said it was a responsibility to be borne by \u201cboth sides\u201d. \u201cChina must abandon threats of force against Taiwan,\u201d she said. \u201c \u2026 Democratic Taiwan and our democratically elected government will not concede to threats and intimidation.\u201d",

Scott Morrison and the agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, announced the extension of category D funding for \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d on Tuesday, before a small business roundtable at which the business community is expected to push for a similar deal forthose indirectly affected by the national crisis. The prime minister told reporters in Canberra the package would come from the $2bn of disaster relief funding already announced, although it will be demand-driven and not capped at $100m. The grants available to 19,000 farmers, fishers and foresters in fire-affected areas match the federal package in response to the north Queensland floods, and will be administered by the states, which will make fast-tracked assessments of eligibility. Morrison said funding could be spent on anything from rebuilding sheds to repairing fences, replacing equipment including solar panels and disposing of livestock. The package includes an extra $15m for 60 more rural financial counsellors. Tuesday\u2019s small business roundtable is the second of a series announced by Morrison. The first on Friday on health produced a $76m package for free counselling sessions, with further roundtables to follow on the environment, agriculture, tourism, education and the science of natural disasters and mitigation. Dugald Murray, the executive director of policy, trade and public affairs at the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told Guardian Australia the meeting would allow businesses to present evidence about the impact of bushfires and \u201cadvocate for the right levels of assistance\u201d. Murray said there had been \u201cconfusion\u201d because, while disaster relief funding for individuals, state and local government had been extended in both New South Wales and Victoria, funding for small businesses has been approved for NSW but not yet for Victoria. Category C funding is available for small businesses and primary producers where the impact of disaster is \u201csevere\u201d, after a request from the states and agreement from the prime minister. It is usually considered once the impacts of the disaster on affected communities have been assessed. NSW had approval for category C funding because fires have been burning in that state for longer and Murray said the federal government was \u201cactively focused\u201d on extending it to other states such as Victoria. Morrison confirmed that the national security committee of cabinet had considered a small business package, with an announcement to follow by the week\u2019s end. Murray said that, according to figures provided to the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry by the Victorian Tourism Industry Council, tourism businesses in the two Victorian bushfire zones had suffered 100% cancellation rates, while those outside the areas directly affected still suffered rates ranging from 10% to 60%. \u201cWe have assurances from both [state and federal] levels of government that they are working on an assistance package for business,\u201d he said. \u201cTourism is the canary in the coalmine in this situation \u2013 it\u2019s discretionary spending so that\u2019s what people tend to cancel first \u2013 but it flows through to other businesses and industries.\u201d The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia\u2019s chief executive, Peter Strong, said the government and the emergency management minister, David Littleproud, had been \u201cvery open\u201d to the needs of small business. \u201cWhat [small business groups are] concerned about is mental health \u2013 initially \u2013 what they\u2019re hearing is their members are concerned about their employees. \u201cThe next is cashflow; what do you do if you run a small supermarket with $60,000 of goods which all perished because the freezer has not been working without power? You need another $60,000 to restock.\u201d Strong said support was needed in areas with no bushfires but affected by disasters nearby, such as Braidwood, a town on the Kings Highway between Canberra and Batemans Bay. \u201cIt\u2019s a ghost town,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir sales at this time of year are dependent on that Canberra traffic and ordinarily they make a motza \u2013 the fires have had a big impact.\u201d More than 100,000 businesses have been indirectly affected by the fires, including self-employed contractors who don\u2019t employ others, Strong said. \u201cThe government has not put one barrier in the way of these issues \u2013 they\u2019ve been clear everything is on the table.\u201d Strong said the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia had also worked with Energy Australia, which had agreed to turn off automated payment demands to businesses in affected areas, and the Business Council of Australia, to speed up payments from big businesses to their small business suppliers. The tourism roundtable will be held on Friday. Tourism Australia has issued guidance to international tourists that although fires have impacted parts of Australia, \u201cmany parts \u2026 remain unaffected and are welcoming visitors\u201d and will consider inviting international journalists to demonstrate Australia that is still open for business. On Sunday Morrison revealed that he had been in \u201cdirect contact at senior levels of the US administration\u201d after the US advised travellers to consider postponing their travel to areas where air quality is significantly affected by bushfire conditions. On Tuesday he thanked the US for downgrading the advice to instead exercise increased caution. Similar efforts are occurring behind the scenes with other major sources of tourists to Australia, including Germany and the UK. Before the roundtable the small and family business minister Michaelia Cash said the government was \u201cready for ideas and proposals from stakeholders that will see these small businesses and the families that run them through the recovery and beyond\u201d. \u201cThese businesses are viable but vulnerable and we need to do everything we can to get them back on their feet.\u201d",

But authors of recent Australian ecofiction \u2013 books that explore connections between Australia\u2019s natural world, the human and the nonhuman \u2013 are shifting that traditional bushfire narrative, drawing connections between climate crisis and bushfire, and showing that what is occurring in Australia can no longer be considered \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/11/from-nick-caves-suit-to-iced-vovos-with-kevin-rudd-how-authors-for-fireys-is-funding-bushfire-relief\">From Nick Cave's suit to Iced Vovos with Kevin Rudd: how Authors for Fireys is funding bushfire relief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mireille Juchau\u2019s The World Without Us is one example, highlighting the connections between ecological disaster and human grief through its depiction of logging, mining and, significantly, a destructive fire in a rural community\u2019s past that alters the present lives of the novel\u2019s protagonists. In a New South Wales town surrounded by farms and mountains, this fire threatens human infrastructure as well as the surrounding rainforest. Towns just like this are among many that have been devastated by bushfire in recent weeks.</p> <p>And Juchau is not alone. Alice Bishop\u2019s short story collection, A Constant Hum, tells fictional stories of the Black Saturday bushfires. Eliza Henry-Jones\u2019s latest novel, Ache, is the story of a town and family recovering from the impacts of an intense bushfire. Alice Robinson\u2019s Anchor Point explores the life-altering consequences of both fire and flood.</p> <p>These stories are among many that are finding their place within the genres of ecofiction and climate fiction. They are often devastatingly real, introducing readers to narratives of climate crisis that highlight the threats posed to people and places by a failure to properly act on the issue. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Australian ecofiction provides readers with an alternative climate narrative to that pushed by our elected leaders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alexis Wright\u2019s The Swan Book addresses the strong ties between colonisation and climate catastrophe in its depiction of a near-future Australia irreversibly affected by climate change. The text speaks of \u201cfloating ashes that flickered with fire and dazzle-danced the sky in the full-throated blizzard of heat flying over the hills\u201d. As First Nations people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/for-first-nations-people-the-bushfires-bring-a-particular-grief-burning-what-makes-us-who-we-are\">mourn the loss of sacred places to fire</a>, Wright\u2019s work speaks volumes of what the climate crisis means for Indigenous peoples.</p> <p>In the confines of his government\u2019s misleading climate narrative, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has waxed lyrical about the nation\u2019s bushfire-prone past, telling Australians that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/01/no-better-place-to-raise-kids-scott-morrison-new-year-message-burning-australia\">we have faced these disasters before</a>\u201d. His approach conforms to an outdated stereotype of the Australian wilderness as an unforgiving, nightmarish hellscape, an archaic colonial perspective that positions nature as the ultimate threat. Claire Coleman\u2019s novel, Terra Nullius, is just one recent work that challenges this in interesting ways.</p> <p>Fiction allows readers to focus not only on the human plight but on that of the nonhuman. The World Without Us, The Swan Book, Catherine McKinnon\u2019s Storyland and Jennifer Mills\u2019s Dyschronia are just some examples of Australian ecofiction that emphasise the lives of animals, plants, and more in the context of the climate emergency, providing a lens that does not depict nature as an all-destructive adversary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/22/bushfires-shape-australias-landscape-but-the-trauma-burns-on-and-on\">Bushfires shape Australia\u2019s landscape \u2013 but the trauma burns on and on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is it possible that we are witnessing the emergence of a genre of climate fiction: bushfire fiction? </p> <p>Access to stories like these is important.

      "bodyText": "Fifteen years ago the renowned nature writer Robert Macfarlane lamented \u201cthe deficiency of a creative response\u201d to climate crisis. Novels, art, music, poetry and other cultural products were \u201curgently needed\u201d so that the crisis, its causes and its consequences could be \u201cdebated, sensed and communicated\u201d. In Australia ever since, even as our government repeatedly rejects the connections between human activity and increasingly catastrophic events in the natural world, artists have been heeding that call. Bushfires have always played a significant role in telling Australian stories. But authors of recent Australian ecofiction \u2013 books that explore connections between Australia\u2019s natural world, the human and the nonhuman \u2013 are shifting that traditional bushfire narrative, drawing connections between climate crisis and bushfire, and showing that what is occurring in Australia can no longer be considered \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d. Mireille Juchau\u2019s The World Without Us is one example, highlighting the connections between ecological disaster and human grief through its depiction of logging, mining and, significantly, a destructive fire in a rural community\u2019s past that alters the present lives of the novel\u2019s protagonists. In a New South Wales town surrounded by farms and mountains, this fire threatens human infrastructure as well as the surrounding rainforest. Towns just like this are among many that have been devastated by bushfire in recent weeks. And Juchau is not alone. Alice Bishop\u2019s short story collection, A Constant Hum, tells fictional stories of the Black Saturday bushfires. Eliza Henry-Jones\u2019s latest novel, Ache, is the story of a town and family recovering from the impacts of an intense bushfire. Alice Robinson\u2019s Anchor Point explores the life-altering consequences of both fire and flood. These stories are among many that are finding their place within the genres of ecofiction and climate fiction. They are often devastatingly real, introducing readers to narratives of climate crisis that highlight the threats posed to people and places by a failure to properly act on the issue. Alexis Wright\u2019s The Swan Book addresses the strong ties between colonisation and climate catastrophe in its depiction of a near-future Australia irreversibly affected by climate change. The text speaks of \u201cfloating ashes that flickered with fire and dazzle-danced the sky in the full-throated blizzard of heat flying over the hills\u201d. As First Nations people mourn the loss of sacred places to fire, Wright\u2019s work speaks volumes of what the climate crisis means for Indigenous peoples. In the confines of his government\u2019s misleading climate narrative, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has waxed lyrical about the nation\u2019s bushfire-prone past, telling Australians that \u201cwe have faced these disasters before\u201d. His approach conforms to an outdated stereotype of the Australian wilderness as an unforgiving, nightmarish hellscape, an archaic colonial perspective that positions nature as the ultimate threat. Claire Coleman\u2019s novel, Terra Nullius, is just one recent work that challenges this in interesting ways. Fiction allows readers to focus not only on the human plight but on that of the nonhuman. The World Without Us, The Swan Book, Catherine McKinnon\u2019s Storyland and Jennifer Mills\u2019s Dyschronia are just some examples of Australian ecofiction that emphasise the lives of animals, plants, and more in the context of the climate emergency, providing a lens that does not depict nature as an all-destructive adversary. Is it possible that we are witnessing the emergence of a genre of climate fiction: bushfire fiction? Access to stories like these is important. Without them we will find it harder to imagine different ways of responding to the crisis, harder to understand the connections between natural processes and our own actions, and more difficult to deeply engage with the reality of the climate emergency in this country and what it means for our lives. Reading Australian ecofiction \u2013 especially that of the bushfire kind \u2013 provides readers with an alternative climate narrative to that pushed by our elected leaders, a narrative that is more truthful, thoughtful and empathetic, and one that places the culpability for the crisis firmly at the feet of the people \u2013 yes, people \u2013 ultimately responsible. \u2022 Rachel Fetherston is a PhD candidate in literary studies at Deakin University",

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He cited the resumption of lethal military aid to Ukraine for defence against Russia-backed separatists, Trump\u2019s withdrawal from an arms control accord with Moscow and tests of a new US intermediate-range cruise missile.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/13/crisis-iran-opportunity-for-washington-donald-trump\">Crisis for Iran may present an opportunity for Washington</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pompeo also pointed to increased US naval exercises in the South China Sea in response to China\u2019s militarisation of disputed islands and Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports as aspects of the administration\u2019s deterrence strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re restoring credibility to deterrence,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>His comments came as the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said victims of an Iran-downed jetliner would still be alive if not for a recent escalation of tensions partly triggered by the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think if there were no tensions, if there was no escalation recently in the region, those Canadians would be right now home with their families,\u201d Trudeau said in an interview with Global television, according to a transcript.

      "bodyText": "Murdoch University has dropped plans to sue a lecturer who spoke out about student exploitation, in news welcomed by the whistleblower, his lawyers and the tertiary education union. Murdoch prompted outrage among academics, in Australia and globally, when it decided to sue the mathematics lecturer Gerd Schr\u00f6der-Turk for speaking to the ABC\u2019s Four Corners about the treatment of international students. Schr\u00f6der-Turk said the university was accepting students who were below its English standards, effectively exploiting them in pursuit of revenue and jeopardising academic integrity and student welfare. He later said Murdoch University had taken reprisal action against him by seeking to remove him from the university\u2019s senate. He challenged his treatment in the federal court and, in response, the university countersued him for damaging its reputation. The Perth university\u2019s actions prompted criticism in October from more than 50 of Australia\u2019s most distinguished professors, who said it posed a grave risk to academic freedom and set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d. Their warning followed a previous open letter from 23 academics across the globe protesting against Schr\u00f6der-Turk\u2019s treatment, sent in May. On Monday, Murdoch University said it was dropping the financial component of its counter-claim. Schr\u00f6der-Turk welcomed the news in a statement issued by his lawyers. \u201cThe counter-claim by the university has caused me and my young family a great deal of unnecessary stress,\u201d he said. \u201cI have always acted in the best interest of the university, its students and its staff, and have done so in very difficult circumstances.\u201d He said his concerns about student welfare remained. The National Tertiary Education Union said the university must now also drop the remainder of its lawsuit against the whistleblower and stop attempts to remove him from the university senate. Its general secretary, Matthew McGowan, said the university\u2019s tactics were designed to intimidate. \u201cIt was patently absurd to think that a university would sue a staff member for millions of dollars in damages,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cMurdoch has rightly received international condemnation for its action, and it\u2019s pleasing to see that the university is finally seeing some sense on this issue. \u201cBut we still fundamentally disagree with Murdoch management about what is the real essence of this matter. This is about academic freedom \u2013 the right of a staff member to speak openly about issues and concerns about their institution without fear or favour \u2013 and if Murdoch management cannot understand this then they shouldn\u2019t be running a university.\u201d Murdoch has denied suggestions the dispute was about academic freedom. In a statement to its staff, the university said it simply concerned \u201csenate governance\u201d and whether Schr\u00f6der-Turk breached his responsibilities as a senate member. \u201cThe university maintains that all members of senate must uphold their duties,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn doing so, there is a requirement as both a matter of law and a matter of principle that members of the senate must at all times act in the best interests of the university and not use their position to cause detriment to the university. \u201cThis is important for Murdoch University, as every university relies on sound governance to operate effectively.\u201d Schr\u00f6der-Turk is a member of the Australian Institute of Physics, which also spoke out about his treatment. \u201cThe AIP strongly defends the right of staff and students of academic institutions to respectfully question their organisations in order to pursue excellence and maintain high academic standards,\u201d it said in a statement in October.

There are now 294 days until the 2020 presidential election. An updated summary of the news from today: Russian military hackers targeted Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company at the center of Trump\u2019s impeachment, the New York Times reported. It\u2019s not clear what the Russian hackers were looking for, but they may have been seeking dirt on Hunter Biden and Joe Biden. Senior White House officials told CBS News that they believe four or more Republican senators, including Collins, Romney, Murkowski and Gardner may vote to call witnesses in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. The Department of Energy will release records of former secretary Rick Perry\u2019s communications with Ukrainian officials starting in late January. The U.S. A attorney general, William Barr, said that the December shooting at a Florida military base has been deemed an act of terrorism. CNN reported that a during a private meeting between Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders in 2018, Sanders said he didn\u2019t think a woman could win the 2020 presidential election. Sanders and his campaign manager said the claim was a lie, and Sanders\u2019 campaign manager said that if Warren herself weighed in, she would say that it was a lie. After a long day of silence, Warren put out a statement saying the report was true. A top member of the Sanders campaign denied that reported campaign talking points about Warren were meant to \u201ctrash\u201d her. Donald Trump mocked Senator Cory Booker\u2019s announcement that he is ending his presidential campaign. Warren confirms Sanders privately told her a woman could not win After a long day of silence from the Warren campaign, Elizabeth Warren has gone on the record with a statement confirming the report that Bernie Sanders told her in a private meeting that a woman could not win the White House in 2020. \u201cI thought a woman could win; he disagreed,\u201d Warren said in the statement. \u201cI have not interest in discussing this private meeting any further.\u201d Russian military hackers reportedly targeted Ukranian company at center of Trump\u2019s impeachment Russian hackers from a military intelligence unit targeted the Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, that is at the center of the Trump\u2019s impeachment, the New York Times reports, citing a Silicon Valley security firm that says it detected the hacking. \u201cThe timing and scale of the attacks suggest that the Russians could be searching for potentially embarrassing material on the Bidens \u2013 the same kind of information that Mr Trump wanted from Ukraine when he pressed for an investigation of the Bidens and Burisma, setting off a chain of events that led to his impeachment,\u201d the Times reports. Hunter Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s son, served on the board of Burisma when his father was Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president. At least four Republicans may vote to call witnesses in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, White House officials tell CBS News Senior White House officials told CBS News they believe that at least four Republicans, and perhaps more, may join Democrats in voting to call witnesses in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. The potential Republican votes for calling witnesses, per CBS News: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Susan Collins of Maine Mitt Romney of Utah Cory Gardner of Colorado, \u201cpossibly\u201d Possible additional votes: Rand Paul of Kentucky is seen as \u201cwild card\u201d Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is seen as an \u201cinstitutionalist\u201d Read the full story from CBS News, as well as this caution from a Washington Post reporter: Department of Energy will release Rick Perry\u2019s communications with Ukranian officials Save the date: Perry resigned as energy secretary last year amid questions about his involvement in the Ukraine scandal. Sanders campaign manager: \u2018It is a lie\u2019 Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign manager is calling the report that Sanders told Elizabeth Warren in 2018 that a woman couldn\u2019t win the 2020 presidential race \u201ca lie\u201d. He also said that Warren herself \u201cwould say that it is not true, that it is a lie\u201d. The CNN report, describing what happened during a private 2018 meeting between the two candidates, cites four sources: \u201ctwo people Warren spoke with directly soon after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting\u201d. In a previous statement, Sanders himself accused members of Warren\u2019s staff, who weren\u2019t present for the one-on-one conversation, of \u201clying about what happened\u201d. An update on US-China trade news: Senator Chuck Schumer on Monday blasted the Trump administration for what he described as its decision to \u201cback down\u201d from labeling China as a currency manipulator. Reuters reported. \u201cChina is a currency manipulator \u2013 that is a fact,\u201d Schumer said in a statement released by his office. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, on Monday reported the US treasury department would lift its designation of China as a currency manipulator in a semi-annual report due to be released soon. The United States and China are due to sign a phase one trade deal this week. Reporter presses Trump on claim about embassies being targeted Lois Beckett here in our west coast office, taking over live politics coverage for this evening. Donald Trump is headed to the College Football Playoff National Championship in New Orleans. As Trump boarded a plane to New Orleans, a journalist asked Trump about his previous claim to Fox News that Iran had \u201cprobably\u201d been planning to attack four embassies across the Middle East, and that this had informed his decision to approve the assassination of the top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Trump\u2019s defense secretary, Mark Esper, said yesterday that he had not seen specific evidence that was the case. \u201cMr President, what did the intelligence show about the threat to the four embassies?\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s been consistent: We killed Suleimani,\u201d the president responded. Alright, I\u2019m handing the reins over to Lois Beckett. Here\u2019s where things stand at this hour: The US attorney general, William Barr, said that the December shooting at a Florida military base has been deemed an act of terrorism. CNN reported that a during a private meeting between Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders in 2018, Sanders said he didn\u2019t think a woman could win the 2020 presidential election. A top member of the Sanders campaign denied that recently reported talking points about Warren were meant to \u201ctrash\u201d her. Donald Trump mocked Senator Cory Booker\u2019s announcement that he is ending his presidential campaign. Another national poll finds Biden leading Democratic primary field Joe Biden leads in another national poll of Democratic primary voters. The Quinnipiac University poll released Monday afternoon found Biden leading the field with 25% support followed by Senator Bernie Sanders with 19% support. Senator Elizabeth Warren came in next with 16% support followed by former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 8% support. The poll\u2019s findings underscore Biden\u2019s frontrunner status within the primary. Most polls have shown him leading the field in key states and nationally. The poll comes the same day a Monmouth poll of Iowa Democratic voters also found Biden leading the primary field. Sanders co-chair denies campaign talking points were to trash Warren The co-chair of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign denied that a set of talking points distributed by the campaign to volunteers was an effort to \u201ctrash\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren. Nina Turner, a former Ohio state legislator and the co-chair of the Sanders campaign, said in an interview with Hill.TV that the Sanders campaign \u201cwould never\u201d trash Warren or any other candidate. The comments on Monday come in response to increasing tension between the Sanders campaign and the Warren campaign over a set of talking points the Sanders campaign distributed to its volunteers that urged them to describe Warren\u2019s supporters as \u201chighly-educated, more affluent people\u201d and argue to voters that Warren could not expand the electorate. In response Warren said that Sanders was trying to \u201ctrash\u201d her campaign. Warren said she was disappointed with the Sanders campaign when asked about the talking points during a gaggle with reporters over the weekend. Turner though denied that was the intention. \u201cI was really sad to see that because as Senator Warren laid out that Senator Sanders knows her \u2014 she knows him,\u201d Turner said. \u201cShe knows that he would never do anything like that so when she says he sent out his volunteers, nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d Turner said. The back and forth between Sanders and Warren, who until the past few days avoided criticizing each other, comes just before the last Democratic primary debate before the Iowa caucuses. Pensacola shooting ruled an \u201can act of terrorism\u201d The Florida shooting last month by a Saudi Air Force officer that resulted in three dead Americans was ruled an act of terrorism, Attorney General William Barr said on Monday. In announcing that ruling on the Pensacola, Florida ruling Barr also said that 21 Saudi military trainees would be taken out of the United States in response to the investigation of the shooting, according to Reuters. Barr\u2019s announcement came at a news conference to discuss the findings of the investigation into the shooting. The investigation found that Royal Saudi Air Force Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani was driven by \u201cjihadist ideology\u201d and that pushed him to conduct the shooting. Alshamrani was fatally shot by a deputy sheriff during the shooting on Dec. 6. The investigation did not find any evidence of other Saudi trainees at the base having knowledge or helping Alshamrani. \u201cThis was an act of terrorism,\u201d Barr said at the press conference. \u201cThe evidence showed that the shooter was motivated by jihadist ideology. During the course of the investigation, we learned that the shooter posted a message on Sept. 11 of this year stating, \u2018The countdown has begun.\u2019\u201d During a private meeting at the end of 2018 between Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders the two liberals agreed not to attack each other in the upcoming presidential race. And in response to Warren explaining why she could be a formidable candidate, Sanders said he doubted a woman could be elected president, according to a new report in CNN. That recounting is based on the accounts of four people, according to CNN, \u201ctwo people Warren spoke with directly soon after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting.\u201d The report comes amid rising tensions between the Sanders campaign and the Warren campaign. Over the weekend Politico reported that the Sanders campaign had distributed talking points to supporters suggesting they describe Warren\u2019s supporters and elite and that the Massachusetts senator is incapable of expanding her party\u2019s voting base. In response, Warren said Sanders was trying to \u201ctrash\u201d her. At the 2018 meeting Warren said she disagreed with Sanders\u2019 assessment, according to three of the four people the CNN report cites. In a statement to CNN Sanders denied how the meeting was characterized. \u201cIt is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn\u2019t win,\u201d Sanders said in the statement. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren\u2019t in the room are lying about what happened. What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could. Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign, similarly, declined to comment. Trump teases Booker on dropping out Donald Trump knocked Senator Cory Booker in response to the New Jersey senator\u2019s decision to drop out of the 2020 Democratic primary on Monday. The tweet was a marked contrast to even Booker\u2019s rivals within the Democratic primary who praised the senator\u2019s bid for the presidency. Some former candidates also weighed in. A clip of Booker running into entrepreneur and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang also circulated online through Yang\u2019s traveling press secretary. Here\u2019s where things stand at this hour: The big news of the day so far is that Democratic 2020 candidate Cory Booker has essentially quit the race for president, after announcing he was suspending his campaign. Joe Biden has had a good result from some new polling Donald Trump is weighing in over healthcare with Michael Bloomberg, and escalating tension between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. We are watching for any and all developments regarding the Trump impeachment inquiry, as the House prepares some time this week to deliver the congressional charges against the president (aka the articles of impeachment) to the Senate. A new Monmouth University poll of Iowa voters finds former Vice President Joe Biden pulling away from the rest of the Democratic primary field. The poll, released Monday, found Biden leading the field with 24 percent support followed by Senator Bernie Sanders with 18 percent support. Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg got 17 percent support followed by Senator Elizabeth Warren with 15 percent and Senator Amy Klobuchar with 8 percent. The poll was conducted before Senator Cory Booker dropped out of the race on Monday. No other candidate was able to break double digits in the poll or even reach the high single digits. The poll\u2019s findings underscore Biden\u2019s frontrunner status even as other candidates have both surged and then lost support in early state polling in the primary. The poll comes just a few weeks before the Iowa caucus. Senator Bernie Sanders suggested during the 2020 presidential campaign that he might be willing to release a list of potential candidates he would appoint to the Supreme Court if elected president. In a wide ranging interview with The New York Times published on Monday the Vermont senator was asked if he would be willing to release a slate of potential names. Donald Trump released a list of possible candidates in 2016 which helped attract some conservative Republicans to Trump\u2019s campaign. When the Times editorial board asked if he would do something similar, Sanders responded \u201cmaybe\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cnot a bad idea.\u201d Here\u2019s what he said: Maybe. I mean, it\u2019s something, you know \u2014 it\u2019s the same thing, who\u2019s my vice president? Got to kind of win the nomination first. I\u2019m kind of struggling to do that. And I want to do that. But you know, it\u2019s not a bad idea. It\u2019s a reasonable idea. My wife agrees with you. Yeah. I\u2019ll take that into consideration. Nothing wrong with that. As to who I\u2019ll potential nominees for the Supreme Court would be. Yep. All right. So if you see that in The New York Times, you know where it came from. Donald Trump is having a busy day on Twitter, including going after the Democrats over their reaction to the assassination of Gen Qassem Suleimani. \u201cThe Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Suleimani was \u2018eminent\u2019 [sic \u2013 he means \u201cimminent\u201d] or not, &amp; was my team in agreement,\u201d the president wrote, in a tweet that was deleted and reissued, spelling fixed. He was referring in part to a sticky Sunday for his defense secretary, Mike Esper, and national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, as they were asked about the intelligence behind the strike, which was carried out without Congress being informed. \u201cThe answer to both is a strong YES,\u201d Trump continued, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t really matter because of his horrible past!\u201d He added: The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Suleimani into a wonderful guy, only because I did what should have been done for 20 years. Anything I do, whether it\u2019s the economy, military, or anything else, will be scorned by the Rafical [sic] Left, Do Nothing Democrats! It seems obvious to note that the Democrats have not made the Iranian general out to have been \u201ca wonderful guy\u201d, but they have hit the administration hard over the background to the strike and the crisis it stoked with Iran. Prior to his own tweets, Trump also re-tweeted a string of messages concerning the #NancyPelosiFakeNews hashtag, which has proliferated with video of the House Speaker discussing the Suleimani strike on ABC News on Sunday. On ABC, Pelosi discussed protests in Iran after Tehran admitted to shooting down an airliner, killing 176 people. She said some protests were against \u201cthe fact that that plane went down and many students were on the plane and were out on the street\u201d and also said there were anti-regime protests before Trump ordered the strike which killed Suleimani. Republican sources picked up on the phrase \u201cdifferent reasons why people are in the street\u201d and gleefully ran with it out of context. Not hugely presidentially, as ever, Trump also retweeted the following image of Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer: Here\u2019s our latest report on the protests in Iran: Senator Cory Booker announced Monday that he is suspending his presidential campaign. He sent the following email to supporters announcing the move: Friend, Nearly one year ago, I got in the race for president because I believed to my core that the answer to the common pain Americans are feeling right now, the answer to Donald Trump\u2019s hatred and division, is to reignite our spirit of common purpose to take on our biggest challenges and build a more just and fair country for everyone. I\u2019ve always believed that. I still believe that. I\u2019m proud I never compromised my faith in these principles during this campaign to score political points or tear down others. And maybe I\u2019m stubborn, but I\u2019ll never abandon my faith in what we can accomplish when we join together. I will carry this fight forward -- I just won\u2019t be doing it as a candidate for president this year. Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg shot back over Twitter at Donald Trump\u2019s jab at him on healthcare. The Justice Department in the Trump administration is currently party to a lawsuit seeking to overturn the preexisting conditions still in place as part of the Affordable Care Act. At times Trump has promised to keep and protect that aspect of the law while also, quixotically, vowing to completely gut Obamacare. Trump weighs in on escalating tensions between Warren and Sanders Donald Trump weighed in on the escalating tensions between senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on Monday. In the process he misspelled his nickname for Warren \u2013 Pocahontas. The tweet comes in the aftermath of a weekend in which Sanders and Warren began to take still-somewhat subtle jabs at each other. It started when Politico reported that the Sanders campaign is urging volunteers to describe Warren as the preferred candidate of elite Democratic voters. \u201cShe\u2019s bringing in no new bases to the Democratic Party,\u201d the talking points suggested. In response, Warren told reporters that she was disappointed that the Vermont senator was sending out supporters to \u201ctrash\u201d her campaign. Warren and Sanders, until now, had retained a pretty consistent detente with each other in the primary, refusing to openly attack each other. But now the gloves are coming off. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: As a party, and as a country, we can\u2019t afford to repeat the factionalism of the 2016 primary,\u201d Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a fundraising email to supporters. \u201cTo win in November, we need a nominee who can unite a broad coalition of Democrats \u2014 who will excite every part of the Democratic party and inspires more people to join the fight.\u201d Former vice-president Joe Biden rolled out a set of endorsements Monday underscoring two aspects of the Democratic primary Biden\u2019s campaign is focusing on in the final days before the Iowa caucuses. First, Biden\u2019s team announced that Representative Colin Allred had backed him. Allred is the tenth black member of Congress to back the former president. The endorsement underscores the support Biden enjoys among the black Democratic community. But Biden isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s been winning support among black lawmakers lately. Last week Representative Anthony Brown endorsed former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, one of Biden\u2019s chief rivals in the 2020 Democratic primary. Biden\u2019s campaign also announced on Monday that Iowa attorney general Tom Miller is now backing him. Miller was one of the few Democrats to support Montana Governor Steve Bullock before he dropped out of the Democratic primary. Miller is the latest in a string of Iowa endorsements that Biden\u2019s campaign has rolled out. He\u2019s been endorsed by Representative Abby Finkenauer, former agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack, and Cedar Rapids state Representative Kirsten Running-Marquardt. Such endorsements are coveted in the lead up to the Iowa caucuses. Donald Trump dinged former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg on Twitter calling the 2020 Democratic candidate \u201cMini Mike Bloomberg,\u201d and saying that he fought to keep the pre-existing conditions protections in Obamacare while also getting rid of the law\u2019s individual mandate. The justice department in the Trump administration is currently party to a lawsuit that would overturn the preexisting conditions protections. Trump, in the early days of his administration, tried to gut as much of the Affordable Care Act as he could. Bloomberg\u2019s presidential campaign has been airing an ad attacking Trump on healthcare. The narrator in the ad that says that as president \u201cMike will provide universal access to affordable healthcare.\u201d Watch the ad here: Hello live blog readers. This is my first time doing this so forgive me for being a novice. Let\u2019s start with the latest on impeachment. Less than a month ago it was clear Donald Trump preferred a showy TV-style impeachment trial. But on Sunday the president indicated a reversal. It\u2019s a bit of character for a president who loves being ostentatious and confrontational. The tweet comes just a few days before the likely beginning of the trial later in the week. On the Democratic side, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to meet with the Democratic caucus on Tuesday to discuss impeachment. Pelosi could introduce a resolution later that day. Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re watching as the day unfolds: The president is traveling to New Orleans tonight to watch the College football playoff national championship. A number of Democratic presidential candidates are in Iowa doing a few more campaign stops before tomorrow\u2019s debate at Drake University. John Delaney, Pete Buttigieg, and Joe Biden have events scheduled today and John Kerry and Jill Biden have events scheduled for Biden. Bruce Mann is doing an event for Elizabeth Warren. We\u2019re also alert to ongoing reports of a Bernie-Biden feud, of course. White House national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien told Axios that Trump has \u201creached out to the North Koreans\u201d in an effort to resume negotiations.",

There\u2019s some dizzying exposition in the opening scene of episode one, in which Nicholas answers questions about himself posed by a guy he has picking up in a bar (Alex, played by Adam Faison) between bouts of necking on. Later, Nicholas\u2019s father (Christopher May) utters the immortal line: \u201cI have a terrible cancer which I\u2019ll give you some more information about later, but this is the news that I need to tell you now.\u201d Cue sad music. \u201cPilots are the hardest thing in the world,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cThere\u2019s always a lot of premise, which isn\u2019t my favourite thing. My favourite thing is when you know the people and you get to hang out with them.\u201d The show certainly feels more like an American sitcom than the critically adored \u201chome-cooked pleasures\u201d of its predecessor. The humour is broader, the colours more vibrant, the high school tropes a little heavy-handed \u2013 but by the second episode the pace settles and the character quirks and meandering dialogue Thomas imbued Please Like Me with are allowed to take root. Please Like Me was imported at the tail-end of a time when it was more common for US networks to remake international shows. In fact, that was initially the plan of Pivot, the US cable channel that acquired the rights. \u201cThey wanted me to be in it, and the same director, and then they wanted other cast members to be in it, and then I was like, \u2018Guys, why don\u2019t we go with the show we already made?\u2019 And then they did that, thank goodness,\u201d Thomas says. Thank goodness indeed \u2013 because for every Office remake success story, there\u2019s a Kath &amp; Kim disaster prompting the the San Francisco Chronicle to opine that America owes Australia an apology. As it was, Pivot put Thomas\u2019s face on the side of buses in Los Angeles \u2013 and when Pivot ceased to be, streaming service Hulu quickly stepped in to take over the broadcast rights. The trailer for Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay depicts a funeral scene in which Nicholas\u2019s half-sister Matilda (Kayla Cromer) gives a eulogy. While there have been high-profile comedies led by characters on the autism spectrum \u2013 Netflix\u2019s Atypical being the most recent example, and Big Bang Theory the most contested one \u2013 Thomas believes this is the first time an actor on the spectrum has taken the role. \u201cHaving gone through the casting process of auditioning people who are neurotypical and people who have autism, there was only one choice,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cI went in thinking it was more ethical, and I came out of it thinking, \u2018This is just better.\u2019 Kayla gives the character so much more authenticity. \u201cThere are heaps of girls with autism who are really great actors. I spoke to a mum who said, \u2018My daughter\u2019s really good at acting because she had to learn how to mimic to survive and to study human behaviour to understand how neurotypicals work.\u2019 I found that really interesting.\u201d Thomas was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 28, and he thinks that has given him a small window into people who aren\u2019t neurotypical. \u201cI like people who are really direct and I like outsiders,\u201d he says. Cromer\u2019s character is outspokenly interested in sex, which flies against a stereotype that people with autism tend to be asexual and naive. \u201cI wanted to, like, make autism sexy,\u201d he laughs. \u201cPeople with autism get horny. Girls generally can get desexualised, and people with disabilities get desexualised. [But] she grew up in a progressive family and would have absorbed all that. Autism is a broad church.\u201d As with season four of Please Like Me, season one of Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay starts with a gay make-out scene, something he says has given his \u201cpoor mum\u201d cause for concern. \u201cShe saw the pilot and she was saying, \u2018Don\u2019t you think it might make people turn off?\u2019 I said, \u2018If they don\u2019t want to see gay people kissing then I don\u2019t want them watching my show.\u2019 Do you know what I mean? I don\u2019t want to hang out with homophobic people and I don\u2019t want my audience to be homophobic, so I\u2019m happy to put [those scenes] there. They hired me because I\u2019m gay. It\u2019s a plus for them.\u201d \u2022 Episode one and two of Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay premieres on 17 January on Stan in Australia, and Freeform in the US.",

Both north-west rivals could make up a shortfall of more than \u20ac100m because United have forecast a fall in revenues of up to \u00a385m next year as a result of the club\u2019s repeated failure to qualify for the Champions League. Sam Boor, senior manager in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said shifting sands in English football proved that football clubs could not afford to miss out on European competition. \u201cThe impact of participation and performance in Uefa club competitions on revenue is evident in London and the north-west, with the rise of Liverpool, Manchester City and Spurs driven by reaching the Champions League knockout stages. \u201cThe relative decline of Arsenal is a direct result of not participating in the competition for a second consecutive season, a fate that may also befall Manchester United.\u201d The importance of European football was underscored by the fact that TV broadcast revenues make up 44% of clubs\u2019 income on average. Transfer fees are not included in the calculations. The report also showed the potential benefits of sound financial strategy, with Barcelona overtaking Real Madrid thanks to a new operating model. Barcelona became he first club to report revenues of \u20ac800m, which Deloitte said was thanks to a decision to bring merchandising and licensing activities in-house, taking better control of its globally-recognised brand. The table also showed that football\u2019s ability to generate cash shows no sign of slowing down, with the top 20 clubs forecast to break the \u20ac10bn revenue barrier some time in the next few years.",
