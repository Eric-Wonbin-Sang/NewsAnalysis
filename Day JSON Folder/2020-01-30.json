      "bodyText": "The religious discrimination bill would harm patients\u2019 rights to access healthcare and allow religious hospitals to discriminate against doctors, the Australian Medical Association has warned. The AMA made the comments in a submission to the second round of consultation on the religious freedom bills, which closes on Friday. The second draft bill, released in early December, has addressed some conservative religious institutions\u2019 concerns by including an exemption that will enshrine their ability to discriminate against staff on the basis of religion in settings like hospitals and aged care. But the broad chorus of dissent against the bill from employers, LGBTI organisations, human rights groups and medical bodies shows little sign of abating. The AMA submitted that sections of the bill \u201cappear to override \u2026 the well-developed framework of professional standards of the medical profession\u201d and \u201ccreate a new confusing element with the potential for serious unintended consequences\u201d. The bill allows doctors, pharmacists and other limited categories of medical practitioners to \u201cconscientiously object to providing a health service\u201d, sparking concerns about provision of contraceptives and other services. The second draft made only minor changes to the provision, narrowing the range of medical practitioners who can conscientiously object and specifying that this does not give a right to medical practitioners to discriminate against individuals based on gender or other characteristics. The AMA noted the medical board\u2019s code of conduct stated doctors have \u201ca duty to make the care of patients their first concern\u201d. It submitted that the bill \u201cwould create a conflict between professional standards and commonwealth legislation where relevant sections of the code of conduct are simply displaced by the legislation, effectively undermining the role of the medical board and the ethical codes of the wider medical profession\u201d. The AMA gave practical examples of impacts including: harm when patients need \u201cspecific care at the time it is sought\u201d, for example abortion or post-exposure prophylaxis; logistical difficulties in seeking alternative care; mental health impacts and patients foregoing medical care for fear of judgment. The AMA warned the bill would \u201c[undermine] the rights of some doctors by enabling employers to discriminate against them based on religious belief\u201d. It noted a doctor could be refused employment, promotion or career development opportunities or have their employment terminated \u201cbecause they act on their clinical/vocational responsibility to provide a health service to a patient\u201d where their views clashed with those of the hospital or aged care facility. The bill would legalise all statements of religious belief, provided they are not malicious and do not harass people, even if they otherwise breach federal, state or territory discrimination laws. The AMA submitted the bill therefore \u201clawfully enables statements (asserted to be based on religious belief) to offend, humiliate, insult or intimidate groups such as women, LGBTIQ people or persons with disabilities\u201d. On Thursday Labor leader Anthony Albanese held a consultation on the bills with peak bodies including the Australian Industry Group, AMA, unions, human rights, women\u2019s and LGBTI groups. It follows a similar consultation with religious leaders in December. Albanese told the Labor caucus in November that \u201cwe support freedom of religion but we don\u2019t support increasing discrimination in other areas\u201d and the shadow health minister Chris Bowen has described the bill as \u201cfriendless\u201d \u2013 both strong signs the opposition is unlikely to support it. Anna Brown, the chief executive of Equality Australia, said it was \u201cvery pleasing\u201d Albanese had listened to the concerns of a \u201clarge and diverse group of stakeholders\u201d. Rodney Croome, a spokesman from Equality Tasmania, told Guardian Australia that while Albanese did not commit to oppose the bill he did \u201chear the best arguments against it from some of Australia\u2019s most influential advocates\u201d. \u201cIf, before the meeting, he held out any hope this bill is redeemable he won\u2019t any more,\u201d Croome said.",

All three teams independently developed their models based on the biological understanding of cervical cancer, and multiple data sources from multiple countries located in east Asia and Pacific, Europe and central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cOne of the exciting things for us about the new studies is the three teams did independent work but got very similar results,\u201d director of research at Cancer Council NSW and adjunct professor Karen Canfell said. While there has been some success in high-income countries like Australia, cervical cancer is still the fourth-most common cancer for women in the world, and the leading cause of cancer death in some low-income countries. A large majority of the 570,000 new cervical cancer cases worldwide in 2018 were in women living in low- and lower-middle income countries. The combination of vaccination of girls, along with twice-lifetime cervical cancer screening and access to invasive cervical cancer treatment was predicted to reduce cervical cancer incidence by 97% and mortality by almost 99%, averting more than 74 million cervical cancer cases and more than 62 million deaths in the next 100 years, she said.

The research will be considered by WHO\u2019s executive board next week, and by countries at the World Health Assembly in May. Australia has led the charge in preventing and treating cervical cancer, and last year Canfell said Australia was on track to eliminating cervical cancer by 2035, and this week, Public Health England also released a study showing that as of the end of 2018 \u2013 10 years since the vaccination program was introduced \u2013 there were no HPV infections detected in 16 to 18-year-old females.

      "bodyText": "A British family who had been trapped at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak is to fly out of China after a last-minute U-turn by the country\u2019s authorities. Previously, they had said that no one with a Chinese passport would be allowed to travel. However, on Thursday night, as the evacuation flight from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, was readying to depart, the Foreign Office confirmed that Britons would be allowed to bring their dependants onboard and dual nationals would also be allowed. Matt Raw, who has lived in Wuhan for the past year with his wife, Ying, and 75-year-old mother, Hazel, who suffers from dementia, were at the airport on Thursday night. The family had earlier been told that Ying, who has a UK visitor visa valid until July but a Chinese passport, was not allowed on the flight and the family had decided to stay put. However, Raw told the Guardian: \u201cWe have actually finally been given permission to fly. We are at the airport now and we\u2019re just getting ready to go through security. We\u2019ve obviously been able to get my mother and my wife has been told she can fly, she has a ticket, so fingers crossed we get through security and we return to England hopefully later on today.\u201d It was unclear how many other Britons with Chinese dependants or dual nationals were aware of the U-turn. A British father and daughter said earlier that they had also decided to stay in the country rather than leave behind their wife and mother, who has a Chinese passport. Previously the father, who does not want to be named, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just awful weighing up taking my daughter out and keeping her safe, but leaving my wife behind.\u201d The family also experienced problems getting hold of paperwork to enable them to pass through roadblocks that have been placed throughout Hubei province to limit movement. Earlier on Thursday night, 38-year-old Chris Hill said that he had refused to board the flight back to the UK because because the Foreign Office could not confirm whether his four-year-old daughter, a Chinese national, would be allowed to join him. Hill, from Sunderland, said his wife of 11 years could not travel as she was needed to work in a hospital in Wuhan, and he could not consider leaving his family. He said his daughter, Renee, had some understanding of events and had expressed that she didn\u2019t want her father to leave. \u201cShe knows that people are ill, and she knows not to spend time around many people, but I did ask her, if daddy had to go back home and you had to stay here would you want me to go, and she said no,\u201d he said. Hill has also criticised the planning of the flight, saying that he was given just seven minutes\u2019 notice to arrive at the airport. \u201cThere\u2019s no cars, there\u2019s no taxis, anything, and the FCO say, \u2018Oh we\u2019ll pick you up from Wuhan Tianhe airport but you have to make your own way there\u2019. That gives me a very bad taste in my mouth. It\u2019s just bad planning.\u201d He added that he was \u201closing faith\u201d in the government. It was unclear whether Hill was aware of the U-turn.",

No discussions have happened yet, but my position is clear. It is a pleasure to represent this club, I came here to win things and if they want me to stay then of course I\u2019ll give my best to try and win trophies. \u201cTo be honest the reality now, with this team, is that it will be hard to win the league.

And polls suggest the incumbent will be hard for Democrats to beat in Iowa in the November election.

Patty Judge, chair of Focus on Rural America and former lieutenant-governor of Iowa, said: \u201cIowans aren\u2019t interested in hearing Donald Trump offer more promises that he won\u2019t keep. \u201cHaving crafted some of the biofuels policies that have driven economic opportunity in rural Iowa, I\u2019m deeply saddened to see him prioritise waivers for Exxon and Chevron over farmers and homegrown biofuel facilities, abandoning the engines that drive many small towns and rural economies.\u201d",

The bill, which cleared the South Dakota house of representatives on Wednesday but still has to clear the state\u2019s senate, would bar doctors in the state from providing anyone under 16 with the drugs, which can temporarily stop the body from producing the hormones that lead to puberty, a reversible process. Critics of the proposed ban say the drugs play a crucial role in allowing trans children struggling with the onset of puberty to hit pause. \u201cOne of the biggest problems for these kids is \u2026 their sense of who they are isn\u2019t matching their body,\u201d Anne Dilenschneider, a South Dakota psychologist, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a body developing in a way that is causing a huge crisis. And they want it to stop,\u201d said Dilenschneider, warning this could make young people suicidal. Studies have found that young trans people have a much higher suicide rate than their peers. Proponents of the bill, which would also ban treatments rarely performed on children such as sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy as well as puberty blockers, say these can harm young people, who may not fully grasp the risks. Fred Deutsch, a South Dakota Republican representative, described the procedures ahead of the vote as \u201ccriminal acts against vulnerable children who are too young to understand the impact\u201d. The legislation has sparked national backlash from doctors and activists across the country, who say it is rooted in misinformation and seeks to outlaw standards of care outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other major medical organizations. The bill follows the introduction in South Carolina of measures that could see the licenses of doctors who treat trans children revoked, one of a series of such measures in conservative US states. Lawmakers in Missouri are considering a law that would see parents who allowed such treatments reported to child welfare, while Republican legislators in Texas, Georgia and Kentucky have proposed banning gender reassignment treatment for minors. The Trump administration has also launched attacks on trans rights with a number of discriminatory policies. Experts and parents of trans children warn such restrictions could harm young people already struggling with the challenges of adolescence and gender dysphoria. A study of 20,619 trans adults published earlier this month found those who wanted and received puberty-blockers were less likely to have a history of suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts by their mid-30s. South Dakota resident Rob has a 14-year-old daughter who has been on puberty blockers for about a year. Rob, who asked to be identified only by his first name, said puberty blockers had \u201cmade all the difference in the world for my child\u201d, who had been self-harming before she began taking the drugs. \u201cShe changed as a person, back into this friendly, fun-loving child,\u201d said Rob, who describes himself as \u201c100% Republican\u201d but said he was frustrated that politicians would try to prevent his daughter from accessing the treatment. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government has any right to step in and dictate what a person does with their own body,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not protecting anybody.\u201d The ban passed with 46 votes to 23 in the state\u2019s Republican-controlled house of representatives.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

It news came shortly before the risk level from the virus in the UK was raised from low to moderate and the World Health Organization declared it a global health emergency. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, announced that the emergency flight, which was delayed by 24 hours, would be taking off from Wuhan and was due to land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire at around 9am. Military doctors will be onboard the chartered plane in case immediate treatment is necessary, although any passengers displaying symptoms of the virus \u2013 which can include a sore throat, fever and breathing difficulties \u2013 will be barred from boarding. It is understood there will be a quarantine area in the plane in case somebody falls ill during the flight. The returnees will be bussed to Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral where they will be monitored and treated if any symptoms develop. They will be staying in an accommodation block usually designated for NHS staff. Margaret Greenwood, the Labour MP for Wirral West, said she had spoken to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who told her that experts believed it was unlikely that those quarantined had the virus. Passengers were asked to sign contracts agreeing to the 14-day quarantine as a condition of getting the flight home. A further 50 EU nationals will also be on the chartered flight, which will fly on to Spain where it will complete its journey. Raab said: \u201cWe are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 0500 local time on Friday 31 January. The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority.

Thursday saw the single biggest increase in the death toll \u2013 up 29% to 170 \u2013 with more than 7,700 reported cases. Ninety-five per cent of the deaths have occurred in the Hubei province in central China, but health officials in Chicago have confirmed a first case of person-to-person transmission inside the US. In Italy 6,000 holidaymakers remain in lockdown on board a cruise ship after concerns passengers could be carrying the virus, while a 17-year-old boy with cerebral palsy from Hubei <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/disabled-teenager-in-china-dies-at-home-alone-after-relatives-quarantined\">has died after his carers were quarantined</a> and unable to assist him.</p> \n<p><strong>The watchdog for Australia\u2019s disability services is receiving up to 100 allegations of neglect or abuse weekly</strong>, with figures from just three months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/31/ndis-watchdog-is-fielding-nearly-100-allegations-of-abuse-or-neglect-a-week\">showing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/31/ndis-watchdog-is-fielding-nearly-100-allegations-of-abuse-or-neglect-a-week\">more than 6,000 instances of people being physically restrained</a> without their consent. There were 1,236 reports of abuse or neglect filed during the quarter, with Jeff Smith, the chief executive of People with Disability Australia, saying it was \u201chorrifying that people with disability are being subjected to this level of violence\u201d. </p> \n<p><strong>At least 12 sport grant applications seeking funding for female change rooms were ignored</strong>, despite the federal government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/31/sports-grants-coalition-rejected-12-grant-applications-for-female-change-rooms-at-local-sport-grounds\">defending the program on the basis of its focus on female participation</a> in community sports. One of the rejected applications, Cherry Gardens Ironbank Recreation Ground, came highly recommended by Sport Australia with a score of 94 out of 100, but was overlooked by the then sport minister, Brigid McKenzie. A rugby club in the Coalition-held seat of Sturt did receive $500,000 for women\u2019s change rooms, despite fielding no women\u2019s teams after allegations of sexism. It was rated by Sport Australia at 60.5 out of 100.</p> \n<h2>Australia</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73e83a032f68bb23acd33460d5aaf7f692862ddc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e83a032f68bb23acd33460d5aaf7f692862ddc/0_192_5278_3166/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Regrowth in a bushfire-ravaged area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We want birds, insects, green shoots, animal poop, fungus \u2026 Even if it\u2019s a tree that has burned to a crisp, that\u2019s still useful,\u2019 Casey Kirchhoff says.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Crosling/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Scientists are calling on Australians to document how the nation\u2019s habitats and wildlife are recovering from the unprecedented bushfire crisis.</strong> With 11m hectares badly burnt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/31/birds-insects-animal-poo-citizen-science-search-for-data-to-make-sense-of-bushfire-devastation\">a new citizen data project could deliver essential information</a> to aid recovery efforts.</p> \n<p><strong>The Australian Conservation Foundation has called for a cap on the fuel rebate system</strong>, with the $4.5bn annual saving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/31/australian-conservation-foundation-calls-for-cap-on-fuel-tax-credits-for-big-business\">to be redirected to rural and regional renewal</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 31 January. Top stories The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency but has stressed its confidence in China\u2019s handling of the crisis. Thursday saw the single biggest increase in the death toll \u2013 up 29% to 170 \u2013 with more than 7,700 reported cases. Ninety-five per cent of the deaths have occurred in the Hubei province in central China, but health officials in Chicago have confirmed a first case of person-to-person transmission inside the US. In Italy 6,000 holidaymakers remain in lockdown on board a cruise ship after concerns passengers could be carrying the virus, while a 17-year-old boy with cerebral palsy from Hubei has died after his carers were quarantined and unable to assist him. The watchdog for Australia\u2019s disability services is receiving up to 100 allegations of neglect or abuse weekly, with figures from just three months showing more than 6,000 instances of people being physically restrained without their consent. There were 1,236 reports of abuse or neglect filed during the quarter, with Jeff Smith, the chief executive of People with Disability Australia, saying it was \u201chorrifying that people with disability are being subjected to this level of violence\u201d. At least 12 sport grant applications seeking funding for female change rooms were ignored, despite the federal government defending the program on the basis of its focus on female participation in community sports. One of the rejected applications, Cherry Gardens Ironbank Recreation Ground, came highly recommended by Sport Australia with a score of 94 out of 100, but was overlooked by the then sport minister, Brigid McKenzie. A rugby club in the Coalition-held seat of Sturt did receive $500,000 for women\u2019s change rooms, despite fielding no women\u2019s teams after allegations of sexism. It was rated by Sport Australia at 60.5 out of 100. Australia Scientists are calling on Australians to document how the nation\u2019s habitats and wildlife are recovering from the unprecedented bushfire crisis. With 11m hectares badly burnt, a new citizen data project could deliver essential information to aid recovery efforts. The Australian Conservation Foundation has called for a cap on the fuel rebate system, with the $4.5bn annual saving to be redirected to rural and regional renewal. Under the proposal, small landholders would not be adversely disadvantaged courtesy of an annual cap of $20,000, with the bulk of savings coming from the mining sector. The world High winds have blown over sections of Donald Trump\u2019s US-Mexico border wall, with construction crews rushed in to fix nine-metre steel panels that had begun to lean at sharp angles. Islamic State has started to reassert itself in its Middle East heartlands, the UN has warned, with a UN security council report warning that the group is conducting increasingly brazen insurgent attacks inside Syria and Iraq. Nearly 10m trees planted in Turkey as part of National Forestation Day have reportedly died, just months after Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, declared the initiative. A lack of water is understood to have been the cause. The Screen Actors Guild has released new guidelines to oversee the filming of sex scenes, in an effort to eradicate sexual misconduct in the film and television industry. Described as a \u201clandmark document\u201d, the protocols outline responsibilities for on-set intimacy coordinators. Recommended reads It\u2019s a buzzword that\u2019s been adopted by the industrial wellness complex, but can we do better than \u201cself-care\u201d in the 2020s? \u201cWhile looking after yourself is great, self-care is still an idea rooted in a neoliberal tradition of looking out for ourselves, rather than seeing ourselves, our health and our fates as inextricably linked to our fellow human beings,\u201d writes Brigid Delaney. So could a more socially minded concept of \u201ccommunal care\u201d come to replace it? The myriad issues facing Indigenous Australians are hard to tackle in isolation because they\u2019re systemic and intersecting. In Guardian Australia\u2019s series 2020 Vision, the Atsic social justice commissioner, June Oscar, offers one potential starting point: dismantling a system of denial, and moving towards one anchored in truth. \u201cBetween denial and truth is immense fear about what we will unearth. A fear that what we will see will be so uncomfortable that we can no longer continue business as usual, and that transformation will be the only way forward.\u201d Until The Secret Life of Us, there were no accurate reflections on Australian TV screens of messy, complicated twentysomething living. Shows like Melrose Place or Friends appeared \u201ctoo glossy, the apartments too nice\u201d. The first in a triptych of generational-capturing dramas, leading Love My Way and Tangle, it reflected a contemporary Australia, Brigid Delaney writes. (What\u2019s your most unforgettable Australian TV moment? Vote in our poll until Wednesday 5 February) Listen Last year the small Pacific island of Bougainville voted overwhelming for independence. But with the historic referendum non-binding, will Papua New Guinea obstruct the move to freedom? On this episode of Full Story, Leanne Jorari looks at the long and often violent journey to this historic moment for Bougainville. Sport A groin injury may have made Roger Federer\u2019s Australian Open exit to Novak Djokovic a likely outcome but the Swiss remains hopeful of adding to his men\u2019s record 20 grand slams, writes Simon Cambers, despite going down 7-6, 6-4, 6-3 to the Serbian. After all, just six months ago he was at match point in a Wimbledon final. A downcast Ash Barty has put her semi-final exit to American Sofia Kenin in perspective, brightening her post-match press conference with a surprise appearance by her three-month-year-old niece, Olivia. \u201cI mean, perspective is a beautiful thing. Life is a beautiful thing. She brought a smile to my face as soon as I came off the court.\u201d And it\u2019s Friday, which means David Squires on \u2026 the most unlikely potential saviour of Australian football. Media roundup South Australia\u2019s Liberal premier, Steven Marshall, has vowed to put his \u201cfoot to the floor\u201d in accelerating the state\u2019s move towards a zero-emissions economy, writes the Australian, with the premier saying climate change had \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d exacerbated bushfires. An \u201cincreasingly erratic\u201d Tony Mokbel has threatened the life of a senior Victorian police officer who worked on the taskforce that eventually arrested the underworld boss, the Age reports. And, Tasmanian farmers might become big winners out of Brexit, claims the Mercury, which suggests that Australia could sign a trade deal with the UK by year\u2019s end that would dramatically boast the state\u2019s food exports. Coming up The Productivity Commission is releasing an annual report on primary and community health, ambulance services, public hospitals and mental health management. The CSIRO will hold a media conference on its work on the coronavirus at 10am.

      "bodyText": "Speculation that a decision on HS2 will be made early next week is mounting as the prime minister and key figures are understood to have held final talks on the controversial project. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, who has publicly swung behind the scheme, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, are believed to have met Boris Johnson as the high-speed line continues to divide opinion among backbenchers. Shapps told the Commons on Thursday that a decision was due \u201cnext month\u201d, though the expectation is that it will be made public early next week while avoiding a clash with Johnson\u2019s major speech on a future trade deal with the EU. Shapps told MPs during transport questions in the Commons on Thursday that they \u201cwon\u2019t have to wait very long\u201d for a final announcement. The Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, who has been a strong advocate for the line and its potential to help the region\u2019s economy, told the Guardian: \u201cAll of my instinct is the argument will be won.\u201d Javid is understood to \u201cbroadly back\u201d the project, which has already prompted deep divisions within the Conservative party. Its cost has been estimated at up to \u00a3106bn, nearly doubling from a figure of \u00a356bn in 2015. But opposition to the high-speed line \u2013 which will link London, Birmingham, the east Midlands, Manchester and Leeds \u2013 remains strong, with critics raising concerns over rising costs and environmental impact. The newly elected Conservative MP Greg Smith, who represents Buckingham, a constituency where some people have been forced out of their homes to make way for HS2, indicated he would rebel against the government in any Commons vote on the project. Asked whether he was willing to defeat his own government, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI was very clear in the general election campaign that I am opposed to HS2. It is absolutely wrong for my constituency and I believe it to be wrong for the country as well, and I made very clear commitments in the general election that, come what may, I will oppose HS2. \u201cWhat I really want to get on with, though, is convincing the government that there are better projects that we can deliver, which will improve people\u2019s lives.\u201d The rising budget could become a stumbling block as Javid has ordered ministers, in a letter co-signed by Johnson, to identify 5% cuts in their departments so the government is free to plough funds into manifesto pledges on improving the NHS, education and policing. Smith said his constituents were \u201cextremely angry\u201d about the project, adding: \u201cHS2 rips through the middle of Buckinghamshire as a whole, not just my constituency, and we have many people who are already turfed out of their homes, having, incidentally, not been paid for those homes, farms cut in two, villages decimated. \u201cBut I think this case is twofold. One is the environmental destruction, which is outrageous, especially in Buckinghamshire where there is no benefit whatsoever for local people, no stop, no ability to use this line. \u201cBut bigger than that is the unaffordability of HS2. Lord Berkeley\u2019s review [into HS2] found that for every pound spent, we\u2019re only going to get 60p back.\u201d The review, overseen by the former HS2 chair Doug Oakervee, was leaked in November but Berkeley demanded that his name be removed after the leak suggested that the line should be built in full. However, Street said the cost of the project would be paid over many decades and the economic case made in the Oakervee review, which is yet to be released, showed there is a strong economic case for the project. He said: \u201cIt was very significant the chancellor put his weight behind it. The chancellor said he pored over the numbers and I know as a member of the Oakervee panel that all the costs were there and the likely benefits, and there was a value for money answer. \u201cYou\u2019ll be paying it back over 50 to 100 years, just as the people who built the Victorian railways or indeed the people who built the Channel tunnel would think in that timeframe. On these really big projects that\u2019s how you\u2019ve got to think about it.\u201d Politically he said it would be unthinkable to reject the scheme now. \u201cWe just had the breaching of the red wall and this is to invest in those places that turned to the Conservatives,\u201d he said. Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, warned earlier this month that HS2 was over budget and behind schedule because the risks and complexity of the project had been underestimated. The final cost was impossible to estimate \u201cwith certainty\u201d, the watchdog said. Phase one, running between London and Birmingham, was to open in 2026 but services are now expected to launch between 2031 and 2036.",

      "bodyText": "A national rollout of smart motorways has been put on hold by transport secretary, Grant Shapps, after they were linked with an increase in the number of road deaths. Shapps said there would be no new stretches of smart motorway until the government has completed a review announced last year. \u201cFor me, we must make them at least as safe, if not safer [than ordinary motorways], otherwise they cannot continue,\u201d he said. The freeze comes days after new figures revealed that the schemes, designed to increase capacity, had led to a dramatic 20-fold increase in the number of near misses. But while work will stop on several schemes that were due to finish this year, sections of smart motorway that are already in use \u2013 including on the M1, M4, M6 and M62 \u2013 will remain open. The trial schemes help increase capacity without the need for road widening, by allowing drivers to use the hard shoulder when directed to do so by electronic signs mounted on gantries above the road. About 200 miles of motorway in Britain have already been converted. Shapps announced a review in October last year, amid concern about accidents involving drivers who break down on sections of motorway with no hard shoulder. Earlier this week, an investigation by BBC\u2019s Panorama programme cast fresh doubt on their safety. Near-misses on the M25 London ring road went up by 20 times after the introduction of \u201csmart running\u201d, according to a freedom of information request, while one of the electronic warning signs was out of action for 336 days. The investigation also revealed that 38 people have been killed on smart motorways in the past five years. The day after the programme, a report by the all-party parliamentary group on roadside rescue and recovery, led by the ex-minister who signed off the expansion of smart motorways, branded them a \u201cdeath trap\u201d. Former roads minister Mike Penning accused Highways England of \u201ccasually ignoring commitments\u201d on safety. The report criticised Highways England\u2019s failure to implement a Stopped Vehicle Detection system, which uses radar to spot vehicles that have broken down. In their report, the MPs said an admission by Jim O\u2019Sullivan, Highways England chief executive, that radar technology could have saved lives was \u201ca damning indictment of the agency\u2019s on-the-hoof approach\u201d. Days after the emergence of fresh concerns about smart motorways, Shapps told the Commons that all new schemes would be on hold, including a \u00a392m project in Kent. Work to convert a 6.5 mile stretch of the M20 into a smart motorway between West Malling and Aylesford was due to be completed in March after two years of work which has disrupted journeys. Chatham and Aylesford MP Tracey Crouch asked Shapps if he agreed that the new road system should not open because it does not have stopped vehicle detection systems or \u201cappropriately spaced emergency refuges\u201d. He replied: \u201cThat stretch of the M20 and all other stretches which are currently being worked on will not be opened until we have the outcome of the stock take.\u201d Work will also cease on several major schemes that were due to finish this year, including stretches of the M20 in Kent, the M62 in Greater Manchester, the M23 near Gatwick Airport and the M6 near Coventry. Philip Gomm, of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, said: \u201cOn safety grounds this pause is unarguable. \u201cBut it does mean that for users of the M20 \u2013 who have suffered delays not just because of this scheme but also the Brexit-related speed restrictions and lane closures \u2013 the inconvenience is set to go on. \u201cNo-one underestimates the complexity of these schemes but it does underline the need to get the design right first time.\u201d",

The avocado \u2013 more commonly known for gentrifying communities across countries \u2013 is poised to cause a spate of injuries this weekend. Super Bowl Sunday is thought to be one of the year\u2019s biggest days for avocado consumption \u2013 162m lb of avocado was consumed during last year\u2019s big game, and many dutiful hosts serving up chips and dips this game season could be putting themselves at serious risk. Last year, the forebodingly named \u201cavocado hand\u201d was branded an \u201cepidemic\u201d of hand injury by researchers at Emory University, who noted a rise in such cases. If you think epidemic sounds far-fetched, consider this: the researchers estimated 50,413 avocado-related knife injuries occurred between 1998 and 2017, with over half happening in the last decade. And that\u2019s not even counting those too ashamed to go to hospital. Avocado hand occurs when a person tries to remove the pit in a dangerous manner, such as with a knife, and ends up cutting themselves. The consequences can be serious: avocado hand can result in damage to the muscles or tendons, and even the nerves in extreme cases. (And there we all were thinking the only problem with avocados is how they are causing a crisis in millennial home ownership.) Here are the rules on how to safely cut an avocado, according to the California Avocado Commission. How to safely remove an avocado stone \u2022 Take the avocado, wash thoroughly, dry and then place on a cutting board. \u2022 Carefully cut the avocado in half lengthwise around the pit (or seed), with the fruit flat on the cutting board. \u2022 Rotate the avocado a quarter-turn and cut lengthwise around the pit, creating quarter avocado segments. Put down your knife. \u2022 By separating the quarters, you can remove the pit seamlessly with your fingertips.",

First, breaking up is hard to do. The problems we have faced in trying to leave the EU stand as a testament to how right the Brexiters were all along: this isn\u2019t a simple trading block, it is far, far, more. And disentangling the relationship has likewise proved far more complicated than many people \u2013 including most high-profile Brexiters \u2013 ever imagined. Think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/24/revealed-complex-post-brexit-checks-for-northern-irish-traders\" title=\"\">Northern Ireland</a> and those endless debates over backstops and borders.

From the apolitical civil service, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/03/brexit-civil-service-1930s-germany\" title=\"\">vilified and abused</a> by politicians who should know better, to judges, attacked from parliament and on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">front pages of the tabloid press</a>. From the devolution settlement, buttressed by a Sewel convention that, like Jack Sparrow\u2019s pirates\u2019 code, turns out to be more \u201cguidelines than rules\u201d\u201d To the sovereignty of parliament, neatly sidestepped by the government, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/what-is-prorogation-prorogue-parliament-boris-johnson-brexit\" title=\"\">closed it down</a> for a while. Much of what we have taken for granted about our country now appears vulnerable.</p> <p>Which brings us to the politicians. Many of the problems we have faced have stemmed from the dysfunctionality of our politics since that June poll. It was the inability of the cabinet and then parliament to agree what they wanted, not the failure of civil servants, that was largely responsible for the Brexit impasse. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/27/olly-robbins-steely-operator-fighting-on-the-brexit-frontline\" title=\"\">Olly Robbins</a> became an unfortunate scapegoat for others\u2019 incompetence. Civil servants didn\u2019t fail their political leaders. Quite the contrary.</p> <p>And divisions were compounded by the low calibre of many of those in the top jobs. You might have thought that a leader of the opposition would understand what article 50 was before recommending its triggering. But no. Corbyn shot from the hip.

      "bodyText": "Dawn, 24 June 2016. College Green. That small patch of grass opposite the Palace of Westminster. A flag-waving group of men \u2013 Nigel Farage and co \u2013 celebrates raucously. An ashen-faced Jeremy Corbyn arrives to tell the prime minister that article 50 should be triggered immediately. A senior FT reporter runs past, gasping that \u201cthe PM\u2019s resigned and it\u2019s only the third story on our website\u201d. And so, the post-referendum odyssey began. In the sun, on the Green, with everyone going bonkers. It\u2019s been three and a half long years, in which we have learned a number of things about not only Brexit but also ourselves. First, breaking up is hard to do. The problems we have faced in trying to leave the EU stand as a testament to how right the Brexiters were all along: this isn\u2019t a simple trading block, it is far, far, more. And disentangling the relationship has likewise proved far more complicated than many people \u2013 including most high-profile Brexiters \u2013 ever imagined. Think of Northern Ireland and those endless debates over backstops and borders. Think of the power wielded over Theresa May by a party few in Great Britain had ever heard of, let alone understood. And at the same time, we\u2019ve come to understand that our most treasured institutions are perhaps more fragile than we\u2019d suspected. From the apolitical civil service, vilified and abused by politicians who should know better, to judges, attacked from parliament and on the front pages of the tabloid press. From the devolution settlement, buttressed by a Sewel convention that, like Jack Sparrow\u2019s pirates\u2019 code, turns out to be more \u201cguidelines than rules\u201d\u201d To the sovereignty of parliament, neatly sidestepped by the government, who closed it down for a while. Much of what we have taken for granted about our country now appears vulnerable. Which brings us to the politicians. Many of the problems we have faced have stemmed from the dysfunctionality of our politics since that June poll. It was the inability of the cabinet and then parliament to agree what they wanted, not the failure of civil servants, that was largely responsible for the Brexit impasse. Olly Robbins became an unfortunate scapegoat for others\u2019 incompetence. Civil servants didn\u2019t fail their political leaders. Quite the contrary. And divisions were compounded by the low calibre of many of those in the top jobs. You might have thought that a leader of the opposition would understand what article 50 was before recommending its triggering. But no. Corbyn shot from the hip. Speak in haste, don\u2019t repent ever. As for the former prime minister, where to start? First, she painted herself into a corner by turning a soundbite (\u201ccontrol over our borders, laws and money\u201d) into negotiating red lines. Second, she prioritised Conservative party unity over forging a national consensus. And third, she called an unnecessary snap election that left her a hostage of the Democratic Unionist party and European Research Group. You might also have hoped that the resident of 10 Downing Street would be capable of making difficult choices and explaining fundamental tradeoffs. Yet May persisted in asking for the impossible: frictionless trade while leaving the single market and customs union. And just consider the other abject nonsense we\u2019ve had to tolerate. The pointless adjective war of that first summer \u2013 hard Brexit, soft Brexit, clean Brexit, chaotic Brexit, managed Brexit, red white and blue Brexit, dog\u2019s Brexit. And then the real rubbish: \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d; \u201ca jobs-first Brexit\u201d; \u201ca second referendum to overcome division\u201d (I ask you); and, of course, \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Failure, of course, was not confined to those in positions of influence. Honourable mentions go to those who either wanted to prevent Brexit or to \u201csoften\u201d it. The former ran perhaps the least effective campaign since, well, the campaign against Brexit in the referendum. The latter \u2013 allegedly determined to deliver Brexit, but a soft one \u2013 distinguished themselves by voting against precisely that on 29 March 2019. Of course, support for the third meaningful vote would not have guaranteed a soft Brexit \u2013 let\u2019s not forget the stalwarts of the ERG and their endless capacity to cause trouble. But the May deal offered far more to those interested in retaining close ties with the EU than anything that\u2019s going to be on offer now. So yes, we\u2019ve all had a lot to deal with.

In 2010, the 62 seats lost by the party in England and Wales that have not been regained since, have an almost identical \u201cBrexit profile\u201d to the 54 fresh losses in 2019. Moreover, while lots has happened \u2013 the period since the referendum has ended the careers of two prime ministers, eight cabinet ministers and over 80 MPs \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t assume this churn is the new normal.

It is almost six years since he moved to the Premier League, having first tried his luck in Europe aged 17. Without a work permit and threatened with deportation from France, the midfielder was adopted by his Belgium-based agent before eventually being recruited by Anderlecht. But it was his performances for Senegal at the 2012 Olympics in London that proved to be the launchpad for him and many of his international teammates.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the Olympics, so many players got contracts with big European clubs \u2013 it opened the doors for so many of our generation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way ... we\u2019re from small towns with nothing there, no prospects. If you want to make it you need to fight as hard as possible.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many great players in Senegal but you need to have some luck to make it. For me, Sadio and Idrissa [Gueye], we knew we had to take this chance.\u201d</p> <p>Kouyat\u00e9 won four league titles with Anderlecht and was heavily linked with Arsenal before joining West Ham in 2014. He initially found the change of scenery hard to deal with.</p> <p>\u201cIn my first year here, every week I would want to go back to Belgium,\u201d he says. \u201cMy friends were asking me why I kept coming back and I would tell them: \u2018It\u2019s because I don\u2019t like London.\u2019 But after three or four months I got to know some of the players at West Ham like Carlton Cole, Diafra Sakho and Mark Noble \u2013 he helped me a lot.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e19eac006ba77dbd88ceeaba468d7325cd839d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e19eac006ba77dbd88ceeaba468d7325cd839d1/0_0_3500_2381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheikhou Kouyate is hauled back by Arsenal\u2019s Granit Xhaka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cheikhou Kouyate is hauled back by Arsenal\u2019s Granit Xhaka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tess Derry/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>West Ham finished seventh in Kouyat\u00e9\u2019s second season and he scored the first goal at the club\u2019s new London Stadium home in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/04/west-ham-domzale-europa-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Europa League tie</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/04/west-ham-domzale-europa-league-match-report\" title=\"\"> in August 2016</a>.

The team spirit here is unbelievable and it really helped with my integration.

Sometimes we go to Mama [Sakho]\u2019s house, mine or [Christian] Benteke\u2019s. My wife is a very good cook \u2013 we usually have Yassa chicken, which is a typical food from Senegal that has lots of onions, mustard and peppers served with rice and pasta. It is really nice \u2026 you will have to try it one time. But it\u2019s different every time. For example when we go to Jordan\u2019s house we have Ghanaian food.\u201d</p> <p>As for whether Palace can improve on last season\u2019s 12th place or surpass 2015\u2019s Premier League high of 10th, Kouyat\u00e9 is taking nothing for granted. \u201cWe have one objective: to finish higher than we did last year \u2026 But the first priority has to be make sure we are safe from relegation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also has big plans to try to emulate two of Senegal\u2019s successful youth academies by opening his own once his career is over.

      "bodyText": "\u2018We don\u2019t like that,\u201d says Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9, frowning. \u201cBut what can we do? They never listen to us players.\u201d Having just completed a session at Crystal Palace\u2019s training ground in Beckenham on a chilly January day, Senegal\u2019s captain has a towel slung over his broad shoulders to keep out the cold. Less than 24 hours after the decision was taken to switch the 2021 edition of the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon from summer to the middle of next season, he wants to get something off his chest. \u201cImagine if you are playing for a club in Europe and then suddenly you have to leave during the middle of the season and let your team down? It\u2019s so hard for me and my African brothers,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody wants to miss any part of the season, especially at such an important time of the year. It puts us all in a very difficult position. Imagine what it\u2019s going to be like this time next year \u2013 Liverpool will be without three of their best players in Sadio [Man\u00e9], [Mohamed] Salah and Naby Ke\u00efta; here we have me, Jordan Ayew, Wilfried Zaha and Jeffrey Schlupp \u2026\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s suggestion that the switch to January could put European clubs off signing African players struck a chord with Kouyat\u00e9, who was in the Senegal side also featuring Man\u00e9 that lost to Algeria in the final of last year\u2019s tournament in Egypt. \u201cYou could understand if that happened,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cManagers need to have a strong squad that they can rely on all of the time.\u201d Kouyat\u00e9 should know. It is almost six years since he moved to the Premier League, having first tried his luck in Europe aged 17. Without a work permit and threatened with deportation from France, the midfielder was adopted by his Belgium-based agent before eventually being recruited by Anderlecht. But it was his performances for Senegal at the 2012 Olympics in London that proved to be the launchpad for him and many of his international teammates. \u201cAfter the Olympics, so many players got contracts with big European clubs \u2013 it opened the doors for so many of our generation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way ... we\u2019re from small towns with nothing there, no prospects. If you want to make it you need to fight as hard as possible. \u201cThere are so many great players in Senegal but you need to have some luck to make it. For me, Sadio and Idrissa [Gueye], we knew we had to take this chance.\u201d Kouyat\u00e9 won four league titles with Anderlecht and was heavily linked with Arsenal before joining West Ham in 2014. He initially found the change of scenery hard to deal with. \u201cIn my first year here, every week I would want to go back to Belgium,\u201d he says. \u201cMy friends were asking me why I kept coming back and I would tell them: \u2018It\u2019s because I don\u2019t like London.\u2019 But after three or four months I got to know some of the players at West Ham like Carlton Cole, Diafra Sakho and Mark Noble \u2013 he helped me a lot.\u201d West Ham finished seventh in Kouyat\u00e9\u2019s second season and he scored the first goal at the club\u2019s new London Stadium home in a Europa League tie in August 2016. But his spell in east London soured in February 2018 when Tony Henry, the club\u2019s head of player recruitment, was suspended following allegations that he wanted to limit the number of African players in their squad because some \u201chave a bad attitude\u201d and \u201ccause mayhem\u201d when they are not in the team. On the day the story broke, Kouyat\u00e9 posted a selfie on Instagram with the caption: \u201cAfrican and proud\u201d and now acknowledges the message was in direct response to what West Ham later condemned as \u201cunacceptable comments\u201d by an employee they sacked. \u201cIt was because we are so proud of where we are from,\u201d he says. \u201cWe love football and we love having the chance to play in Europe. We don\u2019t see any difference between white and black people. But sometimes we have some crazy people who I don\u2019t understand why they say things \u2026 This is very hard for some brothers. For me, we just need to forget that and focus on our job. \u201cThis is life \u2013 sometimes you can do nothing. We talk, we talk, we talk [about racism] but tomorrow you\u2019re going to see another thing. Take your time to concentrate on those that are close to you like your family and try to give love to them. Forget the rest and you will be happy.\u201d Palace\u2019s longstanding interest in Kouyat\u00e9 culminated in a \u00a39.5m move in August 2018, allowing him to link up again with his former West Ham teammate James Tomkins. Despite the large African contingent in Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad, Kouyat\u00e9 insists that was not a factor in his decision. \u201cI knew there were a lot of African players here but the white people are like Africans also. You have [James] McArthur, Luka [Milivojevic, also a former teammate at Anderlecht], James Tomkins \u2026 These are people that I knew before I came and they have made things easier for me. The team spirit here is unbelievable and it really helped with my integration. After nine months it felt like I had been here for five years.\u201d As well as football, there is another passion that runs through the squad. \u201cWe usually go to each other\u2019s houses for food,\u201d Kouyat\u00e9 says. \u201cWe play a game in training and if you lose, then we have to come to your home for food. Sometimes we go to Mama [Sakho]\u2019s house, mine or [Christian] Benteke\u2019s. My wife is a very good cook \u2013 we usually have Yassa chicken, which is a typical food from Senegal that has lots of onions, mustard and peppers served with rice and pasta. It is really nice \u2026 you will have to try it one time. But it\u2019s different every time. For example when we go to Jordan\u2019s house we have Ghanaian food.\u201d As for whether Palace can improve on last season\u2019s 12th place or surpass 2015\u2019s Premier League high of 10th, Kouyat\u00e9 is taking nothing for granted. \u201cWe have one objective: to finish higher than we did last year \u2026 But the first priority has to be make sure we are safe from relegation.\u201d He also has big plans to try to emulate two of Senegal\u2019s successful youth academies by opening his own once his career is over. Generation Foot and Diambars \u2013 established thanks to support from Dakar-born Patrick Vieira \u2013 have helped produce players such as Man\u00e9, Gueye and Watford\u2019s Isma\u00efla Sarr over the past decade and Kouyat\u00e9 believes it is only the start. \u201cWe need to continue this way because you can see how successful they have been. For me, it is a dream to do something like this in the future. We want to help as many people as possible to have a chance.\u201d",

In it the rightwing academic tarred managers who thought there were corporate responsibilities beyond profits as \u201cunwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society\u201d. Friedman\u2019s view of shareholder primacy became the conventional wisdom, boosted by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Since 1979 the idea that only company owners are the rightful claimants of the fruits of the economy gained traction. Nowadays shareholders are the central actor in economic life. This has been a damaging and unwise road to take.</p> <p>Putting shareholders first means less cash for workers and other stakeholders, hampering efforts to tackle in-work poverty and climate change. While the UK\u2019s largest listed companies have doubled in a decade the amount paid out to shareholders (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a711e64d-420e-4f61-bcf5-4a88dee950e4\" title=\"\">a record \u00a3110bn last year</a>), the average wage in November 2019, measured as weekly real pay, was <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/january2020\" title=\"\">lower</a> than in February 2008. If the \u00a3110bn was divided up between the <a href=\"https://merchantmachine.co.uk/profit-per-employee/\" title=\"\">5 million people</a> employed by the FTSE 100 companies, each worker would receive \u00a322,000 each.</p> <p>It is worth noting that Friedman\u2019s pull is so strong that dividend payouts almost never fall, irrespective of profitability. This is not the only way to funnel cash back to shareholders: since 2011 about <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/817978/share-repurchases-executive-pay-investment.pdf\" title=\"\">\u00a320bn a year</a> has been spent by companies on share buybacks in the UK. Prem Sikka of Essex University has <a href=\"https://leftfootforward.org/2020/01/prem-sikka-excessive-dividends-are-strangling-the-uk-economy/\" title=\"\">pointed</a> out that \u201cshare buybacks have consistently exceeded share issuance over the past decade\u201d, turning stock markets into cash extraction machines.</p> <p>It was Thomas Piketty, the French economist, who noted that \u201cwhen the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities\u201d. This is the reality of the current mode of capitalism. In a report last year the Trades Union Congress <a href=\"http://highpaycentre.org/files/Shareholder_Returns_report_November_2019_%281%29.pdf\" title=\"\">said that</a> UK taxpayers earning more than \u00a3150,000 (barely 1% of all taxpayers) captured around 22% of income from company dividends. It is <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/review/r150811a.pdf\" title=\"\">important</a> to note that most of these people are not involved in the firms they own or knowledgeable about them. </p> <p>While the candidates for the Labour party leadership are engaged in a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-leadership-nationalisation-keir-starmer-corbyn-nandy-a9308471.html\" title=\"\">competition</a> over who can dream up the most nostalgic of left policies, it may be worth the party spending some time thinking about how to ensure increases in business profits are effectively directed to job-creating investment. This would require challenging the Friedmanite consensus around shareholder primacy. If Labour chooses to retreat into the comfort zone of nationalisation, it will find its slogans lifted by Boris Johnson who has no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/boris-johnson-tories-left-economy-labour\" title=\"\">compunction</a> in doing so if it wins votes.</p> <p>What the Conservative party is much less likely to do is to repurpose the firm into a more egalitarian vehicle for social change. John McDonnell\u2019s policy of inclusive ownership funds, drawn from work by the <a href=\"https://common-wealth.co.uk/examining-the-IOF.html\" title=\"\">Common Wealth</a> thinktank, did just that. The idea was for businesses to issue a sliver of equity each year to a fund controlled by staff. This would not only pay dividends to employees but also give them a vote as shareholders. Rewarding bosses with stock has been the norm for years, and if it is good enough for them, why not the same for workers? Labour\u2019s possible leaders ought to be much more engaged with this work if they want territory beyond Friedman that the Tories would find it hard to co-opt.</p>",

This has been a damaging and unwise road to take. Putting shareholders first means less cash for workers and other stakeholders, hampering efforts to tackle in-work poverty and climate change. While the UK\u2019s largest listed companies have doubled in a decade the amount paid out to shareholders (a record \u00a3110bn last year), the average wage in November 2019, measured as weekly real pay, was lower than in February 2008. If the \u00a3110bn was divided up between the 5 million people employed by the FTSE 100 companies, each worker would receive \u00a322,000 each. It is worth noting that Friedman\u2019s pull is so strong that dividend payouts almost never fall, irrespective of profitability. This is not the only way to funnel cash back to shareholders: since 2011 about \u00a320bn a year has been spent by companies on share buybacks in the UK. Prem Sikka of Essex University has pointed out that \u201cshare buybacks have consistently exceeded share issuance over the past decade\u201d, turning stock markets into cash extraction machines. It was Thomas Piketty, the French economist, who noted that \u201cwhen the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities\u201d. This is the reality of the current mode of capitalism. In a report last year the Trades Union Congress said that UK taxpayers earning more than \u00a3150,000 (barely 1% of all taxpayers) captured around 22% of income from company dividends. It is important to note that most of these people are not involved in the firms they own or knowledgeable about them. While the candidates for the Labour party leadership are engaged in a competition over who can dream up the most nostalgic of left policies, it may be worth the party spending some time thinking about how to ensure increases in business profits are effectively directed to job-creating investment. This would require challenging the Friedmanite consensus around shareholder primacy. If Labour chooses to retreat into the comfort zone of nationalisation, it will find its slogans lifted by Boris Johnson who has no compunction in doing so if it wins votes. What the Conservative party is much less likely to do is to repurpose the firm into a more egalitarian vehicle for social change. John McDonnell\u2019s policy of inclusive ownership funds, drawn from work by the Common Wealth thinktank, did just that. The idea was for businesses to issue a sliver of equity each year to a fund controlled by staff. This would not only pay dividends to employees but also give them a vote as shareholders. Rewarding bosses with stock has been the norm for years, and if it is good enough for them, why not the same for workers? Labour\u2019s possible leaders ought to be much more engaged with this work if they want territory beyond Friedman that the Tories would find it hard to co-opt.",

      "bodyText": "The jury in the New York rape trial of Harvey Weinstein has heard that the once-powerful movie mogul employed the Israeli private investigation firm Black Cube to try to squash a New York Times article that blew the lid on sexual misconduct allegations against him and sparked the #MeToo movement. Dev Sen, a corporate lawyer at the prestigious New York law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told the court that his company had acted as go-between connecting the beleaguered movie producer to Black Cube. The private detective firm has a staff largely consisting of alumni of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. Under questioning by Manhattan prosecutors, Sen said that on 11 July 2017 \u2013 three months before the New York Times came out with its bombshell article revealing that Weinstein had paid off multiple women over decades to bury their sexual harassment complaints \u2013 Boies Schiller signed a contract with Black Cube. The deal was sealed under the instructions of Weinstein. The jury was not given details about the nature of the contract. But in legal argument in court on Thursday out of the earshot of jurors, key details of its contents were discussed. Lawyers read out elements of the contract. One excerpt said Black Cube was employed to \u201cprovide intelligence which will help the client\u2019s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY newspaper\u201d. The contract also included a bonus clause under which Black Cube would be paid $300,000 if they actually succeeded in foiling publication of the Times article. During heated legal argument, the lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon argued that the contract \u201cshows that the defendant was concerned about an article coming out and he was looking for Anabella Sciorra to be investigated\u201d. Sciorra is one of six women who feature in the Weinstein rape trial. Last week Sciorra gave dramatic evidence in which she described allegedly being raped by the film producer in her Manhattan apartment in the winter of 1993-94. Weinstein faces five counts that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. He is charged with two counts of rape, one that he forcibly performed oral sex on a woman and two counts of predatory sexual assault. He denies all the charges. Thursday\u2019s testimony and legal arguments corroborated the work of the journalists who exposed the elaborate operation created by Weinstein and his associates in an attempt to try to prevent his alleged sexual misconduct and crimes ever seeing the light of day. The Black Cube contract was first reported by Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker, who revealed that the Israeli firm, on Weinstein\u2019s dollar, deployed a number of investigators using false identities to befriend women accusing the movie titan of sexual misconduct and extract information from them. Farrow also revealed that the contract discussed in court on Thursday was signed personally by David Boies.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

The death toll rose to 170 on Thursday \u2013 up from 132 the previous day, a rise of 29%. The number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 7,736, up from 5,974 a day ago. The actual death rate has not risen, and is now at 2.2%. The number of global cases is 7,818. It is understood that 162 of the deaths \u2013 or 95% \u2013 are in Hubei province where Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began, is located. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province and one in the south-western province of Sichuan. The health chief of Huanggang city, which has reported 500 cases, second only to Wuhan, was summarily sacked by the Chinese government following public anger over her inability to answer questions about the outbreak on state television.

US officials believe it poses a security risk because the Chinese government will make the firm engineer backdoors in its technology, through which information could be accessed by Beijing. Donald Trump has banned US companies from sharing technology with Huawei and has been putting pressure on other nations to follow suit.</p>\n    <p>The UK has accepted there is some risk in working with Huawei, but security services do not believe it to be unmanageable. It has designated Huawei a \u201chigh-risk vendor\u201d, but the company will be given the opportunity to build non-core elements of Britain\u2019s 5G network. The head of MI5 recently said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/12/huawei-technology-poses-no-threat-to-uk-security-ex-mi5-head\">he was confident the US-UK intelligence-sharing relationship would not be affected</a>&nbsp;if London gave Huawei the nod.</p>\n    <p>Much of the doubt surrounding Huawei stems from founder Ren Zhengfei\u2019s time as an engineer in the China's People\u2019s Liberation Army from 1974-83. His daughter Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei executive, was arrested in Canada in December 2018 over allegations of Iran-sanctions violations.<br></p>\n    <p>Huawei insists the Chinese government has never asked it to build a backdoor into its technology, and has offered to sign a \u201cno spy agreement\u201d with countries adopting it. The trade rivalry between the US and China has intensified in recent years and the firm believes the White House is simply using it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/07/us-trade-deficit-falls-to-three-year-low-in-wake-of-china-standoff\">as a weapon in that larger fight</a>.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kevin-rawlinson\"><b>Kevin Rawlinson</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked if the US would reduce intelligence sharing with the UK due to the Huawei access to the UK network, Pompeo said: \u201cWe will never permit American international security information to go across a network that we don\u2019t have trust and confidence in.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the standard, whether it is a Microsoft system, it is the same whether it is a Ericsson, a Nokia system, that\u2019s the standard if it is a Chinese system.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will work with our UK counterparts, and I know the Australians, the New Zealanders, all others in the \u2018five eyes\u2019, will work together to ensure the systems are sufficiently secure and they are going to deliver the outcomes we need them to deliver, and that we have only a level of risk in the system that we find tolerable.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that we will protect American information to that standard.\u201d</p> \n<p>The tone of his remarks suggest the US regards the UK decision as an open negotiating point with room to still change. The US believes that with the decision also unpopular on the Conservative backbenches, in the months ahead it may in effect be nullified.</p> \n<p>But Pompeo warned that the Chinese Communist party did not have \u201ca technical back door to Huawei. They have the front door.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the US had been making the case that having Huawei technology within the network was \u201cvery difficult to mitigate\u201d and so was \u201cnot worth the candle\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you allow the information of your citizens or the national security information of your citizens to transit a network that the Chinese Communist party has a legal mandate to obtain it creates risk.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/boris-johnson-huawei-brexit-prime-minister-government\">Boris Johnson is still triumphant.

If your health records are on a system that belongs and is controlled by the Chinese Communist party that is probably not something you would probably choose in the first instance.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the earlier event with Raab, he wished \u201cGodspeed\u201d to the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, he underlined the tensions ahead by saying it was fantastic that the UK in future would be able to disalign from EU regulations, so making business with the US easier.</p> \n<p>His remarks underline the extent to which the UK will come under US pressure in trade negotiations to maximise its distance from the EU, even though this may mean a more limited UK-EU trade deal.</p> \n<p>Pompeo said: \u201cThe previous administration took the view that if the United Kingdom made this decision it would be at the back of the line. We intend to put the United Kingdom at the front of the line.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both Raab and Pompeo held back from predicting that a deal could be agreed before the US presidential elections this November.</p> \n<p>Pressed to explain why the US had refused the UK government request to extradite Anne Sacoolas over the death of 19-year-old Harry Dunn last year, Pompeo simply said the case was an enormous tragedy and he was terribly sorry for the loss of a British citizen\u2019s life.</p> \n<p>He said \u201cthe US would do everything possible to make that right in a way that protects the important relationship between the two countries\u201d. He said he was still working on a good resolution to the disagreement, but did not go into any specifics. Nothing he said suggested he was going to comply with the UK extradition request.</p> \n<p>Raab rejected any suggestion that there could be a link between the Sacoolas extradition and the US requests for Prince Andrew to cooperate with the inquiry into his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Raab said one of the points of the discussions with the US was to ensure that such an episode did not reoccur, including a review of the extradition system.</p> \n<p>Pompeo claimed the US policy of maximum economic sanctions on Iran was working, saying \u201cthe fewer dollars in the hands of the Ayatollah was a good thing\u201d, describing Iran as the central threat to stability in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Although Raab agreed there had been wholesale non-compliance of the nuclear deal by Iran, he said the UK still favoured staying inside the nuclear deal since it \u201cwanted to leverage Iran back into some kind of diplomacy negotiation to get compliance\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIf the JCPOA (the technical term for the nuclear deal) can be used to do that, that would be valuable.\u201d</p> \n<p>The US left the deal in 2018, prompting Tehran to take a succession of steps away from it in an attempt to leverage European nations to do more to boost trade with Iran.</p> \n<p>Tehran now states it is free to take whatever steps it wishes to develop a civil nuclear power programme, but continues to allow the UN atomic inspectors to monitor and report on the Iranian programme.</p> \n<p>Throughout the one-hour joint conversation at the Policy Exchange thinktank Raab referred to the creases in the US-UK special relationship, but focused on the shared objectives and values that bind the special relationship.</p>",

Asked if the US would reduce intelligence sharing with the UK due to the Huawei access to the UK network, Pompeo said: \u201cWe will never permit American international security information to go across a network that we don\u2019t have trust and confidence in. \u201cThat\u2019s the standard, whether it is a Microsoft system, it is the same whether it is a Ericsson, a Nokia system, that\u2019s the standard if it is a Chinese system. \u201cWe will work with our UK counterparts, and I know the Australians, the New Zealanders, all others in the \u2018five eyes\u2019, will work together to ensure the systems are sufficiently secure and they are going to deliver the outcomes we need them to deliver, and that we have only a level of risk in the system that we find tolerable. \u201cI\u2019m sure that we will protect American information to that standard.\u201d The tone of his remarks suggest the US regards the UK decision as an open negotiating point with room to still change. The US believes that with the decision also unpopular on the Conservative backbenches, in the months ahead it may in effect be nullified. But Pompeo warned that the Chinese Communist party did not have \u201ca technical back door to Huawei. They have the front door.\u201d He said the US had been making the case that having Huawei technology within the network was \u201cvery difficult to mitigate\u201d and so was \u201cnot worth the candle\u201d. \u201cWhen you allow the information of your citizens or the national security information of your citizens to transit a network that the Chinese Communist party has a legal mandate to obtain it creates risk.\u201d But Pompeo set the Huawei decision in the starkest context by saying the US now regards the Chinese Communist party as antithetical to US values and a bigger threat than terrorism. Speaking later on LBC, Pompeo said: \u201cWe view the intrusion of the Chinese Communist party into information technology systems as a very great risk, a national security risk as well as a core privacy risk. If your health records are on a system that belongs and is controlled by the Chinese Communist party that is probably not something you would probably choose in the first instance.\u201d At the earlier event with Raab, he wished \u201cGodspeed\u201d to the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, he underlined the tensions ahead by saying it was fantastic that the UK in future would be able to disalign from EU regulations, so making business with the US easier. His remarks underline the extent to which the UK will come under US pressure in trade negotiations to maximise its distance from the EU, even though this may mean a more limited UK-EU trade deal. Pompeo said: \u201cThe previous administration took the view that if the United Kingdom made this decision it would be at the back of the line. We intend to put the United Kingdom at the front of the line.\u201d Both Raab and Pompeo held back from predicting that a deal could be agreed before the US presidential elections this November. Pressed to explain why the US had refused the UK government request to extradite Anne Sacoolas over the death of 19-year-old Harry Dunn last year, Pompeo simply said the case was an enormous tragedy and he was terribly sorry for the loss of a British citizen\u2019s life. He said \u201cthe US would do everything possible to make that right in a way that protects the important relationship between the two countries\u201d. He said he was still working on a good resolution to the disagreement, but did not go into any specifics. Nothing he said suggested he was going to comply with the UK extradition request. Raab rejected any suggestion that there could be a link between the Sacoolas extradition and the US requests for Prince Andrew to cooperate with the inquiry into his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Raab said one of the points of the discussions with the US was to ensure that such an episode did not reoccur, including a review of the extradition system. Pompeo claimed the US policy of maximum economic sanctions on Iran was working, saying \u201cthe fewer dollars in the hands of the Ayatollah was a good thing\u201d, describing Iran as the central threat to stability in the Middle East. Although Raab agreed there had been wholesale non-compliance of the nuclear deal by Iran, he said the UK still favoured staying inside the nuclear deal since it \u201cwanted to leverage Iran back into some kind of diplomacy negotiation to get compliance\u201d. He added: \u201cIf the JCPOA (the technical term for the nuclear deal) can be used to do that, that would be valuable.\u201d The US left the deal in 2018, prompting Tehran to take a succession of steps away from it in an attempt to leverage European nations to do more to boost trade with Iran. Tehran now states it is free to take whatever steps it wishes to develop a civil nuclear power programme, but continues to allow the UN atomic inspectors to monitor and report on the Iranian programme. Throughout the one-hour joint conversation at the Policy Exchange thinktank Raab referred to the creases in the US-UK special relationship, but focused on the shared objectives and values that bind the special relationship.",

      "body": "<p>The Mail on Sunday has agreed to pay \u00a3180,000 in damages to a former minicab licensing officer after the newspaper falsely accused him of acting as a \u201cfixer\u201d for paedophile taxi drivers in Rochdale.</p> <p>Waj Iqbal, 44, told the Guardian his life had been ruined by the article, leaving him reliant on anti-depressants, out of work, and prevented from seeing his children. He said the legal victory followed a three-year battle and the newspaper had chosen to pick on him because of his race.</p> <p>The Mail on Sunday story claimed Iqbal, who is British-Pakistani, cleared taxi drivers of the same background to work in Rochdale at a time when they were sexually abusing children.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the article came out I didn\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s like my whole world crumbled around me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe colour of my skin was the selling point. Put that together with grooming gangs and then \u2013 boom.\u201d</p> <p>Under the headline \u201cScandal of the mini-cab predators\u201d, the newspaper focused on Iqbal, a junior taxi-licensing official at South Ribble borough council, as part of its coverage of the decision to renew the licence of a local driver called John O\u2019Sullivan, who had been found guilty of assaulting a profoundly autistic child by tying him up on a school run.</p> <p>The Mail on Sunday attempted to connect him to a much bigger scandal, claiming that in a previous job he was a \u201cfixer\u201d for taxi drivers in Rochdale \u201cat a time when some local drivers were raping underage girls as members of paedophile rings\u201d.</p> <p>The piece appeared in May 2017, the same week that the BBC broadcast the drama series Three Girls about the scandal \u2013 leading many in the close-knit communities around Iqbal\u2019s home to draw a connection between the two.</p> <p>While Iqbal was working at Rochdale, it was as part of a large team covering all manner of licensing issues, an issue now accepted by the Mail on Sunday\u2019s lawyers.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThey put two and two together and got five. It\u2019s easy to say that the Asian licensing officer is granting licensing to groomers.\u201d</p> <p>The impact on Iqbal, who also worked part-time as a bouncer, was immediate. The security company he worked for said he could no longer be employed as a member of door staff at local venues as there was too much interest in the story.</p> <p>\u201cI feared for my life. I put CCTV all up around my house because you get lunatics. I had to come off social media completely. My son was studying at Preston and people would say say: \u2018Your dad\u2019s dodgy, he\u2019s part of this grooming thing.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5d6590e5933807d0352fbae19d6891f08b5f679\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5d6590e5933807d0352fbae19d6891f08b5f679/0_210_5906_3542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waj Iqbal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waj Iqbal: \u2018It\u2019s like my whole world crumbled around me.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said being branded a paedophile-enabler pushed him towards suicidal thoughts. Potential employers would offer him agency work, Google his name and withdraw the offer when they saw the coverage. He said he had already being having issues in his marriage and this story was the \u201cnail in the coffin\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe article portrayed me as the main guy when in reality there were 10 to 15 staff,\u201d he said of his time at Rochdale.

      "bodyText": "The Mail on Sunday has agreed to pay \u00a3180,000 in damages to a former minicab licensing officer after the newspaper falsely accused him of acting as a \u201cfixer\u201d for paedophile taxi drivers in Rochdale. Waj Iqbal, 44, told the Guardian his life had been ruined by the article, leaving him reliant on anti-depressants, out of work, and prevented from seeing his children. He said the legal victory followed a three-year battle and the newspaper had chosen to pick on him because of his race. The Mail on Sunday story claimed Iqbal, who is British-Pakistani, cleared taxi drivers of the same background to work in Rochdale at a time when they were sexually abusing children. \u201cWhen the article came out I didn\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s like my whole world crumbled around me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe colour of my skin was the selling point. Put that together with grooming gangs and then \u2013 boom.\u201d Under the headline \u201cScandal of the mini-cab predators\u201d, the newspaper focused on Iqbal, a junior taxi-licensing official at South Ribble borough council, as part of its coverage of the decision to renew the licence of a local driver called John O\u2019Sullivan, who had been found guilty of assaulting a profoundly autistic child by tying him up on a school run. The Mail on Sunday attempted to connect him to a much bigger scandal, claiming that in a previous job he was a \u201cfixer\u201d for taxi drivers in Rochdale \u201cat a time when some local drivers were raping underage girls as members of paedophile rings\u201d. The piece appeared in May 2017, the same week that the BBC broadcast the drama series Three Girls about the scandal \u2013 leading many in the close-knit communities around Iqbal\u2019s home to draw a connection between the two. While Iqbal was working at Rochdale, it was as part of a large team covering all manner of licensing issues, an issue now accepted by the Mail on Sunday\u2019s lawyers. He said: \u201cThey put two and two together and got five. It\u2019s easy to say that the Asian licensing officer is granting licensing to groomers.\u201d The impact on Iqbal, who also worked part-time as a bouncer, was immediate. The security company he worked for said he could no longer be employed as a member of door staff at local venues as there was too much interest in the story. \u201cI feared for my life. I put CCTV all up around my house because you get lunatics. I had to come off social media completely. My son was studying at Preston and people would say say: \u2018Your dad\u2019s dodgy, he\u2019s part of this grooming thing.\u2019\u201d He said being branded a paedophile-enabler pushed him towards suicidal thoughts. Potential employers would offer him agency work, Google his name and withdraw the offer when they saw the coverage. He said he had already being having issues in his marriage and this story was the \u201cnail in the coffin\u201d. \u201cThe article portrayed me as the main guy when in reality there were 10 to 15 staff,\u201d he said of his time at Rochdale. He said that in any case there was little the licensing department could have done about the grooming activities of the minicab drivers, since the police had been reluctant to investigate or prosecute the individuals. Because the drivers had not been found guilty of any offence, there was no reason to block their licences. Instead, when the authorities finally took action against the paedophile drivers, it was Iqbal who found himself tasked with telling a driver who would later be convicted of child sex offences that he would be taken off the road. \u201cI went to deliver the suspension letter and his 11-year-old daughter opened the door. I was sickened to the stomach thinking about how he could do that stuff.\u201d The case was picked up by the lawyer Mark Lewis, and on Thursday the Mail on Sunday settled at the high court in a case that is estimated to have cost the newspaper a further \u00a31m in legal fees. As part of the settlement the newspaper has agreed to retract the claims, with a court statement making clear that Iqbal did not work exclusively as a taxi licensing official while at Rochdale and emphasising that he was never issued with any formal warning over his work at South Ribble council. Iqbal, who had struggled to find work and had been driving a 180-mile daily roundtrip from his home in Nelson to Wrexham in search of work, has celebrated the payout by taking a holiday to Bali. But he said there was little upside from the incident. \u201cFamily-wise I couldn\u2019t see my kids for two years because of the article. The money is there but the time I\u2019ve lost with my children, you can\u2019t put a price on it. And within the Asian community my reputation is basically gone.\u201d He said he was concerned about Islamophobia in parts of the British media. \u201cI\u2019m being portrayed as if I\u2019m part of these bad people.

Internationally, Podence has been capped at five different youth levels, playing alongside current Wolves players Ruben Neves and Diogo Jota for Portugal Under-21s. </p> \n   <p>Wolves are now awaiting international clearance for their latest capture, which makes him a doubt to be available for Saturday\u2019s Premier League clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford.</p> \n   <p>Speaking about his move, Podence told the club website: \u201cI\u2019m very excited. It was always a childhood dream of mine to play in the Premier League and I look at this achievement as a dream come true. </p> \n   <p>\u201cWolves are a team with a big project, with ambitious goals to look forward to, where I\u2019ll get to meet former team-mates with whom I had the pleasure to play with in the past and I hope to be very successful here.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Unsurprisingly, one of the main reasons he has joined Wolves is due to the considerable Portuguese contingent at the club. He added: \u201cOf course, I spoke with Rui, but I also know Ruben, Jota and Moutinho very well. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a big help for me to adapt to English football, which is challenging.

Will Manchester United sign a striker? All these questions and many more must be answered by 11pm GMT tomorrow. Bye for now! We\u2019ve just published an excellent interview with Crystal Palace\u2019s Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9, which I commend to you. Here\u2019s a sample quote: We play a game in training and if you lose, then we have to come to your home for food. Sometimes we go to Mama [Sakho]\u2019s house, mine or [Christian] Benteke\u2019s. My wife is a very good cook \u2013 we usually have Yassa chicken, which is a typical food from Senegal that has lots of onions, mustard and peppers served with rice and pasta. It is really nice \u2026 you will have to try it one time! And here\u2019s a sample photo: And here\u2019s the article itself: Here\u2019s some news about QPR\u2019s Toni Leistner, now better known as Koln\u2019s Toni Leistner: QPR have allowed defender Toni Leistner to depart the club to sign for Cologne on loan until the end of the season. The 29-year-old has struggled for minutes over the last month and returns to his native Germany to play in the Bundesliga. \u201cAt this stage of the season Toni wants assurances about first-team football and that is something we cannot guarantee any player,\u201d QPR manager Mark Warburton told the official club website. \u201cIt is about being honest with the players and if any individual is not satisfied or is unhappy we will not stand in their way. \u201cThe form of young Conor Masterson has entitled him to recent first-team starts and we will always give opportunities to players, regardless of their age. This move gives Toni his opportunity to play every week and we wish him well during his time with FC Koln.\u201d Sander Berge now has his own news story: So far as I can tell, Mainz are refusing to sell the French forward Jean-Philippe Mateta to Napoli even though they really want him, while Napoli are refusing to sell the Belgian forward Dries Mertens to Chelsea even though they really want him, so nobody has the forward they want. Except Mainz. And maybe Napoli. Done deal claxon! Paco Alc\u00e1cer has moved from Borussia Dortmund to Villarreal, where he has signed a four-and-a-half year deal, for a reported fee of \u20ac23m, rising to \u20ac30m. That makes him the Yellow Submarine\u2019s record signing. Borussia are reportedly set to immediately splash that cash on Emre Can. Apparently Newcastle have emerged as rivals for Espanyol in their pursuit of Porto\u2019s 28-year-old striker Vincent Aboubakar. Done deal claxon! Krzysztof Piatek, another striker heavily linked this month with a move to the Premier League, has gone somewhere else - to Hertha Berlin to be precise. Ianis Hagi has landed in Glasgow, ahead of his move to Rangers: Here\u2019s Andy Brassell on what to expect from Bruno Fernandes: In a relatively small country, nothing stays a secret for too long. As Bruno Fernandes stepped outside his home and on to the street, he was swiftly doorstepped by a reporter from the television news station SIC. \u201cIt\u2019s not the moment yet for my final message to Sporting fans,\u201d he said with an amiable smile. Would he at least confirm that going to England was his preference? \u201cIt always was,\u201d said Fernandes, without a second\u2019s hesitation. All things come to those who wait and how Sporting Clube de Portugal\u2019s now-erstwhile captain has waited. In the past year it was abundantly clear that Sporting couldn\u2019t hold him much longer, and with his talent demanding a wider audience it would have been so even if they had been in better financial shape. So Sportinguistas savoured every moment over that period, from last April\u2019s stealthy rocket from range to oust Benfica from the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal in the semi-final to the deflected drive that put them on the road to victory in the Ta\u00e7a final against Porto. Much more here: Done deal claxon! Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Bruno Fernandes from Sporting on a five-and-a-half year contract, with an option to extend for another year. This is what the player has had to say on his move: My love of Manchester United really started when I used to watch Cristiano Ronaldo play and ever since then I have been a big fan of this great club. For me to now play for Manchester United feels incredible, I have worked hard to get to this moment and I can promise the fans that I will give everything for the badge to help bring us more success and trophies. I want to thank Sporting for everything they have done for me. It is surreal to hear the nice words that have been said about me from players that used to play for this team. A massive thank you to Ole and everyone at Manchester United for the trust they have shown in me and I can\u2019t wait to start to repay that on the pitch. Sander Berge has cost Sheffield United a club-record \u00a322m. He\u2019s quite young, quite good and quite tall (nearly 6ft 5in). Here\u2019s a transfer announcement for fans of Money Heist, the intensely gripping (for the first couple of seasons) Spanish drama: Done deal claxon! Sander Berge has officially joined Sheffield United, according to Sky. Presumably this is him here: \u201cRochdale aren\u2019t the only north-west team with a driving school connection,\u201d my Guardian colleague Will Dean informs me. \u201cI first tried (and failed) to learn to drive with the Oldham Athletic-affiliated Latics School of Motoring in the early 00s. I think it has since been spun off from the club and presumably, given OAFC\u2019s dismal last few seasons, has a much better pass rate.\u201d I\u2019ve got some entertainment for your eyes and ears in the shape of this week\u2019s Football Weekly Extra: And David Squires\u2019 weekly Australian sport update: We have an update on the Jarrod Bowen situation, and it\u2019s not good news for Newcastle: Hang on, Rochdale have their own driving instructor? Here\u2019s Luke Matheson, their 17-year-old right-back (he\u2019s started 13 league games this season, the first three of them while he was still 16), who has passed his driving test today. The company he used describe themselves as \u201cthe Official Driving School of Rochdale AFC offering Professional Driving tuition to clients throughout Rochdale, Heywood, Middleton and surrounding areas\u201d. The last we heard of Willian Jos\u00e9 was that Spurs were reviving their interest in him, but can that: according to AS Tottenham have pulled out of negotiations. This leaves the Brazilian forward in a bit of a pickle, they explain, because of his refusal to play against Espanyol last week in the belief that a move to London was just hours away. He has burned some bridges at Real Sociedad but as it stands remain their player. West Ham might swoop to usher him away from this awkward situation. The Daily Mail are reporting that Nottingham Forest are to attempt to take Newcastle\u2019s Dwight Gayle on loan, with an obligation to buy for \u00a315m should they get promoted. Forest are currently third in the Championship, four points behind the leaders, Leeds United, and two behind West Bromwich Albion. One of the names that has cropped up most over the course of this month is Edinson Cavani, who has been linked to Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea, and Atletico Madrid a few more times. L\u2019Equipe is now reporting that he will stay at Paris St-Germain for the remainder of the season, after the Spanish side decided not to increase their previously-rejected \u20ac15m offer for the Uruguayan frontman. He will be available on a free transfer in the summer. A little over an hour ago we had news on Jarrod Bowen\u2019s potential move from Hull to Newcastle, but in this mixed-up, muddled-up, shook-up world things can change fast: Sky are now reporting that Crystal Palace are ready to offer \u00a316m plus \u201cadd-ons\u201d for him. This just in from Bruno Fernandes\u2019 agent (for those who can\u2019t see the image, it\u2019s the midfielder in a Manchester United tracksuit, in front of a desk upon which rests a piece of paper and a pen): The Romanian journalist Emanuel Rosu has written a bit on Twitter about Rangers-bound Ianis Hagi: A few words about Ianis Hagi for all the Rangers fans out here: great vision, both feet, technical guru, capable of scoring impossible goals and seeing passes others don\u2019t. Weaknesses: work rate is not impressive, sometimes tries too hard for the impossible. I hope he\u2019ll thrive at Rangers. He\u2019s not physical, and that\u2019s a fear I have, but he can find a place where he\u2019s valued and I think that will make him show what he\u2019s made of! Come on, kid! Right, my watch is over. Simon Burnton is here to take you through the next little bit. Reports of medicals have slowed, but i\u2019m sure that behind closed doors, stethoscopes are a go-go. \u201cIan Ormandroyd,\u201d begins Chris Fenton. \u201cThe original Crouch. Bradford City legend?? For a team that once had Fellaini...this is a step up in quality.\u201d United should probably sign Tony Daley to make sure he has the service he needs. Steven Nzonzi is in France, and should join Rennes on loan from Roma. Manchester United are seeking to open talks with Ian Olney and Ian Ormondroyd. Danny Rose is expected at Newcastle\u2019s training ground shortly. His loan comes with no obligation to buy. Thinking about deals already done, I wonder how Jurgen Klopp will use Takumi Minamino. Had Liverpool had a player of that ilk, they\u2019d probably have won the league last season, but now they have Oxlade-Chamberlain fit and a system that doesn\u2019t include him works. Obviously there are lots of games, but in the biggest ones, I\u2019d expect the midfield three to be Fabinho, Henderson and Wijnaldum. Rondon scored 28 goals in 120 appearances for West Brom. Dean Smith is still looking for a striker, because if there\u2019s one thing of which Villa are short, it\u2019s strikers. He\u2019s not ruling out players coming in, leaving, or nothing happening. I enjoyed this, but I\u2019ve always been a toast man. Manchester United have signed Nathan Bishop, a 20-year-old goalie, from Southend United. Tangentially, after watching for former warm up last night I\u2019ve decided to apply for Lee Grant\u2019s job. Krzysztof Piatek is moving from AC Milan to Hertha Berlin. Spurs had been interested, apparently, but there were concerns about how well he\u2019d gel with Serge Aurier. Gosh. Newcastle are trying for Olivier Giroud and Jarrod Bowen. Here\u2019s more on that... Brendan Rodgers is after some defensive cover. There\u2019s no indication of the form it might take. I can\u2019t recall which commentator it was, but I once heard someone pronounce Tom Soares\u2019 surname the same way Cedric Soares pronounces his. What an incredible job Hassenhuttl has done at Southampton these last couple of months. What a peculiar league it is that has them ninth. Check out our transfer window interactive. Ralph Hassenhuttl, manager of the year, is giving a press conference. It looks like Cedric Soares is off to Arsenal! Verily, I do not know. \u201cIs Southampton\u2019s business done? \u201cSo far, yes.\u201d He is, of course, the son of Georghe, the Maradona of the Carpathians. Boy could play. Nabil Bentaleb, who looked a player at Spurs until he fell out with Mauricio Pochettino, has told Sky he\u2019d like his move to become permanent. He\u2019s asked if he thinks Danny Rose is good; he says yes, he does think that Danny Rose is good. More news as I get it. Sky are reporting that Spurs want Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg \u2013 but Arsenal and Everton are also interested. That one might not happen until the end of the season if, indeed it happens. Roy Hodgson has no updates on Nathan Ferguson, but is hoping for an update from Dougie Freedman. He is amazed to discover that his club are linked with Yannick Carrasco and that other teams are linked with Patrick van Aanholt. He is less definitive about Connor \u201cChief\u201d Wickham, who he says needs to play but can\u2019t leave if he\u2019s needed. Potter has nothing to say on Gaetan Bong, who is with Forest. He\u2019s not trained today but nothing is confirmed. Potter won\u2019t speak about Mac Allister and reiterates the importance of Glenn Murray, who\u2019d like to play more. He seems to be staying at the not Goldstone Ground. \u201cLife goes on,\u201d says Graham Potter. That is a relief. As was Celtic-Racing the previous season. Talking of Estudiantes, here\u2019s their World Club Cup tussle with Manchester United in 1968. It was rough. Brighton are hoping to get the tremendously-named Alexis Mac Allister back from Boca Juniors. Previously, he hadn\u2019t been awarded a work permit, but that is now in place. Marcos Rojo, who was in the away end at the Etihad last night wearing an alluring orange puffa, is close to sealing his return to Estudiantes, on loan. Buzzing to find out for which game he\u2019s getting rushed back. As per the below, Chelsea are reportedly up for Dries Mertens. But so are ... yes ... Inter. He\u2019d be a nofty acquisition for either. Apparently Everton have kaybeed Barcelona\u2019s \u00a380m bid for Richarlison. I wonder about him: he looks to have all the attributes to be a serious players. I wonder what he makes of it all. Chris Wilder, wearing a coat and snood in doors \u2013 maybe he\u2019s not staying long, but can\u2019t expect to feel the benefit when he leaves \u2013 expects to bring in maybe three players. A deal is close for Sander Berge who is, apparently, in Sheffield. This thread is excellent for those who\u2019d like more information on Fernandes, and to have that information presented in words not numbers. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said last night that Fernandes is \u201cfit and ready to play\u201d. He also said he needs someone read to \u201cbreak their nose\u201d to score \u2013 a repudiation, no doubt, of Anthony Martial who plays like he wouldn\u2019t even break win. Afternoon all and thanks Tom. A man is stood outside Old Trafford \u2013 \u201ca veteran of many deadline days\u201d, sweardown someone just said that \u2013 explaining that Bruno Fernandes is having a medical. And with that, I\u2019ll hand you over to Daniel Harris, who\u2019ll sort the afternoon\u2019s wheat from the chaff for you. Email him here if you fancy. Bye. Into Ligue 1, and a sizeable deal reported from Lyon, who have signed the defensive midfielder Bruno Guimar\u00e3es for \u20ac20m. AP reports that the 22-year-old Guimares has joined from the Brazilian club Athletico Paranaense until June 2024. A couple of nuggets of Football League news: Cardiff have signed the Bournemouth defender Brad Smith on loan for the rest of the season. The Australian international has been on loan at the MLS club Seattle since March. And Scunthorpe have sacked their manager, Paul Hurst, as the Iron flounder in the bottom half of League Two. What\u2019s happened with Hurst? His Shrewsbury side of a couple of years ago were really highly regarded, but since his ill-fated Ipswich move nothing\u2019s really worked for him. More Barcelona talk: the Spanish champions are reportedly preparing a \u00a320m offer for Chelsea\u2019s Willian, according to Sky Sports\u2019 Kaveh Solhekol. Meanwhile his near-namesake Willian Jos\u00e9 is set to be the target of a revived bid from Spurs for his services. But we\u2019re living off speculative scraps at the moment without the meat and potatoes of proper Done Deals. More from Sheffield United: Sander Berge\u2019s fee has been agreed, release clause/add-ons being negotiated, and his agent is at the Blades\u2019 training ground, the Guardian\u2019s own Jamie Jackson tells us. It will be a club record if the deal for Genk\u2019s Norway midfielder gets over the line. \u201cHi Tom.\u201d Hi Justin Frost. \u201cRestos, Berge and, according to the Beeb, Dutch striker Richairo Zivkovic. Is Chris Wilder a secret FM fanatic? All three wonderkids were the backbone of my mighty Torquay United team who went on to dominate the Premier league and Europe. I predict a future Blades dominance. Also rumours of Richarlison going to Barca. Really? Brief glimpses of quality but generally mediocre. The mind boggles \u2026\u201d Sometimes I think these huge-price thwarted deals are just thrown out there to give us something to talk about while nothing much happens. Anyway, I\u2019d like to know more about Torquay\u2019s era of European dominance. Not before time, frankly. Manchester United latest: Bruno Fernandes is at the club\u2019s training ground, and according to Sky \u201cliterally crawling to the finish line\u201d in completing his medical (no pictures of this literal crawling yet available). Confirmation of the deal is expected in late-afternoon. Fernandes may even make his debut against Wolves on Saturday. United might yet be in for a striker in the next 35 hours too. There\u2019s reports afoot that Manchester City have gazumped Barcelona in the pursuit of the teenage right-back Yan Couto and secured a \u20ac15m deal with the Brazilian club Coritiba for the 17-year-old\u2019s service. Yahoo Sports reports that Manchester City have swooped in late to thwart a \u20ac10m move to Barcelona and bring Couta to the Premier League. Couto\u2019s Coritiba contract was set to expire at the end of the season. The report says that Couto will travel to England to finalise the details and confirm the deal, but will have to return to Coritiba for a few months before turning 18 in June, when he will officially move to Manchester. Meanwhile, sometime Chelsea and Spurs target Krzysztof Piatek has arrived in Berlin for a medical ahead of his move from Milan to Hertha. The Bristol City captain Josh Brownhill will undergo a medical at Burnley this afternoon ahead of a move that could be worth up to \u00a310m. Going in the opposite direction, in a separate deal, is the striker Nahki Wells, who spent the first half of this season on loan at Queens Park Rangers. Brownhill has matured into one of the best box-to-box midfielders in the Championship since joining the club from Preston in 2016. Earlier this season City manager Lee Johnson said: \u201cHe is a very good student and has been since I first took him on loan to Barnsley. I could see that there was a superstar in the making. He probably goes down as one of the value signings in Bristol City\u2019s history.\u201d Nathan Ferguson, also included in the Guardian\u2019s guide to the most promising players in the Championship this season, is set to join Crystal Palace before window shuts. Over in Serie A, Roma have signed the Barcelona forward Carles P\u00e9rez in a deal worth an initial \u20ac11m, ESPN is reporting. Perez, who has made 10 appearances in La Liga this season, has signed a contract with Roma until 2024. More Sheffield United news: As well as signing Sander Berge, Chris Wilder is hoping to nail down a deal for the Bayer Leverkusen and Greece defender Panagiotis Retsos. More when and if we get it. Here\u2019s more on Podence\u2019s move to Wolves, from PA Media Wolves have completed the signing of Portuguese winger Daniel Podence from Olympiacos on a four-and-a-half-year deal. The fee is understood to be \u00a317m, which makes the 24-year-old the third most expensive signing in the club\u2019s history behind Raul Jimenez (\u00a332m) and Adama Traore (\u00a318m). Podence becomes the 10th Portuguese player within manager Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s current squad, and is part of the same Sporting Lisbon academy that produced goalkeeper Rui Patricio and midfielder Jo\u00e3o Moutinho. Podence made 40 appearances for Sporting before joining Greek Super League side Olympiacos in August 2018, scoring 11 goals in 64 appearances. Internationally, Podence has been capped at five different youth levels, playing alongside current Wolves players Ruben Neves and Diogo Jota for Portugal Under-21s. Wolves are now awaiting international clearance for their latest capture, which makes him a doubt to be available for Saturday\u2019s Premier League clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford. Speaking about his move, Podence told the club website: \u201cI\u2019m very excited. It was always a childhood dream of mine to play in the Premier League and I look at this achievement as a dream come true. \u201cWolves are a team with a big project, with ambitious goals to look forward to, where I\u2019ll get to meet former team-mates with whom I had the pleasure to play with in the past and I hope to be very successful here.\u201d Unsurprisingly, one of the main reasons he has joined Wolves is due to the considerable Portuguese contingent at the club. He added: \u201cOf course, I spoke with Rui, but I also know Ruben, Jota and Moutinho very well. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a big help for me to adapt to English football, which is challenging. It\u2019s really good to have well-known faces around.\u201d So, this Chelsea link to a Dries Mertens bid then? Reports from Italy suggest Chelsea have bid \u20ac5.5m (\u00a34.6m) for the 32-year-old, whose contract with Napoli expires in the summer. Frank Lampard hasn\u2019t had it all his own way on Chelsea\u2019s return to window-world after their ban, and Mertens might be tempted, given the indifferent season Napoli are having domestically. We shall see. In Manchester United deals actually going ahead, Bruno Fernandes is in Manchester now having his medical. But not before issuing a tearful video to Sporting Lisbon fans about how much he loved their club. \u201cThere were important moments that made a mark on my career. I went through many positive things and many negative things,\u201d he told Sporting TV. Breaking news: Wolves have managed to land the winger Daniel Podence from Olympiacos on a four and a half year deal for a fee thought to be around \u00a317m, and here\u2019s the now-obligatory portentous video montage to mark it. Chelsea loaning out promising starlets is a January staple. And you can read about one such, Conor Gallagher, here. Ben Fisher met him for a chat, a couple of weeks into his loan spell at Swansea, about recovering from heart surgery, Frank Lampard and what he hopes to achieve at the Liberty and beyond. What to make of a couple of today\u2019s more eye-opening tidbits, Everton rebuffing a whopping \u00a385m bid from Barcelona for Richarlison, and the speculation that Manchester United want another garlanded 30-something, Bar\u00e7a\u2019s Ivan Rakitic? In stuff definitely happening, Sander Berge has arrived in south Yorkshire to finalise his move to Sheffield United from Genk. First off, a couple of Championship deals to tell you about. Bristol City have secured a deal for second-tier perennial Nahki Wells from Burnley. Wells spent the first half of the season on loan at QPR, and now the forward is set to bolster the Robins\u2019 attacking options. He\u2019s due a medical at Ashton Gate later today. Elsewhere, Luton have signed Tottenham\u2019s Cameron Carter-Vickers on loan to reinforce a defence that needs reinforcing; the Championship\u2019s bottom club have shipped 63 goals this term. Morning everyone, and welcome to our penultimate day of the transfer window liveblog, where we\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments, endeavouring to sort transfer news wheat from chaff and generally make sense of things as clubs, players and Mr 15%s try to drag deals, coughing and wheezing, over the line. Or not. This is all either as thrilling and dramatic as football gets away from the pitch or a breathless absurd ritual of waving money in the public\u2019s face, depending on your perspective, and how your club\u2019s getting on in the market. Anyway, on to business. Here\u2019s a recap of some of the latest stories: Tottenham\u2019s Danny Rose is heading north-east on a Newcastle loan deal: Chelsea are looking to make a late swoop for Napoli\u2019s Dries Mertens: Manchester United\u2019s protracted pursuit of Bruno Fernandes is finally set to be completed: And Arsenal are getting some defenders in:",

      "bodyText": "People who worked on the Grenfell Tower refurbishment could face the threat of being jailed for life, their lawyers have said, with witnesses interviewed by police believing they could be charged with manslaughter. On Thursday at the public inquiry into the June 2017 disaster, lawyers for current and former employees of the architect, contractor, subcontractor and client on the project said it was plain to those interviewed already by police that the investigation \u201cwill include gross negligence manslaughter where applicable\u201d. \u201cIn addition, [detectives] are expressly investigating contraventions of relevant health and safety legislation and regulation,\u201d they said in an application seeking assurances that evidence they give to the inquiry cannot be used to prosecute them. Health and safety at work crimes are punishable by up to two years in prison, but in the application the lawyers noted that a manslaughter charge could lead to a life sentence. Jonathan Laidlaw QC, acting for Harley Facades, whose employees are among those already questioned by police under caution and who are due to testify to the public inquiry, said \u201ca significant number\u201d of the witnesses expected to be called in the second phase of the inquiry had already backed the application for protection and more may follow. \u201cRight through the course of phase two [of the public inquiry] these individuals will remain suspects in respect of whom there is a real and appreciable danger of self-incrimination,\u201d he said. Many witnesses expected to be called had already been interviewed by detectives, he said, and unless they were given the undertaking then they would invoke their right to refuse to answer even the most basic questions in front of the inquiry. Without protection it would be \u201cimpossible to get to the answers the bereaved, survivors and residents are plainly entitled to,\u201d Laidlaw said. The tactic was branded \u201csabotage\u201d by lawyers for the bereaved and survivors, many of whom were furious. They are due to consider their position on the application over the weekend. Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the inquiry chairman, said the witnesses\u2019 move was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, not least because the issue had been raised more than a year ago. Laidlaw said four witnesses for Harley Facades, the company that oversaw the cladding works, had already been interviewed by police and faced further interviews over possible breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act. That act places a duty on every employee while at work to take reasonable care for the health and safety of anyone \u201cwho may be affected by his acts or omissions at work\u201d. \u201cYou would need to demonstrate that you had done all that was reasonably practicable to escape conviction,\u201d Laidlaw said. \u201cAny person who has failed to take reasonable care for the safety of another commits a criminal offence potentially punishable by a term of imprisonment.\u201d Detectives have said they will not consider whether or not to pass a file recommending prosecutions to the Crown Prosecution Service until after the inquiry has concluded. That means any trials could be at least two years away. Some of the bereaved and survivors have said they would prefer to see justice though the criminal courts than the public inquiry and so would prefer the police investigation to come first.",

His body was found floating in a well on Wednesday, reportedly showing signs of torture. The motive for his murder remains unknown, but some activists speculated that it could have been related to disputes over illegal logging. Last week, authorities called in 53 police officers from the surrounding municipalities for questioning. G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s death comes as the murder rate continues to surge in a country where environmental defenders, human rights workers and community activists are routinely targeted for their work. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has promised to halt attacks on environmental defenders, but the killings continue. \u201cThis is a very regrettable act, very painful,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said at his morning press conference on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s part of what makes us apply ourselves more to guarantee peace and tranquility in the country.\u201d According to Global Witness 14 defenders were murdered in Mexico in 2018.

      "bodyText": "When the classic British motorcycle marque Norton slumped into administration on Wednesday afternoon, the news was framed in the habitual way of a standard UK engineering corporate failure. The 122-year-old brand \u2013 famed for roles in the Che Guevara memoir The Motorcycle Diaries and the James Bond film Spectre \u2013 had fallen victim to an assortment of overwhelming forces ranging from Brexit, a punchy HMRC pursuing the firm for \u00a3300,000 in unpaid taxes, and tough international competition that made it impossible for Norton\u2019s traditional bespoke approach to succeed. However, the story is far more complex than that. It is a pile-up that includes hundreds of hapless pension holders, together with unsuspecting Norton customers, staff and even government ministers, who repeatedly endorsed Norton as millions of pounds in taxpayer support flowed into the firm. All will take a lot of persuading that this is merely a story of a plucky British company that is a victim of circumstance. Their anger looks likely to be directed principally towards one man: Norton\u2019s boss, Stuart Garner. Garner bought the Norton brand in 2008, after it had been under US ownership and had ceased producing bikes. He pledged to return the marque to former glories that include a racing tradition dating back to winning in the first Isle of Man TT race. Even before this week\u2019s collapse, the businessman was being pursued by dozens of \u201cordinary working people\u201d, some of the 228 savers whose pension pots added up to the \u00a314m that was invested into Norton following a fraud. Those savers had been persuaded by a conman to transfer their retirement funds out of conventional pension plans during 2012 and 2013. Their money was then locked up for five years into three new pension plans controlled by Garner \u2013 where the cash was invested in just one asset: Norton shares. Garner has said he had no idea the funds had been raised fraudulently when he accepted them. He insists he too is a \u201cvictim\u201d and that he thought he had longer than five years to pay the money back. An investigation by the Guardian and ITV News has also found: \u2022 Dozens of pension holders are now accusing Garner of ignoring repeated requests to return their pension pots \u2013 years after the lock-in periods that prevented them from accessing their money have passed. \u2022 Millions of pounds in government-backed loans and ministerial endorsements were given to Norton, which enhanced the credibility of the firm and its owner. \u2022 Lengthy delays in promised deliveries of Norton motorcycles \u2013 which can cost as much as \u00a344,000 each \u2013 despite customers saying they had paid deposits and sometimes even the full purchase price. \u2022 A \u00a31m loan received by the motorcycle firm in 2008, that came directly from the proceeds of a tax fraud, for which two longstanding Norton associates were convicted in 2013. Elizabeth Pitcairn, a 55-year-old former HBOS bank worker from Cowdenbeath in Scotland, claims Garner has missed his own deadlines to return her \u00a356,000 pension pot, in a saga that has dragged on for almost a year. She said: \u201cI think [Garner] has behaved atrociously. How is it in this day and age with all these checks that are in place that he can have my money \u2013 basically take my money \u2013 and not give it back and there be no penalty to him?\u201d Further questions are sure to be asked about how Norton reached this point, and how millions of pounds of taxpayer money was staked on the firm. In July 2015, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said his government\u2019s long-term economic plan was \u201call about backing successful British brands like Norton\u201d, as he visited the firm\u2019s Leicestershire factory to announce a \u00a34m government grant to Norton and 11 of its supply chain partners.

      "body": "<p>Brexit day will be an incredibly sad occasion. The loss of the many economic, social and environmental benefits that membership of the largest single market in the world brings will leave us all the poorer in so many ways. Benefits associated with the free movement of goods, capital, services and people across the EU have been immense. Exiting is such a needless act of self-destruction, hitting the poorest hardest. It is a move I predict we will go on to regret.</p> <p>Pro-EU events being held on Friday do, however, afford us the opportunity to celebrate the benefits that membership has brought \u2013 peace, stability and prosperity. The EU flag will also still fly outside the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>Pro-EU campaigners like myself are now in the same position that those who campaigned for the UK to leave what was the EEC were 47 years ago. I would urge the EU to keep a light on for us. The fight continues \u2013 and one day, I am certain, these efforts will be rewarded and we will return.<br><strong>Alex Orr</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am very sad to see the UK leaving the EU, as are huge numbers of my European colleagues. I am British and have worked for the EEC \u2013 and then the EU \u2013 since I graduated in 1973. I retired several years ago. I remember the positive buzz in the early years of membership. </p> <p>But then the rot set in. The UK began to think it was special, too good for the rest of them. Money back, opt-outs and so on. In the 1980s we also saw the beginning of Euromyths and the media\u2019s enthusiasm for Brussels-bashing. UK governments did not have the courage to emphasise the benefits of membership, and even laid the blame for many of their own unpopular decisions on the EU. The British public still think \u201chealth and safety\u201d is an EU invention.</p> <p>This arrogant trend finally resulted in David Cameron\u2019s pusillanimous referendum. The campaign was ridiculously vague, based on lies, and serious malpractices have still not been investigated. The last three years have been a misery for those of us who know the reality (and were not allowed to vote in the referendum) and had to listen to the lies spouted about the organisation we have been proud to work for.</p> <p>The outlook for the UK is not good. The brave new world the government is promising could well become the desperate flounderings of a has-been island. What a waste.<br><strong>Dave Skinner</strong><br><em>Tervuren, Belgium</em></p> <p>\u2022 As the curtain falls on 47 years of EU membership most media attention has focused on the impact on this country, whether the negative trade consequences and lost influence, or instead on the boundless opportunities for a new \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. Little attention has been paid to the risks and damage to our neighbours.</p> <p>The EU will be diplomatically, economically and strategically weakened by us leaving. For internal and external security, the risks are unknown, but most commentators see only damage to trust, partnership and capability in addressing threats in a dangerously unstable environment.</p> <p>An enterprise that the Nobel laureate John Hume described as \u201cthe best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution\u201d, itself justly a recipient of the Nobel peace prize in 2012, will suffer gravely, giving succour to its enemies both within and afar.</p> <p>For Ireland the undermining of the Good Friday agreement is frightening. The 30 years in which 3,000 people were killed is euphemistically named \u201cthe Troubles\u201d. Those with short memories who have campaigned to leave would do well to watch the BBC documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0007pb4/peter-taylor-my-journey-through-the-troubles\" title=\"\">Peter Taylor: My Journey through the Troubles</a>\u2019. Images from Strabane, not broadcast at the time, reveal a town that resembled Bosnia\u2019s Mostar in 1995, such was the scale of devastation.</p> <p>Nationalism and nostalgia are the ghosts that stalk Europe. Sadly, we may act in haste and repent at leisure.<br><strong>Dr Simon Sweeney</strong><br><em>University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 Visiting Brussels last week, I was shown the Chapel for Europe, where on Friday there will be a Brexit day service to \u201cgive thanks for the good over the past five decades, to reflect on the closing of this chapter, to pray for those who work in and with the EU and UK governments, and to seek wisdom and vision for the future\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Brexit day will be an incredibly sad occasion. The loss of the many economic, social and environmental benefits that membership of the largest single market in the world brings will leave us all the poorer in so many ways. Benefits associated with the free movement of goods, capital, services and people across the EU have been immense. Exiting is such a needless act of self-destruction, hitting the poorest hardest. It is a move I predict we will go on to regret. Pro-EU events being held on Friday do, however, afford us the opportunity to celebrate the benefits that membership has brought \u2013 peace, stability and prosperity. The EU flag will also still fly outside the Scottish parliament. Pro-EU campaigners like myself are now in the same position that those who campaigned for the UK to leave what was the EEC were 47 years ago. I would urge the EU to keep a light on for us. The fight continues \u2013 and one day, I am certain, these efforts will be rewarded and we will return. Alex Orr Edinburgh \u2022 I am very sad to see the UK leaving the EU, as are huge numbers of my European colleagues. I am British and have worked for the EEC \u2013 and then the EU \u2013 since I graduated in 1973. I retired several years ago. I remember the positive buzz in the early years of membership. But then the rot set in. The UK began to think it was special, too good for the rest of them. Money back, opt-outs and so on. In the 1980s we also saw the beginning of Euromyths and the media\u2019s enthusiasm for Brussels-bashing. UK governments did not have the courage to emphasise the benefits of membership, and even laid the blame for many of their own unpopular decisions on the EU. The British public still think \u201chealth and safety\u201d is an EU invention. This arrogant trend finally resulted in David Cameron\u2019s pusillanimous referendum. The campaign was ridiculously vague, based on lies, and serious malpractices have still not been investigated. The last three years have been a misery for those of us who know the reality (and were not allowed to vote in the referendum) and had to listen to the lies spouted about the organisation we have been proud to work for. The outlook for the UK is not good. The brave new world the government is promising could well become the desperate flounderings of a has-been island. What a waste. Dave Skinner Tervuren, Belgium \u2022 As the curtain falls on 47 years of EU membership most media attention has focused on the impact on this country, whether the negative trade consequences and lost influence, or instead on the boundless opportunities for a new \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. Little attention has been paid to the risks and damage to our neighbours. The EU will be diplomatically, economically and strategically weakened by us leaving. For internal and external security, the risks are unknown, but most commentators see only damage to trust, partnership and capability in addressing threats in a dangerously unstable environment. An enterprise that the Nobel laureate John Hume described as \u201cthe best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution\u201d, itself justly a recipient of the Nobel peace prize in 2012, will suffer gravely, giving succour to its enemies both within and afar. For Ireland the undermining of the Good Friday agreement is frightening. The 30 years in which 3,000 people were killed is euphemistically named \u201cthe Troubles\u201d. Those with short memories who have campaigned to leave would do well to watch the BBC documentary Peter Taylor: My Journey through the Troubles\u2019. Images from Strabane, not broadcast at the time, reveal a town that resembled Bosnia\u2019s Mostar in 1995, such was the scale of devastation. Nationalism and nostalgia are the ghosts that stalk Europe. Sadly, we may act in haste and repent at leisure. Dr Simon Sweeney University of York \u2022 Visiting Brussels last week, I was shown the Chapel for Europe, where on Friday there will be a Brexit day service to \u201cgive thanks for the good over the past five decades, to reflect on the closing of this chapter, to pray for those who work in and with the EU and UK governments, and to seek wisdom and vision for the future\u201d. A bit different from projecting a countdown clock on to the front of Downing Street. Susan Tomes Edinburgh \u2022 As we are now heading down the toilet, should we call this B-day?

      "bodyText": "As a coalition of early years educators, we are alarmed that sustainability hasn\u2019t been given a stronger focus in the government consultation on reforms to the early years foundation stage, which closes this Friday. Politicians of all parties must urgently acknowledge and address the vital impact that sustainability must have on saving future generations and our planet. We can only make a lasting difference by teaching the next generation about the values of sustainability. In England we start this too late, when children begin full-time at school. England lags behind not just Scotland and Wales, but also New Zealand and Australia, which have already embedded sustainability into early years education. We must catch up. Children must be encouraged to learn through their involvement in reducing the environmental impact of their homes and pre-schools. An ethos of sustainability must be embedded in every aspect of daily life and the management of early years settings. Additionally, providers must ensure their employees understand, through training and information, that they are role models for sustainable citizenship. Early years providers are uniquely placed to cultivate respect for sustainable practices, and we believe that the government needs to recognise this and extend the support for the environment that already exists in primary schools into early years too. The government must introduce sustainability to the curriculum as early as possible, and encourage behaviours that will teach the next generation to secure a more sustainable future for all.

Several employees said they had left their jobs as a result of bullying, derogatory comments and inappropriate references to sensitive personal information.</p> <p>When it appeared that no action had been taken by WLS, five made complaints in 2016 to Westminster council\u2019s safeguarding unit. The council declined to investigate, saying: \u201cWLS have reassured us they will be addressing the safeguarding claims.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell strenuously denied that he had acted inappropriately.

      "bodyText": "A rabbi who was appointed to lead one of the UK\u2019s foremost synagogues has been effectively suspended after concerns were raised about past allegations of bullying and manipulative behaviour. The West London Synagogue (WLS), the flagship of the UK Reform Judaism movement, whose congregation includes the historian Sir Simon Schama and the actor Maureen Lipman, asked Rabbi David Mitchell \u201cto take a period of time away\u201d while a team of independent advisers consider the issues raised. The move comes after members of progressive Jewish communities expressed dismay that Mitchell had been appointed as joint senior rabbi following the forthcoming retirement of Julia Neuberger. They drew attention to internal complaints made in 2012 by some members of the synagogue\u2019s staff of inappropriate behaviour by Mitchell. Several employees said they had left their jobs as a result of bullying, derogatory comments and inappropriate references to sensitive personal information. When it appeared that no action had been taken by WLS, five made complaints in 2016 to Westminster council\u2019s safeguarding unit. The council declined to investigate, saying: \u201cWLS have reassured us they will be addressing the safeguarding claims.\u201d Mitchell strenuously denied that he had acted inappropriately. In a statement given to the Guardian earlier this month, he said: \u201cI want to apologise for anything that I have done which has inadvertently hurt or angered others. Since these issues were first raised I have learned, with coaching and mentoring, to become a better manager of people and I am still learning.\u201d On Thursday, WLS circulated a statement to staff and members of its congregation, informing them that Mitchell had been asked to step down for a period of time. It said: \u201cThe past few weeks have brought particular challenge and reflection across the entire family of West London Synagogue. As a caring community we strive for best practice in the fulfilment of our duty of care to every individual. \u201cOur board of trustees now feels a need to bring in independent advisers \u2013 a fresh pair of eyes \u2013 to spend some time working through the wide range of recent discussions, and meeting those affected. \u201cThis will enable us to learn, and then move ahead with our role as a beacon of progressive Jewish life in central London. As part of this, Rabbi David Mitchell has been asked, and has agreed, to take a period of time away from West London Synagogue. \u201cThis will give breathing space for us to work with all our staff. For this period to be effective, we rely as always on the support of all parties.\u201d One of the complainants welcomed the move but said they wanted any investigation to be \u201ctransparent, to focus on the experience and trauma of victims, to review all historic cases and how the synagogue responded, to address the synagogue\u2019s culture and told in how this has unfolded, and not just look at what is legal but what is ethical\u201d. An open letter signed by more than 100 people has demanded rabbis and cantors adhere to standards of behaviour, covering financial malpractice, bullying, harassment, inappropriate sexual behaviour and intellectual dishonesty.

When the women\u2019s peace camp was set up in 1981, they opened their home to the women and their families, and regularly attended Newbury magistrates court to offer legal advice to those charged with trespass and obstruction. Although Leslie had no law training, he possessed a great understanding of legal matters, allied to the courage to challenge authority.</p> <p>It was Leslie who helped the Greenham women\u2019s case that resulted in a House of Lords judgment that Greenham was still common land. He then opposed further development on the base by assembling evidence that all building work there since the second world war had been illegal. Wendy and Leslie then organised Commons Again, a campaign that supported commoners who refused to give up their rights in return for Ministry of Defence compensation, and the continued existence of these rights eventually resulted in Greenham Common being restored to the public.</p> <p>Leslie was born in Wembley, north-west London, to Sidney Pope, a science journalist, and his wife, Lily (nee Goodenough). After Wembley county school he sat the civil service exam, coming second in the country. He started work at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance in London, and stayed there throughout his working life, rising to be a senior executive officer by the time of his retirement.</p> <p>In 1945 he married Wendy, a teacher, and they eventually moved to Newbury in the 70s. Committed vegetarians, they had both registered as conscientious objectors during the second world war and continued their peace campaigning afterwards. As CND supporters they went on the Aldermaston marches and were members of Newbury Campaign Against Cruise Missiles. It was their involvement in that organisation that led to their later links with the Greenham women.</p> <p>When Wendy died in 2017, Leslie moved to live in a care home in Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear.</p> <p>He is survived by their four children, Anne, Margaret, Jonathan and Simon, 10 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.</p>",

When the women\u2019s peace camp was set up in 1981, they opened their home to the women and their families, and regularly attended Newbury magistrates court to offer legal advice to those charged with trespass and obstruction. Although Leslie had no law training, he possessed a great understanding of legal matters, allied to the courage to challenge authority. It was Leslie who helped the Greenham women\u2019s case that resulted in a House of Lords judgment that Greenham was still common land. He then opposed further development on the base by assembling evidence that all building work there since the second world war had been illegal. Wendy and Leslie then organised Commons Again, a campaign that supported commoners who refused to give up their rights in return for Ministry of Defence compensation, and the continued existence of these rights eventually resulted in Greenham Common being restored to the public. Leslie was born in Wembley, north-west London, to Sidney Pope, a science journalist, and his wife, Lily (nee Goodenough). After Wembley county school he sat the civil service exam, coming second in the country. He started work at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance in London, and stayed there throughout his working life, rising to be a senior executive officer by the time of his retirement. In 1945 he married Wendy, a teacher, and they eventually moved to Newbury in the 70s. Committed vegetarians, they had both registered as conscientious objectors during the second world war and continued their peace campaigning afterwards. As CND supporters they went on the Aldermaston marches and were members of Newbury Campaign Against Cruise Missiles. It was their involvement in that organisation that led to their later links with the Greenham women. When Wendy died in 2017, Leslie moved to live in a care home in Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear. He is survived by their four children, Anne, Margaret, Jonathan and Simon, 10 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.",

One of the signatories, Tom Gardiner, said on Thursday: \u201c[It] was nothing compared to the efforts Sodexo staff and their union, United Voices of the World, went to, but I hope it encourages a sense of solidarity amongst NHS staff that we are one family. We stand together with a shared dream of an NHS that is both a world-class health service and a world-class employer.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of outsourced cleaning and catering jobs are to be brought in-house at one of England\u2019s biggest NHS trusts, meaning staff will be paid thousands of pounds more a year, after a wave of industrial action. Facilities workers at Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust in London, some of whom were earning the minimum wage three months ago, will receive NHS pay rates, sick leave and pensions. Almost 200 workers employed by the outsourcing firm Sodexo at St Mary\u2019s hospital began a wave of strikes and demonstrations in October. The concessions will apply to 1,000 outsourced workers across the trust. Prof Tim Orchard, the chief executive of Imperial, announced the decision in a letter addressed \u201cto porters and cleaning and catering staff\u201d on Thursday morning. \u201cEach of you plays a vital role in caring for our patients,\u201d the letter said. \u201cI want to you to feel properly valued and part of our wider team so that together we can provide the very best care for our patients.\u201d After news of the decision broke, facilities workers outside St Mary\u2019s cheered, danced and applauded, tearing off their Sodexo uniforms and throwing them away. According to their union, some of them will receive pay rises of up to \u00a310,000. \u201cToday marks a huge victory not just for these brave workers but for all outsourced workers in the NHS,\u201d said Petros Elia, a lead organiser at the United Voices of the World union, which called the strikes. \u201cOur members were told they would never win this fight, but with the full backing of UVW and mass picketing, blockades and occupations they\u2019ve won against all odds. This victory sets a historic precedent which we hope other workers will follow in demanding an end to outsourcing across the NHS.\u201d Workers at St Mary\u2019s \u2013 one of five hospitals controlled by Imperial Healthcare \u2013 staged their first strike on 28 October, walking out for three days. They followed that up with two further three-day strikes. The decision to bring them in-house was announced on the day they had threatened to begin an indefinite strike. The trust will initially directly employ support staff for a one-year trial period, after which it will \u201cdecide whether to continue to employ you directly \u2013 and bring you all up to full NHS (Agenda for Change) terms and conditions \u2013 or re-tender the contract with an improved specification.\u201d When the workers began their industrial action, 50 doctors at St Mary\u2019s wrote an open letter in support. One of the signatories, Tom Gardiner, said on Thursday: \u201c[It] was nothing compared to the efforts Sodexo staff and their union, United Voices of the World, went to, but I hope it encourages a sense of solidarity amongst NHS staff that we are one family. We stand together with a shared dream of an NHS that is both a world-class health service and a world-class employer.\u201d",

As an ex-editor of the Sunday Telegraph, Sands can\u2019t be branded \u201cBBC liberal elite\u201d, but she says: \u201cAs an outsider who comes from Conservative-minded newspapers, I would ask the government not to be too careless about the great idea behind the BBC. It was Michael Grade who said it exists to keep the media honest.\u201d Yes, the Today programmes often \u201cdrives people mad\u201d, says Sands. But \u201cthe Reithian principle still glows here and I feel very protective towards it\u201d. In an age of rage, the BBC is the most satisfying target: it\u2019s ours, we pay for it, so how dare it not tell my truth as I see it? Cue shoes flung at the radio and TV, ever since the referendum culture wars broke out. But right now the BBC is more dangerously friendless than it has ever been, as formerly sensible people lob grenades about hypothetical better ways to finance it. The latest is the usually clever national treasure Gary Lineker, undermining the national treasure that pays him top dollar, with his cavalier remarks that the licence fee should be voluntary. He admitted he didn\u2019t \u201cknow the logistics of how it would work\u201d, and that \u201cyou would lose some people\u201d. Scrambling for a solution that eluded myriad official reports, he added: \u201cAt the same time you\u2019d up the price a bit \u2026 If you put it up you could help older people, or those that can\u2019t afford it.\u201d That\u2019s about as useful an analysis as I would make on Match of the Day. It\u2019s time the BBC toughened up and demanded loyalty. All staff, especially top talent, should get a briefing on BBC facts of life. The licence fee costs under 44p a day per household, and its news is five times more trusted than its nearest competitor, ITV. Only 5% of the fee goes on administration; all the rest is spent on programmes. Eight out of 10 children watch its high-quality children\u2019s programming every week. Despite declining youth audiences, 89% of 16- to 34-year-olds look at the BBC online every month, as do nine out of 10 adults. Decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee would cost the corporation \u00a3200m. Free licences for the over-75s was a government obligation that George Osborne forced the BBC to take over out of political malice. Why leave the global news field to Russia\u2019s RT, to Al Jazeera \u2013 or worse, Fox News? The BBC\u2019s website and journalism are invaluable globally. On a bad electioneering day, Johnson threatened the BBC with abolition. Tory crocodile tears over the poor paying the licence fee are a shaming excuse from a government that deliberately leaves universal credit claimants to starve for five weeks. True, about 129,000 people are taken to court each year for not paying the fee, but only a tiny number are jailed \u2013 the wilful non-payers that judges find do have the means to pay it. The latest anti-BBC argument is that with binge-watching Netflix, Amazon and the rest, who needs an outdated national broadcaster? The answer is: because most people want British-produced programming. Because arts, music, movies, TV and video gaming are a rare booming British success and the BBC is the industry\u2019s springboard. The director general, Tony Hall, has walked the plank to save his crew, standing down sooner than intended so the current chairman of the board can select his successor before the government installs a hostile new chair. Now the BBC needs to grow a spine, fight back, stop its own people blurting out idiocies, and summon every friend to join a fight for its future. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

Some will celebrate, some will mourn, and others will just get on with their lives. The debate over whether we are in or out of the EU is over, but the debate over the kind of country we want to become has only just begun.</p> <p>As a country we\u2019ve been bitterly divided for three and a half years. Our politics has been frozen instead of tackling the real and deep-rooted problems we face.</p> <p>Now the leave-remain divide must end. Defining people by how they voted in June 2016 merely upholds a divide that we must overcome. There are no leavers or remainers any more. In 2024 there will be no leave or remain constituencies.</p> <p>This morning, in a typical classroom of 30 children, nine of them will be living in poverty. The morning after we\u2019ve left the EU, this will still be a reality for those children and their families. It will be the same in a year\u2019s time, and a year after that, unless we do something. The Conservatives are using the rhetoric of sovereignty as cover for the systematic disempowerment of all of us \u2013 ever lower wages, fewer workplace rights, weaker environmental protections. Inequality is not an act of God or nature \u2013 it is the result of political decisions, but we can change them if we choose to.</p> <p>Brexit will not put right the problems that led so many to vote leave. They are the result of years of failure, which we will put right only when we stop diagnosing and start treating. We can fix the broken political system that closed off investment and opportunity to whole regions and communities. We can take on the failed market economy that has pushed millions into poverty. We\u2019re not the luckless victims of the unimaginably wealthy. But power concedes nothing without a demand. We can make those demands, because we know what is needed to create the country we want to live in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We must raise our sights with a vision that matches the ambition of the British people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Seventy-five years ago Britain\u2019s great generation won the war, helping to free occupied Europe and liberate the concentration camps. They dreamed of a better future and they trusted Labour to \u201cwin the peace\u201d. That Labour generation rebuilt our country after the devastation of war and created a new settlement that lasted for generations. The NHS, the welfare state, decent affordable council homes, the promise of the new towns and civic pride and placing great industries and national infrastructure under democratic control: this was their achievement and it created a better life for millions. Our present Labour generation must summon that same spirit of courage and radicalism to \u201cwin the peace\u201d again after the divisions of Brexit.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear our politics is broken. This week I\u2019ve travelled the length and breadth of the UK talking about radical plans to devolve power away from Whitehall to the nations, regions, cities and towns. But this can\u2019t just be about transferring power from one set of politicians to another. I believe the fight for social, economic and climate justice can only be won if we put real power directly in the hands of the people.</p> <p>The market economy has failed and left millions in poverty. Under privatisation our probation service does not work, our railways do not work. I want new forms of common ownership that give frontline workers and the people who use our public services the power to influence how they are run. Real democratic accountability to the people, not statism.</p> <p>The green new deal must be hardwired into everything we do because we\u2019re in an epochal battle to save our planet. That means a major role for government in stronger regulation and redirecting investment. It also means empowering communities and activists to take action for themselves, like Labour-run Plymouth council has done by setting up dozens of community-owned sustainable energy co-ops.</p> <p>And I want to scrap the Tory welfare reforms that humiliate the very people they should be helping. I will end the cruelty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/22/disabled-benefits-claimants-test-atos\" title=\"\">work capability assessments</a> and halt the punitive sanctions that push people into destitution. Instead, people who are unemployed or living with disabilities will have a say over the kind of support they need. A real voice for everyone and the power to make it heard.</p> <p>Britain is an outward-looking country with a proud history of internationalism and co-operation. When Boris Johnson decided last week to turn away <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/22/brexit-johnson-condemned-for-dropping-pledge-to-replace-family-reunion-law\" title=\"\">child refugees</a>, he stood in the face of those values. Instead of this, the government ought to begin to heal divisions. We need long-overdue security for EU citizens. The government should give all 3 million EU nationals living in the UK full voting rights in future elections. The way they have been treated over the past three years is shameful. We were never just \u201ctolerating\u201d EU citizens living in this country \u2013 they are our neighbours, friends and families. To see their status in doubt devastates our sense not just of justice but also of fellowship.</p> <p>Basic social justice demands that we always stand up for citizens\u2019 rights and oppose trade deals that put our NHS or public services up for sale. We must make the case for a close economic relationship with the EU that protects jobs and allows us to cooperate in other fields.</p> <p>We\u2019ll shine a light on the Conservatives\u2019 failures and the damage they will inevitably do. We must raise our sights with a vision that matches the ambition of the British people. We must summon the courage that led Labour\u2019s post-war generation to remake this country with a radical vision of a fairer future.</p> <p>Labour has lost four elections in a row: we simply cannot afford to lose the next one. I will move our party on from the division of the past and remake our party as a democratic movement that faces outwards towards the country, not inwards on itself. Endless Conservative government is not inevitable. I\u2019m here to lead Labour to victory because I know that another future is possible if we come together and fight for it.</p> <p>\u2022 Keir Starmer is the MP for Holborn and St Pancras and a Labour party leadership candidate</p> <p>\u2022 Guardian Live Event, Labour leadership hustings: Join us in Manchester on Tuesday 25 February for a live debate with the four candidates vying for the Labour party leadership.

      "bodyText": "Tomorrow, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. Some will celebrate, some will mourn, and others will just get on with their lives. The debate over whether we are in or out of the EU is over, but the debate over the kind of country we want to become has only just begun. As a country we\u2019ve been bitterly divided for three and a half years. Our politics has been frozen instead of tackling the real and deep-rooted problems we face. Now the leave-remain divide must end. Defining people by how they voted in June 2016 merely upholds a divide that we must overcome. There are no leavers or remainers any more. In 2024 there will be no leave or remain constituencies. This morning, in a typical classroom of 30 children, nine of them will be living in poverty. The morning after we\u2019ve left the EU, this will still be a reality for those children and their families. It will be the same in a year\u2019s time, and a year after that, unless we do something. The Conservatives are using the rhetoric of sovereignty as cover for the systematic disempowerment of all of us \u2013 ever lower wages, fewer workplace rights, weaker environmental protections. Inequality is not an act of God or nature \u2013 it is the result of political decisions, but we can change them if we choose to. Brexit will not put right the problems that led so many to vote leave. They are the result of years of failure, which we will put right only when we stop diagnosing and start treating. We can fix the broken political system that closed off investment and opportunity to whole regions and communities. We can take on the failed market economy that has pushed millions into poverty. We\u2019re not the luckless victims of the unimaginably wealthy. But power concedes nothing without a demand. We can make those demands, because we know what is needed to create the country we want to live in. Seventy-five years ago Britain\u2019s great generation won the war, helping to free occupied Europe and liberate the concentration camps. They dreamed of a better future and they trusted Labour to \u201cwin the peace\u201d. That Labour generation rebuilt our country after the devastation of war and created a new settlement that lasted for generations. The NHS, the welfare state, decent affordable council homes, the promise of the new towns and civic pride and placing great industries and national infrastructure under democratic control: this was their achievement and it created a better life for millions. Our present Labour generation must summon that same spirit of courage and radicalism to \u201cwin the peace\u201d again after the divisions of Brexit. It\u2019s clear our politics is broken. This week I\u2019ve travelled the length and breadth of the UK talking about radical plans to devolve power away from Whitehall to the nations, regions, cities and towns. But this can\u2019t just be about transferring power from one set of politicians to another. I believe the fight for social, economic and climate justice can only be won if we put real power directly in the hands of the people. The market economy has failed and left millions in poverty. Under privatisation our probation service does not work, our railways do not work. I want new forms of common ownership that give frontline workers and the people who use our public services the power to influence how they are run. Real democratic accountability to the people, not statism. The green new deal must be hardwired into everything we do because we\u2019re in an epochal battle to save our planet. That means a major role for government in stronger regulation and redirecting investment. It also means empowering communities and activists to take action for themselves, like Labour-run Plymouth council has done by setting up dozens of community-owned sustainable energy co-ops. And I want to scrap the Tory welfare reforms that humiliate the very people they should be helping. I will end the cruelty of work capability assessments and halt the punitive sanctions that push people into destitution. Instead, people who are unemployed or living with disabilities will have a say over the kind of support they need. A real voice for everyone and the power to make it heard. Britain is an outward-looking country with a proud history of internationalism and co-operation. When Boris Johnson decided last week to turn away child refugees, he stood in the face of those values. Instead of this, the government ought to begin to heal divisions. We need long-overdue security for EU citizens. The government should give all 3 million EU nationals living in the UK full voting rights in future elections. The way they have been treated over the past three years is shameful. We were never just \u201ctolerating\u201d EU citizens living in this country \u2013 they are our neighbours, friends and families. To see their status in doubt devastates our sense not just of justice but also of fellowship. Basic social justice demands that we always stand up for citizens\u2019 rights and oppose trade deals that put our NHS or public services up for sale. We must make the case for a close economic relationship with the EU that protects jobs and allows us to cooperate in other fields. We\u2019ll shine a light on the Conservatives\u2019 failures and the damage they will inevitably do. We must raise our sights with a vision that matches the ambition of the British people. We must summon the courage that led Labour\u2019s post-war generation to remake this country with a radical vision of a fairer future. Labour has lost four elections in a row: we simply cannot afford to lose the next one. I will move our party on from the division of the past and remake our party as a democratic movement that faces outwards towards the country, not inwards on itself. Endless Conservative government is not inevitable. I\u2019m here to lead Labour to victory because I know that another future is possible if we come together and fight for it. \u2022 Keir Starmer is the MP for Holborn and St Pancras and a Labour party leadership candidate \u2022 Guardian Live Event, Labour leadership hustings: Join us in Manchester on Tuesday 25 February for a live debate with the four candidates vying for the Labour party leadership.

As Cheryl tells Larry, not without affection: \u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole.\u201d Would we have it any other way?",

Dame Vera Baird urged Geoffrey Cox QC to carry out an in-depth inquiry into the quality of CPS decision-making.</p> \n<p>Baird said no \u201cplausible explanation\u201d for why the CPS charge rate had dropped by 52.2% in two years had been offered.</p> \n<p>\u201cI travel nationwide to meet with victims of crime as well as meeting with victim care professionals. Everywhere I have gone in the past seven months and asked that question, the answer has been that the CPS has become risk averse. This includes all the criminal justice agencies,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Rape charges brought by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/12/prosecutions-in-england-and-wales-at-lowest-level-in-a-decade\">CPS fell 38% in 2018-19</a><strong>, </strong>even as the number of people reporting rape to the police<strong> </strong>sharply increased, figures in the CPS\u2019s annual violence against women and girls report showed.</p> \n<p>Charging volumes fell between October 2018 and June 2019, then increased by 4% between July and September that year, around the same time as an intention to bring a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/10/cps-faces-challenge-over-covert-policy-change-on-cases\">judicial review into the CPS\u2019s charging decisions</a> was announced.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2020-01-30T10:49:16/embed.html\" data-alt=\"graph of prosecutions and convictions\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2020-01-30T10:49:16/embed.html\">graph of prosecutions and convictions</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Although the numbers of rape cases referred to the CPS and completed prosecutions have continued to fall, the decline has slowed. The volume of cases referred by the police fell 14% in the year to September 2019. However, the decline was less steep than the 23% drop in 2018/19.

      "bodyText": "Rape victims are finding it increasingly difficult to access justice as police refer fewer cases to the Crown Prosecution Service and fewer allegations of rape are being prosecuted and convicted, according to new figures. The number of cases referred by the police for charging decisions fell by 32% in the year to September 2019, while prosecutions by the CPS fell 26% and convictions dropped 21%, according to Guardian analysis of quarterly CPS prosecution data. The victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales has called on the attorney general to reject a recent report by the CPS inspectorate (HMCPSI) that concluded the service was not to blame for a precipitous drop in rape charges. Dame Vera Baird urged Geoffrey Cox QC to carry out an in-depth inquiry into the quality of CPS decision-making. Baird said no \u201cplausible explanation\u201d for why the CPS charge rate had dropped by 52.2% in two years had been offered. \u201cI travel nationwide to meet with victims of crime as well as meeting with victim care professionals. Everywhere I have gone in the past seven months and asked that question, the answer has been that the CPS has become risk averse. This includes all the criminal justice agencies,\u201d she said. Rape charges brought by the CPS fell 38% in 2018-19, even as the number of people reporting rape to the police sharply increased, figures in the CPS\u2019s annual violence against women and girls report showed. Charging volumes fell between October 2018 and June 2019, then increased by 4% between July and September that year, around the same time as an intention to bring a judicial review into the CPS\u2019s charging decisions was announced. Although the numbers of rape cases referred to the CPS and completed prosecutions have continued to fall, the decline has slowed. The volume of cases referred by the police fell 14% in the year to September 2019. However, the decline was less steep than the 23% drop in 2018/19. The decline in the volume of completed prosecutions also eased. It fell by 23% in the year to September 2019, down from a decline of 33% in 2018/19. The director of public prosecutions, Max Hill, said it was right to scrutinise the performance of the criminal justice system. \u201cI share the deep public concern over the growing gap between the number of rapes being reported and the number of criminals being convicted of this sickening offence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe CPS is playing an active role in the cross-government review which is looking right across the system to understand the reasons for this. There is a clear need for end-to-end action to provide better support for victims of this devastating crime, and to bring more offenders to justice.\u201d The End Violence Against Women Coalition, Rape Crisis England and Wales, Women\u2019s Aid and other women\u2019s groups have also written to the attorney general saying the CPS inspectorate report failed to answer whether rape charging policy and practice at the CPS had become more risk averse. The coalition launched a legal challenge against the CPS in September last year. The report was commissioned as part of a major government review of the treatment of rape in the criminal justice system last year, commissioned following a collapse in the charging of rape cases, and fears that the CPS was dropping weaker cases. The HMCPSI report said there was no evidence the CPS had become more risk averse, but that the system \u2013 and in particular police-led investigations \u2013 were under-resourced to \u201cbreaking point\u201d. The victims\u2019 commissioner suggested HMCPSI had itself driven the CPS to improve conviction rates, \u201cpowerfully criticising areas where it was low\u201d, adding: \u201c[T]heir criticisms drove some areas to prosecute fewer cases.\u201d Her letter also stated that five of the report\u2019s inspectors were recent rape-specialised CPS lawyers; and that \u201cnobody else\u201d had been asked whether CPS had become risk averse, including police, victims\u2019 organisations, court barristers and judges, despite external views having been sought in previous reports. In their seven-page report to the attorney general, the victims\u2019 groups said it was \u201cunfathomable\u201d that the report had failed to properly investigate a 10% rise in the rape conviction rate, which the inspectorate itself had said was one factor that might show a more risk-averse approach. A spokeswoman for HMCPSI said it used recent front line prosecutors among its inspectors. \u201cWhere the subject matter is specialist - such a RASSO cases \u2013 we also use inspectors with relevant experience in that field.

In the past year it was abundantly clear that Sporting couldn\u2019t hold him much longer, and with his talent demanding a wider audience it would have been so even if they had been in better financial shape. So <em>Sportinguistas</em> savoured every moment over that period, from last April\u2019s stealthy rocket from range to oust Benfica from the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal in the semi-final to the deflected drive that put them on the road to victory in the final against Porto.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/dec/30/football-january-transfer-window-latest-deals-premier-league-europe\">Transfer window January 2020 \u2013&nbsp;every deal from Europe's top five leagues</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It has been a long goodbye; more so this month, with the protracted negotiations between Sporting and Manchester United \u2013 who completed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/30/transfer-news-bruno-fernandes-olivier-giroud-and-danny-rose-live\" title=\"\">\u00a346m, five-and-a-half-year deal on Thursday</a>, with the option of another year \u2013 leaving him in a strange sort of purgatory, having a farewell mini-tour in which each game looked like being his last. Fernandes\u2019s reign at the Alvalade \u2013 and it was just that \u2013 finally ended with Monday\u2019s narrow home win over Mar\u00edtimo. Cristian Borja scored the winner but this Sporting victory had their No 8\u2019s fingerprints all over it, as usual.</p> \n<p>Fernandes, 25, wore the armband, took the set pieces, drifted from centre to left to right as he made the passes, switched the play and pointed his teammates into position when he didn\u2019t have the ball. He almost left one final sumptuous memory for those fans who adored him, smacking the crossbar with one of his frequent, sweetly struck efforts from range.</p> \n<p>A player not getting that elite club move (and United remain exactly that in the eyes of the vast majority of players outside England) until their mid-20s arouses the suspicions of some, and recalls a different time, which encompassed cases such as those of Gheorghe Hagi and Hristo Stoichkov. Although it is unusual to see top talent waiting far beyond 21 to be flogged to a top club in football\u2019s modern economic climate, it does potentially offer Fernandes and United big advantages. He arrives with a much greater depth of experience than a player leaving Portugal for the Premier League would generally possess.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0ab09398-e60e-42df-b4a4-37da37dad90f\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Fernandes has rarely stood still. He has always had a strong sense of educating himself: after growing up on the outskirts of Porto and joining Boavista\u2019s academy, he took the big decision to leave for Italy, and Novara, when he was 17, at an age when most players in his position would be dreaming of a future at Porto, Benfica or Sporting.</p> \n<p>It explains much of Fernandes\u2019s wide palette now. His range of passing and ability to change the tempo are not typical of many goalscoring midfielders, but it is testament to the tactical schooling he received in Serie B and then in the top flight, with Udinese. Italy was also where he developed his steely side. Fernandes is hard working and difficult to bully, despite his relatively slight stature.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b07fd6b605c646928fcb363a28f82827ea1692a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b07fd6b605c646928fcb363a28f82827ea1692a/0_0_3263_2051/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruno Fernandes has an impressive range of passing and the ability to change the tempo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruno Fernandes has an impressive range of passing and the ability to change the tempo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel A Lopes/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After moving to Udine in 2013, he came under the influence of Antonio Di Natale, the club\u2019s greatest-ever player. \u201cBruno Fernandes irritates me,\u201d Di Natale once said, \u201cbecause he\u2019s young and out of the two of us he\u2019s the one with more technical quality.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s got two incredible feet but sometimes he just coasts through games.\u201d By the time he said that publicly, Di Natale had brought it up with Fernandes in private. He helped the young Portuguese work hard on his technique, and Fernandes acknowledges learning everything from striking the ball to better body shape from him.</p> \n<p>By the time Fernandes played an excellent season at Sampdoria in 2016-17, he had matured considerably and even though the \u20ac8.5 million Sporting paid for him after that was the second-highest fee in their history, it felt like a pretty safe bet.</p> \n<p>Let off the leash in the Sporting midfield with William Carvalho and Rodrigo Battaglia behind him, Fernandes came into his own in the attacking realm. He showcased his ability to score and assist, usually tucked in behind Bas Dost (the only player to cost Sporting more than Fernandes).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"757fddaca4456a142f2c58b96b2b0b4416c6274c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/757fddaca4456a142f2c58b96b2b0b4416c6274c/0_150_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruno Fernandes is welcomed by Manchester United\u2019s manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruno Fernandes is welcomed by Manchester United\u2019s manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester United via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That promising Sporting side fell apart when a group of ultras reacted furiously to their failure to reach the Champions League in 2018, invading the training base and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/15/sporting-lisbon-intruders-training-attack-players-staff\" title=\"\">attacking the players</a>. Fernandes was one of nine to unilaterally rescind their contracts but agreed to come back \u2013 and made a point of signing the same terms as before, keen not to profit from the majority of the fans\u2019 misery.

So Sportinguistas savoured every moment over that period, from last April\u2019s stealthy rocket from range to oust Benfica from the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal in the semi-final to the deflected drive that put them on the road to victory in the final against Porto. It has been a long goodbye; more so this month, with the protracted negotiations between Sporting and Manchester United \u2013 who completed the \u00a346m, five-and-a-half-year deal on Thursday, with the option of another year \u2013 leaving him in a strange sort of purgatory, having a farewell mini-tour in which each game looked like being his last. Fernandes\u2019s reign at the Alvalade \u2013 and it was just that \u2013 finally ended with Monday\u2019s narrow home win over Mar\u00edtimo. Cristian Borja scored the winner but this Sporting victory had their No 8\u2019s fingerprints all over it, as usual. Fernandes, 25, wore the armband, took the set pieces, drifted from centre to left to right as he made the passes, switched the play and pointed his teammates into position when he didn\u2019t have the ball. He almost left one final sumptuous memory for those fans who adored him, smacking the crossbar with one of his frequent, sweetly struck efforts from range. A player not getting that elite club move (and United remain exactly that in the eyes of the vast majority of players outside England) until their mid-20s arouses the suspicions of some, and recalls a different time, which encompassed cases such as those of Gheorghe Hagi and Hristo Stoichkov. Although it is unusual to see top talent waiting far beyond 21 to be flogged to a top club in football\u2019s modern economic climate, it does potentially offer Fernandes and United big advantages. He arrives with a much greater depth of experience than a player leaving Portugal for the Premier League would generally possess. Fernandes has rarely stood still. He has always had a strong sense of educating himself: after growing up on the outskirts of Porto and joining Boavista\u2019s academy, he took the big decision to leave for Italy, and Novara, when he was 17, at an age when most players in his position would be dreaming of a future at Porto, Benfica or Sporting. It explains much of Fernandes\u2019s wide palette now. His range of passing and ability to change the tempo are not typical of many goalscoring midfielders, but it is testament to the tactical schooling he received in Serie B and then in the top flight, with Udinese. Italy was also where he developed his steely side. Fernandes is hard working and difficult to bully, despite his relatively slight stature. After moving to Udine in 2013, he came under the influence of Antonio Di Natale, the club\u2019s greatest-ever player. \u201cBruno Fernandes irritates me,\u201d Di Natale once said, \u201cbecause he\u2019s young and out of the two of us he\u2019s the one with more technical quality. \u201cHe\u2019s got two incredible feet but sometimes he just coasts through games.\u201d By the time he said that publicly, Di Natale had brought it up with Fernandes in private. He helped the young Portuguese work hard on his technique, and Fernandes acknowledges learning everything from striking the ball to better body shape from him. By the time Fernandes played an excellent season at Sampdoria in 2016-17, he had matured considerably and even though the \u20ac8.5 million Sporting paid for him after that was the second-highest fee in their history, it felt like a pretty safe bet. Let off the leash in the Sporting midfield with William Carvalho and Rodrigo Battaglia behind him, Fernandes came into his own in the attacking realm. He showcased his ability to score and assist, usually tucked in behind Bas Dost (the only player to cost Sporting more than Fernandes). That promising Sporting side fell apart when a group of ultras reacted furiously to their failure to reach the Champions League in 2018, invading the training base and attacking the players. Fernandes was one of nine to unilaterally rescind their contracts but agreed to come back \u2013 and made a point of signing the same terms as before, keen not to profit from the majority of the fans\u2019 misery. Those supporters will miss him badly and if United get half of the productivity Sporting have been treated to, Fernandes will have gone a long way to remedying their midfield shortcomings.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell has blamed weaker oil and gas markets for delaying the world\u2019s largest share buyback scheme after its profits halved in the final quarter of the year. The Anglo-Dutch oil giant made a profit of $2.9bn (\u00a32.23bn) in the last three months of 2019, down from $5.7bn in the final quarter of 2018, when fears of a slowdown in the global economy caused oil prices to slump. For the year as a whole, profits fell 23% to $16.5bn, in a blow to the oil company\u2019s plans to complete a $25bn share buyback programme by the end of this year. The company blamed weaker oil and gas prices, which drifted down last year due to a well-stocked global market and concerns over worldwide economic growth that dampened demand for fossil fuels. Shell\u2019s worse than expected results confirmed investor fears that its plan to hand back $25bn to investors who had accepted shares in lieu of dividends in recent years would be delayed. The company\u2019s share price tumbled after the announcement by almost 4% to \u00a320.52, the lowest level in two and a half years. Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said the company faced \u201cchallenging macroeconomic conditions\u201d in its petroleum refining and chemicals business, \u201cas well as lower oil and gas prices\u201d last year. The global oil price averaged $64.36 a barrel last year, down sharply from an average of just over $71 a barrel in 2018. It was trading at $58.78 on Thursday. Shell was also hit by a slide in global gas prices from an average of $2.59 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) last year from $3.13 per MMBtu in 2018. Shell has said it needed oil prices to be above $65 a barrel in 2019 and $66 a barrel in 2020 to afford payments on its giant debt pile and the cost of buying back shares from its investors by the end of 2020. Oil industry analysts expect the year-end target for share buybacks to take a back seat to Shell\u2019s desire to pay off its debt. Shell has spent $15bn buying back shares so far and said it would buy back $1bn of shares over the next three months, down from $2.75bn in the preceding three months. \u201cIt now looks extremely challenging to complete the programme by year end,\u201d analysts Redburn said. Shell raised fears of a delay to the programme after warning investors late last year that it would take a $2.3bn hit in the fourth quarter due to a weaker global economy. Other major oil companies including Chevron, BP, Repsol and Equinor have all written off billions of dollars due to a slump in US shale prices.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following the blog today and all your comments. I\u2019m going to leave you with an afternoon summary: The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has indicated that chlorinated chicken will be part of the trade deal demanded by the US. Asked directly about the issue, he told LBC: \u201cThere will be real contentious issues around agriculture ...We need to make sure we don\u2019t use food safety as a ruse to try and protect a particular industry.\u201d The Communication Workers Union has endorsed Rebecca Long-Bailey as the next Labour leader. Long-Bailey had already received the endorsement of Unite and the Fire Brigades Union. The CWU also endorsed Angela Rayner as deputy leader but its general secretary, Kevin Ward, admitted the contest had not caught the imagination of the public and urged candidates to deliver \u201cmore dynamic and innovative campaigns\u201d. Preparations are underway for tomorrow\u2019s Brexit Day, when the UK will leave the EU at 11pm GMT. Union flags have been hung in Parliament Square. A small number of demonstrators have been demonstrating in the square about the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. I reported earlier that the Communication Workers Union has endorsed Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner for Labour party leader and deputy leader respectively. But the union\u2019s general secretary Dave Ward has been critical of the campaigning so far. He said: I am proud of the democratic process our union has conducted and it is clear to me that Rebecca Long-Bailey is the outstanding candidate for leader. It is also clear that the ability and experience of Angela Rayner make her the best candidate for deputy leader. What is also true is the contest so far has not caught the imagination of Labour members or the wider public. We call on all candidates to deliver more dynamic and innovative campaigns in the coming weeks and months. We\u2019ve had a glimpse into the preparations to mark Brexit in the UK. Here\u2019s a peek into what our European friends are doing: The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has been speaking to Iain Dale on LBC about post-Brexit trade talks and indicated that chlorinated chicken would be part of the deal demanded by the US. Asked by Dale directly about chlorinated chicken, he replied: There will be real contentious issues around agriculture ... I\u2019m sure the Ag[riculture] issues will be difficult. Our ask will be as it has been in the other negotiations. We need to be open and honest about competitiveness. We need to make sure we don\u2019t use food safety as a ruse to try and protect a particular industry. And then we need to have hard conversations about the places we have opportunities to give and take and then deliver on outcomes that benefit the agricultural sector - and most importantly consumers who are going to be the net beneficiaries of these really good deals. The new speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, has indicated that he would be happy for women MPs to breastfeed in the chamber, , the Independent reports. It says he was asked at a Westminster lunch whether he would allow feeding to take place in the Commons chamber and committee rooms and replied: My view is, it is up to the woman. I think it would be wrong for me as a man to dictate on that policy. If it happens, it happens. I wouldn\u2019t be upset by it. Female MPs have in the past demanded that new mothers be allowed to breastfeed in the House of Commons chamber to help get more women into parliament. The former speaker, Betty Boothroyd, said it would be allowed when workers at Tesco were allowed to do so. The Edinburgh West MP, Christine Jardine is to formally announce that she is standing for the Liberal Democrat leadership, the New Statesman reports. Jardine, the party\u2019s home affairs spokesperson, has represented her constituency since 2017. No one has formally announced their candidature yet but the frontrunners for the post are considered to be acting leader Ed Davey and Layla Moran. Other possible contenders include the Bath MP, Wera Hobhouse, and new MP Daisy Cooper, who took St Albans from the Conservatives at the general election. Union flags have been raised in Parliament Square ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Brexit celebrations. Not everyone is in the mood for celebrating though ... Want to own a piece of history? Nigel Farage has revealed one lucky connoisseur will have the chance to purchase the Mr Brexit portrait, he unveiled, with the help of comedy dinosaur, Jim Davidson, this afternoon (see 2.45pm update). From PA Media: The work created by artist Dan Llywelyn Hall was revealed at L\u2019Escargot Restaurant in London, less than 36 hours before the UK is set to leave the European Union. Mr Farage told the PA news agency: \u201cI will miss the drama. I will miss being the pantomime villain who gets up and 500 people boo. \u201cI won\u2019t miss Brussels because it\u2019s a dump. But I will miss Strasbourg which has got lots of family-run restaurants and yeah, of course, I am going to miss that. \u201cI suppose my level of notoriety is relatively high at the moment and I am hoping we can auction this off for a magnificent charity.\u201d The money raised by the painting will go towards veteran support charity Care After Combat. Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey has received the endorsement of the Communication Workers Union today. She had already secured her place on the ballot paper after endorsements from Unite and the Fire Brigades Union. Responding to the CWU\u2019s declaration of support, Long-Bailey said: I am honoured to be endorsed by one of the leading workplace trade unions in the UK, which has been solidly behind the Labour Party\u2019s transformative agenda. As leader of the Labour Party I will stand shoulder to shoulder with trade unions in disputes, and full solidarity to the CWU in their current dispute with Royal Mail. The decision was made by a forum of over 500 workplace representatives from the CWU, who backed Angela Rayner for deputy leader. The Times Scotland\u2019s political editor has been tweeting out results of their new YouGov polling, which shows a lead for Scottish independence of 51%. The majority in favour of independence will boost the SNP as Nicola Sturgeon prepares to set out her next steps towards another referendum tomorrow, after Boris Johnson refused her request for the powers to hold a legal referendum earlier this month. While the poll shows 2014 no voters and 2016 Remain voters converting to the \u2018yes\u2019 cause, interestingly there is not a majority in favour of a second referendum this year, which Sturgeon is still pushing for. Indeed, yesterday the Scottish parliament\u2019s pro-independence majority of SNP and Greens voted through Sturgeon\u2019s motion in favour of a 2020 referendum. Finally, the challenge for a future yes campaign is the same as always: the economy. According to this poll, 42% of Scots think the country would be worse off economically with independence, and 35% think it would be better off. It is still less than 33 hours till Brexit but the celebrations have already begun. For younger readers who may be unfamiliar with Jim Davidson, a list of his most controversial moments by the Telegraph includes creating Chalky White, a stereotype of West Indians, as part of his stand-up routine and his single, White Christmas, performed in a Jamaican accent. Here is video of the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, saying the US intends to put Britain \u201cat the front of the line\u201d for a trade deal post-Brexit. Here are the morning\u2019s main developments: The government has refused to confirm or deny that Boris Johnson is planning to give the go ahead for HS2, after the chancellor, Sajid Javid, gave the controversial high speed rail project is backing. A spokesperson for the PM refused to preempt the decision while the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said an announcement would be made next month. Javid, Johnson and Shapps are meeting today to discuss HS2 amid opposition from some backbenchers. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has reiterated that the UK will be \u201cat the front of the line\u201d when it comes to negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal. At a Policy Exchange event with the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, both Raab and Pompeo insisted a full trade deal could be finalised prior to November\u2019s US presidential election. They generally presented a united front, glossing over disagreements on Iran, Huawei and the Harry Dunn case. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said that a charter flight to evacuate Britons from areas affected by the coronavirus will depart Wuhan at 5am tomorrow. Earlier, he said the foreign office had been working flat out to arrange their safe transport. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.75%. It took the decision amid early signs of a rebound in the economy following Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory and despite warning that Brexit would hold back growth in the long run. The acting Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, has used a speech in Manchester to call for unity among progressives, including on fighting against a no-deal Brexit. He said there should be an end to discord between remain and leave voters but that progressives needed to band together to fight inequality under Boris Johnson\u2019s government and deliver a soft Brexit. Self-harm in prisons has hit a new high, with more than 60,000 incidents in the 12 months to September 2019, Ministry of Justice figures released today show. The number of inmates self-harming increased by 2% in the latest 12 months, to the highest recorded figure of 12,740 individuals. The number of self-harm incidents per individual rose by 14% from 4.2 to 4.8. Here are some more opinions from Westminster on HS2 - against and for respectively: Dominic Raab said during the Policy Exchange event that hopefully British citizens would be evacuated \u201clater this evening\u201d. However, in a statement, he has just confirmed that the flight will be tomorrow morning: We are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 5am local time on Friday 31 January. The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. Our embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need. That was a display from Dominic Raab and Mike Pompeo of US-UK unity ahead of Brexit, with disagreements over Huawei, Iran and the Harry Dunn depicted as blips that could be overcome. Instead, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, reiterated that the UK would be \u201cat the front of the line\u201d when it comes to a trade deal, with both parties concurring that this was achievable before November\u2019s presidential election in November. Pompeo said it could deliver \u201cenormous benefits\u201d for both the US and the UK now that the latter was not constrained by the EU. There is a follow up question on Harry Dunn from CBS. Raab says he had a \u201cgood conversation with Mike\u201d about it. What changes to the special relationship can be expected post-Brexit, someone else asks. t Pompeo says he is optimistic because there were things the UK were required to do as being part of the EU which they no longer have to do. That is fantastic for the US and UK, says the secretary of state. He says there will be \u201cenormous benefits\u201d that accrue to both organisations. Lucy Fisher from the Times says a full trade deal is unlikely before the November US election. Will a sectorial deal be struck instead and if so will it be for the financial sector? Raab says a deal can be done and we should have a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude. Pompeo simply says \u201cI concur\u201d. Jason Groves from the Mail asks if there could be a barter - Prince Andrew for Anne Sacoolas. Pompeo says both situations will be resolved. Raab says there is no barter. And that\u2019s the conclusion of the event. James Landale from the BBC asks Pompeo if the US will make good on its pledge to restrict intelligence-sharing in response to the Huawei decision. Pompeo says the security relationship is deep and will remain but the US will not permit its citizens information to go across a network it is unhappy about. Landale also asked how the special relationship fits in with the case of Harry Dunn and the refusal to extradite Anne Saccolas, who fled the country after being involved in the incident which killed the teenager. Pompeo offers some platitudes and says they are working to resolve the situation. Landale also asks Raab about getting UK citizens out of Wuhan, China. Raab says ideally citizens will be evacuated tonight and insists the UK government is doing its best. On Huawei, Pompeo says permitting a Chinese company tied to the Chinese communist party to access private information creates risk. He says Chinese companies have obligations to the party and party members are investors in Huawei. This is about a model that the Chinese communist party has ...it\u2019s not about a technical back door, they have the front door. He says he is confident the UK and US will find a way to resolve the situation and be able to work together. Raab says the decision protects security and the relationship with security allies, \u201cthe five eyes\u201d. Both Raab and Pompeo say there need to be more players in 5G. Breaking away briefly from the Raab-Pompeo show, the Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged at 0.75% (seven members to two voted to maintain the status quo). It slashed its slashed its growth forecasts to 0.8% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.7% in 2022. You can read more on our business blog. Pompeo says the UK should have a close relationship with the EU and Nato, although there will inevitably be disagreements with the EU, which brings a smile to Raab\u2019s face. The special relationship means shared values and being a force for good around the world, says the US secretary of state. Talking about trade arrangements with the US, Raab says he doesn\u2019t want to pre-empt negotiations. Pompeo says it is about reducing friction between the countries, creating ease of travel, ease of each others citizens attending each others schools, ease of travel of capital. On Iran, Pompeo says pressure on Iran\u2019s economy has reduced its capability. Raab says there is scope for rapprochement with Iran but it must be prepared to take the necessary steps. Asked about the Trump deal on Iran, Raab says: I don\u2019t think there is a huge difference between Europeans and Americans ...the question is whether there is political will in Iran. Pompeo says you can only have conversations/disagreements about the likes of Huawei with countries you have a \u201cdeep relationship\u201d with, so it won\u2019t fracture the friendship. Raab concurs: Good friends don\u2019t always agree on everything. He says there is a sea of things the countries agree on. Pompeo says there is a \u201ctremendous value\u201d to the US from the relationship with the UK. He says: The Chinese communist party represents the central threat of our times. The US secretary of state talks about the importance of western democratic values, which he contrasts to those of the Chinese government. The Pompeo-Raab conversation has begun (refresh the page to see the livestream embedded at the top of the page). The US secretary of state says he wanted to be here on the date that Brexit takes place but Raab said Brexit day would be \u201chectic\u201d so he\u2019s here the day before. Raab says Brexit was about pursuing the UK self-interest and self-belief and it\u2019s great to have the US recognising and supporting that. Having the US say it\u2019s all fine by us ...it\u2019s great. Pompeo says: We intend to put the UK at the front of the line [for a trade deal]. He contrasts this with the Obama administration which he says would have put the UK at the back of the queue. The government has said it is working \u201curgently\u201d with Chinese authorities to ensure citizens in Wuhan can return on a flight \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: We are doing everything we can to get British people in Wuhan safely back to the UK. A number of countries\u2019 flights have been unable to take off as planned including the British repatriation from Wuhan. We are working urgently with the Chinese authorities to ensure that the flight can take off as soon as possible. The flight is planned to touch down at a military base in the UK before passengers are taken to an NHS facility to be quarantined. But the plane has been prevented from leaving China because \u201cwe haven\u2019t got the necessary clearances and we are working with the Chinese authorities on securing those\u201d, the spokesman said. Number 10 is not giving away any more than Grant Shapps did in transport questions this morning regarding whether HS2 will go ahead, despite the chancellor\u2019s backing for the high speed rail project. Coming up shortly (scheduled for 11.30am) is the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in conversation with the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in a Policy Exchange event. We will be embedding a livestream at the top of the blog and I will also be listening in. Here are a couple of HS2-themed clips from transport questions in the House of Commons this morning. The Lib Dems\u2019 acting leader, Ed Davey, has been making a speech in Manchester this morning. He called for the end of the discord between remain voters and leave voters and for unity among progressives (an olive branch to Labour depending on who is elected leader?) to tackle inequality. He said that the campaign to stop Brexit is over but the Lid Dems will always be a pro-European, internationalist party. He said: Through pain comes wisdom, and the immense pain we feel tomorrow should at least remind us of one important truth: That which unites us is far greater than that which divides us. That is true whether \u201cus\u201d is the United Kingdom, Europe or humankind. And it is also true of \u2018us\u2019 as progressives. We cannot let small disagreements or tribal labels stand in the way of our common values: compassion, fairness, equality. internationalism. He added: We must no longer be a country that is divided by leave and remain, but that means we must heal our country\u2019s other divisions too. For if Brexit has taught us anything, it is that there are many serious divisions to fix. The UK is divided by inequality. Inequality of opportunity, of wealth, of power. Inequality of hope. And the forces of English and Scottish nationalism unleashed by these divisions, cannot bring our fractured country together: by their very nature they seek to divide our family of nations even further. Only progressive parties like the Liberal Democrats will fight to disperse power and wealth across our country, and to create opportunity for every child, in every community. He promised to fight the Conservatives every step of the way. When it comes to tough choices on taxation and spending, this Conservative prime minister looks to protect the wealthy than the vulnerable. Boris Johnson\u2019s idea of reforming democracy is to attack the courts and make it more difficult for people to vote. Boris Johnson\u2019s idea of uniting the country has been to tell half of the country to give up their beliefs. Boris Johnson\u2019s idea of a new role for Britain in the world, is to ring Donald Trump for his orders. We cannot leave Britain\u2019s future in the hands of a Prime Minister who only cares about himself, and has never once put the national interest ahead of his own career. We must stand together as progressives against these forces that have done so much harm, to prevent them doing even more. He said that the fight for a progressive Britain would begin with the campaign to prevent a no-deal Brexit at the end of the year. Moving away from HS2 for a minute, the Mirror had a story in today\u2019s paper about a confidential internal Labour report which found: The party lost 2.6m voters between the 2017 and 2019 general elections. Around 750,000 former supporters switched to the Lib Dems and a similar number went to pro-Brexit parties, primarily the Tories. A further 1.2m Labour voters from 2017 decided not to cast a vote. Of the 20 constituencies where Labour had the most \u201ccontacts\u201d with voters, it only gained one - Putney. Labour lost most support to the Tories among low-income older voters and less well-off families,. Toby Perkins, Labour MP for Chesterfield, urged Grant Shapps to commit to HS2 and \u201cget control\u201d of some MPs \u201cconstantly undermining\u201d it. Shapps said that MPs were quite entitled to debate the merits of the project under a democracy, adding: It is the case that this is the biggest infrastructure decision this country has ever made, the biggest in Europe, and it\u2019s quite right that it\u2019s properly and carefully considered ...the good news is he won\u2019t have to wait too long. Here is PA Media on the prison violence statistics, published this morning: Incidents of self-harm in prison have reached a record high, official figures show. There were 61,461 incidents in the 12 months to September, up 16% from the previous period, according to data released by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). But the number of deaths behind bars have fallen by 8% in the 12 months to December, down to 300 from 325 in the previous period. Of these, 84 were self-inflicted, a 9% drop from 92 in the previous period. The number of assaults has also fallen slightly, down 2% in the year to September with 33,222. Attacks on staff remained at the same level as the previous period, with 10,059 assaults recorded, according to the data. Philip Davies called HS2 \u201ca catastrophic waste of money\u201d at transport questions in the House of Commons. He urged the government to prioritise \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d rail, increasing connections between northern cities, including those in his West Yorkshire constituency. In response, transport minister Chris Heaton-Harris said that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail \u201care not either or, they are additional investments.\u201d Seven minutes into transport questions, the first question on HS2 was posed to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. Eddie Hughes, Conservative MP for Walsall North, asked him whether he would join the chancellor in backing HS2 ahead of their meeting with the prime minister today. Shapps wasn\u2019t prepared to give anything away. He replied: He [Hughes] won\u2019t have to wait very long and we will have an announcement on this next month. Greg Smith, the newly elected Conservative MP for Buckingham, warned this morning that he will vote against HS2 in parliament if the government presses ahead with the project. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I was very clear in the general election campaign that I am opposed to HS2. It is absolutely wrong for my constituency and I believe it to be wrong for the country as well. I made very clear commitments in the general election that, come what may, I will oppose HS2. Smith said his view was shared by many other MPs, including newly-elected Tories in northern constituencies. We are not against infrastructure. We are just saying that HS2 is the wrong project, it goes along the wrong route at a cost that, frankly, the nation can\u2019t afford. What the HS2 review group - which has many new northern Conservative MPs on it - is saying is that, instead of HS2, we can do great things that will really improve people\u2019s lives - local commuter routes in our Midlands and northern towns and cities - big improvements to those. Good morning. This is Haroon Siddique standing in for Andrew Sparrow. It\u2019s a big day for the HS2 rail project today as the chancellor, Sajid Javid, is expected to give his backing to the controversial scheme despite concerns about its spiralling costs, environmental impact and opposition from many Tory MPs, not to mention Dominic Cummings. A final decision is not expected to be made until next week but Javid will meet Boris Johnson and the transport secretary, Grant Sharps, to discuss HS2 today. Given, he holds the purse strings, the chancellor\u2019s support is key and most papers report this morning that it paves the way for the project to be completed. Also coming up today: 9.30am - Shapps faces an hour of transport questions in parliament, where HS2 is likely to dominate. 9.30am - Statistics on prison violence and youth justice will be published by the ministry of justice at 9:30 a.m. 11.30am - The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo will be in conversation with the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab at Policy Exchange event. 12pm - The Bank of England will announce whether interest rates are to be cut for the first time since 2016, ahead of the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union tomorrow. The government will announce that minimum funding levels for schools are to be enshrined in law. Every secondary school in England will receive at least \u00a35,000 per pupil next year, while primary schools will receive \u00a33,750 per pupil. After he planned airlift of UK nationals out of parts of China affected by coronavirus was cancelled at the last minute, the government is likely to face pressure about the effectiveness of its response. Stay tuned for all the political developments today. If you want to catch my attention, the best way is via Twitter @Haroon_Siddique.",

It remains extremely unclear why \u2013 certainly to viewers, who watch the event in smaller and smaller numbers each year. Last year, the Oscars telecast <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/oscars-ratings-2019-1203144417/\" title=\"\">peaked at 29.6 million US viewers</a>, although the zombie statistic that it is watched by \u201ca billion people around the globe\u201d staggers on. Indeed, it presumably accounts for all the winners\u2019 attempts to contemplate Big Themes in their humble speeches, which serve as thankful outreach to all the citizens of the world who make them possible. The Congolese children, for instance, who watch the Oscars to unwind after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths\" title=\"\">a day down the cobalt mine</a> surfacing the materials necessary for people to make memes on their phones about the red-carpet outfits. As a previous Oscars slogan ran: we ALL dream in gold.</p> <p>So, yes, the main reason the Academy has never really \u201cgot\u201d comedy down the years is that it simply can\u2019t afford to. Its vulnerability is just too great. It is much less personally exposing to stick to a metric where massive weight gain or weight loss is regarded as the highest form of acting. After all, this is an awards ceremony that wanks on annually about being audited by a top international accountancy firm, but which, in 2017, still somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/27/anatomy-of-an-oscars-fiasco-how-la-la-land-was-mistakenly-announced-as-best-picture\" title=\"\">contrived to award its biggest prize to the wrong movie</a> in an envelope snafu that even Shirley MacLaine was still \u201cprocessing the horror of\u201d three weeks later. Shirley\u2019s processed about 47 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/09/biography.features1\" title=\"\">past lives</a>, to put that into the terrifying perspective it deserves.</p> <p>Anyway, here we all are, just over a week out from the next Oscars ceremony, with the Academy digging deep to make the usual rows about snubbing black nominees look gorgeous. And, arguably, it has alighted on the perfect way to defuse yet another \u201cOscars so white\u201d row. Say hello to what we might call \u201cOscars so green\u201d, a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/09/vegan-food-recycled-tuxedos-and-billions-of-tonnes-of-co2-can-hollywood-ever-go-green\" title=\"\">toweringly minuscule commitments to an embattled planet</a> \u2013 the same planet that at least 50% of the industry\u2019s time is effectively devoted to destroying in the cause of finding work for Ben Affleck or whoever. Or, as its much-heralded press release put it this week: \u201cThe Academy is an organisation of storytellers from around the world, and we owe our global membership a commitment to supporting the planet.\u201d</p> <p>To quote Steven Seagal in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105690/\" title=\"\">Under Siege</a> (1992, snubbed in all categories bar sound): what is this babbling bullshit? You don\u2019t even think you owe your global membership the right to have their movies considered anywhere else than the ghetto of \u201cbest international feature film\u201d. It feels fairly unlikely that you\u2019re going to care about drowning their countries in order to produce enough energy to power the essential work of rebooting the Transformers franchise a few more times.</p> <p>But even if we take the Academy at its own extraordinarily moving word, you might be wondering how this commitment to supporting the planet will manifest itself. In which case, let me tell you that the Academy was thrilled to clarify <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/oscars-plant-menu-1203482197/\" title=\"\">by announcing</a> that the Oscar nominees luncheon would be serving AN ENTIRELY PLANT-BASED MENU. I know! Furthermore, if a furthermore there need be, the Governors Ball afterparty would be offering a 70% plant-based menu, having served a 50% plant-based menu since 2013.</p> <p>So have we finally found it? Have we found the smallest commitment to doing anything other than jack shit that an organisation will publicly congratulate itself for? Did the Academy literally press release the fact that a single Oscar afterparty will be trimming the volume of meat that is served to people who are largely contractually mandated not to eat anything other than herb garnishes? It would seem so.</p> <p>Ideally, then, the notion of meat-based starters will be commemorated in the In Memoriam section of the interminable Oscars show, with a photo of Doris Day fading graciously into a picture of a doubtless witty take on lobster remoulade. We have lost so much. So much.</p> <p>Needless to say, this quarter-arsed gesture has been reported with admiration bordering on the clinical. Many publications have taken the time to point out that the Academy\u2019s plan is likely to have been inspired by the Golden Globes\u2019 own last-minute decision to go vegan earlier this month. That menu, we learn in remorseless detail, \u201coriginally featured a Chilean sea bass dish, but was changed to king oyster mushroom \u2018scallops\u2019 with wild mushroom risotto and vegetables\u201d. Right. Is there an awful lot more of this? Oh, I see. There is. \u201cGlobes offerings also included a chilled golden beet soup appetizer,\u201d one report elaborated. \u201cA so-called \u2018vegan opera dome\u2019 by pastry chef Thomas Henzi was served as dessert \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Please don\u2019t regard this as a so-called opera dome of bullshit. It\u2019s quite the gesture-politics trend. In fact, the leading talent agency WME announced that its own pre-Oscars party would be plant-based in honour of its client Joaquin Phoenix. He stars in Joker, whose commitment to recycling other directors\u2019 work was almost total.</p> <p>Indeed, Phoenix garnered headlines a few weeks ago when it was proudly revealed that he would be wearing the same dinner jacket for the whole awards season, a move that hugely endeared him to Stella McCartney, by chance also the designer of that dinner jacket. \u201cThis man is a winner,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stellamccartney/status/1214123180408918016?lang=en\" title=\"\">explained McCartney on Twitter</a>. \u201cWearing custom Stella because he chooses to make choices for the future of the planet. He has also chosen to wear the same Tux for the entire award season to reduce waste. I am proud to join forces with you.\u201d When you say \u201cjoin forces\u201d \u2026 are there other forces? Stronger forces? Better strategised forces? I just feel like we need better forces on this stuff than people who capitalise Tux, or commit to wearing couture menswear more than once.</p> <p>It certainly wasn\u2019t clear from Phoenix\u2019s Globes acceptance speech, which began: \u201cFirst, I would like to thank the Hollywood foreign press for recognising and acknowledging the link between animal agriculture and climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bold move, making tonight plant-based.\u201d It\u2019s not the boldest, all told, but anyway. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to take private jets to Palm Springs sometimes,\u201d continued Phoenix, \u201cor back, please.\u201d Coupled with the historic announcement that the Golden Globes was going to reuse its red carpet rather than bin it as usual, this was a huge credit to an industry where, at any given moment, scores of luxury vehicles are ticking into the fourth hour of waiting with the air con on because a pretend superhero can\u2019t get out of bed that day.</p> <p>So do let\u2019s hope the Oscars goes several steps further and serves up another Hollywood night to make u think. Even if what you increasingly end up thinking is: I refuse to believe these people aren\u2019t actually double agents for Exxon.</p>",

There is. \u201cGlobes offerings also included a chilled golden beet soup appetizer,\u201d one report elaborated. \u201cA so-called \u2018vegan opera dome\u2019 by pastry chef Thomas Henzi was served as dessert \u2026\u201d Please don\u2019t regard this as a so-called opera dome of bullshit. It\u2019s quite the gesture-politics trend. In fact, the leading talent agency WME announced that its own pre-Oscars party would be plant-based in honour of its client Joaquin Phoenix. He stars in Joker, whose commitment to recycling other directors\u2019 work was almost total. Indeed, Phoenix garnered headlines a few weeks ago when it was proudly revealed that he would be wearing the same dinner jacket for the whole awards season, a move that hugely endeared him to Stella McCartney, by chance also the designer of that dinner jacket. \u201cThis man is a winner,\u201d explained McCartney on Twitter. \u201cWearing custom Stella because he chooses to make choices for the future of the planet. He has also chosen to wear the same Tux for the entire award season to reduce waste. I am proud to join forces with you.\u201d When you say \u201cjoin forces\u201d \u2026 are there other forces? Stronger forces? Better strategised forces? I just feel like we need better forces on this stuff than people who capitalise Tux, or commit to wearing couture menswear more than once. It certainly wasn\u2019t clear from Phoenix\u2019s Globes acceptance speech, which began: \u201cFirst, I would like to thank the Hollywood foreign press for recognising and acknowledging the link between animal agriculture and climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bold move, making tonight plant-based.\u201d It\u2019s not the boldest, all told, but anyway. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to take private jets to Palm Springs sometimes,\u201d continued Phoenix, \u201cor back, please.\u201d Coupled with the historic announcement that the Golden Globes was going to reuse its red carpet rather than bin it as usual, this was a huge credit to an industry where, at any given moment, scores of luxury vehicles are ticking into the fourth hour of waiting with the air con on because a pretend superhero can\u2019t get out of bed that day. So do let\u2019s hope the Oscars goes several steps further and serves up another Hollywood night to make u think. Even if what you increasingly end up thinking is: I refuse to believe these people aren\u2019t actually double agents for Exxon.",

The groundbreaking law, which the French government claims is a world first, also covers electrical items, hygiene products and cosmetics, which must now be reused, redistributed or recycled. It also phases out the use of paper till receipts and single-use plastics and encourages pharmacies to sell certain medications in individual doses. The bill, containing 130 articles, was finally adopted after the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale \u2013 which passed it nine days ago \u2013 and the upper house, the S\u00e9nat, reached an agreement. France already has a law banning supermarkets from throwing away unsold food and forcing them to hand the goods to charities. The anti-waste and circular economy bill requires producers, importers and distributors, including online firms such as Amazon, to donate unsold non-food goods except those that pose a health or safety risk. It aims for all plastic to be recyclable by 2025 and a 50% reduction in the use of single-use plastic bottles in the next decade. Fast-food restaurants and takeaways will have to stop using plastic containers by 2023 at the latest. Brune Poirson, a junior environment minister, promised legislation to tackle waste last year after French TV broadcast a documentary showing containers of unsold and returned products at an Amazon warehouse being sent to be destroyed. Prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe\u2019s office said more than \u20ac650m worth of new consumer products were destroyed or thrown away every year in France. In a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d clause, companies will be required to finance the destruction of waste that they create. This requires tobacco manufacturers to pay for the disposal of cigarette butts from next year, and affects those making toys, sports goods, DIY and garden products, and building materials from 2021. Arash Derambarsh, a French politician behind the 2016 law forcing supermarkets to donate usable expired food instead of dumping or destroying it, said the new law was \u201cfull of good intentions \u2026 but half-hearted\u201d. \u201cToday, thanks to our food-waste law any supermarket that refuses to donate food can be fined \u20ac10,000.

      "bodyText": "Finally, the FTSE 100 has ended another bad day deep in the red. The blue-chip index shed 101 points, or 1.36%, to end at 7,381. Coronavirus worries were a key factor, while the stronger pound hurt exporters. Greg Daco of Oxford Economics has spotted that a sharp slide in US imports actually flattered today\u2019s growth figures: Time for a summary: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates on hold, at Mark Carney\u2019s final meeting as governor. Only two policymakers voted for a cut, surprising the City which expected a closer results. The Bank also cut its growth forecasts, and downgraded its expectations for productivity growth, in a sign that the UK economy has suffered from Brexit uncertainty. Carney, who said he had no regrets about his time at the Bank, told reporters that Britain faces a decade of perhaps profound change. He also said the Bank was watching the coronavirus crisis slowly, given its possible impact on the global economy. Fabrice Montagne, chief UK economist at Barclays says Carney may have left his successor, Andrew Bailey, a conundrum: \u201cThere\u2019s a real risk that falling oil prices push inflation below 1% and the new governor will then have to explain why the BoE is missing its inflation target. Against that backdrop, a rate cut today would have made it easier for incoming governor Bailey to ease into office.\u201d In other news... The US economy has fallen short of Donald Trump\u2019s promises, again. US GDP only expanded by 2.3% during 2019, below the White House\u2019s goal of 3%. In the fourth quarter alone, the US grew by 2.1% with consumer spending slowing and business investment dropping again. Global stock markets have been hit by renewed worries about the coronavirus, as firms continue to shutter shops and factories. In the last few minutes, BMW has announced its factories will stay closed until 8 February. Carnival, the cruise operator, fell 8% at one stage following reports that two passengers are in isolation on a ship on the coast of Italy - leaving 6,000 people trapped on board. The US stock market has opened in the red, following the losses in Europe already today. The latest jump in the death toll from coronavirus is alarming investors, as it could mean the global economy is more badly affected (quite apart from the human suffering). The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 0.2%, with the broader S&amp;P 500 down 0.4%. Facebook is among the big fallers, down almost 6% after posting slowing revenue growth last night. Eurpoe is taking a bigger hit than Wall Street, with the FTSE 100 down almost one hundred points (-1.3%), Germany\u2019s DAX down 1% and France\u2019s CAC losing 1.3%. Chris Towner, director at risk management firm JCRA, says the crisis is dampening hopes for an economic revival this year: \u201cThe acceleration in the spread of the virus across the globe along with the increase in the number of deaths, continues to alarm financial markets. Stock markets continue to trade under pressure and so is the Chinese renminbi. The offshore traded Chinese currency has weakened to test the psychological \u2018seven\u2019 level against the US dollar. To put this into perspective, since the coronavirus hit just ten days ago the Chinese currency has weakened just over 2%. Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, fears that America\u2019s economy will keep slowing in 2020, having only managed 2.3% growth in 2019. Economists are a little disappointed that America\u2019s growth rate slowed last year - here\u2019s some snap reaction: Newsflash: America\u2019s economy has posted its weakest growth since Donald Trump became president. US GDP only grew by 2.3% during 2019, the Commerce Department says, shy of the 3% growth which Trump targeted. That\u2019s down from 2.9% in 2018. Such a lacklustre performance grates when you remember Trump\u2019s bragging at Davos last week, about America enjoying \u201can economic boom - the likes of which the world has never see before\u201d. The figures also show that in the fourth-quarter, US GDP only expanded by an annualised rate of 2.1%. Business investment fell during the quarter (by -1.5%), while consumer spending growth slowed to +1.8% (from 3.2%) Mark Carney\u2019s final press conference didn\u2019t contain many fireworks. Instead, today will be remembered for the uncertainty and trepidation in the City about whether the Bank would cut rates or not. That\u2019s not the sign of a smooth-running central bank -- policymakers shouldn\u2019t create such confusion ahead of a monetary policy meeting, especially one the day before Brexit. Its no way to shake off Carney\u2019s reputation as an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019. As Nick Wall, co-manager of the Merian Strategic Absolute Return Bond Fund at Merian Global Investors, puts it: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney brought an end to his reign by holding interest rates at 0.75% after business surveys picked up post-election. To his critics, he proved unreliable to the end, but in our view this seems like the correct decision, particularly with the upcoming spending review. \u201cHistorians perusing the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE\u2019s) base rate during Carney\u2019s tenure as governor may conclude it was a dull affair. His Monetary Policy Committee tweaked interest rates three times over the course of 69 meetings. Traditional measures of central bank activity, however, as Carney acknowledged in his final speech this month, have fallen by the wayside as conventional policy tools find it harder to boost inflation than to contain it. Mark Carney then wraps up his final press conference as Bank of England governor, saying the economics press pack that he\u2019s \u201cappreciated your challenge and insights\u201d over the years (he\u2019s hidden that appreciation well at times...) He tells the reporters they have a tough job, in a 24-hour news cycle, without unlimited budgets (true, that....) You come here, we lock you in our vault, we give you bacon sandwiches of uncertain vintage... ...No you don\u2019t! the press mutter, pointing out that they might get biscuits on a good day. But putting the butties aside, Carney seems genuinely sincere about the challenge of covering complicated economic issues for the UK audience. And with that, he\u2019s off. Q: What impact have your new climate stress tests had? Carney says that the feedback is ongoing, and that major banks and insurers are \u201cvery engaged\u201d with these new stress tests. The tests aren\u2019t meant to catch firms out, he adds, they\u2019re meant to help set strategy to a low-carbon economy. Q: When you say it\u2019s \u2018so far, good enough\u2019, do you mean that any weak data could prompt a rate cut? That\u2019s a question for the March meeting of the MPC, Carney replies -- when he\u2019ll have left. The MPC will also look at Sajid Javid\u2019s budget, and any progress on Brexit negotiations, when setting interest rates. Also on Brexit, Carney warns that European companies and pension funds would face higher costs if UK-based financial companies lose their equivalence status with the EU. In other words, Europe could suffer if there is too much divergence between London\u2019s financial centre and the EU after Brexit. Q: What impact will Brexit have on UK productivity? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says the Bank now doesn\u2019t expect much of a pick-up in productivity growth - it\u2019s now forecast to rise by just 0.5% per year (compared to 1.5% to 2% in the past). Q: What has been your biggest regret, or monetary policy mistake, of your time at the Bank, asks my colleague Larry Elliott? Carney has a think.... and concludes he doesn\u2019t have any regrets on monetary policy. Q: Is the coronavirus the biggest risk to the global economy? Mark Carney replies that the virus is affecting a number of people. We should acknowledge the difficulties and the pain of those directly affected, and the anxiety of hundreds of millions of people whose lives are disrupted, he points out. The crisis is taking place in the world\u2019s largest economy, and spreading beyond it. But it\u2019s very early days, the governor continues: We, like others, are monitoring this quite closely, as you\u2019d expect.\u201d Carney won\u2019t speculate on the possible impact on the economy, but adds that the Bank is looking \u201cvery closely\u201d at this \u201cfast-moving issue\u201d. Q: When you arrived in 2013, bank rate was 0.5%. It\u2019s now only 0.75%... &lt;50% higher, Carney mutters proudly&gt;... ...if you\u2019d been told that at the time, would you be surprised? Carney says he wouldn\u2019t have expected equilibrium rates to be so low today. Britain\u2019s r* rate (short-term interest rate which should occur when the economy is at equilibrium with inflation low and employment high) is lower than the global average, he adds. Carney then suggests there could be new fiscal measures in the March budget. That could lift equilibrium rates, as could a drop in Brexit uncertainty. Q: What do you think of chancellor Sajid Javid\u2019s comments about raising UK growth rates, given you have cut your forecasts? Carney says he welcomes Javid\u2019s focus on the issue (!) given the concerns over Britain\u2019s growth potential. Large structural changes may be needed to get Britain\u2019s supply growth up, he adds. But it can\u2019t happen overnight, it needs substantial investments and policy changes. It\u2019s a common issue. We\u2019re just calling it as we see it at present. The government and chancellor\u2019s efforts to raise the speed limit of the UK economy should be judged on long-term basis, not a two or three-year cycle, Carney adds. Q: Why have you dropped your guidance of \u201climited and gradual\u201d rises in interest rates in favour of \u201csome modest tightening\u201d being needed, as your forecast suggest inflation only hits target if you cut rates? Carney replies that a rate cut would push inflation over target -- so not consistent with the Bank\u2019s goals. But \u2018limited and gradual\u2019 implied multiple rate rises, and that\u2019s not expected, Carney add. Q: Markets were convinced that today\u2019s meeting would see rates cut - but actually you\u2019re talking about tightening policy. Given that, would you recommend that your successor uses forward guidance on interest rates? Carney insists that forward guidance (pledging not to move interest rates until certain conditions are met) are a key part of the armory. \u201cThe jury is in\u201d that they work, he insists. [The problem, though, is that the Bank kept promising to raise interest rates in a steady, gradual way, but has barely lifted borrowing costs since the financial crisis]. Carney then denies that the City were misled or confused -- 50% of participants may have expected a cut, but 50% didn\u2019t. That\u2019s now markets work, he explains.... Q: The Bank has lowered its assessment of the UK\u2019s growth potential, so what\u2019s gone wrong and is it partly the Bank\u2019s fault? The answer to the second part is \u201cno\u201d, Carney replies smoothly (do central bankers ever admit mistakes?!). Deputy governor Ben Broadbent explains that the Bank has lowered its expectations for labour supply, and for productivity. Carney adds that the Bank\u2019s forecasts assume an orderly move to a new free-trade agreement with the European Union, with divergence between the UK and EU happening over time. Q: The Bank of England has cut its assessment of Britain\u2019s supply growth today, so does that mean the economy is weaker since the Brexit vote? Mark Carney says there are three factors: 1) The Bank has been disappointed by the persistent failure of productivity to increase over several years, so has adjusted its forecasts accordingly 2) Business investment has been very weak since the Brexit vote -- spending less on new equipment and processes. Instead of expanding their businesses, they\u2019ve been focused on contingency planning to survive various Brexit cliff-edges. There\u2019s now \u201csome payback\u201d from that in the Bank\u2019s new forecasts, Carney says. 3) The Bank\u2019s forecasts now factor in Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal - and assume an \u201cimmediate move\u201d to a deep free-trade deal with the EU in a year\u2019s time [rather than a slower transition]. Looking ahead, Mark Carney warns that the UK is entering a decade of \u201cpotentially profound structural change\u201d. New trading relationships will be struck, new immigration rules will be set, major initiatives on infrastructure and regional development will be introduced.... plus there\u2019s the shift to a low-carbon economy. The discovery of a new strain of coronavirus in China is a reminder of the need to remain vigilant, Mark Carney continues. (Yesterday, US central bank chief Jerome Powell predicted that coronavirus would have an impact on the global economy, as well as China\u2019s) Indicators of uncertainty in the UK have fallen, Mark Carney continues, citing surveys showing that firms are less worried about Brexit. The latest hard data, covering the time before December, shows the economy is weak. But the more timely (but softer) survey data measuring activity after the election have improved \u201csharply\u201d. So with the global economy also appearing to recover, the Bank was persuaded to leave interest rate on hold. But Carney strikes a cautious note. This isn\u2019t a case of \u201cso far so good\u201d, but actually \u201cSo far, good enough.\u201d The hard economic data needs to back up the surveys. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a press conference at the central bank now. He warns that the UK economy probably stagnated in the final quarter of 2019, while core inflation has also slowed. So the question facing the MPC is whether the new decade will start with a bang. Politics is certainly delivering - with Brexit taking place tomorrow night. But the economic outlook is more modest, Carney warns. Here\u2019s our news story on the Bank\u2019s decision: The Bank suggests that the pick-up in manufacturing and service sector growth this month, and the easing of US-China trade tensions, both played a factor in today\u2019s decision. The minutes of the meeting say: Since the December meeting, international developments had been positive and the most recent UK data supported the forecast of a near-term recovery in growth. The Committee would monitor closely the extent to which these early indications of an improved outlook were sustained and followed through to the hard data on domestic activity in coming months. That was enough to persuade governor Mark Carney, deputy governors Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, and Dave Ramsden, chief economist Andrew Haldane, and external members Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe to vote to leave rates at 0.75%. For the third month running, Saunders and Haskel disagreed -- pointing to downside risks from Brexit uncertainties and a weaker world outlook. The pound has rallied against the US dollar following the Bank\u2019s decision. Sterling has gained almost half a cent to $1.3064. City traders are concluding that the BoE is less likely to cut interest rates in the coming months, as only two policymakers voted to cut rates today. Some economists had expected a closer vote, perhaps 6-3 or even a 5-4 nail biter. There were even forecasts of a rate cut. It appears that the Bank has taken heart from signs that activity is picking up this month, rather than fretting about data showing a slowdown at the end of 2019 [I outlined the various reasons for cutting or not cutting here] The Bank of England is helpfully tweeting the key points from today\u2019s Monetary Policy report (its quarterly healthcheck on the UK economy): You can see the Bank\u2019s latest Monetary Report here. It explains that interest rates may need to be cut if growth doesn\u2019t improve. But rates could rise \u201cmodestly\u201d in future if the economy recovers and inflation picks up, the BoE adds. The Bank of England has also cut its growth forecasts for the UK economy. It now expects GDP will only rise by 0.8% this year, down from 1.2% previously. Growth in 2021 has been revised down too, to 1.4% from 1.8%. And in 2022, the Bank only predicts growth of 1.7%, down from 2.0%. The Bank says that Brexit uncertainty hurt the UK economy last year - it is hoping that the global economy can help lift growth. In 2019, the UK economy slowed because firms\u2019 uncertainties about Brexit reduced their spending, and growth in the world economy slowed. UK inflation fell back below our 2% target. The latest data suggest that the uncertainty facing businesses has fallen, and that global growth has stabilised. We expect uncertainty to fall further and global growth to pick up. If that happens, it should help to support growth here in the UK. If that does not happen, then we may need to lower interest rates to support UK growth and ensure that we return inflation to our 2% target sustainably BoE policymakers Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel continued to demand a cut to interest rates, but couldn\u2019t persuade any of their other seven colleagues to join them. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates on hold. Britain\u2019s central bank has decided to leave Bank Rate at 0.75%, despite recent weak economic data. The decision was not unanimous \u2014 2 members of the monetary policy committee voted to cut rates, and 7 voted to leave them unchanged. More to follow. David Madden of CMC Markets says today\u2019s Bank of England decision (in four minutes) is pretty exciting: At previous meetings, policymakers Michael Saunders plus Jonathan Haskel voted for lowering rates. Gertjan Vlieghe has recently indicated he would be open to the idea of lowering rates too, so this meeting will be one of the more interesting ones in a while. The meeting has the added excitement of being the last one for Mark Carney, the head of the BoE. The central banker has a reputation of behaving like an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019, so he might try and shake off the image by voting to keep rates on hold \u2013 previously he has been content to keep the current policy. It would seem odd to cut rate ahead of the Budget, not to mention the Brexit situation. Tension is building in the City, with just 15 minutes until the Bank of England sets UK interest rates. Will policymakers cut borrowing costs to prop up the economy, or will they be heartened by recent signs that confidence and activity are picking up? It\u2019s a deliciously close call...and a gripping way for Mark Carney to end his time as governor. Shares in Carnival, the international cruise operator, have slumped by 7% this morning following a report that a couple from Hong Kong are in solitary confinement on one of its ships docked off the Italian coast. ANSA, the Italian news service, reports that the wife has a fever and is being tested by the authorities for coronavirus, and are mored at Civitavecchia. The 6,000 passengers on board the Costa Smeralda (one of the world\u2019s biggest cruise ships) are currently unable to get off. According to ANSA, the couple had arrived from Hong Kong at Milan Malpensa airport on Saturday 25 January and then headed to Savona (in Northern Italy) where they boarded the ship for the cruise. The mayor of Civitavecchia, Ernesto Tedesco, has said the situation is under \u201ccareful control\u201d, and that all the necessary protocols are being followed. Here\u2019s the story: My colleague Matt Weaver is tracking all the developments here: Michael Mulligan, insolvency and restructuring partner at law firm, Shakespeare Martineau, is alarmed that UK personal insolvencies have spiked to their highest since 2010. He believes it should temper optimism about a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d, and suggests the UK economy is still struggling -- something for the Bank of England to bear in mind. Mulligan says: In reality, growth continues to stagnate, and business and individuals are feeling the effects. There are thousands of zombie companies hanging on across a number of vulnerable sectors. \u201cBrexit uncertainty and trade wars have dominated the economic landscape, sapping opportunities for growth and pushing those who are struggling further under water. For bricks and mortar retail in particular, which is already threatened by rising online sales, the knives are out and the fight for customer spending continues. \u201cIndividual insolvencies have risen to highest annual level since 2010, with the UK retaining its status as the country with the highest level of personal insolvency in the world. The total number of County Court Judgments (CCJs) issued against individuals in debt reached 1.15 million in 2019 \u2013 the highest on record. \u201cThe availability of seemingly \u2018cheap\u2019 debt and short-term loans continues to be an issue and people are still being caught out by the temptation of accessible borrowing. January figures from the Bank of England show that UK households owe \u00a372.5 billion on credit cards, a total increase of \u00a3400 million in November 2019 alone Worryingly, the number of personal insolvencies in the UK has hit its highest level since 2010, after the financial crisis. The Insolvency Service has reported there were 122,181 personal insolvencies in 2019, an increase of 6% on 2018, and the highest annual total since 2010. Alex Collinson of the TUC has tweeted the key points: Duncan Swift, President of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, says the rise in insolvencies is due to \u201ca tough year for personal finances\u201d. \u201cIndividuals have benefited from low inflation, real wage increases, and record employment levels, but this has been counter-balanced by rising consumer debt and the fact that not all employment is secure. For the most financially vulnerable, the problems with the benefits system have been well-publicised. \u201cFinances are stretched for many, and financial resilience is low. It doesn\u2019t take much of a shock \u2013 a missed benefit payment, an unexpected bill, or a reduction in hours \u2013 to cause financial problems. Real wages are rising, but having fallen for so long before that it\u2019s a bit too late for some, while wage increases will not be evenly distributed. \u201cBanks and other lenders have continued to tighten their credit standards in response to the Bank of England\u2019s concerns around consumer over-indebtedness, which means many people have lost a fall-back option they may have used in the past. Christopher Dembik, Head of Macro Analysis at Saxo Bank, predicts that Mark Carney will leave interest rates on hold -- as the latest economic data has been encouraging. Dembik writes: We believe the BoE is data-dependent and will wait for more post-election data to come in before cutting interest rates. The latest data tend to confirm that the UK economy is rebounding in early 2020. January flash Purchasing Managers\u2019 index readings were above consensus. Flash Service PMI was out at 52.9, flash Manufacturing PMI at 49.8 and flash Composite PMI at 52.4. Credit conditions have also improved significantly with availability of secured credit for households reaching the highest level since 2015. We still consider that the UK economy will need more stimulus in the coming months to offset the prolonged contraction in credit push and the five consecutive quarters of contraction in private investment but, as of now, the BoE is in no hurry to step in. Another argument for postponing the rate cut is that it is the last meeting chaired by Governor Carney before Andrew Bailey takes over in March. It is likely that Carney will let Bailey make the call once more data will be available regarding the state of the UK economy in the post-Brexit era. Consumer goods giant Unilever is in hot water this morning after putting its tea operations on the market. CEO Alan Jope announced a \u201cstrategic review of our global tea business\u201d this morning, as part of a drive to improve performance. Unilver also reported a 33% drop in pre-tax profits for 2019, amid a slowdown in South Asia and weaker trading in China. Selling Unilever\u2019s \u2018black tea\u2019 business may make sense - given the move among younger consumers towards fruit teas and more glamorous coffees. But... Unilever denied that it was considering selling the tea business just two months ago, after our friends at the Telegraph reported it. Looks like Hannah Uttley was on the money. No wonder they\u2019re, ahem, stewing this morning.... On balance, the City expects the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold today with a 6-3 split on its monetary policy committee, Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward reports: Traders see about a 52% chance of a cut on Thursday, the most divided they\u2019ve ever been this close to a decision under Carney. Bets climbed as high as 70% in the weeks before the announcement, before paring back in the last few days. A Bloomberg survey of economists predicts five different results for the vote split among the nine policy makers. They lean toward a 6-3 vote to hold, with Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel repeating their calls for lower rates, and Gertjan Vlieghe joining the dissent. Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Morgan Stanley are among the banks calling for no change, while Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Natwest predict a cut. Rabobank, the Dutch financial services group, predicts the Bank of England will cut interest rates at noon today... BT shares are also under the cosh this morning after reporting a 3% drop in revenues in the last quarter, and a 4% decline in core profits. Traders are concerned that BT has predicted a \u00a3500m bill for replacing Huawei kit in its networks, to comply with the UK government\u2019s new restrictions on the Chinese operator. My colleague Mark Sweney has the details: BT, which saw its share price fall 4% in early trading after reporting slightly worse than expected third quarter results, said that the \u00a3500m projection included assumptions on the costs getting equipment from alternate providers such as Nokia and Ericsson will be when deals are done. \u201cThe way it works at the moment is when you put a 5G box on a mast it has to on top of a 4G box from the same supplier,\u201d said Philip Jansen, the chief executive of BT. \u201cMore than 35% of [our] 4G boxes are Huawei. We are going to have to take out some of Huawei 4G boxes and not use them again. That is probably the single biggest cost. In order to make 5G work we are going to have to use other manufacturers\u2019 equipment.\u201d Profits have halved at Royal Dutch Shell after the energy giant was hit by sliding oil and gas prices. The news has sent its shares to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard in early trading, to a two and a half-year low. The Anglo-Dutch oil giant has posted profits of just $2.9bn for the final quarter of 2019, compared with $5.7bn a year before. Profits for 2019 as a whole dropped to $16.5bn, down 23% from 2018, after a disappointing end to the year. My colleague Jillian Ambrose explains: The company blamed weaker oil and gas prices, which drifted down last year due to a well stocked global market and concerns over global economic growth which dampened demand for fossil fuels. Ben Van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said the company faced \u201cchallenging macroeconomic conditions\u201d in its petroleum refining and chemicals business, \u201cas well as lower oil and gas prices\u201d last year. Shares in Shell are down 4% this morning at \u00a320.44, their lowest since July 2017. European stock markets have all fallen into the red in early trading, as the escalating coronavirus crisis hits stocks. France\u2019s CAC and Germany\u2019s DAX have both fallen by over 1%, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 currently 0.6% lower. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With the coronavirus death toll leaping 29% overnight, the European markets reverted back to panic mode, quickly unravelling the rebound managed in the last couple of sessions. The market\u2019s fears weren\u2019t helped by the Fed on Wednesday evening. As the central bank kept rates unchanged, while re-upping its commitment to 2% inflation, Jerome Powell refused to speculate on the full impact of the coronavirus, though he did acknowledge the potential for any economic disruption in China to spill over to the US. Here\u2019s our news blog on the latest developments: The pound is looking a little jittery this morning, dropping below $1.30 as traders await the BoE decision at noon. There are several reasons why Bank of England policymakers may vote for an interest rate cut today for the first time since the Brexit vote. For example: The UK economy shrank by 0.3% in November, according to the latest GDP figures Retail sales slumped in December, and have not risen for five months The coronavirus outbreak is already denting confidence, and will hurt UK businesses exposed to China Economic uncertainty may rise in the coming months as Britain tries to reach free trade deals with the EU and US by the end of 2020 But it\u2019s not a clear call, as the most recent data paints a better picture: British manufacturing and services companies returned to growth in January, according to a \u2018flash PMI\u2019 survey released last Friday UK business confidence has surged a 14-month high, according to a survey from Lloyds Bank released this morning Here\u2019s a nice recap of Mark Carney\u2019s time at the Bank of England, from CNBC: Today\u2019s Bank of England decision is on a \u201cknife-edge\u201d, says Neil Wilson of Market.com: Recent comments from several policy makers at the Bank, some softer inflation data and GDP numbers, and persistent risks to the global outlook suggest the MPC may choose to act now to cut. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After more than six years at the Bank of England, Mark Carney will today announce his final decision on interest rates. And it\u2019s possibly the trickiest judgement faced by the governor yet. Carney, and his colleagues on the Monetary Policy Committee, must weigh up whether to slash borrowing costs to give the economy a lift, or sit tight and see whether there\u2019s really a \u201cBoris Bounce\u201d after last month\u2019s election. The odds of a rate cut have been volatile in recent weeks -- hitting over 60% at one stage, after weak growth figures suggested the economy was flatlining. But they have dropped back to 50% in recent days, after survey data suggested the private sector is growing again. It\u2019s a devilish decision. With Brexit due tomorrow night, the Bank might be tempted to cut rates from 0.75% to 0.5% to shore up confidence. But with new governor Andrew Bailey taking over in March, they might like to leave him some ammunition too. Back in December, the Bank voted 7-2 to leave borrowing costs unchanged, with policymakers Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel calling for a cut. But since then, two more external members - Silvana Tenreyo and Jan Vlieghe - have both hinted that they could vote for a cut. So it\u2019s going to be terribly exciting at noon today, when the decision hits the wires. Central banks take pride in their ability to guide the markets through judicious communication, but today\u2019s decision really could go either way. James Smith, economist at ING, predicts the Bank will hold rates.... just. It\u2019s not clear that the remaining five \u2018internal\u2019 members of the committee will back calls for easing right now. Admittedly, we don\u2019t have that much to go on in terms of communication, but as we noted at the time, our sense from Governor Mark Carney\u2019s recent speech was that he hadn\u2019t been fully convinced of the merits of cutting interest rates this month. While his comments were perhaps the most candid he has been on the idea of easing, he noted the better news on politics, and pushed back on the idea that the Bank was running out of ammunition. Also coming up today Fears over the coronavirus are intensifying today, as the death toll rises to 170 overnight. Asian stock markets are deep in the red, with Hong Kong losing another 2.8%. Yesterday, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the outbreak would have an impact on the Chinese economy, and the wider global economy, adding: Of course we are very carefully monitoring the situation. European stocks are expected to suffer, as countries around the globe close their Chinese stores and factories. The FTSE 100 has just dropped by 71 points at the open to 7412, back towards Monday\u2019s lows. We find out how America\u2019s economy fared in the last quarter of 2019. Economists predict growth remained around 2.1% per year -- not exactly sizzling. And it\u2019s a busy day in the City, with oil company Shell reporting a halving of its profits, Unilever reviewing its global tea business, and BT warning that the UK\u2019s curbs on Huawei will cost it \u00a3500m. The agenda Noon GMT: Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision, and monetary policy report 12.30pm GMT: BoE governor Mark Carney holds press conference 1.30pm GMT: US GDP for October-December 2019: Forecast to have grown by 2.1%, as in Q3",

      "bodyText": "Life in my 20s was a whirlwind of McJobs, casual sex, insane crushes, share houses, and intense friendships. I was trying to start a career, trying to write the great Australian novel, always poor, making bad choices while drunk, and somehow had hours and hours in the middle of the day, in the middle of the week, to just \u2026 hang out. It was unremarkable, but it felt somehow hidden. We were living these lives in inner-Melbourne that felt complicated and interesting and full of drama, yet strangely, we never really saw these types of (let\u2019s face it, pretty privileged) lives in the TV shows we watched. Instead, people in their 20s in Australia at the turn of the millennium watched Melrose Place or Friends to see their generation reflected back at them. But the reflection never seemed quite right. Those shows were too glossy, the apartments too nice, the characters too well put together, their problems not really relatable. There was the BBC drama This Life, about a bunch of London barristers, that came close \u2013 it was full of fully realised characters whose messy, complicated lives seemed human in a way that the characters on American dramas were not. Later, Fleabag and Girls covered similar ground well. But for a long time in Australia, the lives of urban 20-somethings were passed over in favour of cop shows, dramas focused on communities in the bush or by the sea, or the lives of suburban families in soaps such as Neighbours. That is, until The Secret Life of Us. Premiering in 2001 on Channel 10, even the opening credits (backed by a Motor Ace song) provoked a thrill of recognition. There was St Kilda beach! And a neon-lit bar! And a tram! The Secret Life of Us (created by John Edwards and Amanda Higgs) followed the relationships of a group of twentysomething Melbourne friends, played by Deborah Mailman, Claudia Karvan and Samuel Johnson. Kelly, Alex and Evan were the housemates that seemed eerily familiar \u2013 starting careers, trying to write books, losing jobs, sleeping with the wrong people. The show was the first in a triptych of excellent Australian dramas produced by John Edwards that tapped into the sensibility of a generation. It was followed by the thirtysomething drama, Love My Way, and Tangle, which focused on fortysomethings. They were distinct, unrelated storylines, but the cast and creative team overlapped, and all three were distinguished by their superior scripts, a keen eye for location, excellent cinematography and talented casts. In lesser-hands, The Secret Life of Us could have easily been embarrassing or tone deaf \u2013 always a problem when people try to make edgy, youth-focused drama. But it aired for four seasons on free-to-air television and reflected a very contemporary Australia. Love My Way, airing a few years later on pay TV, was its more complex, richer and ultimately more satisfying older sibling, focusing on complex family structures, both traditional and patched together, of a group of thirtysomethings in Sydney. Karvan also co-produced and wrote much of the series, describing it as \u201crawer and darker\u201d than its predecessor. Love My Way also contained some of the best Australian acting talent ever assembled \u2013 Karvan, Sam Worthington, Dan Wyllie, Asher Keddie, Brendan Cowell, Lynette Curran and Max Cullen \u2013 and it looked beautiful and sounded real. (Although the first episode, in which Karvan\u2019s character gets drunk at the Walkley awards and goes home with an ill-chosen colleague, was perhaps more real for some of us than others.)

O\u2019Brien said the grant would have given local builders some work and helped boost morale in the town. He hired a professional grant writer and surveyor to prepare the application, which he said \u201cticked all the boxes\u201d of what the grant program aimed to achieve. Sport Australia deemed it worthy of funding, scoring it 76 out of 100. But the application was rejected twice, in rounds one and two of the program. O\u2019Brien said it has been deeply disappointing to since learn that his application had lost out to projects scored in the 50s or below. Wealthier clubs like the members-only Royal Adelaide Golf Club, one of Australia\u2019s most exclusive golf courses, the Mosman Rowing Club, and the Applecross Tennis Club, which boasts \u201cmillion dollar views\u201d of Perth\u2019s Swan River, were successful. Guardian Australia has also reported that the Old Collegians Rugby Club in the Coalition-held seat of Sturt received $500,000 for female change rooms despite its women\u2019s team quitting because of a sexism row. The club\u2019s application had a score of 60.5. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cYou put your trust in these people. It cost us money to do the grant.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got no ladies facilities in terms of dressing rooms and these grounds are used every day of the week by schools, clubs, and for Indigenous sports carnivals.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t build your trust too much in parliamentarians or governments.\u201d The club has since had a 2016 application for funding with the state government re-assessed, and won some money to build the change rooms. But the funding was based on old quotes and the club has now been left with a shortfall of at least $50,000, meaning the work is in jeopardy. Labor\u2019s shadow sports minister Don Farrell said that across Australia there had been grassroots clubs, including those wanting funds for female change rooms, that had been \u201ccheated\u201d by the grants process, with some of the highest-ranked but rejected applications focused on female participation. \u201cIn seats not held or targeted by the Coalition and even in safe Coalition-held seats, grassroots sports clubs were cheated out of grants because the Morrison government used this program as its own personal pork-barrelling account,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cClubs that applied for grants to fund female change rooms and other projects supporting girls and women to play sport were snubbed.\u201d Fellow Labor frontbencher Chris Bowen accused the National party of \u201ctheft\u201d, saying many worthy clubs that had \u201cdreamt of change rooms for years\u201d had missed out as a result. \u201cNow this is pure and simple political corruption of a process here by Bridget McKenzie. She should pay for that with her job,\u201d Bowen said. Labor will move to establish a Senate inquiry into the scheme when parliament returns next week. Amid mounting calls for McKenzie to be dumped from cabinet, Morrison is waiting on the findings of an investigation being undertaken by the head of his department, Phil Gaetjens, into whether the Nationals MP breached ministerial standards. Gaetjens, who is also Morrison\u2019s former chief of staff, will look at McKenzie\u2019s handling of the grants program, and whether she should have disclosed membership of a Wangaratta gun club that received a $36,000 grant. On Thursday, home affairs minister Peter Dutton again defended McKenzie, saying he still strongly backed the embattled agriculture minister. But he also said there was a \u201cprocess in place\u201d to determine her fate. \u201cHe [Morrison] is waiting on that advice back from the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Obviously he\u2019s looked very closely at the recommendations made by the Auditor-General and I think that\u2019s the right process. I think we should, again, leave some of the emotion to one side, look at the facts and make a decision on that basis,\u201d Dutton said.",

The scale of the bushfires that have so far burned about 11m hectares across the country has ecologists and scientists in \u201cuncharted territory\u201d as they scramble to gather data to understand the devastation. But the new citizen science project organised by the University of New South Wales could deliver essential data and observations that will feed into recovery efforts and future scientific papers. Ecologist Casey Kirchhoff, of the UNSW Centre for Ecosystem Science, has started the project that lets people upload photographs using a free smartphone application called iNaturalist or its linked website. Kirchhoff, a PhD candidate studying climate change impacts on alpine plants, lost her own NSW home at Wingello, next to Morton National Park, when a fire razed the area on 4 January. Preliminary government data suggests the fires burned through at least half the known habitats of more than 100 threatened species. More than a billion animals have likely perished, with scientists fearing some species have been pushed to extinction.

Kingsford said the information uploaded to the project was open source and available to any members of the public, as well as researchers from anywhere in the world.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the end of January, a time of year when most parents in Australia begin to wonder if they are suffering from a major depressive illness or just really ready for the school holidays to end. As I watch my daughters fight over who got to watch the most YouTube meditations before bed \u2013 which is not what meditation is supposed to be about, you pint-sized philistines \u2013 I keep myself sane by curling, slater-like, into a ball and browsing the Marks &amp; Spencer uniform shop for pointelle socks, pin-tuck blouses and knife-pleat pinafores. Standard state school uniform suppliers, with their predilection for polar fleece and coarse disregard for shape and form, don\u2019t make the grade. A good school uniform should be comfortable, aesthetically pleasing and made with fabrics that don\u2019t instantly bring to mind the words \u201ckeep away from fire\u201d. If shopping for school gear sounds like an odd way to self-soothe, let me explain: I love uniforms. Some people spend their evenings furtively hunting down tabloid stories about Harry and Meghan; I spend mine looking up uniforms of the world \u2013 posh private school uniforms, Italian police uniforms, NHS nurses uniforms (those silver buckle belts), flight attendant uniforms. My primary school enforced a rigid and elaborate uniform code, the perfect hothouse in which to nurture a budding uniform fanatic, and by eight years of age, I was doing Windsor knots for my friends and enthusiastically assenting to even the pettiest uniform demands (retrospectively, that navy underpants-only rule seems OTT). Even as I devolved into a dyspeptic teen with Drano-coloured hair, I could never bring myself to vandalise the uniform like my classmates did. So it\u2019s with a hint of envy that I watch my kids sort through their gear in preparation for the first day back at school. How wonderful it must be to wear the same outfit every day, without fear of looking overdone or underdone. How wonderful to never have to put a moment\u2019s thought into looking adorable. I\u2019m not the only parent with a taste for sartorial conformity. Schools in the US are tightening up their uniform codes, often because parents tell them that\u2019s what they want. In 2006 just 13.8% of US schools had a uniform requirement, but that number has now risen to over 40%. Australians value a uniform too \u2013 there are even social campaigns around them. In Western Australia all public schools have mandatory uniforms, as do schools in the Northern Territory up until year 9. In all other states, the majority of schools have uniform requirements too. Why, as our culture becomes ever more accepting of a person\u2019s right to freely express themselves via their clothes and gender, do we still view uniforms as a necessary requirement in the schoolyard? After all, uniforms are not without their sinister aspects: it\u2019s not by accident that the fertility slaves in The Handmaids Tale wear red robes and white bonnets. Uniforms are an easy way to convey control. But in less sinister settings, they can also do the reverse. \u201cI believe the appeal of a uniform is because it makes you feel empowered,\u201d says fashion collector and author Charlotte Smith. \u201cThere is no better way to embody \u2018team\u2019 than by dressing the same.\u201d Smith\u2019s words certainly gel with my experience of wearing a uniform; as someone who always felt a bit on the outer, I relished the sense of belonging my school uniform gave me, even as I kicked against the institution itself. In an educational environment, continues Smith, \u201ca uniform eliminates any possibility that someone is less or more equal by what they wear\u201d. Which isn\u2019t to say a uniform can\u2019t be a status symbol. Fashion designers have a rich history of collaborating with brands to create staff uniforms, such as Martin Grant\u2019s immaculate red tailoring for Qantas. Internationally, Oleg Cassini, Balmain, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Zac Posen have all put their stamp on cabin crew uniforms too. One look at Max Mara\u2019s spring 2020 collection will show the fascination extends to the runway, which featured military-crisp pastel shirts, shorts and ties. While on the high street last year, work wear company Dickies teamed with Madewell to create a wildly popular line of utilitarian basics, including a sellout mechanic\u2019s-style boiler suit.

Her suggestion was, ahem, uniformly rejected. But were Marc Jacobs to revive the idea in 2020, I\u2019d be an early adopter. When I look at the other women at school drop-off, though, it\u2019s clear that I already stick to an urban mum uniform of sorts \u2013 a mishmash of clearance-store Gorman and Zara, with the odd shock of lurex thrown in, to remind everyone that we used to know how to carve up a dancefloor. \u201cWe are tired,\u201d say our clothes, \u201cbut we are not yet ready to lay down our bodies at the altar of athleisure.\u201d We don\u2019t really want to think about what to wear anymore.

Figures released by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission also reveal that 531 incidents have been referred to police, demonstrating what advocates describe as the \u201chorrifying\u201d level of alleged abuse experienced by people with disabilities. More than 300,000 Australians are now accessing the NDIS, which since July has been regulated by the commission in all states except Western Australia. Between 1 July and 30 September, the commission said it had received 8,595 reports of serious incidents within the scheme, including: 6,694 reports of unauthorised restrictive practices. 1,236 reports of alleged abuse and neglect (including physical, verbal or financial abuse). 437 reports of known serious injury (including accidents). The figures are the first time the commission has provided a close to national snapshot of the allegations it is asked to review. In the 2018-19 financial year, it received 4,537 reports of serious incident but it had only been regulating New South Wales and South Australia. Jeff Smith, the chief executive of People with Disability Australia, said it was \u201chorrifying that people with disability are being subjected to this level of violence\u201d. Pointing to the high rate of unauthorised restrictive practices, which made up nearly 80% of all allegations, Smith said that these were instances where people were \u201cbeing restrained, medicated or locked up without their consent\u201d. \u201cThey are truly awful and sickening figures,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThese are only allegations, but there\u2019s a whole bunch of structural reasons why we might expect there to be underreporting so I wouldn\u2019t take any comfort from the fact some of these may be allegations rather than instances. \u201cIt does highlight the formidable task that the disability royal commission has ahead.\u201d The figures were provided to the Senate in response to a question from the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John, who said the figures showed why the royal commission should fully investigate the abuse experienced by people with disabilities. \u201cThis data supports what disabled people and our organisations have been saying for years; that this issue is widespread in our community,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve got to remember about these figures is that they represent only a small cohort of the disabled community \u2013 people who have accessed the NDIS and are able to report \u2013 and only incidents that have occurred recently.\u201d The royal commission heard in December that people with disabilities are being strapped down and forcibly medicated in group homes, a practice that must be authorised either by the commission or under existing state regulators. In cases where an NDIS provider has not been granted permission to use such practices, they must self-report to the commission. The NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, said all allegations of abuse were concerning, which demonstrated why the government had established the commission in the first place. \u201cThe NDIS commission works with all providers reporting such incidents to effectively manage incidents and support people with disability to assure their safety,\u201d he said. Robert said he and his state and territory counterparts had committed to \u201cwork to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, the use of restrictive practices on people with disability\u201d at a Coag meeting in December. \u201cIn doing so, the council agreed that all governments would increase efforts to achieve consistency in state and territory approaches to review the authorisation of restrictive practices,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission said the watchdog had expected to receive a larger number of reports of use of restrictive practices while nationally consistent rules were developed. The figures provided by the scheme also noted 228 reports of death within the scheme within the three-month period. This reflected all deaths of participants that occurred in connection with the scheme, \u201ceven if the death is expected\u201d, the spokesperson said. \u201cIn some cases, further information reveals that the death of the person with disability did not occur in connection with the provision of NDIS supports and services,\u201d the spokesperson said.

He, you see, is very much of the view that only pretentious wonks take an interest in Iberian football, especially at a time when there are so many intriguing matters to resolve in good old England, such as the progress of Arsenal under their dashing young manager, Manchester United\u2019s \u00a350m acquisition of a midfielder who can run and shoot, and Tottenham\u2019s ongoing pursuit of someone called Willian Jos\u00e9 to keep warm the throne of Harry Kane MBE.</p> \n<p>Truth be told, Weird Uncle Fiver would rather listen to Danny Mills give lectures on the discography of Vera Lynn than hear a preview of this weekend\u2019s Madrid derby. Nope, unless it comes in a bottle or is hidden in the side-panels of an unremarkable car, there\u2019s no point offering anything foreign to Weird Uncle Fiver. He absolutely doesn\u2019t care that Atl\u00e9tico go into Saturday\u2019s showdown at the Santiago What\u00e9ver on their worst run of results since Diego Simeone took charge of them in 2011. Granted, he has always liked the cut of Simeone, who gives the impression he could start a fight with a clock if he didn\u2019t like the look on its face, but it\u2019ll take more than that for Weird Uncle Fiver to bother tuning in, especially as Madrid look set to be without their Welsh star, Ian Woosnam.</p> \n<p>As they prepare to head across to their neighbours and the Spanish league leaders, Atl\u00e9tico also have a slew of players absent through knack, including ace goleador Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix and top trolleador Diego Costa. England\u2019s Kieran Trippier remains out of Weird Uncle Fiver\u2019s mind. Simeone says everyone just needs to stay cool. \u201cWe need to work hard, look for answers [to our bobbins form] and make decisions, especially me; we need to regain our calm,\u201d bawled the football manager most likely to treat a bat the way Ozzy Osbourne once did.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cIt will be long term. It was a bad twist. He says there was contact but it doesn\u2019t look like there was contact. It looks like he has twisted the knee and there is a bit of swelling there and ligament damage. It was annoying for me because we were making a substitution and he said he was alright to carry on. But quite clearly after a couple of minutes that wasn\u2019t the case\u201d \u2013 a fresh and funky Neil Lennon, whose empathy was in short supply after substitute Mikey Johnston was forced off by knack in the Queen\u2019s Celtic\u2019s 3-0 win at St Johnstone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7c025a551f30359aba4ce470e0bb5f116d783f4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7c025a551f30359aba4ce470e0bb5f116d783f4/0_0_1800_1396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freshness and funk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freshness and funk.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vagelis Georgariou/Action Plus/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>FIVER LETTERS</strong></h2> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d missed the news that Colin Calderwood had been given the boot (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs), but was aware it had happened when I saw people retweeting the b@nter feeds suggesting there were actual (admittedly very long) odds on Football Weekly\u2019s very own Max Rushden being offered the Cambridge United manager\u2019s job. If employing a fan of the team \u2013 or a celebrity from nearby \u2013 really could revive a team\u2019s fortunes, maybe my local team, Grantham Town should turn to notable Lincolnshire resident Geoff Capes to, ahem, strengthen their chances of avoiding relegation from Online Casino Northern Premier League\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor.</p> \n<p>\u201cRe: Tim Cole (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). May I point out that \u2018The Squirrels\u2019 \u2026 coming out to anything by Dr Drey\u2019 should have drawn nothing but the sound of applause from pun-lovers at Fiver Towers, not an admonishment from your Hip-hop Ed. Instead we heard only a wooshing sound far above your heads. A drey is the nest of a squirrel\u201d \u2013 Colin Robertson.</p> \n<p>\u201cIs Kilmarnock the only club with a squirrel \u2013 in fact, two \u2013 on its badge? I think we should be told\u201d \u2013 Peter Storch.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think I have something to trump all the others regarding tunes played before matches (Fiver letters passim). When I was fortunate enough to see the mighty Altrincham FC a few weeks ago at fortress Moss Lane, my ears were assailed, or should that be assaulted, before the match and during half-time by the unmistakable tones of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. I can tell you that Hoedown sounds no better now through a tinny PA system than it did the first time I heard it all those years ago.

It looks like he has twisted the knee and there is a bit of swelling there and ligament damage. It was annoying for me because we were making a substitution and he said he was alright to carry on. But quite clearly after a couple of minutes that wasn\u2019t the case\u201d \u2013 a fresh and funky Neil Lennon, whose empathy was in short supply after substitute Mikey Johnston was forced off by knack in the Queen\u2019s Celtic\u2019s 3-0 win at St Johnstone. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI\u2019d missed the news that Colin Calderwood had been given the boot (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs), but was aware it had happened when I saw people retweeting the b@nter feeds suggesting there were actual (admittedly very long) odds on Football Weekly\u2019s very own Max Rushden being offered the Cambridge United manager\u2019s job. If employing a fan of the team \u2013 or a celebrity from nearby \u2013 really could revive a team\u2019s fortunes, maybe my local team, Grantham Town should turn to notable Lincolnshire resident Geoff Capes to, ahem, strengthen their chances of avoiding relegation from Online Casino Northern Premier League\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor. \u201cRe: Tim Cole (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). May I point out that \u2018The Squirrels\u2019 \u2026 coming out to anything by Dr Drey\u2019 should have drawn nothing but the sound of applause from pun-lovers at Fiver Towers, not an admonishment from your Hip-hop Ed. Instead we heard only a wooshing sound far above your heads. A drey is the nest of a squirrel\u201d \u2013 Colin Robertson. \u201cIs Kilmarnock the only club with a squirrel \u2013 in fact, two \u2013 on its badge? I think we should be told\u201d \u2013 Peter Storch. \u201cI think I have something to trump all the others regarding tunes played before matches (Fiver letters passim). When I was fortunate enough to see the mighty Altrincham FC a few weeks ago at fortress Moss Lane, my ears were assailed, or should that be assaulted, before the match and during half-time by the unmistakable tones of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. I can tell you that Hoedown sounds no better now through a tinny PA system than it did the first time I heard it all those years ago. I mean, how can you have a band with no guitar?\u201d \u2013 Steve Powell. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport.

And Norwich City have been given a motivational speech by golfer Danny Willett.

All but four of the 80 reported deaths so far have been recorded in Hubei province where the outbreak started. Experts have warned, however, that about 100,000 people may already be infected \u2013 far more than the 2,700 cases reported by China\u2019s National Health Commission in China. The World Health Organisation is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the virus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers Avoid direct, unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals when visiting live markets in affected areas Avoid eating raw or undercooked animal products and exercise care when handling raw meat, milk or animal organs to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection of the airborne disease. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces \u2013 23 times an hour, according to one study. Dr David Carrington, of St George\u2019s, University of London, told BBC News that \u201croutine surgical masks for the public are not an effective protection against viruses or bacteria carried in the air\u201d, because they were too loose, had no air filter and left the eyes exposed. Masks could, however, help lower the risk of contracting a virus through the \u201csplash\u201d from a sneeze or a cough and offer some protection against hand-to-mouth transmissions, he said. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit \u2013 but not eliminate \u2013 the risks, provided they are used correctly. That means securing them over the mouth, chin and nose, using the bendable metal strip at the top to keep it snug against the contours of the nose. Experts say the best way to avoid germs, with coronavirus and other airborne illnesses, is to wash your hands thoroughly and frequently, try not to touch your face or eyes and avoid contact with people displaying symptoms. WHO experts advise against wearing gloves on the basis that hand-washing is more important and people wearing gloves are less likely to wash their hands. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 February 2020 to make it clear that China\u2019s National Health Commission figures related to China.",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill.

      "bodyText": "Ditching meat may reduce the risk of urinary tract infections, at least in women, research suggests. Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are common and painful, with more than 150m cases around the world every year. Infections in otherwise healthy individuals are generally caused by certain strains of E coli bacteria that can cause problems outside of the gut. These typically live in the bowel, and sometimes the vagina, but can end up entering the urethra, resulting in an infection there or further up the urinary tract, in the bladder. Women are particularly affected by UTIs, such as cystitis, because the distance from the anus to the urethra and the length of the urethra itself are both shorter. The urethra is also close to the vagina, meaning bacteria can be easily transferred during sex. While UTIs can be treated with antibiotics, there has been a rise in persistent infections, a trend potentially driven by an increase in antibiotic resistance and greater concerns about prescribing antibiotics in the first place. Now a study involving Buddhists in Taiwan has revealed that those who follow a vegetarian diet have a lower risk of developing a UTI than those who eat meat. The team behind the study say that may be because meat, particularly pork and poultry, is known to contain the strains of E coli bacteria that cause many UTIs. By ditching a meat-eating diet, the theory goes, people decrease their exposure to these bacteria, reducing levels in the bowel and hence lowering the risk they will end up in the urethra. But there may be another effect. \u201cVegetarian diets [lead to] lower stool pH than for non-vegetarians, and the lower stool pH could prevent the growth of E coli,\u201d said Dr Chin-Lon Lin, co-author of the research from Tzu Chi University in Taiwan. However, others warned that the study did not look at the impact of switching diet, noting that the problematic E coli might linger among internal microbial communities in former meat-eaters. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know if an established reservoir [of these bacteria] in one\u2019s gut microbiota could be easily ousted by a diet change \u2013 though it would make an interesting future study,\u201d said Dr Jennifer Rohn, the head of the centre for urological biology at University College London. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the team from Taiwan report how they analysed responses to questionnaires completed in 2005 by more than 9,700 participants from the Tzu Chi Foundation, a Buddhist NGO. None of the participants included in the analysis had previously had a UTI. The survey included a range of questions, including about diet, smoking, drinking, physical activity and medical conditions. The team then tracked participants through national health insurance records until 2014. The results reveal that 217 of the 3,257 vegetarian participants developed a UTI during the study, compared with 444 of the 6,467 non-vegetarians. Overall the team say a vegetarian diet was linked to a 16% lower risk of developing a UTI, compared with meat eating, after taking into account potentially influencing factors such as age, sex, lifestyle and other health conditions, including those that may predispose a participant to UTIs. However, further analysis revealed the reduced risk of UTIs among vegetarians was only clear in women, non-smoking participants and \u201cuncomplicated UTIs\u201d \u2013 those that crop up in otherwise healthy people. The team say the latter was not surprising, as E coli is only thought to cause about 50% of \u201ccomplicated\u201d UTIs \u2013 those involving a predisposition to an infection, such as urinary tract stones, having a catheter, or renal failure. However, the study only questioned participants at one point in time and relied on self-report. Dr Jim Johnson, an expert in an infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota, pointed out that the study did not take into account family history of UTIs, the frequency with which participants had sex or the method of contraception \u2013 all of which can affect UTI risk.

Previously it was believed that only non-African populations carried Neanderthal genes due to interbreeding that took place after a major human migration out of Africa and across the globe about 60,000 years ago. The latest findings suggest human and Neanderthal lineages are more closely intertwined than once thought and point to far earlier interbreeding events, about 200,000 years ago. \u201cOur results show this history was much more interesting and there were many waves of dispersal out of Africa, some of which led to admixture between modern humans and Neanderthals that we see in the genomes of all living individuals today,\u201d said Joshua Akey, an evolutionary biologist at Princeton University and senior author of the research. The study suggests living Europeans and Asians carry about 1% Neanderthal DNA, compared with on average 0.3% for those of African ancestry. Akey and colleagues believe that this Neanderthal DNA arrived in Africa with ancient Europeans whose ancestors \u2013 over many generations \u2013 had left Africa, met and mated with Neanderthals and then returned to Africa and mixed with local populations. \u201cAn important aspect of our study is that it highlights humans, and hominins, were moving in and out of Africa for hundreds of thousands of years and occasionally admixing,\u201d said Akey. \u201cThese back-to-Africa migrations, largely from ancestors of contemporary Europeans, carried Neanderthal sequences with them, and through admixture, contributed to the Neanderthal ancestry we detect in African individuals today.\u201d The increasingly fine-grained details of our ancestors\u2019 migration patterns and intimate encounters with other types of human are coming into focus thanks to the advent of sophisticated computational genetics techniques. These statistical methods allow scientists to line up the Neanderthal genome side by side with that of ancient modern humans and DNA from different living populations and figure out whether the different lineages have been steadily diverging or whether there are blips where large chunks of DNA were exchanged at certain time points. The latest comparison highlights previously unnoticed ancient human genes in the Neanderthal genome, apparently acquired from interbreeding events dating to about 200,000 years ago. This suggests an early group of humans travelled from Africa to Europe or Asia, where they encountered Neanderthal populations and left a faint imprint on their genome that could still be detected more than 100,000 years later. The paper also highlights the relative lack of genetics research in African populations, despite modern humans having first emerged on the continent and despite African populations today being more diverse genetically than the inhabitants of the rest of the world combined. \u201cTo more fully understand human genomic variation and human evolutionary history, it is imperative to comprehensively sample individuals from all regions of the world, and Africa remains one of the most understudied regions,\u201d said Akey. It is not known whether all African populations, some of whose roots stretch into the deep past, share this Neanderthal heritage. KhoeSan (bushmen) and Mbuti (central African pygmy) populations, for instance, appear to have split off from other groups more than 100,000 years ago.

      "bodyText": "The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, arrived in Kyiv on Thursday amid a bruising Washington impeachment battle and a storm around his alleged remarks to an NPR reporter: \u201cDo you think Americans care about Ukraine?\u201d Pompeo is scheduled to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday, as he seeks to put a positive spin on relations between the two countries at a crucial moment in the Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump. The visit, Pompeo\u2019s first to Ukraine, was important to \u201chighlight US support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d, a spokesperson told reporters. That support has come into question because of Trump\u2019s apparent affinity for Vladimir Putin and accusations that he delayed $392m in military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure Zelenskiy into announcing an investigation into the Biden family. Zelenskiy, meanwhile, will look for commitments to diplomatic and military aid in his country\u2019s conflict with Russia, which has left more than 14,000 dead in south-east Ukraine, and may also seek an invitation to the White House. The Ukrainian president would look past Pompeo\u2019s reported faux pas and roll out the red carpet, said the Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko, because Ukraine\u2019s need for US support was paramount. \u201cHe can\u2019t really complain about what has been said.

The discussions are likely to cover bilateral relations and Ukraine\u2019s conflict with Russia, gas politics and the US\u2019s sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, possible investment opportunities and the progress of reforms in Ukraine. Pompeo is also scheduled to meet with Ukraine\u2019s foreign and defence ministers, as well as representatives of Ukraine\u2019s religious, civil society, and business communities. The trip is the first leg of a four-country tour through the former Soviet Union for Pompeo that will also take him to Belarus, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. But it is in Kyiv where the spotlight will focus most firmly on Pompeo and his attempts to repair the damage done over the past two years. Former officials say the scandal has hollowed out the ranks of senior Ukraine experts in the US government and reduced US interest in the peace talks over the war in south-east Ukraine. Trump still has not nominated an ambassador to Kyiv and Pompeo has faced criticism for failing to support the former US ambassador Maria Yovanovitch against Trump\u2019s political supporters, including Rudy Giuliani.

He had requested two shirts to prevent himself from shivering from the cold, a reflex he thought could be mistaken for fear. He knelt in front of the crowd and placed his head on a block. Moments later, the axe fell.</p> <p>Now, 371 years later, the pale blue vest worn by Charles during his execution is to go on display. \u201cThis undergarment would have been a good thing to wear in January because it is knitted silk, so it would have been a warm garment,\u201d said Meriel Jeater, a curator at <a href=\"https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItfqq18-r5wIVWeDtCh1WyAw4EAAYASAAEgK9evD_BwE\">the Museum of London</a>.</p> <p>The silk vest is the star of an exhibition due to open in October that will look at public executions in London from 1196 to 1868.

      "bodyText": "On 30 January 1649, King Charles I of England took to the scaffold outside the Banqueting House in London\u2019s Whitehall. He had requested two shirts to prevent himself from shivering from the cold, a reflex he thought could be mistaken for fear. He knelt in front of the crowd and placed his head on a block. Moments later, the axe fell. Now, 371 years later, the pale blue vest worn by Charles during his execution is to go on display. \u201cThis undergarment would have been a good thing to wear in January because it is knitted silk, so it would have been a warm garment,\u201d said Meriel Jeater, a curator at the Museum of London. The silk vest is the star of an exhibition due to open in October that will look at public executions in London from 1196 to 1868. The latter date marks the last such execution \u2013 that of Michael Barrett, who was hanged for murder at Newgate prison after being found guilty of involvement in a bombing. The vest is notable for its stains but whether they are the marks of a sticky end or the contents of a terrified king\u2019s stomach remains unclear. \u201cWe have had tests done on them by forensics labs to try and work out if they are blood, but they were inconclusive,\u201d said Jeater, noting that the stains fluoresce under UV light \u2013 as would be expected for sweat and vomit but not blood.

For example, the vest is thought to have been given to the king\u2019s physician. The stories of others who were executed, and the impact on their families, will also be covered in the exhibition. \u201cWe are mapping execution sites and also places where bodies were gibbeted, so they are hung in gibbet cages as a warning against crime,\u201d said Jeater. London Bridge is well known as a site where the heads of traitors were displayed. \u201cThere were so many different places in London where you could encounter either an execution itself or the aftermath of that,\u201d she said. Those who witnessed executions will also be under scrutiny \u2013 from why they turned up to how they reacted. \u201cThey could be quite supportive to somebody who was being executed and throw flowers to them and shout \u2018good luck\u2019 and things like that,\u201d said Jeater. \u201cOr if it was a particular horrible crime that had been committed, they could totally vilify the person who was being hanged, and throw things, and swear and shout at them and boo and hiss.\u201d",

She was seen within two weeks but told her cervix \u201clooked normal\u201d.</p> <p>In November she was still unwell and her GP made a third referral to the specialists, who saw her in February 2017.</p> <p>She was due to undergo further tests at Southmead the following month but decided to see a consultant at a private hospital instead.</p> <p>On examining O\u2019Connor, they immediately suspected cervical cancer, which was later confirmed. Further tests showed signs her cancer had spread and she underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p> <p>Consultant gynaecologist Prof Robert Hammond said if the smear test had been acted upon, O\u2019Connor would had the affected cells removed \u2013 giving her less than 1% chance of developing cervical cancer in the future.</p> <p>Voisin asked Hammond: \u201cIs it fair to say she would not have died in February, if she did?\u201d He replied: \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>During the inquest, O\u2019Connor\u2019s husband, Kevin, 50, who works for the Civil Aviation Authority, expressed concern at her inquest that there could be many other \u201cvictims\u201d.</p> <p>He said there were \u201csystemic failures\u201d by North Bristol NHS trust in the care of his wife and raised concerns about the investigations into what went wrong.</p> <p>\u201cI am concerned about the trust\u2019s ability to learn from past mistakes. The root cause analysis does not look at the root underlying cause,\u201d he said. \u201cThe root cause analysis does not account for further potential victims. I am extremely concerned that a proper wider independent investigation has not taken place.</p> <p>\u201cThis negligence is of serious public concern. There may be other victims who have received false negative pathology reports, and false gynaecology clinician examinations, at the North Bristol NHS trust, who need to be reviewed.\u201d</p> <p>North Bristol NHS Trust deputy medical Director Tim Whittlestone said: \u201cFirstly I would like to repeat on behalf of North Bristol NHS Trust our sincere apology for the mistakes we made in failing to diagnose Julie\u2019s cancer.</p> <p>\u201cI would also like to say how sorry we are to her loving family and friends for causing them pain, distress and loss.</p> <p>\u201cNorth Bristol has investigated these errors and more importantly that we have learnt lessons from our mistakes.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to reassure patients that as a result of Julie we have improved the way we examine patients and diagnose cervical cancer.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "There were gross failures in the care of a nurse who died from cervical cancer after doctors wrongly told her a smear test and biopsy were normal, a coroner has concluded. The Avon coroner, Maria Voisin, said neglect contributed to the death of 49-year-old Julie O\u2019Connor, who died in a hospice in February last year 12 months after the cancer was finally confirmed. Voisin said: \u201cIt is clear there are a number of failures in her care, that her condition should have been known and action should have been taken when it was not.\u201d She spelled out four failures and three gross failures from September 2014 to November 2016. O\u2019Connor repeatedly went to see her GP over a 14-month period complaining of gynaecological problems and was referred three times \u2013 twice under the two-week cancer pathway \u2013 to Southmead hospital in Bristol for further tests. One expert said O\u2019Connor would have had less than a 1% chance of developing cervical cancer had she received the appropriate treatment when she was wrongly given the all-clear from the smear test in 2014. A second said there was clear evidence of cancer when O\u2019Connor had a biopsy in October 2015 and a third said had O\u2019Connor\u2019s cancer been diagnosed and treated in August 2016 she most likely would have survived for at least five years. The inquest heard that by August 2016 O\u2019Connor had returned to her GP with the same symptoms and was referred back to Southmead. She was seen within two weeks but told her cervix \u201clooked normal\u201d. In November she was still unwell and her GP made a third referral to the specialists, who saw her in February 2017. She was due to undergo further tests at Southmead the following month but decided to see a consultant at a private hospital instead. On examining O\u2019Connor, they immediately suspected cervical cancer, which was later confirmed. Further tests showed signs her cancer had spread and she underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Consultant gynaecologist Prof Robert Hammond said if the smear test had been acted upon, O\u2019Connor would had the affected cells removed \u2013 giving her less than 1% chance of developing cervical cancer in the future. Voisin asked Hammond: \u201cIs it fair to say she would not have died in February, if she did?\u201d He replied: \u201cYes.\u201d During the inquest, O\u2019Connor\u2019s husband, Kevin, 50, who works for the Civil Aviation Authority, expressed concern at her inquest that there could be many other \u201cvictims\u201d. He said there were \u201csystemic failures\u201d by North Bristol NHS trust in the care of his wife and raised concerns about the investigations into what went wrong. \u201cI am concerned about the trust\u2019s ability to learn from past mistakes. The root cause analysis does not look at the root underlying cause,\u201d he said. \u201cThe root cause analysis does not account for further potential victims. I am extremely concerned that a proper wider independent investigation has not taken place. \u201cThis negligence is of serious public concern. There may be other victims who have received false negative pathology reports, and false gynaecology clinician examinations, at the North Bristol NHS trust, who need to be reviewed.\u201d North Bristol NHS Trust deputy medical Director Tim Whittlestone said: \u201cFirstly I would like to repeat on behalf of North Bristol NHS Trust our sincere apology for the mistakes we made in failing to diagnose Julie\u2019s cancer. \u201cI would also like to say how sorry we are to her loving family and friends for causing them pain, distress and loss. \u201cNorth Bristol has investigated these errors and more importantly that we have learnt lessons from our mistakes. \u201cI would like to reassure patients that as a result of Julie we have improved the way we examine patients and diagnose cervical cancer.\u201d",

It is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/28/why-1917-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar\" title=\"\">great film</a>, but it reflects a current big-screen aversion to engaging with the issues that determine our fate. It restricts itself so entirely to the felt experience of its principals that we are left knowing nothing, not just of the vast conflict of which their story forms part, but even of what brought them into it.</p> <p>Only thus, you may be told, can we really get to feel what war is like, but the first world war\u2019s extensive celluloid canon suggests otherwise. In 1931, the Academy\u2019s best picture award <a href=\"https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1931\" title=\"\">went to</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1079273,00.html\" title=\"\">All Quiet on the Western Front</a>. Whether or not this film is more or less harrowing than 1917 can be debated, but its claim to being the greatest-ever anti-war film rests on more than its depiction of the frontline experience. It finds room to explore the ideology behind warfare; its soldiers discuss the causes of war as well as its impact on them. It deals in attitudes displayed in training camps and on the home front as well as on the battlefield.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8696cdb6e3f888116e95a2139d010800986dc63a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8696cdb6e3f888116e95a2139d010800986dc63a/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For Sama answers some questions on the war in Syria, but leaves others unanswered.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For Sama answers some questions on the war in Syria, but leaves others unanswered.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is good to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/15/for-sama-review-documentary-aleppo-syria\" title=\"\">For Sama</a> making Bafta\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-british-academy-film-awards-nominees-winners-2020#outstanding-british-film-\" title=\"\">best British</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-british-academy-film-awards-nominees-winners-2020#outstanding-british-film-\" title=\"\">documentaries list.</a> Waad al-Kateab has done as much for civilians as a vast swathe of celluloid has done for warriors.

On the contrary, mostly, they press you to do the opposite. Their aim is to reinforce approved prejudices rather than to open minds.</p> <p>Ken Loach\u2019s otherwise under-appreciated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sorry-we-missed-you\" title=\"\">Sorry We Missed You</a> deserves its place on Bafta\u2019s British list.

Yet Harvey Weinstein no longer poses a threat: he is on trial. #MeToo no longer needs to be promoted; perhaps it is instead time to interrogate the phenomenon.</p> <p>To find genuinely thought-provoking contenders, we need to turn to Asia.

It tries to present an authentic portrait of both sides of the cultural and economic divide. The plot is absurdly comical, but emerges from genuine social observation. The privileged and the disadvantaged are convincingly attractive and persuasively flawed. Consequently, we are forced to question our preconceptions and reappraise the makeup of our world.</p> <p>Another gem directed by an Asian actor is even more tellingly illuminating. Though comprehensively snubbed by Oscar voters, Lulu Wang\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/21/the-farewell-review-lulu-wang-awkwafina\" title=\"\">The Farewell</a> has crawled on to Bafta\u2019s foreign-language list. Its tale seems simple enough. A New York-based Chinese-American called Billi returns to the land of her birth to join her relatives in saying goodbye to her grandmother, who has terminal lung cancer. Billi discovers that, in keeping with ancient custom, the family intend to withhold the truth from the patient. They will stage a fake wedding to explain the clan reunion. Billi protests, she is overruled, accepts the ruling and goes home. And her grandmother lives on. That\u2019s pretty much it.</p> <p>The film has been regarded as a family comedy. As it doesn\u2019t have many laughs, that perhaps explains why it has not broken through. But from its simple domestic dynamics, it manages to wring a message of deep import. The refusal to inform the grandmother turns out to reflect an outlook that wholly separates China from America. Billi believes her grandmother\u2019s humanity entitles her to control of her fate; her family believe that suppressing her autonomy for the communal good will make everyone happier.</p> <p>Whether the Chinese are like westerners or different from them is a key question of our time. Are we all the same under the skin, aspiring to live the same kind of lives? We need to know to determine how to approach Huawei, Hong Kong, the Uighurs, epidemiology and climate policy, not to speak of a looming geopolitical showdown.</p> <p>And the answer, according to The Farewell, is no, the Chinese are different and will not become like us just because we expect them to.

      "bodyText": "This season\u2019s lineup of awards contenders has much to offer: it may be the best crop of hopefuls for a decade. Fine direction, acting, sound, design and technical innovation deliver a feast for the eye, ear, heart and soul. But for the brain? Not so much. Leading the race, according to the bookies, for the biggest prize of both Baftas and Oscars is 1917. It is a great film, but it reflects a current big-screen aversion to engaging with the issues that determine our fate. It restricts itself so entirely to the felt experience of its principals that we are left knowing nothing, not just of the vast conflict of which their story forms part, but even of what brought them into it. Only thus, you may be told, can we really get to feel what war is like, but the first world war\u2019s extensive celluloid canon suggests otherwise. In 1931, the Academy\u2019s best picture award went to All Quiet on the Western Front. Whether or not this film is more or less harrowing than 1917 can be debated, but its claim to being the greatest-ever anti-war film rests on more than its depiction of the frontline experience. It finds room to explore the ideology behind warfare; its soldiers discuss the causes of war as well as its impact on them. It deals in attitudes displayed in training camps and on the home front as well as on the battlefield. It is good to see For Sama making Bafta\u2019s best British and documentaries list. Waad al-Kateab has done as much for civilians as a vast swathe of celluloid has done for warriors. Sama will be in no doubt about what her mother went through. But when she grows up, she may also wonder why Syria\u2019s fate was sealed in the way it was. She will learn what the rebels did, but not whether they should have done it, how they might have succeeded or who is to blame for their failure. \u201cWill you blame me for staying here or blame me for leaving?\u201d asks Waad, but the film does not equip her daughter to decide. She will have to look elsewhere. The big beasts of the awards jungle, such as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Irishman, entertain us from worlds safely removed from matters of real current concern. Joker might have engaged properly with mental illness, but instead opts for vacuous horrifics. Jojo Rabbit sounds as if it might be serious, but is not, weird and wonderful though it may be. Marriage Story studiously avoids any discussion of the rights and wrongs, or the explanations and implications of the interactions it so meticulously depicts. Instead, it invites us simply to share the protagonists\u2019 feelings. The Personal History of David Copperfield strips Dickens\u2019s tale of the author\u2019s social commentary and concentrates on the laughs. In the nomination lists, you can find films that enact debate. The Two Popes elegantly explores a real argument, but it is not one that need cost you sleep unless you are a cardinal. Bait is a thoroughly impressive portrait of authentic social strife but, unless you are Cornish, you don\u2019t have to take sides. Not that there aren\u2019t films that do connect with today\u2019s urgent issues. The trouble is, they don\u2019t invite you to think these issues through. On the contrary, mostly, they press you to do the opposite. Their aim is to reinforce approved prejudices rather than to open minds. Ken Loach\u2019s otherwise under-appreciated Sorry We Missed You deserves its place on Bafta\u2019s British list. It is less eager to ram its message down your throat than some of his previous offerings. Still, you would not expect to come out of the cinema shocked to discover that the gig economy might have a positive side. Little Women, Wild Rose, Frozen II and Judy are keen to assure you that women are full-blooded, feisty achievers, and not the weedy sissies you may have thought them. Harriet brings us the news that this is even more the case if they are women of colour. OK, but didn\u2019t we get the memo on this a while back? Bombshell dares to open the lid on harassment in the workplace. Yet Harvey Weinstein no longer poses a threat: he is on trial. #MeToo no longer needs to be promoted; perhaps it is instead time to interrogate the phenomenon. To find genuinely thought-provoking contenders, we need to turn to Asia. We think it is we British who know about class; yet it has fallen to Korea to turn social caste into awards fodder. Unthinkably for a foreign-language film, Parasite has made the cut for both top-picture shortlists. It has achieved this not just by wit, charm and verve, but by subtle social analysis. Bong Joon-ho\u2019s film is no Loach-like diatribe, vilifying the rich and sanctifying the poor. It tries to present an authentic portrait of both sides of the cultural and economic divide. The plot is absurdly comical, but emerges from genuine social observation. The privileged and the disadvantaged are convincingly attractive and persuasively flawed. Consequently, we are forced to question our preconceptions and reappraise the makeup of our world. Another gem directed by an Asian actor is even more tellingly illuminating. Though comprehensively snubbed by Oscar voters, Lulu Wang\u2019s The Farewell has crawled on to Bafta\u2019s foreign-language list. Its tale seems simple enough. A New York-based Chinese-American called Billi returns to the land of her birth to join her relatives in saying goodbye to her grandmother, who has terminal lung cancer. Billi discovers that, in keeping with ancient custom, the family intend to withhold the truth from the patient. They will stage a fake wedding to explain the clan reunion. Billi protests, she is overruled, accepts the ruling and goes home. And her grandmother lives on. That\u2019s pretty much it. The film has been regarded as a family comedy. As it doesn\u2019t have many laughs, that perhaps explains why it has not broken through. But from its simple domestic dynamics, it manages to wring a message of deep import. The refusal to inform the grandmother turns out to reflect an outlook that wholly separates China from America. Billi believes her grandmother\u2019s humanity entitles her to control of her fate; her family believe that suppressing her autonomy for the communal good will make everyone happier. Whether the Chinese are like westerners or different from them is a key question of our time. Are we all the same under the skin, aspiring to live the same kind of lives? We need to know to determine how to approach Huawei, Hong Kong, the Uighurs, epidemiology and climate policy, not to speak of a looming geopolitical showdown. And the answer, according to The Farewell, is no, the Chinese are different and will not become like us just because we expect them to. Our individualism and their collectivism are intrinsic. Expressed through family life, rather than the formal data of politics, this finding comes with a force only cinema could give it. Nowadays, however, few films provide us with such insights into the issues of the day. The rise of populism has yielded no equivalent of Chaplin\u2019s The Great Dictator. Our crisis of capitalism has yet to produce its Metropolis. Fear of artificial intelligence has not delivered a 2001. Even the likes of The Truman Show, Thank You for Smoking, Lincoln, Children of Men, Blade Runner, The Matrix, District 9, Her and Arrival seem to have dried up. Perhaps the explanation lies in the new McCarthyism that has seized the film world. To address controversial questions, you have to be prepared to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy.

Even in the earliest numbers, the differences between the composers are clear. Nadia is the more conservative, stylistically cautious \u2013 her songs take middle-period Faur\u00e9 as their starting point \u2013 while her sister\u2019s pieces are melodically and harmonically much more chromatic.

      "bodyText": "Last year, tenor Nicholas Phan and pianist Myra Huang built a recital disc around Faur\u00e9\u2019s song cycle La Bonne Chanson. They have followed it with a disc devoted to the songs of two composers who knew Faur\u00e9 from their childhoods. Lili Boulanger, who died during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic at the age of 24, is recognised as one of the 20th century\u2019s great unfulfilled talents, while her elder sister Nadia, who died in 1979, went on to become one of its most influential teachers , espousing the doctrine of neoclassicism. Lili\u2019s songs dominate this disc \u2013 there are 16 by her (including the song cycle Clari\u00e8res dans le Ciel, set to poems by Francis Jammes) against five by her sister (which include two settings of Maeterlinck and two of Verlaine). Even in the earliest numbers, the differences between the composers are clear. Nadia is the more conservative, stylistically cautious \u2013 her songs take middle-period Faur\u00e9 as their starting point \u2013 while her sister\u2019s pieces are melodically and harmonically much more chromatic. Some of the piano accompaniments in Lili\u2019s song cycle, for instance, such as that for the fourth song, Un Po\u00e8te Disait, could have been lifted from a Debussy prelude. What they share, though, is meticulous concern for every musical and verbal detail, and Phan\u2019s wonderfully poised and precise singing matches it perfectly. As his recording of La Bonne Chanson has already shown, he is an outstanding interpreter of French song, and Huang is an equally attentive partner. It\u2019s hard to imagine these Boulanger songs could have more convincing advocacy. This week\u2019s other pick The latest of Sony Classical\u2019s complete album collections brings together recordings the US soprano Eileen Farrell made for Columbia between 1946 and 1962.

Rapeseed oil is a great store cupboard swap as it\u2019s lower in saturated fat, higher in vitamin E, and has a higher smoking point than olive oil, which makes it versatile for cooking and drizzling. British chefs such as Tom Kerridge and Jamie Oliver love it, as it\u2019s UK-produced and brings a golden hue to roast potatoes, makes a slightly nutty salad dressing, and has a subtle enough flavour for baking too.

Fibre doesn\u2019t sound like the sexiest part of a healthy diet, but it\u2019s essential for gut health, reducing cholesterol and the risk of type 2 diabetes and bowel cancer. Wholemeal rice takes slightly longer to cook than white rice, but it has 4.5 times more fibre than white, which keeps you feeling fuller for longer and is better for digestion too.

Quinoa takes 10-15 minutes to cook, it\u2019s gluten-free, and bulks out a main meal or lunch as an alternative to unrefined pasta, rice or bread. Try stirring quinoa and cooked lentils through your favourite tomato sauce for a vegan take on bolognese sauce, or enjoy with hot milk and your favourite fruits for a virtuous breakfast.</p> <p><strong>Spice it up<br></strong>Swap high-sugar, pre-prepared sauces and dressings with dried herbs and spices for healthier flavours and lots of colour in your cooking. Turmeric brings a golden glow to stews and curries, while ground ginger gives a warming boost to stir-fries when you can feel a cold coming on. Herbs and spices are a natural flavour rush; sprinkling whole fennel seeds on roasted veg or a few chilli flakes on your scrambled eggs will stop you reaching for salty, sugary sauces, and make the finished dish look prettier too.</p> <p><strong>Sweet potatoes<br></strong>Sweet potatoes are the unsung hero of the vegetable drawer. They\u2019re a complex carbohydrate, with a lower glycemic index ranking than normal potatoes, which means they\u2019re digested and release energy more slowly. Sweet potatoes are also rich in the antioxidant beta-carotene, which gives them their gorgeous colour, and they count as one of your five-a-day (which white potatoes don\u2019t).

Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz only have naturally occurring sugars from the tomato sauce and no artificial sweeteners, so you can keep your beans on toast and still enjoy all the health benefits. Half a can is one of your five-a-day, and they\u2019re naturally low in fat with just 1% of recommended dietary allowance (RDA) per portion. To find more low-sugar varieties in your weekly shop, the NHS advises checking the label for \u201ccarbohydrates (of which sugars)\u201c figure: more than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g is high, and should be avoided, and 5g or less per 100g is low and the way to go. So Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, with 1.9g of sugar per 100g, more than delivers on a lower sugar option without compromising on taste.</p> <p><strong>2 Eat less meat<br></strong>Chickpeas, jackfruit and meat-free burgers are everywhere right now with veganism and vegetarianism on the rise, along with \u201cflexitarians\u201d \u2013 people who\u2019ve made a decision to reduce their intake of animal products. Meat is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals, but the Department of Health advises eating just 70g cooked red and processed meat per day as a healthier choice. Try eating good quality meat just once or twice a week, and try beans, lentils, tofu or mushrooms in your go-to recipes as an alternative, meat-free source of protein.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/full-of-beanz/2020/jan/30/simple-swaps-how-to-keep-your-kitchen-cupboard-stocked-with-healthier-choices\">Simple swaps: how to keep your kitchen cupboard stocked with healthier choices</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3 Reduce salt<br></strong>Seventy-five percent of the salt we eat is found in everyday foods such as bread, snacks, breakfast cereals, tinned food and ready meals. Adults should only consume about one teaspoon of salt per day (6g), but the national UK average is 30% higher (8g), which has been linked to increased risk of heart disease. Cut down on naturally salty foods such as bacon, cheese, prawns, sausages or ham, and go for reduced salt versions of core ingredients such as stock cubes, sauces, soy sauce or tinned vegetables. Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz have 25% less salt than standard baked beans, for example, so you can feel twice as virtuous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4df73be7c020622f1d28404fe63a02336e41f61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4df73be7c020622f1d28404fe63a02336e41f61/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of a young family preparing breakfast together in their kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fibre needn\u2019t mean breakfast cereal - fruit and veg can also be fibre-rich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AleksandarNakic/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4 Eat more fibre<br></strong>Fibre is essential for healthy digestion, but we just don\u2019t eat enough. The British Nutrition Foundation recommends adults eat 30g per day, but the average daily intake is currently a rather meagre 17-20g. You don\u2019t have to start the day with a bowl of cardboard-tasting brown cereal to get your quota; try foods that are naturally high in fibre like No Added Sugar Beanz, fibre-rich fruit and veg such as bananas, raspberries, broccoli or carrots, or nuts and seeds. Chia seeds are a small but mighty source of fibre: they\u2019re 40% fibre by weight and perfect for sprinkling on wholegrain cereal, porridge, or in a smoothie.</p> <p><strong>5 Smaller portion sizes<br></strong>This might be the trickiest one of all, especially if your eyes are bigger than your stomach. Overeating is a common cause of unhealthy eating habits, as restaurants serve larger portions and when we\u2019re cooking at home it\u2019s easy to go for second helpings. Recommended portion sizes are often less than we think; the British Dietetic Association recommends 2-3 tablespoons of cooked rice or pasta, or one medium slice of bread as a portion of carbs, for example, and a portion of cheddar cheese should be no bigger than a small matchbox. Check the label for the recommended serving size, and stick to it. There\u2019s no point opting for healthier food, and then eating twice as much.</p> <p><strong>6 Focus on your food<br></strong>This trick requires you to do almost nothing at all. If you focus on what you\u2019re eating, put your knife and fork down between bites, and eat a little more mindfully, then you might find yourself feeling more satisfied and making healthier choices. If we eat without paying attention or while doing something else then we\u2019re missing out on the pleasure of eating, and taking your time helps your brain know when you feel full sooner, avoids overeating, and aids digestion too.</p> <p><strong>7 Snack happy<br></strong>Snacks aren\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d in themselves; it\u2019s natural to have peaks and troughs of energy throughout the day and look for a little late afternoon pick-me-up. It\u2019s only when snacks are packed with sugar, salt or added fats that we should think twice and step away from the biscuit tin. Slow-release energy snacks under 100 calories are best, which will fill you up and not just give you a sugar high. Try keeping an oat bar in your bag, slip a packet of nuts or dried fruit in your coat pocket, or have a banana close at hand in the office. If you make healthier snacks quick and easy to get hold of, you\u2019re less likely to resort to that bag of crisps or chocolate bar when you\u2019re feeling low.</p> <p><em>Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N7954.133705GUARDIAN.CO.UK/B23701153.266418678;dc_trk_aid=461161149;dc_trk_cid=127815858;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></em></p>",

A book hailed as a \u201cGrapes of Wrath for our times\u201d and \u201cthe great novel of las Americas\u201d by such respected authors as Don Winslow and Sandra Cisneros. The plot? It is the story of a Mexican mother and her son who flee drug cartel violence. Oprah Winfrey gave it her seal of approval. Cummins \u2013 who self-identifies as white but with a Puerto Rican grandmother \u2013 was sitting on top of the literary world.</p> <p>\u200bBut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/24/publishers-defend-american-dirt-claims-cultural-appropriation-jeanine-cummins-oprah\">cracks in this great sensation</a> had already been showing, in the form of a scathing online <a href=\"https://tropicsofmeta.com/2019/12/12/pendeja-you-aint-steinbeck-my-bronca-with-fake-ass-social-justice-literature/\">review</a> published in December (about six weeks before the official publication of American Dirt) by a talented self-described Chicana writer named Myriam Gurba. The review \u2013 which has long since gone viral and quoted in numerous well-regarded publications \u2013 did not spare an ounce of anger or disgust for this book. Supporting her review on the novel\u2019s language and absurd plot lines, Gurba argued that Cummins was guilty of \u201cappropriating genius works by people of color\u201d, \u201cslapping a coat of mayonesa on them to make palatable to taste buds estados-unidenses\u201d and \u201crepackaging them for mass racially \u2018colorblind\u2019 consumption\u201d.</p> <p>\u200bThe critical dam eventually broke with other Latinx writers such as David Bowles, Daniel Pe\u00f1a, Esmeralda Bermudez and Luis Alberto Urrea coming out with powerful critiques that echoed Gurba\u2019s early review but through the particular lenses of their own individual Latinx experiences.</p> <p>One of the biggest cracks came in the form of a New York Times review by Parul Sehgal condemning the novel.

      "bodyText": "Why are Latinx writers so angry about the novel American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins? If you have to ask, the odds are you are neither Latinx nor a writer. Let me try to explain. But first, a recap: in a bidding war, Flatiron Books purchased the rights to publish American Dirt by paying a reported seven-figure advance to Cummins. What kind of book commands such an astronomical sum? A book hailed as a \u201cGrapes of Wrath for our times\u201d and \u201cthe great novel of las Americas\u201d by such respected authors as Don Winslow and Sandra Cisneros. The plot? It is the story of a Mexican mother and her son who flee drug cartel violence. Oprah Winfrey gave it her seal of approval. Cummins \u2013 who self-identifies as white but with a Puerto Rican grandmother \u2013 was sitting on top of the literary world. But cracks in this great sensation had already been showing, in the form of a scathing online review published in December (about six weeks before the official publication of American Dirt) by a talented self-described Chicana writer named Myriam Gurba. The review \u2013 which has long since gone viral and quoted in numerous well-regarded publications \u2013 did not spare an ounce of anger or disgust for this book. Supporting her review on the novel\u2019s language and absurd plot lines, Gurba argued that Cummins was guilty of \u201cappropriating genius works by people of color\u201d, \u201cslapping a coat of mayonesa on them to make palatable to taste buds estados-unidenses\u201d and \u201crepackaging them for mass racially \u2018colorblind\u2019 consumption\u201d. The critical dam eventually broke with other Latinx writers such as David Bowles, Daniel Pe\u00f1a, Esmeralda Bermudez and Luis Alberto Urrea coming out with powerful critiques that echoed Gurba\u2019s early review but through the particular lenses of their own individual Latinx experiences. One of the biggest cracks came in the form of a New York Times review by Parul Sehgal condemning the novel. Sehgal observed that the \u201creal failures of the book \u2026 have little to do with the writer\u2019s identity and everything to do with her abilities as a novelist\u201d. Cummins certainly did not help her cause. In her author\u2019s note, she asserted: \u201cAt worst, we perceive [migrants] as an invading mob of resource \u2013 draining criminals, and, at best, a sort of helpless, impoverished, faceless brown mass, clamoring for help at our doorstep. We seldom think of them as our fellow human beings.\u201d This \u201cexplanation\u201d is offensive on so many levels (faceless brown mass?), the least of which it mirrors the hateful, bigoted stereotypes pushed by Donald Trump to support his promise to build a great wall at our southern border. The publisher has made it worse by cancelling Cummins\u2019 book tour with a statement that there were \u201cconcerns about safety\u201d and that \u201cwe believe there exists real peril to\u201d Cummins and various booksellers. I would not be shocked if Donald Trump cites to such fearmongering at a re-election rally. So, yes, Latinx writers are angry. And it\u2019s not that we think only Latinx writers should write Latinx-themed books. No, this is not about censorship. A talented writer who does the hard work can create convincing, powerful works of literature about other cultures. That\u2019s called art. American Dirt is not art. American Dirt is an insult to Latinx writers who have toiled \u2013 some of us for decades \u2013 to little notice of major publishers and book reviewers, while building a vast collection of breathtaking, authentic literature often published by university and independent presses on shoestring budgets. And while the folks who run Flatiron Books have every right to pay seven figures to buy and publish a book like American Dirt, they have no immunity from bad reviews and valid criticism. And that\u2019s why more than 90 Latinx and other writers signed an open letter to Oprah Winfrey asking her to rethink the much-publicized inclusion of American Dirt in her renowned book club. I signed on to this letter with the hope Winfrey will do the right thing. Yes, we are angry. But we will not be silenced. We are Latinx writers \u2013 with the support of our allies \u2013 who have been fighting too long to stop now. Radical change is needed in the publishing industry, not simply with respect to Latinx writers, but all marginalized writers who have important stories to tell based on their own lives and experiences. Perhaps American Dirt will be remembered not as a great novel, but as a key pivot-point for an industry that desperately needs to change.

Four years on, after raising the number of responses to 7,893, <a href=\"https://blog.leeandlow.com/2020/01/28/2019diversitybaselinesurvey/\">it found that 76% were white</a>.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the sample size difference, this 3% change in white employees does not meet the bar for statistically significant change,\u201d said the survey\u2019s authors. \u201cIn other words, the field is just as white today as it was four years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Seven per cent of respondents described themselves as \u201cAsian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander\u201d, with 6% \u201cHispanic/Latino/Mexican\u201d, 5% \u201cblack/African American\u201d and \u201cbiracial/multiracial\u201d at 3%. Native Americans and Middle Easterners each comprise less than 1% of publishing staff.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time when readers of all backgrounds were demanding to see themselves in books, the publishing industry came nowhere near to reflecting the rich diversity of the US,\u201d concludes the report. \u201cThe people behind the books serve as gatekeepers, who can make a huge difference in determining which stories are amplified and which are shut out.

Multicultural children\u2019s publisher Lee &amp; Low Books last surveyed the sector in 2015, when it found that 79% of respondents identified as white. Four years on, after raising the number of responses to 7,893, it found that 76% were white. \u201cGiven the sample size difference, this 3% change in white employees does not meet the bar for statistically significant change,\u201d said the survey\u2019s authors. \u201cIn other words, the field is just as white today as it was four years ago.\u201d Seven per cent of respondents described themselves as \u201cAsian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander\u201d, with 6% \u201cHispanic/Latino/Mexican\u201d, 5% \u201cblack/African American\u201d and \u201cbiracial/multiracial\u201d at 3%. Native Americans and Middle Easterners each comprise less than 1% of publishing staff. \u201cAt a time when readers of all backgrounds were demanding to see themselves in books, the publishing industry came nowhere near to reflecting the rich diversity of the US,\u201d concludes the report. \u201cThe people behind the books serve as gatekeepers, who can make a huge difference in determining which stories are amplified and which are shut out. If the people who work in publishing are not a diverse group, how can diverse voices truly be represented in its books?\u201d The authors welcomed a drop in the proportion of white executives from 86% in 2015 to 78%, \u201csince true change in company culture almost always requires buy-in from the very top\u201d. But the numbers of white people in editorial roles increased from 82% to 85%, \u201cso, even though more diverse books are being published now, it\u2019s fair to assume that the majority of them are still being acquired and edited by white people\u201d.

When booking flights and travelling to visit family in the EU, which passport should we use? I\u2019m concerned if they travel </strong><strong>to the UK on their EU passport, they\u2019ll be penalised as not having settled status, and be penalised flying into the EU on a UK passport.</strong><br><em>Social care worker, Warwickshire</em><br><br>You can use either passport as immigration rules remain exactly the same for the next 11 months. There is no requirement for any EU citizen to present evidence of settled status to anyone as free movement applies until 31 December under the legally binding withdrawal agreement. What happens after that remains to be determined.</p> <p><strong>I am a medical doctor from Madrid, Spain, doing a short clinical fellowship in oncology at the Royal Marsden </strong><strong>hospital. I am in London for three months but have to make a trip to Madrid before I complete my last month. Will I have any problems? Do I need my passport or any additional documentation?</strong><br><em>Spanish citizen, London</em></p> <p>No extra documents are needed but passports and ID cards will be required as usual on entering the country. The UK remains in the single market until 31 December and EU rules on free movement will continue to apply until next year. So EU citizens are free to study, work or retire in the UK for the next 11 months.</p> <p><strong>As a dual national, will I get into enormous trouble if I return to the UK on my Polish passport after 31 Jan</strong><strong>uary without having my British one? It\u2019s obviously a fairly avoidable situation but I\u2019d kind of like to know how much trouble it could cause, or whether I would in fact be fine travelling on my EU passport still.</strong><br><em>Andrzej Lukowski, journalist</em></p> <p>No. Your Polish passport will suffice until 31 December as freedom of movement still applies (see previous answers). If anyone asks you for any extra evidence, you\u2019ll have yourself a news story.</p> <h2><strong>Pet </strong><strong>passports</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f40271a03592f47d12829992bf0d9889020db92e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f40271a03592f47d12829992bf0d9889020db92e/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pet passports\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pet passports.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bogdan Cristel/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>My trans</strong><strong>atlantic lifestyle means travel via Dublin or Heathrow, and Belfast. Fair enough, I have to cope, as a UK citizen. But my pet dog </strong><strong>follows separately, on a EU-wide pet passport. My fear is that her travel (flights usually Washington-Frankfurt-Dublin, thence by car to Northern Ireland, or vice-versa) will be utterly imperilled. I cannot find advice from our pet couriers. This may not be important to you, but my heart could soon be broken by post-Brexit regulations.</strong><br><em>Nick Brannon, retired archaeologist</em></p> <p>Nothing will change for your pet before the end of the transition period on 31 December, but what happens afterwards depends on what is negotiated in the next 11 months. At present, dogs, cats and ferrets can travel freely across the EU on an EU pet passport, under the EU pet travel scheme. Nothing on your Dublin and Northern Ireland travels will change, as the island of Ireland will remain one epidemiological area under the withdrawal agreement. It is worth nothing that these special arrangements for Northern Ireland kick in whether they there is a trade deal at the end of this year or not.</p> <p>More generally for those travelling between Great Britain and the rest of the EU (Northern Ireland will for all intents and purposes be treated like the EU) with a pet, what will be required in the way of extra certificates and vaccinations will depend on whether the EU declares the UK a \u201cpart 1 listed third country\u201d for pet travel purposes, a \u201cpart 2 listed third country\u201d or an \u201cunlisted third country\u201d.</p> <p>Vets are hopeful the UK will gain part 1 status, which would require your pet to be microchipped and vaccinated against rabies 21 days before travel, and to hold a UK pet passport. A dozen non-EU European countries have this status.</p> <p>Many more, including the US, are part 2 listed, meaning pets need extra treatments (against tapeworm, for example) plus a vet\u2019s certificate every time they travel. They must also enter the EU at a designated entry point.</p> <p>The conditions for pets from unlisted countries are even stricter. A worst-case scenario could result in owners having to pay considerable sums for extra vaccinations, treatments and certification every time their pets travel, and having to start the process up to four months beforehand. <a href=\"https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/travel-guide/travelling-to-europe-with-pets/\">Full details can be found here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Cross</strong><strong>-border services after Brexit</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca599e983ba6818d3436ffb993d023003049e239\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca599e983ba6818d3436ffb993d023003049e239/0_164_4857_2914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Offering digital services after Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Offering digital services after Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Igor Stevanovic/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><strong>What does Brexit mean for UK companies providing services (digital services in this case) to European clients?

One of the big questions facing services outside the financial sector, where specific regulations apply to protect consumers and investors, is the future of data transfer. General data protection regulation (GDPR) will cease to apply after 31 December and what happens after that remains to be determined.

I still don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll be paying EU fees or not, and they don\u2019t either.

However, for the next 11 months, British citizens retain the free movement rights to study, work and retire in the EU.</p> <h2><strong>Frontier workers</strong></h2> <p><strong>My French girlfriend works as a lecturer in France, teaching a few days a week, and regularly commutes between there and the UK. Post-Brexit, how will this work? She</strong><strong> </strong><strong>doesn\u2019t work here or reside permanently for settled status.<br></strong><em>J, Manchester</em></p> <p>As she is an EU citizen she can study, work and retire in France, without any questions or extra paperwork, for life. The issue will be coming back into the UK after next year. If she is just visiting she may be fine on tourist access; conditions for that have not yet been defined. But if she intends to remain living here, she will be required to demonstrate that she was resident here before Brexit fully happened on 31 December. The government has opened what is called the EU settlement scheme (EUSS), a special immigration category for EU citizens. There is a phone app and the process should be very straightforward. More than 2 million people have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/16/nearly-1-million-eu-citizens-in-uk-yet-to-apply-for-settled-status\">successfully applied</a> for settled status. EU citizens have up to 30 June next year to apply for EUSS but the Home Office is encouraging people to apply before the end of this year to reduce the risk of any difficulties with border control next year.</p> <h2><strong>Healthcare</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"049608569b2e71db85e48ad0b6ce859044121630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/049608569b2e71db85e48ad0b6ce859044121630/0_165_5400_3242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spanish nurses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spanish nurses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: john angerson / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>As a retired British citizen living in the EU, I\u2019m very worried about both my healthcare provision and UK state pension after Brexit. I\u2019ve heard so many different versions. What is the situation exactly </strong><strong>\u2013 should I be concerned?<br></strong><em>Susan Templeton, France</em><br><br>There is a lot of confusion about this: people still have in mind the rules that would have applied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/29/british-pensioners-in-eu-will-lose-nhs-covered-health-care-under-no-deal-brexit\">in the case of a no-deal exit</a>.

      "bodyText": "There is continuing confusion about citizens\u2019 rights after Brexit. We asked you about your concerns, and many wrote in with questions about pension and healthcare rights. You raised other issues too: can I still sail around Europe? Will I pay home fees if I start university in the Netherlands this year? What will happen about my pet\u2019s passport? There is much unfinished Brexit business, as you will see from our answers below, composed with the help of experts and government departments. EU citizens travelling to the UK My children are fortunate enough to have UK and EU passports as their mother is an EU citizen. When booking flights and travelling to visit family in the EU, which passport should we use? I\u2019m concerned if they travel to the UK on their EU passport, they\u2019ll be penalised as not having settled status, and be penalised flying into the EU on a UK passport. Social care worker, Warwickshire You can use either passport as immigration rules remain exactly the same for the next 11 months. There is no requirement for any EU citizen to present evidence of settled status to anyone as free movement applies until 31 December under the legally binding withdrawal agreement. What happens after that remains to be determined. I am a medical doctor from Madrid, Spain, doing a short clinical fellowship in oncology at the Royal Marsden hospital. I am in London for three months but have to make a trip to Madrid before I complete my last month. Will I have any problems? Do I need my passport or any additional documentation? Spanish citizen, London No extra documents are needed but passports and ID cards will be required as usual on entering the country. The UK remains in the single market until 31 December and EU rules on free movement will continue to apply until next year. So EU citizens are free to study, work or retire in the UK for the next 11 months. As a dual national, will I get into enormous trouble if I return to the UK on my Polish passport after 31 January without having my British one? It\u2019s obviously a fairly avoidable situation but I\u2019d kind of like to know how much trouble it could cause, or whether I would in fact be fine travelling on my EU passport still. Andrzej Lukowski, journalist No. Your Polish passport will suffice until 31 December as freedom of movement still applies (see previous answers). If anyone asks you for any extra evidence, you\u2019ll have yourself a news story. Pet passports My transatlantic lifestyle means travel via Dublin or Heathrow, and Belfast. Fair enough, I have to cope, as a UK citizen. But my pet dog follows separately, on a EU-wide pet passport. My fear is that her travel (flights usually Washington-Frankfurt-Dublin, thence by car to Northern Ireland, or vice-versa) will be utterly imperilled. I cannot find advice from our pet couriers. This may not be important to you, but my heart could soon be broken by post-Brexit regulations. Nick Brannon, retired archaeologist Nothing will change for your pet before the end of the transition period on 31 December, but what happens afterwards depends on what is negotiated in the next 11 months. At present, dogs, cats and ferrets can travel freely across the EU on an EU pet passport, under the EU pet travel scheme. Nothing on your Dublin and Northern Ireland travels will change, as the island of Ireland will remain one epidemiological area under the withdrawal agreement. It is worth nothing that these special arrangements for Northern Ireland kick in whether they there is a trade deal at the end of this year or not. More generally for those travelling between Great Britain and the rest of the EU (Northern Ireland will for all intents and purposes be treated like the EU) with a pet, what will be required in the way of extra certificates and vaccinations will depend on whether the EU declares the UK a \u201cpart 1 listed third country\u201d for pet travel purposes, a \u201cpart 2 listed third country\u201d or an \u201cunlisted third country\u201d. Vets are hopeful the UK will gain part 1 status, which would require your pet to be microchipped and vaccinated against rabies 21 days before travel, and to hold a UK pet passport. A dozen non-EU European countries have this status. Many more, including the US, are part 2 listed, meaning pets need extra treatments (against tapeworm, for example) plus a vet\u2019s certificate every time they travel. They must also enter the EU at a designated entry point. The conditions for pets from unlisted countries are even stricter. A worst-case scenario could result in owners having to pay considerable sums for extra vaccinations, treatments and certification every time their pets travel, and having to start the process up to four months beforehand. Full details can be found here. Cross-border services after Brexit What does Brexit mean for UK companies providing services (digital services in this case) to European clients? What changes can we expect? While I see warnings about customs changes for companies that import or export goods, not even the staff at the government\u2019s business Brexit helpline know what implications there are for businesses providing services to European clients. Our European clients ask me what will happen to the services we provide after Brexit and I have to tell them I have no idea. David, south-east England Services have barely had a look-in in the Brexit debate despite the fact that they represent almost 50% of the UK\u2019s economic output \u2013 partly because they are not subject to tariffs and quotas. One of the big questions facing services outside the financial sector, where specific regulations apply to protect consumers and investors, is the future of data transfer. General data protection regulation (GDPR) will cease to apply after 31 December and what happens after that remains to be determined. The House of Commons library has a comprehensive research briefing on services, which is just a month old. Pensions I am a UK citizen living in England and currently receive a German state pension. I worked in West Germany in the 1970s. Will Brexit change this pension and the way I receive it? C, Dorset Your pension from Germany will continue to be paid as it is now under the withdrawal agreement. The threat of it changing was linked to a no-deal Brexit but it is protected for life under the withdrawal agreement. I am 73, retired and Danish and live in Edinburgh. I receive a smattering of state pensions from Denmark, the UK and Luxembourg as well as a small pension from the EU commission. I worry that the transfer of the various pensions will be more expensive. Do you think I am right to worry? L, Edinburgh Your right to receive your aggregated pension is guaranteed under the withdrawal agreement and there is no reason that would change. Studying in the EU I applied for university in the Netherlands, to start in September. I still don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll be paying EU fees or not, and they don\u2019t either. It would be good to know soon because I can\u2019t afford to go if I have to pay non-EU fees. 17-year-old student, London (name supplied) Those who start a course before the end of the transition period will still benefit from the reciprocal home fees arrangements among EU states. A spokesman for the Dutch government confirmed UK students starting courses this September would pay home fees \u2013 currently \u20ac2,043 (\u00a31,722) a year \u2013 for the course\u2019s duration, provided they remain living and registered in the Netherlands. Freedom of movement I\u2019m concerned that while I am currently a European Union citizen, with the right to work and live anywhere in the union, with access to justice and healthcare anywhere in the union, I\u2019m now going to lose that. Michael Wooley, retired teacher, Chichester From 1 February, British citizens who do not have dual nationality with another EU state are no longer European Union citizens. However, for the next 11 months, British citizens retain the free movement rights to study, work and retire in the EU. Frontier workers My French girlfriend works as a lecturer in France, teaching a few days a week, and regularly commutes between there and the UK. Post-Brexit, how will this work? She doesn\u2019t work here or reside permanently for settled status. J, Manchester As she is an EU citizen she can study, work and retire in France, without any questions or extra paperwork, for life. The issue will be coming back into the UK after next year. If she is just visiting she may be fine on tourist access; conditions for that have not yet been defined. But if she intends to remain living here, she will be required to demonstrate that she was resident here before Brexit fully happened on 31 December. The government has opened what is called the EU settlement scheme (EUSS), a special immigration category for EU citizens. There is a phone app and the process should be very straightforward. More than 2 million people have already successfully applied for settled status. EU citizens have up to 30 June next year to apply for EUSS but the Home Office is encouraging people to apply before the end of this year to reduce the risk of any difficulties with border control next year. Healthcare As a retired British citizen living in the EU, I\u2019m very worried about both my healthcare provision and UK state pension after Brexit. I\u2019ve heard so many different versions. What is the situation exactly \u2013 should I be concerned? Susan Templeton, France There is a lot of confusion about this: people still have in mind the rules that would have applied in the case of a no-deal exit. The rules for both healthcare and pensions are clearly set out in the withdrawal agreement, a legally binding international treaty. If you have an S1 reciprocal healthcare form (mainly applies to UK pensioners settled in the EU before 31 December), the UK will continue to meet the healthcare costs of you and your family as long as you remain legally resident in your host country, without time limit. An S1 form will also entitle you to a UK EHIC card for treatment when travelling within the EU, and UK law in any case entitles you to free treatment in Britain. Of course, if you are working in your host country and paying into its social security system, you will continue to be covered for healthcare there as before. The withdrawal agreement also states that UK state pensions, and all other UK benefits that may be paid to non-residents, will continue to be uprated annually, as if you were still living in the UK. This arrangement is also without time limit, contrary to the no-deal plans which no longer apply. Full details are here. Irish passport holders in Britain I was born in Cork, Ireland, and have an Irish passport. I\u2019ve lived in England for the past 61 years, since I was six months old. What are the arrangements for Irish passport holders and am I able to remain indefinitely in the UK? M, West Yorkshire. Irish passport holders are treated separately to the rest of EU citizens under the withdrawal agreement. This is partly because of the common travel area but also because of efforts by the British and Irish governments to ensure reciprocity of rights continues. So you have the right to remain indefinitely in the UK, and to work, study, vote, retire and travel between the UK and Ireland freely. Retiring to Spain (or any other EU member state) I own a house in Spain. I bought the house with the intention of retiring there in a few years. What provisions will be made for the many thousands of people in my position? G, north-east England If you retire to an EU country before the end of the year, you will retain all the rights you currently have, apart from freedom of movement. If you are eligible for a pension or UK-funded healthcare (known as S1), you will retain these rights for life. What you will lose, as it currently stands, are the rights to study, work or retire in another member state. Britons in Europe are campaigning for this right to be granted in the next stage of negotiations, along with the right to return back to the UK with a EU family member, and the right for your children to pay home fees at a British university. This article might be of some interest as it features someone of a similar age (50s) who has just moved to Spain. Residence permits in France The French and British government websites give little practical \u2013 and some contradictory \u2013 guidance about applying for a residence permit. The British government site refers to the French for definitive information. But in many places on their official site, the French authorities state that you will only need to apply for a permit if there is no withdrawal deal. Clearly, there is an agreement, but one only covering the transition period. So, we are in limbo until at least December 2020. How do we plan for retirement, move house, and continue to work when in such intolerable uncertainty? Robin Williams, Savoie, France As a Briton legally resident in France, you are right that nothing will change during the transition period. After that, you will need to apply for a residency permit before June 2021, assuming the transition is not extended or France opts, as it may do under the withdrawal agreement, to extend its administrative deadline itself. It isn\u2019t yet clear how you should apply, so it is probably best to wait until that becomes clear, presumably within the next few months. Until very recently France has focused on the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, and its online application process for post-Brexit residency applications has not yet been updated. We do not know if it will be, or if the government will revert to the old system via local authorities. The permit itself is in any case likely to be a special one for post-Brexit British residents; its design is not yet known. What is clear, however, is that when you do apply for it you\u2019ll need to show you are legally resident \u2013 either in a job, retired, self-employed, a student or self-supporting. If you have been legally resident in France for at least five years, you can apply directly for permanent residency. Otherwise, you will be applying for temporary residency, which you can upgrade later. Boating around Europe I am an army veteran who was medically discharged in 2016 with PTSD after 40 years\u2019 service.

Some in the country mutter that it has been the long-term goal of settlement-building and other Israeli policies that damaged, perhaps fatally, the prospects of the two-state solution.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey fear it is a soft, gradual transfer of Palestinians to Jordan \u2013 by making Palestinian lives unbearable, so those people will come to Jordan and outnumber the native Jordanians,\u201d Barari said.</p> \n<p>The Trump plan, along with recent proposals by Benjamin Netanyahu and his main challenger for the Israeli prime ministership, Benny Gantz, to annex most of the West Bank, are ringing alarm bells in Jordan, according to Curtis Ryan, who studies the country\u2019s politics at Appalachian State University in North Carolina.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Jordanian state still sees the two-state model as the only viable alternative to more draconian policies that might not only disenfranchise Palestinians further, but also threaten Jordan\u2019s independent existence,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Resentment over Israel\u2019s abandonment of the two-state solution is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/26/jordan-israel-25-year-peace-deal-strain-donald-trump\">heaping pressure</a> on Jordan\u2019s 1994 peace treaty with its neighbour. Abdullah said in an interview in December that he considered the two countries\u2019 relationship to be at an all-time low.</p> \n<p>Seven in 10 Jordanians now want to limit ties with Israel, according to a survey last year, and a commercial agreement to begin importing Israeli gas to the country this month drew protests and a rare, unanimous rebuke from the country\u2019s parliament, ordinarily regarded as a rubber-stamp body.</p> \n<p>In one of the low-slung concrete homes of the Baqa\u2019a refugee camp, Layla Abu Kishk channelled her grief and anger into a rendition of the song she said her family sang as they left Jaffa in 1948. \u201cMy kids and their kids have all memorised it,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Her grandson, Rached, 17, listened impassively to the mournful tune. The Trump proposal made him \u201cmad and sad\u201d, he sad. \u201cI don\u2019t feel we will get to go back. Things are getting worse.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he admitted: \u201cI only see Palestine on the news. It\u2019s a part of me, but I\u2019ve been here all my life.\u201d</p> \n<p>He occasionally Googles images of Palestine, \u201cjust to see how it looks\u201d, he said. But his more immediate goal is to qualify for a place at a European university to study medicine.</p> \n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll come back here and develop my country,\u201d Rached said, clarifying: \u201cJordan.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Asmahan Bkerat</em></p>",

The country\u2019s leadership is haunted by the \u201cJordanian option\u201d, an idea popular on the Israeli right that proposes fusing Jordan and Palestine into a single state. Some in the country mutter that it has been the long-term goal of settlement-building and other Israeli policies that damaged, perhaps fatally, the prospects of the two-state solution. \u201cThey fear it is a soft, gradual transfer of Palestinians to Jordan \u2013 by making Palestinian lives unbearable, so those people will come to Jordan and outnumber the native Jordanians,\u201d Barari said. The Trump plan, along with recent proposals by Benjamin Netanyahu and his main challenger for the Israeli prime ministership, Benny Gantz, to annex most of the West Bank, are ringing alarm bells in Jordan, according to Curtis Ryan, who studies the country\u2019s politics at Appalachian State University in North Carolina. \u201cThe Jordanian state still sees the two-state model as the only viable alternative to more draconian policies that might not only disenfranchise Palestinians further, but also threaten Jordan\u2019s independent existence,\u201d he said. Resentment over Israel\u2019s abandonment of the two-state solution is heaping pressure on Jordan\u2019s 1994 peace treaty with its neighbour. Abdullah said in an interview in December that he considered the two countries\u2019 relationship to be at an all-time low. Seven in 10 Jordanians now want to limit ties with Israel, according to a survey last year, and a commercial agreement to begin importing Israeli gas to the country this month drew protests and a rare, unanimous rebuke from the country\u2019s parliament, ordinarily regarded as a rubber-stamp body. In one of the low-slung concrete homes of the Baqa\u2019a refugee camp, Layla Abu Kishk channelled her grief and anger into a rendition of the song she said her family sang as they left Jaffa in 1948. \u201cMy kids and their kids have all memorised it,\u201d she said. Her grandson, Rached, 17, listened impassively to the mournful tune. The Trump proposal made him \u201cmad and sad\u201d, he sad. \u201cI don\u2019t feel we will get to go back. Things are getting worse.\u201d But he admitted: \u201cI only see Palestine on the news. It\u2019s a part of me, but I\u2019ve been here all my life.\u201d He occasionally Googles images of Palestine, \u201cjust to see how it looks\u201d, he said. But his more immediate goal is to qualify for a place at a European university to study medicine. \u201cThen I\u2019ll come back here and develop my country,\u201d Rached said, clarifying: \u201cJordan.\u201d Additional reporting by Asmahan Bkerat",

Parscale is Donald Trump\u2019s social media Rasputin.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps it was no surprise, then, that <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-myths-of-the-genius-behind-trumps-reelection-campaign\">an article co-published last year</a> by the not-for-profit ProPublica and Texas Monthly argued that \u201cParscale\u2019s accounts of his life and his work for the president comprise a classic Trumpian tale: they\u2019re a combination of hyperbole, half-truths and the occasional fiction.\u201d</p> <p>He has described himself as a \u201cfarm boy from Kansas\u201d, the article noted, but actually grew up on a suburban cul-de-sac. Parscale received a basketball scholarship to the University of Texas at San Antonio until injury struck and eventually studied international business and economics at Trinity University in San Antonio, graduating in 1999.</p> <p>He told the Guardian in a phone interview: \u201cEarly years, I thought I might be an athlete but that stalled on me very quickly as I got a little older and found out it\u2019s actually almost harder to become an NBA player than it is to own a company. I always just saw myself as kind of a CEO, as a business leader. I just wanted to be successful. I was always wanting to adapt but I knew I wanted more.\u201d</p> <p>Parscale was relatively quick to understand the digital revolution. \u201cIn 2001, I took the time to start teaching myself web design. I bought my own URL; I think you can go look it up.

I recognized that I was a nobody in San Antonio, but working for the Trumps would be everything.\u201d</p> <p>With Trump\u2019s son Eric as his main ally and champion, Parscale and his company went on to land contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars for work that included websites for Melania Trump\u2019s skincare products, the Trump Winery and the Eric Trump Foundation.</p> <p>In February 2015, over one weekend on his laptop at home, Parscale earned $1,500 by coming up with a landing page for a presidential exploratory committee. That summer, he built the Trump presidential campaign\u2019s website for $10,000.</p> <p>As election year neared, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, called Parscale to ask how he would run digital strategy for the campaign. Parscale recalled in a Washington Post interview that he told Kushner: \u201cIf he wants to be the next president, he has got to harness Facebook. Give me the power, and I can help you win.\u201d</p> <p>He impressed sufficiently to get the nod as the Trump campaign\u2019s digital director, though he ended up also looking after many nuts and bolts of the hastily improvised operation. He oversaw an under-the-radar advertising operation of a hundred people, <a href=\"https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-the-trump-campaign-built-an-identity-database-and-used-facebook-ads-to-win-the-election-4ff7d24269ac\">known as Project Alamo,</a> in a San Antonio industrial park office building, finally switching to Trump Tower a month before the election.</p> <p>Crucially, Parscale realized Facebook\u2019s tentacles reached older voters in small towns and rural areas and exploited the platform more effectively than the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Trump and Parscale are a good match: mavericks with no prior political experience willing to cross lines once considered taboo. Parscale gained the candidate\u2019s trust. In October 2016, just days before the election, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go\">the Bloomberg news agency noted: </a>\u201cParscale is one of the few within Trump\u2019s crew entrusted to tweet on his behalf.\u201d</p> <p>Parscale\u2019s companies have been handsomely remunerated by the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee (RNC), although he denies he got rich personally.

      "bodyText": "\u201cMade my night,\u201d tweeted Brad Parscale, approvingly. He was referring to a doctored video in which his head was superimposed on a professional basketball player, leaping up and swatting away from the basket a ball replaced by Joe Biden\u2019s head. Parscale, 6ft 8in tall, was a student basketball star until his career was snuffed out prematurely by leg and back injuries. He suspects the experience of playing in front of thousands of fervent fans was good training for being a warm-up act at Donald Trump\u2019s rallies. If Trump wins re-election in November, Parscale, his workaholic campaign manager, will have had a lot to do with it. To admirers, the 44-year-old is an alchemist who turns those seemingly chaotic and raucous rallies into a matrix of data that can predict human motivations and behavior with astonishing precision. To detractors, Parscale is the epitome of Trumpian Man: a plain-speaking white guy with a Viking beard who makes no apologies, is unburdened by doubt, and embraces a flame-throwing online persona. He is also seen as a chancer who got lucky because of unquestioning loyalty to the Trump family. \u201cHe\u2019s an over-promoted troll,\u201d said Charlie Sykes, author of How the Right Lost Its Mind. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, added: \u201cTrump is the social media president and Parscale is Trump\u2019s enabler.\u201d Jacobs drew a comparison with a political consultant to Trump\u2019s most recent Republican predecessor. \u201cKarl Rove was credited as George Bush\u2019s brain because of his strategic brilliance. Parscale is Donald Trump\u2019s social media Rasputin.\u201d Perhaps it was no surprise, then, that an article co-published last year by the not-for-profit ProPublica and Texas Monthly argued that \u201cParscale\u2019s accounts of his life and his work for the president comprise a classic Trumpian tale: they\u2019re a combination of hyperbole, half-truths and the occasional fiction.\u201d He has described himself as a \u201cfarm boy from Kansas\u201d, the article noted, but actually grew up on a suburban cul-de-sac. Parscale received a basketball scholarship to the University of Texas at San Antonio until injury struck and eventually studied international business and economics at Trinity University in San Antonio, graduating in 1999. He told the Guardian in a phone interview: \u201cEarly years, I thought I might be an athlete but that stalled on me very quickly as I got a little older and found out it\u2019s actually almost harder to become an NBA player than it is to own a company. I always just saw myself as kind of a CEO, as a business leader. I just wanted to be successful. I was always wanting to adapt but I knew I wanted more.\u201d Parscale was relatively quick to understand the digital revolution. \u201cIn 2001, I took the time to start teaching myself web design. I bought my own URL; I think you can go look it up. I\u2019ve owned it for almost 20 years at parscale.com. I would say that\u2019s as ahead as you can get, right? I would say to my friends, go to my website, and they\u2019re like, how do you go? So that\u2019s early.\u201d Parscale set up a digital marketing agency in San Antonio which, he says, won local entrepreneurship awards and had more than 700 clients at its peak. A fan of The Apprentice, he met the Trump family in 2010 and a year later offered a bid of just $10,000 to design a website for Trump International Realty. Parscale told the Washington Post: \u201cI just made up a price. I recognized that I was a nobody in San Antonio, but working for the Trumps would be everything.\u201d With Trump\u2019s son Eric as his main ally and champion, Parscale and his company went on to land contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars for work that included websites for Melania Trump\u2019s skincare products, the Trump Winery and the Eric Trump Foundation. In February 2015, over one weekend on his laptop at home, Parscale earned $1,500 by coming up with a landing page for a presidential exploratory committee. That summer, he built the Trump presidential campaign\u2019s website for $10,000. As election year neared, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, called Parscale to ask how he would run digital strategy for the campaign. Parscale recalled in a Washington Post interview that he told Kushner: \u201cIf he wants to be the next president, he has got to harness Facebook. Give me the power, and I can help you win.\u201d He impressed sufficiently to get the nod as the Trump campaign\u2019s digital director, though he ended up also looking after many nuts and bolts of the hastily improvised operation. He oversaw an under-the-radar advertising operation of a hundred people, known as Project Alamo, in a San Antonio industrial park office building, finally switching to Trump Tower a month before the election. Crucially, Parscale realized Facebook\u2019s tentacles reached older voters in small towns and rural areas and exploited the platform more effectively than the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Trump and Parscale are a good match: mavericks with no prior political experience willing to cross lines once considered taboo. Parscale gained the candidate\u2019s trust. In October 2016, just days before the election, the Bloomberg news agency noted: \u201cParscale is one of the few within Trump\u2019s crew entrusted to tweet on his behalf.\u201d Parscale\u2019s companies have been handsomely remunerated by the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee (RNC), although he denies he got rich personally. He told the Guardian: \u201cI got 1% from the ad buy in 2016 and I split that 50% with my partner. I\u2019m now just working flat. I get a flat salary.\u201d Parscale was handpicked to lead the re-election campaign despite having never been in charge of a political race before. His high status in the Trump family appears to insulate him from the president\u2019s tendency to \u2013 like a medieval monarch or tinpot dictator \u2013 cast out favourites on a whim. The 2020 campaign is bigger and better-organised than 2016 by several orders of magnitude but no less demanding. Parscale, a divorcee who has remarried, divides his time between the campaign nerve centre in Arlington, Virginia, and a home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \u201cI have no hobbies,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hobbies are watching Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, reading the news and putting on my suit. I do try to read books but that\u2019s mainly for work too. I\u2019ve been reading about every election since 1896 and working my way through. I\u2019ve skipped some years, some of the elections don\u2019t matter as much. I think I\u2019m on my fifth election book right now.\u201d Trump campaign emails are sometimes sent out with Parscale\u2019s name in the sender column and subject headings such as \u201cI just got off the phone with the president \u2026\u201d Merchandise sales, competition entries, campaign rallies and other forms of contact are an opportunity to harvest more data that will be invaluable for targeted ads and get-out-the-vote efforts. Democrats are taking note. The Axios website reported: \u201cTrump\u2019s re-election campaign has deployed Facebook in a bigger way than any campaign in history, outspending all the Democrats combined.\u201d As the familiar soundtrack of Elton John, Queen and the Rolling Stones booms at Trump\u2019s rallies, Parscale has become an increasingly familiar figure on the podium, stoking the flames of crowd anticipation before the main attraction. Behind the scenes, he is also the mastermind of Trump\u2019s slick, hard-hitting and falsehood-strewn campaign ads. Importantly in 2016, the interloper Parscale made peace with the RNC and now hopes to reap the reward. Republican lobbyist Henry Barbour, a partner at Capitol Resources, said: \u201cHe\u2019s very serious about his work. He\u2019s intense, he\u2019s aggressive, he means it. He\u2019s a creative thinker. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging for a guy with his background to manage a campaign. If you had a conventional president, it would be a more conventional campaign.

Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank in Palo Alto, California, said: \u201cI think in 2010, it would have been unimaginable to some degree. \u201cBut where campaigns have come and the degree to which the digital function has penetrated other parts of the campaign, what\u2019s entirely clear is that the digital director or the person who understands the digital side of the campaign is incredibly powerful.

Not according to Kurt Bardella, a former spokesman and senior adviser on the House of Representatives\u2019 oversight committee. \u201cObviously the formula that they used in 2016 is something they\u2019re going to try to duplicate in 2020, which is really the tactic of using social media to try to distort the truth and mislead the American people and con themselves back into the White House. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why he was made the campaign manager.

Everything we do, if you go to a coalition event, you sign up for a thing, you touch it.</p> <p>\u201cIf we touch you digitally, we want to know who you are and how you think and get you into our databases so that we can model off it and relearn and understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Parscale, who in 2016 was digital director of the insurgent Trump campaign, offered a metaphor. \u201cImagine it like it\u2019s a gigantic highway but the only time people drive down it is when there\u2019s a big event. Say you live on the north side, all you do is go to the grocery store but every once in a while there\u2019s a huge football game and that\u2019s the time you drive downtown.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we want to run a billboard at that time for my best sporting thing when we know all the sports people are coming down the street. It\u2019s the same principle, right? And so what we want to do is blow things up when we know the people are on the highway.\u201d</p> <p>Parscale\u2019s efforts, including ads that make misleading claims and clickbait that exploits voters\u2019 grievances, pose a hefty challenge to Democrats.</p> <p>Michael Slaby, who was Barack Obama campaign\u2019s chief technology officer in 2008 and chief integration and innovation officer in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/02/democrats-trump-2020-digital-social-media-campaign\">recently warned</a> the left had suffered \u201cover-confidence\u201d while Trump\u2019s social media strategy forged ahead.</p> <p>Asked if he believes Democrats will try to assemble a similar model, Parscale replied: \u201cWe have no idea what they\u2019re going to build. That\u2019s up to you guys to go figure out. We do have an advantage in time. The president was extremely smart the day after the election to say why take our foot off the gas?</p> <p>\u201cElection day 2016 wasn\u2019t the end of the fight. It was the start of the fight. And let\u2019s just keep going. Let\u2019s keep fundraising. Let\u2019s keep building. This is a fight for eight years. This isn\u2019t a fight just for a few months.\u201d<br><br>At 44 years of age, and 6ft 8in in height, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/politics/brad-parscale-trump-campaign.html\">the bearded Parscale</a>, who was born in Topeka, Kansas, and spent his working life in San Antonio, Texas, has become an improbable and recognizable figure at campaign rallies, warming up the crowd before Trump\u2019s arrival. He said he has three objectives there.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the first one that\u2019s getting up there and saying, we\u2019re almost there, hang with us.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign manager has told of his ambition to build a data-gathering juggernaut based around the principle: \u201cWe want to know who you are and how you think.\u201d Brad Parscale, regarded by critics as an apologist for a uniquely dangerous and divisive US president, described to the Guardian a targeted advertising operation immensely more sophisticated than four years ago. Every time someone donates to the Trump re-election campaign, buys some of its merchandise, registers on its mailing list, enters one of its competitions or attends one of the president\u2019s rallies, there is an opportunity to hoover up an email address and other details that will come in useful later. \u201cThe campaign is all about data collection,\u201d Parscale said in a phone interview with the Guardian. \u201cEvery aspect of this campaign. Everything we do, if you go to a coalition event, you sign up for a thing, you touch it. \u201cIf we touch you digitally, we want to know who you are and how you think and get you into our databases so that we can model off it and relearn and understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d Parscale, who in 2016 was digital director of the insurgent Trump campaign, offered a metaphor. \u201cImagine it like it\u2019s a gigantic highway but the only time people drive down it is when there\u2019s a big event. Say you live on the north side, all you do is go to the grocery store but every once in a while there\u2019s a huge football game and that\u2019s the time you drive downtown. \u201cWell, we want to run a billboard at that time for my best sporting thing when we know all the sports people are coming down the street. It\u2019s the same principle, right? And so what we want to do is blow things up when we know the people are on the highway.\u201d Parscale\u2019s efforts, including ads that make misleading claims and clickbait that exploits voters\u2019 grievances, pose a hefty challenge to Democrats. Michael Slaby, who was Barack Obama campaign\u2019s chief technology officer in 2008 and chief integration and innovation officer in 2012, recently warned the left had suffered \u201cover-confidence\u201d while Trump\u2019s social media strategy forged ahead. Asked if he believes Democrats will try to assemble a similar model, Parscale replied: \u201cWe have no idea what they\u2019re going to build. That\u2019s up to you guys to go figure out. We do have an advantage in time. The president was extremely smart the day after the election to say why take our foot off the gas? \u201cElection day 2016 wasn\u2019t the end of the fight. It was the start of the fight. And let\u2019s just keep going. Let\u2019s keep fundraising. Let\u2019s keep building. This is a fight for eight years. This isn\u2019t a fight just for a few months.\u201d At 44 years of age, and 6ft 8in in height, the bearded Parscale, who was born in Topeka, Kansas, and spent his working life in San Antonio, Texas, has become an improbable and recognizable figure at campaign rallies, warming up the crowd before Trump\u2019s arrival. He said he has three objectives there. \u201cI\u2019m the first one that\u2019s getting up there and saying, we\u2019re almost there, hang with us. It takes hours to get all those people through all the mags [metal detector]. Two, is to rah rah them a little bit, get them pumped up, help them understand the importance of their state and give them just a little bit of boost right before. \u201cAnd then lastly is to get the data so I make them try to all memorise 88022. I make them chant it and memorise it and my goal is to make everybody in America know that number 88022. There is no better methodology to contact voters and raise money than cellphone text messaging.\u201d For all the tools and screens of the digital age, it was clear in 2016 that Trump\u2019s rallies carried an old-fashioned power of live theatre. People in long-forgotten small towns queued for hours to see him, saying they were grateful to be remembered at last. He encouraged them to tell their friends and neighbors about the \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d experience. Yet the crowds at Trump rallies are overwhelmingly white. The president has sometimes fired them up with racist rhetoric towards immigrants or Ilhan Omar, one of the first Muslim women in Congress. He stands accused of deepening divisions in what some have called a cold civil war. Parscale denies the premise and blames the media. \u201cThe news and the media has one job: to sensationalise everything to make money. They\u2019re not there to give us news. They\u2019re there to make money and they have stock prices now and they have ratings reviews and they have everything and telling that America is boring doesn\u2019t sell anything.

      "body": "<p>The Premier League\u2019s winter break is coming, and it\u2019s a bit of a mess. I\u2019m a firm believer that a break is necessary: footballers aren\u2019t superheroes, they are humans competing in a sport more physically demanding now than it has ever been. The pace of English football is the reason Sky, BT and broadcasters around the world are paying billions to show it, but that is only possible thanks to the supreme fitness of those competing in it. If there is no consideration for their bodies and minds, sooner or later it will have an impact on the product \u2013 and the profit.</p> \n<p>I know the difference even a short break can make. I remember when I stopped playing for England, during the first seven days of an international break training would be minimal because so few players were around, and they became recovery times for me. You get a bit of extra one-to-one coaching, a bit of technical training, and it helped me to feel really fresh for the games after international breaks. Most of the other players had to leave their club, travel, play potentially two games, return to their club and three days later they\u2019re playing again, and all that time I had the opportunity to spend time recovering and preparing, looking after myself. They say dropping international football can add two or three years to your career, because you gain those recovery weeks. That\u2019s one reason why Jamie Vardy and James Milner have excelled well into their 30s, and the argument for guaranteeing every player in the division one of those recovery weeks in a long season seems overwhelming.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/jan/28/david-squires-on-football-fixture-wars-fa-cup-carabao-liverpool-manchester-city\">David Squires on \u2026 football's fixture wars</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The counter-argument is always that there used to be more league games and more cup replays, and they would be played on terrible, muddy pitches \u2013 and if you\u2019re playing on a heavy pitch, you\u2019re going to feel it in your legs, for sure.

Their manager, Sam Ricketts, has said the replay could allow them to improve the drainage at their training ground, buy video analysis equipment and even \u201cchange the club\u2019s future\u201d.

In a strongly worded statement, Utgivarna, which represents Sweden\u2019s private and public sector media, complained that journalists had been put under intense pressure by Chinese government representatives. \u201cTime and again, China\u2019s ambassador Gui Congyou has tried to undermine the freedom of the press and the freedom of expression under the Swedish constitution with false statements and threats,\u201d the statement read. It said journalists had been denied visas, while editors received a near-constant stream of threatening and critical emails and phone calls. \u201cIt is unacceptable that the world\u2019s largest dictatorship is trying to prevent free and independent journalism in a democracy like Sweden. These repeated attacks must cease immediately,\u201d the statement said. It said the government should raise the issue at EU level and together with other member states \u201cstrongly protest\u201d over the attacks on press freedom. Tensions between Sweden and China have been rising since 2015, when Chinese agents seized the dissident Chinese publisher Gui Minhai while he was on holiday in Thailand. Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen, is still being held by Chinese authorities and his case has been heavily covered by the Swedish media. The friction has increased since Gui Congyou (no relation) was appointed China\u2019s ambassador in November 2017. In November last year he threatened that China would \u201csurely take counter-measures\u201d after Sweden\u2019s culture minister, Amanda Lind, attended a ceremony to award Gui Minhai the Tucholsky prize for writers facing persecution. \u201cSome people in Sweden shouldn\u2019t expect to feel at ease after hurting the feelings of the Chinese people,\u201d he said. This month he was summoned to see Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, Ann Linde, after he described the relationship between the Swedish media and the Chinese state using an analogy that many interpreted as threatening. \u201cIt is like when a lightweight boxer is trying to provoke a fight with a heavyweight boxer, and said heavyweight boxer is kindly encouraging the lightweight to mind his own business, out of goodwill,\u201d he told Sweden\u2019s state broadcaster SVT. On Tuesday the Chinese embassy to Denmark demanded an apology for a cartoon published in Jyllands-Posten, the newspaper whose cartoons of the prophet Mohammed sparked global protests in 2005 that led to an estimated 200 deaths. The latest cartoon, which altered the Chinese flag to stars with viruses, was \u201can insult to China\u201d and \u201churts the feelings of the Chinese people\u201d, the embassy said. Patrik Hadenius, the chief executive of Utgivarna, said his members had felt moved to act after they saw Danish media coming under similar pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a problem for Sweden but a problem for all democratic countries. Just the other day it happened in Denmark,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt we needed to lift this to higher levels.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Francine Toon spent two years of her childhood in the Scottish Highlands, near a town called Dornoch \u2013 \u201cthe last place in the UK to execute someone for witchcraft,\u201d she says with a shiver.</p> <p>Toon and other kids played in nearby Clashmore forest, frightening each other with stories about ghosts, or serial killers, or babysitters who meet horrible ends. \u201cThey made a big impression, those stories,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it came to telling them myself I enjoyed embellishing them, and this gave me a sense of control over the thing that was scaring me. Writing Pine, I realised I was doing the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Canterbury in 1986, Toon lived in England and Portugal before moving to the Highlands when she was nine. The family moved to St Andrews in Fife two years later, but the northern wilds have haunted her ever since, and form the backdrop to her debut novel. Ten-year-old Lauren lives in a remote house with her father, who struggles with alcoholism. Her mother disappeared long ago \u2013 all Lauren knows is that she \u201cwas a healer and different to anyone else\u201d. Ostracised by the other children and pursued by the whispers about her mother\u2019s vanishing, Lauren comforts herself with tarot cards and a handwritten book of spells that belonged to her female forebears. When locals start seeing a silent stranger, it seems only Lauren is able to remember her visits. What follows is a chilling tale of isolation and trauma, filled with precise evocations of the natural world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b4358fa8fbcadcd5ab01abe9e9f4fda6fbd7283d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4358fa8fbcadcd5ab01abe9e9f4fda6fbd7283d/0_0_707_1152/614.jpg\" alt=\"Woods near Dornoch.\" width=\"614\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The last place in the UK to execute someone for witchcraft\u2019 \u2026 woods near Dornoch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Magic feels all too likely, even logical in the remote rural setting of Pine, where Toon writes that Lauren\u2019s dad Niall can imagine his daughter grown up and \u201cno longer [having] to reassure her that kelpies are imaginary. Selkies, though, are <em>almost</em> real.\u201d</p> <p>In the world of the novel, the membrane between reality and folklore is thin. \u201cYou feel very small in that landscape of dramatic hills and forests,\u201d Toon says. \u201cEspecially as a child.\u201d</p> <p>Now an editor at Sceptre, she recalls being taught about selkies at school, how they shed their sealskin to assume human form. And when you\u2019re at the beach, a seal popping up \u201ccould easily be the head of a person\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI can see why people came up with those myths,\u201d she says. \u201cA friend might make up stories about a local woman being a witch, and she\u2019d be telling this as if she was believing it herself. But even though this wasn\u2019t true, was just children telling stories, you\u2019d also be told a witch was executed in the nearby town. And <em>that </em>story would be true. The sense of the unknown, and the similarity of folklore and actual history surrounding the area, make the blending of myth and reality quite blurry.\u201d</p> <p>This in-between zone has proved fertile ground for fiction, Toon says, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/12/dark-charms-why-writers-are-spellbound-by-witches\">female writers in particular turning to stories of witchcraft</a>. \u201cI always think of witchcraft-related spirituality and tarot, and even things like horoscopes, as the spiritual side of feminism if people want to seek it out. It\u2019s female-centric in its beliefs. It\u2019s outside of the normal patriarchal structure.\u201d</p> <p>Just as the writer and her friends found a sense of control in shaping stories about the things they feared, Lauren finds control in her life by reading the tarot, Toon adds, which is a sort of storytelling itself. \u201cAway from its dark history, the figure of the witch has the association of an empowered woman who isn\u2019t necessarily tied to marriage. Who doesn\u2019t have the same fears as women in terms of being able to look after herself.

      "bodyText": "Francine Toon spent two years of her childhood in the Scottish Highlands, near a town called Dornoch \u2013 \u201cthe last place in the UK to execute someone for witchcraft,\u201d she says with a shiver. Toon and other kids played in nearby Clashmore forest, frightening each other with stories about ghosts, or serial killers, or babysitters who meet horrible ends. \u201cThey made a big impression, those stories,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it came to telling them myself I enjoyed embellishing them, and this gave me a sense of control over the thing that was scaring me. Writing Pine, I realised I was doing the same thing.\u201d Born in Canterbury in 1986, Toon lived in England and Portugal before moving to the Highlands when she was nine. The family moved to St Andrews in Fife two years later, but the northern wilds have haunted her ever since, and form the backdrop to her debut novel. Ten-year-old Lauren lives in a remote house with her father, who struggles with alcoholism. Her mother disappeared long ago \u2013 all Lauren knows is that she \u201cwas a healer and different to anyone else\u201d. Ostracised by the other children and pursued by the whispers about her mother\u2019s vanishing, Lauren comforts herself with tarot cards and a handwritten book of spells that belonged to her female forebears. When locals start seeing a silent stranger, it seems only Lauren is able to remember her visits. What follows is a chilling tale of isolation and trauma, filled with precise evocations of the natural world. Magic feels all too likely, even logical in the remote rural setting of Pine, where Toon writes that Lauren\u2019s dad Niall can imagine his daughter grown up and \u201cno longer [having] to reassure her that kelpies are imaginary. Selkies, though, are almost real.\u201d In the world of the novel, the membrane between reality and folklore is thin. \u201cYou feel very small in that landscape of dramatic hills and forests,\u201d Toon says. \u201cEspecially as a child.\u201d Now an editor at Sceptre, she recalls being taught about selkies at school, how they shed their sealskin to assume human form. And when you\u2019re at the beach, a seal popping up \u201ccould easily be the head of a person\u201d. \u201cI can see why people came up with those myths,\u201d she says. \u201cA friend might make up stories about a local woman being a witch, and she\u2019d be telling this as if she was believing it herself. But even though this wasn\u2019t true, was just children telling stories, you\u2019d also be told a witch was executed in the nearby town. And that story would be true. The sense of the unknown, and the similarity of folklore and actual history surrounding the area, make the blending of myth and reality quite blurry.\u201d This in-between zone has proved fertile ground for fiction, Toon says, with female writers in particular turning to stories of witchcraft. \u201cI always think of witchcraft-related spirituality and tarot, and even things like horoscopes, as the spiritual side of feminism if people want to seek it out. It\u2019s female-centric in its beliefs. It\u2019s outside of the normal patriarchal structure.\u201d Just as the writer and her friends found a sense of control in shaping stories about the things they feared, Lauren finds control in her life by reading the tarot, Toon adds, which is a sort of storytelling itself. \u201cAway from its dark history, the figure of the witch has the association of an empowered woman who isn\u2019t necessarily tied to marriage. Who doesn\u2019t have the same fears as women in terms of being able to look after herself. In this book I was preoccupied by the idea of vulnerable women, women who\u2019ve disappeared or women have been abducted.\u201d Lauren gradually understands that her mother didn\u2019t want to leave her family, and that she will never be able to come back \u2013 a realisation that is made all the more chilling by the theory Lauren hears from two local teenagers. Then one of them goes missing, too. As a teenager in St Andrews, Toon recalls a man who pulled up beside her in a car when she was on the way to school. \u201cHe asked if I wanted a lift to school, saying he knew my dad,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t say my dad\u2019s name, and he was driving in the wrong direction to where my dad worked. Something made me say I didn\u2019t need a lift, even though it was raining and I\u2019d be late for school. That incident made me think about how vulnerable teenage girls can be.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of flooded households will not receive a penny of the thousands of pounds in compensation announced by Boris Johnson because of an \u201cobscene postcode lottery\u201d being applied by the government. The prime minister promised that grants of up to \u00a35,000 would be made available for victims of flooding, after visiting Fishlake in Yorkshire last November in the run-up to the general election. Another set of payouts of \u00a3500 for households and \u00a32,500 for businesses was also announced. However, families struggling to get back into their homes and rebuild them to withstand future flooding have discovered the money is only available to areas on which Johnson focused during his visit. Anyone flooded outside the tight time limit of 8-18 November is not eligible, and the payouts are only triggered in areas where more than 25 homes were affected. Mary Dhonau, a flood risk consultant, said: \u201cBoris Johnson said everyone that is being flooded would get up to \u00a35,000, but what he didn\u2019t say was that he meant everyone who was flooded between 8 November and 18 November and in a group of 25 houses or more. \u201cA flood is a flood, people suffer exactly the same wherever they are, not more in areas which are visited by the prime minister.\u201d More than 2,000 homes and businesses were affected by severe flooding in Yorkshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Shropshire and Warwickshire last autumn. Nearly four months on, hundreds of householders and businesses have received no financial support from the government. One source with knowledge of the grant approvals said: \u201cThe eligibility criteria are illogical, inconsistent and unfair. They have created an obscene postcode lottery for flood victims going through traumas which will last for years to come and, for some, the rest of their lives.\u201d The UK experienced one of its wettest autumns on record last year, and more extreme flooding is predicted to occur as a result of climate breakdown. A month before Johnson\u2019s election visit to Yorkshire, severe flooding affected counties around the West Midlands and the border between England and Wales. In Herefordshire, the River Wye reached record levels, and at one point the entire English stretch of the River Severn was the subject of flood warnings, affecting Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. As a result of the government funding restrictions, support will only reach about 30 of more than 300 households that were badly flooded across the neighbouring English border counties of Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Shropshire, Warwickshire and Herefordshire. Sam Underwood, a musical instrument designer, was flooded twice at his home and workshops in Callow End, Worcestershire. He had just cleaned up from the first flood in October when he was hit by the second a month later. Although the second happened in the \u201cright\u201d month to be eligible, he cannot get any of the grants because he is not in an area where more than 25 properties were affected. \u201cThis compensation would\u2019ve really helped us to get back to normality much more quickly and we could\u2019ve taken some further measures to limit future losses,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout the compensation, I had to cease working to deal with the recovery myself. As a sole trader this inevitably had a significant impact on my livelihood.\u201d But his neighbours in Wychavon district \u2013 just a few miles away \u2013 who were flooded by the same event and the same river, were eligible for compensation because they crossed the 25-property threshold. In Hereford, Polly Ernest, who runs a B&amp;B, was forced to evacuate her guests and leave her home when it flooded on 25 October, with contaminated water seeping up through the floorboards and making the house uninhabitable. Ernest is still not able to move back in and is losing tens of thousands of pounds in income, but because her flood was not between 8 and 18 November she is ineligible for a resilience grant. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a penny from the government because we flooded a week too early and because we are in a safe Tory seat \u2013 they didn\u2019t give us anything. I have written to my MP Jesse Norman but we keep being told we are not eligible,\u201d she said. \u201cIts disgusting. It is discriminatory. Something is either a national emergency or it is not. Why was the flooding in Yorkshire any worse than the flooding in Hereford?\u201d The only support Ernest is likely to receive will come from Herefordshire county council\u2019s own emergency fund, because the government has not triggered financial support for the county council. In neighbouring Worcestershire, where 132 properties were flooded, the councillor Tony Miller said no one had received government grants yet, but he anticipated only 33 homes might be eligible. \u201cThe way the threshold criteria has been set for the minimum number of flooded properties means that unitary authorities such as Shropshire and Herefordshire can submit numbers for the whole county, but in Worcestershire the figures must be broken down into each of the six district council areas.

It subsequently established a guideline that demanded an end to auditions and interviews taking place in hotel rooms or private homes. In November, Directors UK issued 96 guidelines for \u201cdirecting nudity and simulated sex\u201d.",

It\u2019s a serio-comic Bonnie-and-Clyde adventure, written by Lena Waithe and James Frey (still notorious for his faux memoir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/15/usa.world\">A Million Little Pieces</a>) and directed by former music video specialist Melinda Matsoukas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/daniel-kaluuya\">Daniel Kaluuya</a> brings his seductive air of politely quizzical irony to the role of Slim, a guy who has managed to get a Tinder date with someone way out of his league. This is a beautiful, smart lawyer named Queen, played by Jodie Turner-Smith, who is richer and taller than he is \u2013 though this latter disparity is never remarked on \u2013 and only went out with him on a whim because his profile picture was so appealingly pathetic. Driving her home after their highly uncomfortable dinner, and having been icily assured that he can expect no sex, Slim is pulled over by a belligerent cop, notorious for his racism, and this jittery encounter spirals out of control.</p> <p>This is a movie that is maybe not entirely clear what tone it wants to take with its audience. Sometimes it\u2019s in complete earnest about the fact that Queen and Slim become a poster couple for anti-racism and standing up to police brutality. Sometimes, though, it\u2019s a more nihilist, anarchic and ironic tale of a sexy couple who are by no means natural born killers.</p> <p>Some scenes are worthy of Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino, especially when dopey Slim attempts to stick up a gas station using a cop\u2019s stolen handgun. \u201cIs that a Glock?\u201d says the disconcertingly calm white attendant. \u201cI\u2019ll give you your gas for free if let me hold it.\u201d Kaluuya once again demonstrates that gift for deadpan comedy he showed us in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/17/get-out-review-fantastically-twisted-horror-satire-on-race-in-america\">Get Out</a>, as his character struggles to process how this attendant has failed to understand what is expected of him, and Slim even considers his offer of free gas \u2013 even though the point was that of course he is supposed to get the gas for free, and all the money in the cash register besides.</p> <p>Queen and Slim doesn\u2019t entirely work. The credibility factor isn\u2019t too high sometimes and there are big set pieces that don\u2019t gel: a sex scene showily intercut with a #BlackLivesMatter demonstration, for instance. Yet this is a punchy, watchable film with a nice cameo from Bokeen Woodbine as Queen\u2019s disreputable Uncle Earl, and some great chemistry between Turner-Smith and Kaluuya.</p> <p>\u2022 Queen &amp; Slim is released in the UK on 31 January and in Australia on 12 March.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igk0ZvH2Y2c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/igk0ZvH2Y2c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

Daniel Kaluuya brings his seductive air of politely quizzical irony to the role of Slim, a guy who has managed to get a Tinder date with someone way out of his league. This is a beautiful, smart lawyer named Queen, played by Jodie Turner-Smith, who is richer and taller than he is \u2013 though this latter disparity is never remarked on \u2013 and only went out with him on a whim because his profile picture was so appealingly pathetic. Driving her home after their highly uncomfortable dinner, and having been icily assured that he can expect no sex, Slim is pulled over by a belligerent cop, notorious for his racism, and this jittery encounter spirals out of control. This is a movie that is maybe not entirely clear what tone it wants to take with its audience. Sometimes it\u2019s in complete earnest about the fact that Queen and Slim become a poster couple for anti-racism and standing up to police brutality. Sometimes, though, it\u2019s a more nihilist, anarchic and ironic tale of a sexy couple who are by no means natural born killers. Some scenes are worthy of Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino, especially when dopey Slim attempts to stick up a gas station using a cop\u2019s stolen handgun. \u201cIs that a Glock?\u201d says the disconcertingly calm white attendant. \u201cI\u2019ll give you your gas for free if let me hold it.\u201d Kaluuya once again demonstrates that gift for deadpan comedy he showed us in Get Out, as his character struggles to process how this attendant has failed to understand what is expected of him, and Slim even considers his offer of free gas \u2013 even though the point was that of course he is supposed to get the gas for free, and all the money in the cash register besides. Queen and Slim doesn\u2019t entirely work. The credibility factor isn\u2019t too high sometimes and there are big set pieces that don\u2019t gel: a sex scene showily intercut with a #BlackLivesMatter demonstration, for instance. Yet this is a punchy, watchable film with a nice cameo from Bokeen Woodbine as Queen\u2019s disreputable Uncle Earl, and some great chemistry between Turner-Smith and Kaluuya. \u2022 Queen &amp; Slim is released in the UK on 31 January and in Australia on 12 March.",

If you\u2019re having a hard time, it is probably your fault. (It\u2019s also a total misunderstanding of what Pluto actually does in a chart, which is more of a representation of the shadow side of society and cultural shifts controlled by the powerful, but sure, OK, whatever.)</p> <p>I\u2019ve had an astrologer tell me that the reason I lost a job was because it wasn\u2019t helping me \u201clive out my higher purpose\u201d.

This kind of thinking might be useful to the type of person who can pay hundreds of dollars for a private consultation with an astrologer. For those who are scraping by, however, it\u2019s condescending and insulting.</p> <p>Nicholas might use terminology borrowed from astrology \u2013 like moon signs and sextiles and whatever \u2013 but ultimately she could be talking about Myers-Briggs or blood types or any other attempts to divide people into cohesive little groups. With so much of contemporary astrology focused on how each sign just <em>is</em>, perhaps it\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re starting to see discussion of whether or not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/22/roommate-astrology-zodiac-discrimination\">it\u2019s legal to discriminate against a specific astrological sign</a>. (And anyway, a sun in Taurus is about understanding yourself through your good and painful experiences with Venusian values like beauty and money, but sure, OK, whatever.)</p> <p>A true astrological revival seems like it might be useful, because what astrology is really good at is bestowing and creating meaning. It\u2019s not about truth, it\u2019s not about destiny, it\u2019s about finding meaning in your life through story and metaphor and reflection. It can help a person understand where the intersection lies between the individual and the family, community and society exists and whether how that influence changes from positive to restrictive. It helps to bring a long-term perspective to changes, rather than keeping them in a sometimes terrifying present.</p> <p>Meaning, however, is not easily distilled into a 200-page book, and a search for meaning often leads us into the arms of predatory con artists, gurus and those trying to capitalize on a moment. When the astrology boom is over, something else that will tell people what they want to hear will replace it, but the millennia-old practice of real astrology will remain. The bust will come when Neptune gets out of Pisces, despite all the astrologers who promised that transit would bring us \u201ca renewed spirituality\u201d. (Pisces is also about insanity and fraud, but sure, OK, whatever.)</p> <ul> <li><p>Jessa Crispin is the host of the Public Intellectual podcast</p></li> </ul>",

Nicholas might use terminology borrowed from astrology \u2013 like moon signs and sextiles and whatever \u2013 but ultimately she could be talking about Myers-Briggs or blood types or any other attempts to divide people into cohesive little groups. With so much of contemporary astrology focused on how each sign just is, perhaps it\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re starting to see discussion of whether or not it\u2019s legal to discriminate against a specific astrological sign. (And anyway, a sun in Taurus is about understanding yourself through your good and painful experiences with Venusian values like beauty and money, but sure, OK, whatever.) A true astrological revival seems like it might be useful, because what astrology is really good at is bestowing and creating meaning. It\u2019s not about truth, it\u2019s not about destiny, it\u2019s about finding meaning in your life through story and metaphor and reflection. It can help a person understand where the intersection lies between the individual and the family, community and society exists and whether how that influence changes from positive to restrictive. It helps to bring a long-term perspective to changes, rather than keeping them in a sometimes terrifying present. Meaning, however, is not easily distilled into a 200-page book, and a search for meaning often leads us into the arms of predatory con artists, gurus and those trying to capitalize on a moment. When the astrology boom is over, something else that will tell people what they want to hear will replace it, but the millennia-old practice of real astrology will remain. The bust will come when Neptune gets out of Pisces, despite all the astrologers who promised that transit would bring us \u201ca renewed spirituality\u201d. (Pisces is also about insanity and fraud, but sure, OK, whatever.) Jessa Crispin is the host of the Public Intellectual podcast",

It was one of the most important initiatives in 20th-century cardiology, helping many more patients survive.</p> <p>Julian, who has died aged 93, was then a young cardiologist at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He posited in his Lancet article that many more coronary patients admitted to hospital might live if they could be treated in a dedicated unit, where their heart could be monitored with a system that sounded an alarm if the rhythm changed, and where trained staff and equipment were available to resuscitate them.</p> <p>At the beginning of the 1960s the outlook for coronary patients was grim. Around a quarter of those who had a heart attack died before they even reached hospital. Those admitted were scattered across general wards, given morphine for the pain and left to rest. If they had the misfortune to experience another cardiac arrest, it might go unnoticed. One of Julian\u2019s contemporaries said he regularly found that one of his coronary patients had died quietly in the night.</p> <p>If a member of staff did spot a patient having a heart attack, a porter had to fetch the defibrillator, which was more than 1.5 metres (5ft) tall and heavy, from wherever it was in the hospital. It is vital to apply a defibrillator quickly, to restore normal heart rhythm, and many patients were not treated in time. An estimated 25% of coronary patients admitted to hospital died within 30 days.</p> <p>Julian wanted to bring in new practices. He had spent a year in the US at the Peter Bent Brigham hospital in Boston (1957-58), where he had seen a demonstration of an electrocardiographic machine that monitored a patient\u2019s heart rate, sounding an alarm if it detected an abnormal rhythm. He thought it would make sense to cluster his coronary patients together in a dedicated unit with easy access to this and other equipment, and with trained staff on hand to care for them.</p> <p>Resuscitation techniques were also changing. At the beginning of the 60s the standard way of doing emergency CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) was to open the chest surgically and manipulate the heart. It was known as open chest cardiac massage and could be done only by a trained doctor, which restricted its use. However, in the US, at the Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, Dr William Kouwenhoven discovered a new technique: resuscitation by rhythmically pressing on the chest (the type of CPR we know today). It was a great step forward as it was not invasive and it was a technique that everyone could learn.</p> <p>Julian found out about this type of CPR in an extraordinary way. In May 1960 a visiting physician had a heart attack in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and Julian opened his chest and massaged his heart. Julian wrote: \u201cBy a remarkable coincidence, our resuscitated physician was an alumnus of Johns Hopkins and, shortly after his recovery, he showed me a note in the hospital bulletin about Kouwenhoven\u2019s work.\u201d Part of Julian\u2019s mission to improve treatment for cardiac patients was to train staff in the new technique.</p> <p>In 1961, the year Julian submitted his article on coronary care improvements to the Lancet, he moved to Sydney, where he ran a cardiac research laboratory. The coronary care units, as he had envisaged, started to spring up across the US, and in 1964 he returned to Edinburgh as a consultant to set up a unit there, the first in Europe.</p> <p>In its first year of operation, an extra seven of every 100 patients survived, compared with a similar group of patients the year before. It became standard practice worldwide to treat patients in coronary care units, so much so that by 1964 no new general hospital in the US could get accreditation without one.

His father, Frederick, was a doctor and his mother, Jane (nee Galbraith), a teacher.

There were 122,181 personal insolvencies last year, an increase of 6% on 2018, and the highest annual total since 2010, according to figures from the government\u2019s Insolvency Service. The rise was largely driven by a 9.8% increase in individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) to 77,982, the highest annual level of IVAs recorded since their introduction in 1987. Insolvency experts blamed the rise of insecure employment, delayed payments under the universal credit welfare programme, and Brexit uncertainty for the steep climb in the number of people running up high levels of debt. The Resolution Foundation said in a report earlier this month that low-income households had come to rely on expensive consumer debt at an increasing rate over the past decade and were now vulnerable to unexpected hard times. The Ministry of Justice recently revealed that a record number of county court judgments (CCJs) were issued last year against individuals who fell into debt, double the level of eight years ago. The data showed that the number of CCJs against individuals in England and Wales who failed to repay their debts climbed by 3% \u2013 or 30,138 \u2013 to 1.15m in 2019. Michael Mulligan, an insolvency partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, said the figures \u201cpaint a bleak picture\u201d of the economy. He said the situation was unlikely to improve this year with \u201cthousands of zombie companies hanging on across a number of vulnerable sectors\u201d. The Insolvency Service said the fourth quarter showed an improvement after dropping slightly from 30,565 in the third quarter to 29,261. Analysis by the government last year showed women were more likely to be indebted and sign up to an IVA, which involves making repayments over a typical period of five years though usually after some debt relief. People living in coastal towns were also more likely to become financially insolvent. Company insolvencies, excluding one-off \u201cbulk insolvency events\u201d, rose 6.8% year on year in 2019. Excluding bulk events, which usually involved the collapse and restructuring of large retail and hotel chains, there were 17,196 corporate insolvencies in 2019 \u2013 the highest since 2013. Duncan Swift, president of the industry trade body R3, said Brexit uncertainty was a factor, but weaker consumer confidence, a decline in hiring by employers, and recessions in both the manufacturing and construction sectors last year also played a part.",

Bridging this gap in an accelerated manner can help young women to get the jobs of the future.\u201d</p> <p>She explains there are several ways to go about this. First, women entrepreneurs need improved tech tools to enable them to better participate in the economy. SMEs are the bedrock of thriving economies, she explains, but the tendering process can be tedious and time-consuming.<strong> </strong>She cites <a href=\"https://www.scale.co.ke/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scale Kenya</a> \u2013 a platform that helps to reduce the manual work often required when bidding for contracts \u2013 as a great example. \u201cI think it can help SMEs, particularly women-led ones, to win more tenders, and thus employ more people,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Another way to bridge the skills gap is through education. \u201cThe curricula in schools and universities need to evolve with industry needs in mind,\u201d she says.

Anie Akpe, founder of African Women in Tech, a networking and events platform, says: \u201cBusiness recognises that they need skilled employees and that organisations such as AkiraChix are helping to offset training costs that the companies couldn\u2019t offer.

The payout means more than 358,000 claimants who were owed a collective \u00a3460m, according to the last administrators\u2019 report, will share less than \u00a323m. The average payout should have been \u00a31,200, but customers will now receive an average of \u00a364 each. The administrators Grant Thornton started writing to affected claimants on Wednesday night, nearly 18 months after the lender collapsed in 2018. Wonga was brought to its knees in August 2018 after a surge in complaints over excessive charges on historical loans that in some cases came with interest rates topping 5,000%. Grant Thornton, which will have received more than \u00a33m in fees for its work on the administration by the end of February, told customers in an email: \u201cAs you will be aware from previous correspondence to you, the payment you will receive is significantly smaller than your accepted claim value.

This often meant that maintaining facilities such as children\u2019s homes was seen as unaffordable \u2013 and cutting them was far less controversial than doing the same with the NHS, for example. Shut down a hospital and there is uproar. Close down several children\u2019s homes, and there is barely a mention of it in the local paper.</p> <p>Austerity is ongoing and its full effects on children\u2019s services are yet to be seen. As recently as 2018, for example, one local authority announced the <a href=\"https://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/17304659.worcestershire-county-council-to-close-four-childrens-homes-next-year-to-help-save-1-million/\">closure</a> of four children\u2019s homes with no plans to replace them. This after a period where, from 2009 to 2017, the number of children in care <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/18/children-in-care-system-breaking-point\">increased</a> from 64,460 to 75,420. And even when they are replaced rather than just closed down, these homes can fall into private hands, in some cases being simultaneously profitable and inadequate: it was found last month that councils paid \u00a32.3m to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/26/revealed-councils-paid-inadequate-care-homes-23m-to-house-children\">failing providers</a>. This creates a worrying conflict of interest among these homes\u2019 owners, especially if quality of care turns out to be inversely related to profitability.</p> <p>While the difference between children\u2019s homes and the NHS may exist in the public mind, it does not in the business plans of some private providers. <a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/CARETECH-HOLDINGS-PLC-4005576/company/\">Care</a><a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/CARETECH-HOLDINGS-PLC-4005576/company/\">Tech Holdings plc</a>, for example, earns much of its revenue through children\u2019s homes but a significant slice of its earnings are from providing services to adults with learning disabilities. Some of CareTech\u2019s largest shareholders are global hedge funds and private equity firmssuch as Liontrust Investment Partners, and \u201cactivist hedge fund\u201d Teleios Capital Partners is a prior shareholder. CareTech recently moved to control an even larger chunk of the UK market when it <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cambian-group-m-a-caretech-hldgs/uk-competition-watchdog-clears-caretech-cambian-deal-idUKKCN1PX0MG\">bought Cambian Group</a> for \u00a3372m. True to the private equity model, the business is now <a href=\"https://howardleague.org/blog/privatising-childrens-social-care/\">highly leveraged</a> with a net debt of \u00a3300m and \u00a37m being spent on \u201cfinancial expenses\u201d (such as interest payments) last year.</p> <p>As private equity firms see that money can be made from Britain\u2019s health and social care sector, this may pave the way for them to roll out services across the NHS, resulting in privatisation in all but name.</p> <p>Although there have been concerns about the quality of care provided by some privately owned children\u2019s homes, it is important to acknowledge that Ofsted ratings of privately run homes are sometimes better than local authority-owned facilities. But my concern is not just about the quality of care provided in the short term. In the long term, as the system becomes more and more dependent on the flow of private money with an aggressive profit focus, those providers may change what they are offering and children in care will suffer. And there will be no public sector left to pick up the pieces.</p> <p>In the absence of the required government investment, those who want to guarantee high-quality, sustainable care for vulnerable children need to think about the best way to work with private providers. We should be focusing on smaller providers with sector expertise (former social workers or children\u2019s charities, for example) backed by social impact capital that limits profit taking and reinvests revenues to improve the service. \u201cSocial impact bonds\u201d have been proven to deliver sustainable returns to investors, savings to local authorities and, above all, improvements to the lives of children in care. One scheme in <a href=\"https://www.socialfinance.org.uk/essex-edge-care-sib\">Essex</a> resulted in 96,000 fewer days spent in care, and cost savings of \u00a317.9m. A similar scheme was implemented in <a href=\"https://www.bridgesfundmanagement.com/uks-first-social-impact-bond-to-fund-foster-placements-for-children-in-care/\">Manchester</a>.</p> <p>Some on the left will be instinctively repulsed by any profit-making in these most sensitive of settings. I understand that reaction, but allowing modest profits that are then reinvested to improve vital services may be the only way to protect the future of children in care.</p> <p>Across the political divide, consensus is building that something needs to change. Earlier this month Michael Farmer, a former treasurer of the Conservative party, described children\u2019s services as being at \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/18/children-in-care-system-breaking-point\">breaking point</a>\u201d. It\u2019s time we all agreed on that \u2013 before we find ourselves saying the same thing about our local hospital.</p> <p>\u2022 Shadim Hussain is a member of the government\u2019s steering group on adoption, and CEO of My Foster Family</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 and 11 February 2020 because an earlier version misdescribed some details of CareTech Holdings plc.

CareTech Holdings plc, for example, earns much of its revenue through children\u2019s homes but a significant slice of its earnings are from providing services to adults with learning disabilities. Some of CareTech\u2019s largest shareholders are global hedge funds and private equity firmssuch as Liontrust Investment Partners, and \u201cactivist hedge fund\u201d Teleios Capital Partners is a prior shareholder. CareTech recently moved to control an even larger chunk of the UK market when it bought Cambian Group for \u00a3372m. True to the private equity model, the business is now highly leveraged with a net debt of \u00a3300m and \u00a37m being spent on \u201cfinancial expenses\u201d (such as interest payments) last year. As private equity firms see that money can be made from Britain\u2019s health and social care sector, this may pave the way for them to roll out services across the NHS, resulting in privatisation in all but name. Although there have been concerns about the quality of care provided by some privately owned children\u2019s homes, it is important to acknowledge that Ofsted ratings of privately run homes are sometimes better than local authority-owned facilities. But my concern is not just about the quality of care provided in the short term. In the long term, as the system becomes more and more dependent on the flow of private money with an aggressive profit focus, those providers may change what they are offering and children in care will suffer. And there will be no public sector left to pick up the pieces. In the absence of the required government investment, those who want to guarantee high-quality, sustainable care for vulnerable children need to think about the best way to work with private providers. We should be focusing on smaller providers with sector expertise (former social workers or children\u2019s charities, for example) backed by social impact capital that limits profit taking and reinvests revenues to improve the service. \u201cSocial impact bonds\u201d have been proven to deliver sustainable returns to investors, savings to local authorities and, above all, improvements to the lives of children in care. One scheme in Essex resulted in 96,000 fewer days spent in care, and cost savings of \u00a317.9m. A similar scheme was implemented in Manchester. Some on the left will be instinctively repulsed by any profit-making in these most sensitive of settings. I understand that reaction, but allowing modest profits that are then reinvested to improve vital services may be the only way to protect the future of children in care. Across the political divide, consensus is building that something needs to change. Earlier this month Michael Farmer, a former treasurer of the Conservative party, described children\u2019s services as being at \u201cbreaking point\u201d. It\u2019s time we all agreed on that \u2013 before we find ourselves saying the same thing about our local hospital. \u2022 Shadim Hussain is a member of the government\u2019s steering group on adoption, and CEO of My Foster Family \u2022 This article was amended on 5 and 11 February 2020 because an earlier version misdescribed some details of CareTech Holdings plc.

      "bodyText": "10. Bernie \u2013 Zookeeper (2011) Imagine Dolittle, but about a depressed zookeeper whose girlfriend had left him because he was a zookeeper, and the subsequent efforts of the animals at the zoo to teach the zookeeper how to get laid. That\u2019s Zookeeper. Bernie, voiced by Nick Nolte, is a full-grown gorilla that the titular zookeeper breaks out of the zoo so that they can go to TGI Fridays, sing Flo Rida songs together and apparently get drunk together. Bernie ends the evening by slow dancing with a sexually aroused secretary while the zookeeper smashes up an acoustic guitar. 9. Blood \u2013 A Boy and His Dog (1975) If you have children and A Boy and His Dog appear on any streaming services, don\u2019t watch it. At first glance, it looks like the sort of earnestly dumb Disney movie that Kurt Russell would have made in the 70s, but it is not that at all. A Boy and His Dog takes place in the aftermath of nuclear war, as a young man scavenges for food with a dog of contemptible character. Voiced by Tim McIntire, Blood\u2019s one job is to find post-apocalyptic women for Don Johnson to have sex with in return for food. They eat a woman at the end. Like I said, not for kids. 8. Rocks \u2013 Look Who\u2019s Talking Now (1993) First there was a talking baby. Then there were two talking babies. And then, in the third Look Who\u2019s Talking film, they introduced a dog. Voiced by Danny DeVito, Rocks was a dog so sexually confident that his opening line to a poodle is: \u201cWhat do you say you and me go play Bury the Bone?\u201d He accuses his best friend of being the product of incest. Why is he called Rocks, you ask? Because he\u2019s incontinent. This is a kid\u2019s film. 7. Ralph \u2013 Joe\u2019s Apartment (1996) The first film produced by MTV, Joe\u2019s Apartment was about a slobby man whose home is invaded by an army of talking cockroaches. Billy West plays Ralph, the leader of the cockroaches, with other cockroaches voiced by Tim Blake Nelson and Dave Chapelle. If you like films where maniacally giggling cockroaches crawl through food, perform Busby Berkeley dance numbers on top of a filthy toilet and crawl under the skirts of terrified women, this is the film for you. 6. Don \u2013 Hot to Trot (1988) By 1988, Bobcat Goldthwait was hot property. His presence helped to elevate three successive Police Academy movies and it seemed as if anything was possible. But then he made Hot to Trot, a film about a talking horse and everything fell apart. It was not just any talking horse but a talking horse that passes on stock tips to Goldthwait, becomes richer than its wildest dreams, moves into Goldthwait\u2019s apartment, wrecks it after a riotous all-animal party, is visited by the spirit of his father in the form of a fly and then wins a race by talking all the other horses out of running. Weird that it didn\u2019t do better. 5. Mr Tinkles \u2013 Cats &amp; Dogs (2001) In a film called Cats &amp; Dogs, of course the dogs are going to be the protagonists. Cats could never be the hero of a story. Cats are awful. And therefore it makes complete sense that the primary antagonist of Cats &amp; Dogs would be Mr Tinkles, an evil, spoilt persian who Weekend at Bernies his infirm billionaire human owner in an effort to destroy the entire world. I\u2019ve met cats. This behaviour tracks. 4. Mr Fuzzypants \u2013 Nine Lives (2016) Shortly before he switched careers and became a genuinely disturbing once-a-year festive YouTuber, Kevin Spacey made the worst film of his life. Barry Sonnenfeld\u2019s Nine Lives is basically Liar Liar except \u2013 and this is a big except \u2013 instead of being forced to tell the truth, a negligent father is transformed into a cat named Mr Fuzzypants. Want to know how Mr Fuzzypants saves the day? He doesn\u2019t. He falls from the top of a skyscraper and dies horribly after mistaking his adult human base-jumping son for a man attempting suicide. 3. The Cat in the Hat \u2013 Cat in the Hat (2003) I mean, where to start? The part when Mike Myers\u2019s cat is so aroused by a photo of a woman that his hat goes stiff? The part when he bends over and his fur rides up revealing a human bottom? The part when he repeatedly threatens to murder a second cat, also played by Myers, with a knife?

Whenever something close to mainstream acceptance has come calling, he has pulled back dramatically. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/dec/22/destroyer-kaputt-review\">Kaputt</a>, his 2011 homage to mid-80s British pop, over which New Order and Prefab Sprout\u2019s shadows loomed large, was shortlisted for the Polaris prize, Canada\u2019s equivalent of the Mercury, while its follow-up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/20/destroyer-poison-season-review\">Poison Season</a> made the lower reaches of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2017, the darker, denser <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ken/\">Ken</a> put paid to that. On paper, this follow-up sounds more off-beam still \u2013 a series of offcuts from earlier work, stream-of-consciousness lyrics, taped in Bejar\u2019s kitchen: \u201cno re-recording, no cleaning up\u201d.</p> <p>The listener thus primed for 40 minutes of hard work may be surprised. As on Kaputt, Have We Met\u2019s main musical touchstone is Britain\u2019s post-postpunk new pop moment, the brief window in the 80s when the desire to make music that was commercial melded with the desire to make music that was inventive and intelligent. As if to signpost where it\u2019s coming from, the album contains a song called Cue Synthesizer. Have We Met is rich with sonic signifiers of that era: sombre washes of synth, slap bass, booming drums, commanding, reverb-laden woah-Vienna piano, guitars that squall or cry mournfully \u2013 the entire title track is consumed by a desolate solo \u2013 but never rock. Moreover, the set is rich with melodies: only the ambient ramble of The Television Music Supervisor obviously sounds like a product of the album\u2019s working method.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ZLNLz2yGI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/06ZLNLz2yGI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Destroyer: Cue Synthesizer \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Bejar has talked about being drawn to this brand of 80s music simply because it\u2019s what he remembers hearing on the radio as a kid, but it fits here for reasons beyond nostalgia. However glossy the sound of new pop, it was frequently underscored by anxiety and fear, sometimes explicitly linked to the era\u2019s nuclear paranoia, sometimes not: even the business of getting ready to go out could be transformed into a troubling psychodrama on The Associates\u2019 exquisite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww2AYxrPqkk\">Party Fears Two</a>, a song that seems to echo through the plangent keyboard lines that stand in for choruses on Have We Met\u2019s Crimson Tide and It Just Doesn\u2019t Happen.</p> <p>There\u2019s a similar sense of alarm beneath the album\u2019s shiny surface. In contrast to the image given by the cover \u2013 Bejar shot as louche crooner, mic in hand, shirt open to mid-chest \u2013 his words rush out in panicky bursts, struggling to cram in all the syllables. Bejar\u2019s stream of consciousness keeps returning to disquieting places. \u201cJust look at the world around you,\u201d opens The Raven. \u201cActually, no, don\u2019t look.\u201d By the time we reach University Hill, paranoia reigns. Forces unknown are coming \u201cto hack us up\u201d; we\u2019re \u201cstaring at oblivion\u201d; \u201cthe game is rigged in every direction\u201d. Devotees of the Destroyer drinking game are likely to be paralytic by its close. But, weirdly, it works: for all the inexplicable non-sequiturs, it accurately captures a sense of ineffable small-hours dread, and of nameless fear poking through random thoughts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the closing Foolssong, the album\u2019s peculiar, compelling balance between the familiar and the confusing, the straightforwardly appealing and the shudder-inducing, finally seems to topple. Perhaps the melodically sweetest song here, it eventually collapses into creepy ambient noise, as if overwhelmed by the fear. But for all the bleakness of its conclusion, the songs on Have We Met stay with you, testament to the fact that Bejar only really makes two kinds of album \u2013 the kind you admire for its bloody-mindedness and the kind you actively enjoy. Have We Met belongs to the latter category. Even at their poppiest, Destroyer remain an acquired taste. This time around, it\u2019s one more than worth acquiring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/3nZqGpGlhxsD9kqyjEQU7d\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3nZqGpGlhxsD9kqyjEQU7d\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnirRGsccVg\">Love Regenerator: Love Regenerator 1</a></strong><br>In which Calvin Harris, of all people, mixes full-on early 90s rave with acidic R&amp;S Records techno of a similar vintage to delightful effect.</p>",

Bejar has talked about being drawn to this brand of 80s music simply because it\u2019s what he remembers hearing on the radio as a kid, but it fits here for reasons beyond nostalgia. However glossy the sound of new pop, it was frequently underscored by anxiety and fear, sometimes explicitly linked to the era\u2019s nuclear paranoia, sometimes not: even the business of getting ready to go out could be transformed into a troubling psychodrama on The Associates\u2019 exquisite Party Fears Two, a song that seems to echo through the plangent keyboard lines that stand in for choruses on Have We Met\u2019s Crimson Tide and It Just Doesn\u2019t Happen. There\u2019s a similar sense of alarm beneath the album\u2019s shiny surface. In contrast to the image given by the cover \u2013 Bejar shot as louche crooner, mic in hand, shirt open to mid-chest \u2013 his words rush out in panicky bursts, struggling to cram in all the syllables. Bejar\u2019s stream of consciousness keeps returning to disquieting places. \u201cJust look at the world around you,\u201d opens The Raven. \u201cActually, no, don\u2019t look.\u201d By the time we reach University Hill, paranoia reigns. Forces unknown are coming \u201cto hack us up\u201d; we\u2019re \u201cstaring at oblivion\u201d; \u201cthe game is rigged in every direction\u201d. Devotees of the Destroyer drinking game are likely to be paralytic by its close. But, weirdly, it works: for all the inexplicable non-sequiturs, it accurately captures a sense of ineffable small-hours dread, and of nameless fear poking through random thoughts. On the closing Foolssong, the album\u2019s peculiar, compelling balance between the familiar and the confusing, the straightforwardly appealing and the shudder-inducing, finally seems to topple. Perhaps the melodically sweetest song here, it eventually collapses into creepy ambient noise, as if overwhelmed by the fear. But for all the bleakness of its conclusion, the songs on Have We Met stay with you, testament to the fact that Bejar only really makes two kinds of album \u2013 the kind you admire for its bloody-mindedness and the kind you actively enjoy. Have We Met belongs to the latter category. Even at their poppiest, Destroyer remain an acquired taste. This time around, it\u2019s one more than worth acquiring. This week Alexis listened to Love Regenerator: Love Regenerator 1 In which Calvin Harris, of all people, mixes full-on early 90s rave with acidic R&amp;S Records techno of a similar vintage to delightful effect.",

Known by her legions of fans as La Nora, she\u2019s a perennial New York Times bestseller who has sold more than 500m books worldwide. Forbes estimates her net worth at $390m. We\u2019re talking in the stunning setting of Ashford Castle in Ireland, the inspiration for her bestselling Cousins O\u2019Dwyer series \u2013 witchcraft; romance; horses \u2013 where almost 200 readers are due for an event later that day. One booked a flight to Ireland the second the event was announced. She has, she says later, read every book Roberts has ever written, from supernatural-tinged series such as the Guardians trilogy to the romantic suspense of <em>The Obsession</em>; this is some feat.</p> <p>Back in 1979, Roberts hadn\u2019t quite cracked the winning formula. Having young children meant she\u2019d gorged herself on Mills &amp; Boon romances in the rare moments she could grab to read (\u201cI\u2019d think a lot of times: \u2018the heroine is a little wimpy\u2019; or \u2018the guy is a total ass\u2019; but it was what I needed from my reading fix during nap time\u201d) and thought she knew what she was doing.</p> <p>As a child \u2013 the youngest of five \u2013 she\u2019d thought that \u201ceverybody made up stories in their heads\u201d. But writing one of these short, formulaic romances was harder than she had thought. \u201cI took every cliche you have ever read in a [romance] novel and I stuffed it in that 55,000-word book,\u201d says the 69-year-old, who is friendly, steely and enjoyably sweary. \u201cThe woman had long red fingernails and he was Latin, but it had a beginning, a middle and an end, it had character, setting, dialogue, it had conflict.\u201d She immediately started another one, writing by hand \u201cwhile the kids were playing or in bed for the night\u201d, then transferring her stories on to a portable typewriter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e59b868c3c1e716c3cd80b1bbb610484758aeb41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e59b868c3c1e716c3cd80b1bbb610484758aeb41/0_0_186_293/186.jpg\" alt=\"Dangerous Embrace by Nora Roberts\" width=\"186\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>She was rejected by Harlequin Mills &amp; Boon, which told her it \u201calready had\u201d its American writer. This was, she points out wryly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/28/plagiarism-book-stuffing-clickfarms-the-rotten-side-of-self-publishing\" title=\"\">Janet Dailey, \u201cwho later plagiarised me\u201d</a> \u2013 more on which later. But another publisher, Silhouette, signed her up and Roberts sold six books in a year. That first contract, for 1981\u2019s<em> Irish Thoroughbred</em> (\u201cAn Irish lass comes to America and finds love\u201d) \u201cwas like a bonanza \u2013 $3,000 upfront money\u201d. She became a single parent, and \u201cfinancially, it was a terrific boon\u201d.</p> <p>Roberts met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, a couple of years later. He was a carpenter and she hired him to put up some bookshelves. \u201cHe did a really good job, and looked good in a tool belt, and I kept him, and got many, many, more bookshelves out of it along the way.\u201d</p> <p>She would go on to write \u201ccategory romance\u201d for almost 20 years. Published by such houses as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/11/mills-boon-books-romance-love\" title=\"\">Mills &amp; Boon and Silhouette</a>, these books come in different lines \u2013 medical, historical, contemporary \u2013 with new titles released every month. The genre, notorious in the past for its domineering heroes and lily-livered heroines, \u201creally did evolve\u201d over time. \u201cThe heroes were still a bit dominant back in the 80s, but my heroines tended to be stronger and more independent, so gradually it became more of a partnership.\u201d</p> <p>The evolution of romance publishing is ongoing: today, authors\u2019 body the Romance Writers of America, which Roberts joined in 1980, is in the middle of a racism row. Roberts criticised the organisation over its homophobia in 2005, after it published a statement \u201cdefining romance as one man/one woman\u201d \u2013 \u201cJesus, it\u2019s fine to have a character fall in love with a freaking vampire, but not someone of the same sex? Bullshit. Just bullshit,\u201d she wrote on her blog. Roberts has since left the RWA, but she describes the current situation, with the organisation imploding over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/31/romance-novel-industry-uproar-discipline-author-racist-courtney-milan\" title=\"\">decision to discipline novelist Courtney Milan</a> for her public criticism of a fellow author\u2019s novel for racism, as \u201chorrendous\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b876c64ebca45054086353f0e4ff07942da843ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b876c64ebca45054086353f0e4ff07942da843ae/0_0_319_500/319.jpg\" alt=\"The Obsession by Nora Roberts\" width=\"319\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The discipline of category romance gave her a great foundation, but what Roberts really wanted to write was romantic suspense \u2013 in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/15/romance-suspense-novelist-mary-stewart-dies\" title=\"\">Mary Stewart, the British author</a> who pioneered the genre with titles including <em>Nine Coaches Waiting</em> and <em>Madam, Will You Talk?</em>. Roberts released her first standalone romantic thriller, <em>Hot Ice</em>, in which a Manhattan socialite crosses paths with a thief on the trail of a hidden fortune, in 1987. \u201cI could use swear words! The relationship was still key, but I could develop the characters, every scene didn\u2019t have to be together or spatting or making up. A friend of mine once said that category romance is all the elements of a book \u2013 the lighting, the costumes, the characters, the music \u2013 in a phone booth. And I could get outside the phone booth.\u201d</p> <p>In 1995, Roberts tried something new. She published <em>Naked in Death</em> (about tough-as-nails cop Eve Dallas and her love interest, the billionaire Irishman Roarke) under a pseudonym, JD Robb. The pen name was \u201ckind of an experiment\u201d; her publisher at Putnam, overwhelmed with the quantity of writing she was sending its way, wanted her to put some books out under a different name. \u201cPhyllis Grann was head of Putnam back then, she\u2019d come in with this New York accent: \u2018Nooora, ya need a hobby.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t want a hobby: forget the other writers, I could fill all the bookstores in all the land.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But Grann eventually convinced her that she could be two popular brands. The character of Dallas came to her. \u201cShe was dark and troubled, but so interesting. I thought, leap it into the future but close, not like tentacles, more speculative future. Let\u2019s try that.\u201d When sales hit a certain level, they \u201chad the big reveal\u201d; Roberts\u2019s new competition was, in fact, Roberts herself, writing under another name. This month, she publishes the 50th novel in what was originally set to be a trilogy,<em> <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/golden-in-death-9780349422077.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Golden in Death</a></em>, in which Dallas and her team are after the killer of a model husband and father.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>'It\u2019s never easy. It shouldn\u2019t be easy. If it was easy everyone would do it \u2026 It\u2019s an art and a science and a skill'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Shortly after her debut as JD Robb, and riding high in the charts, Roberts received a nasty shock. She was contacted by a reader about similarities between her book <em>Sweet Revenge</em>, originally published in 1988, and Dailey\u2019s <em>Notorious</em>, published in 1996. Lawyers were hired on both sides, and Roberts discovered further plagiarism. She won the case \u2013 you don\u2019t mess with La Nora \u2013 and donated the settlement to literacy projects. Today, she still publishes four to five books a year, including two JD Robbs. She rises early, 5.30 or 6am. She gets a Diet Pepsi, and is writing by eight, going through until it\u2019s \u201cwork-out time\u201d, around 2.30pm. \u201cIt\u2019s six to eight hours a day, every day,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd no, it\u2019s never easy. It shouldn\u2019t be easy. If it was easy everyone would do it \u2026 It\u2019s an art and a science and a skill.\u201d</p> <p>A Roberts novel can be many things. The futuristic cop stories of JD Robb. The post-apocalyptic horror of <em>Year One</em>. The home renovation focus of the Inn at Boonsboro trilogy \u2013 Roberts herself lives near the small Maryland town of Boonsboro, where she owns a hotel, fitness centre, restaurant and boutique and where her husband runs a bookshop.</p> <p>My personal favourites are her chunky suspense stories \u2013 <em>Chasing Fire</em>, <em>Black Hills</em>, <em>Whiskey Beach </em>\u2013 that<em> </em>feature strong, intriguing heroines (a firefighter; a search-and-rescue dog handler; a yoga teacher/cleaner; a chef) and glorious settings such as Alaska or Montana. Usually there will be a dog, and some horses if you\u2019re lucky. The repartee is sharp, the ties between characters meaningful, the dilemmas disturbing \u2013 one protagonist is the daughter of a serial killer; another survives a mass shooting.</p> <p>There might be a budding relationship at their heart \u2013 and some mindblowing orgasms \u2013 but none of Roberts\u2019s books these days is packaged as a romance novel. Despite that, she says, she\u2019s going to be called a romance writer for the rest of her life. She accepts it \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t like the way romance writing is dismissed. It always baffles her, she says, that crime writing is seen as \u201csomehow OK\u201d, when \u201cromance is relationships, love stories, forming families, an emotional bond \u2013 and somehow that\u2019s not worthy? Romance is primarily by and for women so until we have a woman president and women start getting real respect \u2026 You can\u2019t win it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a novelist \u2013 that\u2019s it,\u201d she continues. \u201cAt this point my books are always going to have relationships in them, but, surprisingly, many novels have relationships in them,\u201d she adds sarcastically.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7d59d2c00b49748a6d16daed6bfc72b072ce2f16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d59d2c00b49748a6d16daed6bfc72b072ce2f16/0_0_313_499/313.jpg\" alt=\"Captivated and Entranced by Nora Roberts\" width=\"313\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s clear you still don\u2019t want to mess with her. Last year, it emerged that a romance novelist had allegedly plagiarised a host of authors, including Roberts. Roberts accused her of committing \u201cmulti-plagiarism\u201d on a \u201crare and scandalous\u201d level. And like one of her no-nonsense heroines, she used her blog to warn any other writers who might be doing similar things: \u201cEnjoy it while it lasts, because it\u2019s now my mission to turn over the rocks you hide under, then stomp you deep in the muck you breed in.\u201d</p> <p>After our interview finishes, I bump into Roberts and Wilder setting out for a stroll around the castle grounds. She\u2019s travelled here with her family, including her nine-month-old grandson and his parents \u2013 but she\u2019s still fitting in time to write.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m told that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/20/robert-b-parker-dies\" title=\"\">Robert B Parker</a>, one of my favourite authors, died at his computer. Bob \u2013 that\u2019s just the way to go,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a workhorse. I\u2019m the same.\u201d</p>",

Published by such houses as Mills &amp; Boon and Silhouette, these books come in different lines \u2013 medical, historical, contemporary \u2013 with new titles released every month. The genre, notorious in the past for its domineering heroes and lily-livered heroines, \u201creally did evolve\u201d over time. \u201cThe heroes were still a bit dominant back in the 80s, but my heroines tended to be stronger and more independent, so gradually it became more of a partnership.\u201d The evolution of romance publishing is ongoing: today, authors\u2019 body the Romance Writers of America, which Roberts joined in 1980, is in the middle of a racism row. Roberts criticised the organisation over its homophobia in 2005, after it published a statement \u201cdefining romance as one man/one woman\u201d \u2013 \u201cJesus, it\u2019s fine to have a character fall in love with a freaking vampire, but not someone of the same sex? Bullshit. Just bullshit,\u201d she wrote on her blog. Roberts has since left the RWA, but she describes the current situation, with the organisation imploding over its decision to discipline novelist Courtney Milan for her public criticism of a fellow author\u2019s novel for racism, as \u201chorrendous\u201d. The discipline of category romance gave her a great foundation, but what Roberts really wanted to write was romantic suspense \u2013 in the vein of Mary Stewart, the British author who pioneered the genre with titles including Nine Coaches Waiting and Madam, Will You Talk?. Roberts released her first standalone romantic thriller, Hot Ice, in which a Manhattan socialite crosses paths with a thief on the trail of a hidden fortune, in 1987. \u201cI could use swear words! The relationship was still key, but I could develop the characters, every scene didn\u2019t have to be together or spatting or making up. A friend of mine once said that category romance is all the elements of a book \u2013 the lighting, the costumes, the characters, the music \u2013 in a phone booth. And I could get outside the phone booth.\u201d In 1995, Roberts tried something new. She published Naked in Death (about tough-as-nails cop Eve Dallas and her love interest, the billionaire Irishman Roarke) under a pseudonym, JD Robb. The pen name was \u201ckind of an experiment\u201d; her publisher at Putnam, overwhelmed with the quantity of writing she was sending its way, wanted her to put some books out under a different name. \u201cPhyllis Grann was head of Putnam back then, she\u2019d come in with this New York accent: \u2018Nooora, ya need a hobby.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t want a hobby: forget the other writers, I could fill all the bookstores in all the land.\u2019\u201d But Grann eventually convinced her that she could be two popular brands. The character of Dallas came to her. \u201cShe was dark and troubled, but so interesting. I thought, leap it into the future but close, not like tentacles, more speculative future. Let\u2019s try that.\u201d When sales hit a certain level, they \u201chad the big reveal\u201d; Roberts\u2019s new competition was, in fact, Roberts herself, writing under another name. This month, she publishes the 50th novel in what was originally set to be a trilogy, Golden in Death, in which Dallas and her team are after the killer of a model husband and father. Shortly after her debut as JD Robb, and riding high in the charts, Roberts received a nasty shock. She was contacted by a reader about similarities between her book Sweet Revenge, originally published in 1988, and Dailey\u2019s Notorious, published in 1996. Lawyers were hired on both sides, and Roberts discovered further plagiarism. She won the case \u2013 you don\u2019t mess with La Nora \u2013 and donated the settlement to literacy projects. Today, she still publishes four to five books a year, including two JD Robbs. She rises early, 5.30 or 6am. She gets a Diet Pepsi, and is writing by eight, going through until it\u2019s \u201cwork-out time\u201d, around 2.30pm. \u201cIt\u2019s six to eight hours a day, every day,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd no, it\u2019s never easy. It shouldn\u2019t be easy. If it was easy everyone would do it \u2026 It\u2019s an art and a science and a skill.\u201d A Roberts novel can be many things. The futuristic cop stories of JD Robb. The post-apocalyptic horror of Year One. The home renovation focus of the Inn at Boonsboro trilogy \u2013 Roberts herself lives near the small Maryland town of Boonsboro, where she owns a hotel, fitness centre, restaurant and boutique and where her husband runs a bookshop. My personal favourites are her chunky suspense stories \u2013 Chasing Fire, Black Hills, Whiskey Beach \u2013 that feature strong, intriguing heroines (a firefighter; a search-and-rescue dog handler; a yoga teacher/cleaner; a chef) and glorious settings such as Alaska or Montana. Usually there will be a dog, and some horses if you\u2019re lucky. The repartee is sharp, the ties between characters meaningful, the dilemmas disturbing \u2013 one protagonist is the daughter of a serial killer; another survives a mass shooting. There might be a budding relationship at their heart \u2013 and some mindblowing orgasms \u2013 but none of Roberts\u2019s books these days is packaged as a romance novel. Despite that, she says, she\u2019s going to be called a romance writer for the rest of her life. She accepts it \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t like the way romance writing is dismissed. It always baffles her, she says, that crime writing is seen as \u201csomehow OK\u201d, when \u201cromance is relationships, love stories, forming families, an emotional bond \u2013 and somehow that\u2019s not worthy? Romance is primarily by and for women so until we have a woman president and women start getting real respect \u2026 You can\u2019t win it. \u201cI\u2019m a novelist \u2013 that\u2019s it,\u201d she continues. \u201cAt this point my books are always going to have relationships in them, but, surprisingly, many novels have relationships in them,\u201d she adds sarcastically. It\u2019s clear you still don\u2019t want to mess with her. Last year, it emerged that a romance novelist had allegedly plagiarised a host of authors, including Roberts. Roberts accused her of committing \u201cmulti-plagiarism\u201d on a \u201crare and scandalous\u201d level. And like one of her no-nonsense heroines, she used her blog to warn any other writers who might be doing similar things: \u201cEnjoy it while it lasts, because it\u2019s now my mission to turn over the rocks you hide under, then stomp you deep in the muck you breed in.\u201d After our interview finishes, I bump into Roberts and Wilder setting out for a stroll around the castle grounds. She\u2019s travelled here with her family, including her nine-month-old grandson and his parents \u2013 but she\u2019s still fitting in time to write. \u201cI\u2019m told that Robert B Parker, one of my favourite authors, died at his computer. Bob \u2013 that\u2019s just the way to go,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a workhorse. I\u2019m the same.\u201d",

A short time ago in the women\u2019s semis Garbine Muguruza, unseeded at a slam for the first time in six years, upset the Wimbledon champion Simona Halep, 7-6 (8), 7-5, fighting off four set points in the opening set and twice coming from a break down in the second. Earlier the inspired Russian-born American Sofia Kenin edged out the world No 1 Ashleigh Barty by almost the same score, 7-6 (6), 7-5, in the most sweltering conditions of the tournament so far (just hearing that the mercury hit 40 degrees is warming me up after my winter walk into Guardian Towers). It will be a first grand slam final for the 21-year-old Kenin, a first Australian Open final for the former French Open and Wimbledon champion Muguruza, while for Barty and Australia, the 42-year wait for a home female champion will go on. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e31bfc58f0811db2faed98f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T17:24:43.787Z\">5.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s been a tough week or so for poor Roger Federer. First he was forced to come from 8-4 down in a final-set tie-break to get past Australia\u2019s John Millman in the third round; then he had to save seven match points against the world No 100, Tennys Sandgren, in the quarter-finals when he showed rare physical and mental vulnerability by playing on almost one leg and getting a slap on the wrists for swearing; and now he\u2019s got to face the virtually unbeatable Melbourne machine Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. The same Novak Djokovic who, in their last grand slam meeting six months ago, had the audacity to save two championship points before denying him in <em>that</em> Wimbledon final. The indignity of it all! At least Dominic Thiem did him a favour by bundling out Rafael Nadal yesterday and ending the Spaniard\u2019s bid to draw level with Federer\u2019s record of 20 grand slam titles \u2013 for the time being at least. Had the GOAT become only the joint GOAT by Sunday, that really would have added insult to injury.</p> <p>In contrast Djokovic has been doing what Djokovic does at the Australian Open, moving through the draw with ominous intent. The Serbian cyborg has not dropped a set since his opening match against the big-hitting German Jan-Lennard Struff, has lost serve only once in the past four rounds and dominated a dangerous Milos Raonic as he laid down a marker in the quarter-finals. Djokovic looks to be close to his best and a record-extending eighth title would make him to this slam what Federer is to Wimbledon. It looks as if Federer may need a third Melbourne miracle to beat his great rival in their 50th meeting but, until the last ball is hit, the man who has been down so many times this tournament cannot be entirely ruled out.</p> <p> <strong>The players will be on court </strong><strong>at </strong><strong>around: </strong>7.30pm Melbourne time/8.30am GMT.</p> <p><strong>In the meantime: </strong>why not keep yourself entertained with memories of their Wimbledon tussle from last year.

      "bodyText": "Right that\u2019s it from me. Thanks for reading/emailing/tweeting. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with coverage of the second semi-final between Alex Zverev and Dominic Thiem. Jamie Murray also plays for a place in the mixed doubles final. Bye! In case you\u2019ve missed it, here\u2019s more on what happened in two gripping women\u2019s semi-finals earlier: A match report for you: Djokovic speaks: It could have definitely gone a different way. He started off really well, I was pretty nervous at the beginning. Respect to Roger for coming out tonight, he was obviously hurt and wasn\u2019t close to his best in terms of movement. It was not the right mindset from me at the beginning of the match, I was looking at how he was moving rather than executing my shots. I managed to dig my way back and it was very important to win that first set. Djokovic wags his finger in the air and beats his chest. The pair exchange pleasantries at the net before Federer departs the Rod Laver Arena. He\u2019ll be having nightmares tonight about the way the first set slipped away from him and, given Federer\u2019s physical problems, once Djokovic was ahead there was only going to be one winner. Djokovic will play either Alex Zverev or Dominic Thiem in the final on Sunday. It would take a supreme performance from the younger challenger to deny Djokovic on the court where he has produced some of the finest displays of his career. 15-0 ... 30-0 ... the pair then move each other right and left and right and left and Federer emerges victorious with an unreturned bullet of a backhand. And then a crunching cross-court forehand from Federer gets him to 30-all! Two of his best shots of the match. He\u2019s saved the best for last. But a stubborn Djokovic comes right back, as he always does, and it\u2019s match point, 40-30. Djokovic misses the first serve, then bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounces the ball before landing his second, and Federer\u2019s shot flops into the net! Djokovic has got the better of Federer for the fourth time in an Australian Open semi-final and he\u2019s now only one win away from a record-extending eighth title! Much of the talk this fortnight was about Rafael Nadal potentially matching Federer\u2019s grand slam record of 20 but Djokovic is now on the verge of closing within two of Nadal and three of Federer. He may well end up being the greatest of them all. Third set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 3-5 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) Djokovic looks in the mood to finish this on Federer\u2019s serve. It\u2019s 30-all. But there\u2019s a wry smile from Djokovic when he can\u2019t make it match point. Federer has game point at 40-30 and Djokovic then whistles wide. But the defending champion is about to step up to serve for a place in his eighth Australian Open final ... Third set: *Federer 6-7, 4-6, 2-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server) \u201cGiven Nadal\u2019s loss to Them last night and the fact that Thiem has beaten him on clay once each of the last three years, 2020 Paris is by no means a given,\u201d says Shankar Mony. \u201cAnd Novak does look healthiest and best of equals. For my money, Novak is the most complete of the three and should get to 20 and beyond, as deserved richly.\u201d And this from Peter Kane: \u201cThe debate is close to over as regards the greatest of all time, Djoko\u2019s professional record is better all but for the slams. But critically his head to head is better against both Nadal and Federer. And if he stays healthy, he has 5 years on Federer to close the slam tally. Djoko is the GOAT..\u201d Djokovic whizzes through another service game and it\u2019s now just a matter of putting the finishing touches on this win .. Third set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 2-4 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) Federer seems safe at 40-15, is pulled back to 40-30, and then deuce when he fluffs his lines and nets a weak backhand. It\u2019s the first deuce game of the set. Wife Mirka grimaces in the stands. So does an ailing Federer as he stretches his aching body. It\u2019s break point. And Federer is flailing when Djokovic lands possibly the decisive blow in this match with a looping forehand that HawkEye confirms grazed the line. Third set: *Federer 6-7, 4-6, 2-3 Djokovic (*denotes next server) \u201cI wish people would give Djokovic the support and respect that he deserves (in Australia and elsewhere) as he is a competitor like no other that contributed immensely to the sport and today\u2019s match is no exception,\u201d writes Katerina Hemalova. I think if he wasn\u2019t playing Federer here he would be getting more love from the crowd: they do respect what Djokovic has done here in winning seven titles, but cheering against Federer is almost deemed sacrilegious in tennis. There\u2019s a smattering of applause as Djokovic holds to 15. Third set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 2-2 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) Federer produces a hat-trick of aces to defiantly hold to love. Third set: Federer *6-7, 4-6, 1-2 Djokovic (*denotes next server) Of course a great subplot to this match is the race to finish as the GOAT. If Djokovic goes on to win the title, he\u2019ll be on 17 slams, two behind Nadal on 19 (who\u2019ll surely make it 20 at the French Open) and three behind Federer. And Djokovic looks as if he has the time and health on his side to surpass both. Who do you think will end top of tennis\u2019s great triumvirate? But back to on-court matters, where a hold apiece makes it 1-1, before Djokovic comes through a slightly trickier game to 30. Once again most of the spectators can\u2019t bring themselves to applaud Djokovic getting another game on the board. Though the Serbian supporters back their man with a \u201cNole! Nole! Nole!\u201d Federer\u2019s in danger at 30-all and again at deuce. The alarm bells are then ringing at full volume when Djokovic produces a stinging return of serve for set point. Surely Federer isn\u2019t coming back from two sets down? But he\u2019s going to have to try, because more outstanding play from Djokovic, as he chases down a drop shot before sending it past Federer, secures the set. The Rod Laver Arena falls virtually silent. But Djokovic \u2013 fists pumping and eyes bulging \u2013 is roaring. Second set: Federer *6-7, 4-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server) This set hasn\u2019t had the wild swings in momentum of the first, but it\u2019s absorbing nonetheless, as it moves steadily to its denouement with both players attempting to out-serve each other. From Federer\u2019s love hold to a 15 hold for Djokovic, who\u2019s dropped only two points on serve in this set. Federer must hold to avoid going two sets to love down. Second set: Federer 6-7, 4-4 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game, as the ace count hits 12. A love hold will give Djokovic something to think about. Credit to Federer for the way he\u2019s hauled himself off the canvas after the way he was beaten up by Djokovic at the end of the first set. Second set: *Federer 6-7, 3-4 Djokovic (*denotes next server) Federer is definitely attacking the net more in this set, an approach that is bringing some reward, despite Djokovic\u2019s immense passing ability. That said, on game point to Djokovic here, Federer can\u2019t produce any fireworks at the net and it\u2019s another straightforward hold for the Serb. Second set: Federer 6-7, 3-3 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) Gasps as the 38-year-old Federer shows lighting reactions at the net to deal with Djokovic\u2019s thunderbolts and it\u2019s 30-all. Make that 30-40. Djokovic doesn\u2019t take advantage of the break point when he could \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 have done better. Instead he biffs a backhand long. Deuce. And from there Federer fights for the hold. Second set: *Federer 6-7, 2-3 Djokovic (*denotes next server) A tactics change-up helps Federer hold to 30 with some serve-volleying. Cue some more \u201clet\u2019s go Roger, let\u2019s go\u201d inanity \u2013 but given Federer\u2019s wounds are still raw from the first set the chants seem more in hope than belief. Djokovic then darts through another service game, holding to 15, and that\u2019s five successive holds \u2013 a different story to the first set. Fancy a stat attack? Sure you do. Second set: *Federer 6-7, 1-2 Djokovic (*denotes next server) A love hold for Djokovic as the sun sets on Rod Laver. Into the night we go ... Second set: Federer 6-7, 1-1 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) This could be about to go from bad to worse for Federer. It\u2019s 15-40 on his serve. He can\u2019t afford to go a break and a set down, especially if he\u2019s feeling it physically. He grits his teeth and gets to deuce. Djokovic is shrugging and shaking his head when he misses the chance to get a third break point of the game. Djokovic\u2019s forehand is then called out but it was a very late call, Djokovic decides to challenge, and HawkEye confirms the defending champion went wide. Federer steadies himself with a valuable hold. Second set: *Federer 6-7, 0-1 Djokovic (*denotes next server) Djokovic starts the set with a comfortable hold. And here\u2019s that point at 5-1 in the breaker for your viewing pleasure: So for the second match in a row, Federer has called for a rare medical timeout, something that he said after the quarter-finals is a \u201csign of weakness\u201d. He must be hurting. But not only physically, given the way Djokovic broke him mentally in that first set. Djokovic also decides to see a doctor and takes a pill for something. It\u2019s all going on. But Federer is back and Djokovic will get this second set under way... Outstanding play from Djokovic brings up five set points. He produces quite possibly the shot of the match with a delightful drop-shot around the net post while on the run and the ball bounces in. And a ripping return gives Djokovic the set! After Federer had led 4-1, 40-0! But you just can\u2019t beat Djokovic, the Superman of tennis, even when he\u2019s down. First set tie-break: Federer 1-5 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) Neither player has lost a tie-break this year, so something\u2019s gotta give. My money\u2019s on Djokovic, given he\u2019s got the momentum and has a habit of getting under the skin of Federer when it matters most. He rattles through the first three points for a 3-0 lead, before Federer gets on the board with a rasping winner. That will have felt good. But the next point won\u2019t, because Federer meekly nets. An ace from Djokovic and he changes ends very much in command leading 5-1 ... First set: *Federer 6-6 Djokovic (*denotes next server) Djokovic is serving to take this set into a tie-break, which is, incidentally, how the first set of their Wimbledon final was decided too. Djokovic won that breaker 7-5. And he sets up another here by holding to 30 with a stinging serve out wide that Federer can only prod into the net. First set: Federer 6-5 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) Federer, from 5-2 up in the set, is now serving at 5-5, 15-40 down, despite a stunning stop volley on the opening point. Some scar tissue from that Wimbledon final? Perhaps. Maybe he still wonders how he let that one slip away. But back to today\u2019s proceedings. Federer flicks away an overhead and then saves the second break point too. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Game Federer. A gutsy, gutsy hold. First set: *Federer 5-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server) At 30-15, the pair are both flirting with the lines, and Djokovic then hits deep to Federer\u2019s backhand, which loops well long. Djokovic quickly serves it out from 40-15. That\u2019s three games on the spin for Djokovic. Just as he was for much of last year\u2019s Wimbledon final, he\u2019s been the inferior player this set, but he could still find a way to silence Federer. First set: Federer 5-4 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) As Federer steps up to serve for the first set, the crowd chant \u201cLet\u2019s go Roger, let\u2019s go.\u201d Cue Ross McGillivray. \u201cIs there a more inane chant than \u2018let\u2019s go (insert name) let\u2019s go ...\u2019\u201d he emails. \u201cIf I was in charge I\u2019d chuck em out.\u201d Perhaps to demonstrate the inanity of said chanting, Federer flops 0-40 down. He can\u2019t find a first serve. And then Djokovic does what Djokovic does, stepping up in the big moment, laughing in the face of adversity, and breaking Federer to love after a long rally in which Federer eventually nets. They\u2019re back on serve. First set: *Federer 5-3 Djokovic (*denotes next server) One positive for Djokovic: he is, at least, serving with new balls. But even they don\u2019t give him the instant boost he needs. 0-15. 0-30. Djokovic darts forward and thumps away a winner \u2013 but has his heart in his mouth for a brief moment when it looks as if he may touch the net and therefore concede the point. 15-30. 30-all. 40-30. Djokovic has missed only six first serves so far but still has his back against the wall. Deuce. Advantage Djokovic. Djokovic lives to fight another game in this set. First set: Federer 5-2 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) Federer has been averaging 10 aces a match in Melbourne but he\u2019s already up to seven in this semi-final. 15-0. 30-0. 40-0. He\u2019s serving so sweetly. And a netted Djokovic return gives Federer a love game in just over a minute. Djokovic must hold serve to prevent Federer from taking an unexpected one-set lead in this match. First set: *Federer 4-2 Djokovic (*denotes next server) 0-15. 0-30. 0-40. Federer has nothing to lose and is going for broke. Djokovic looks shell-shocked. Djokovic\u2019s box has something to cheer about when a well-judged challenge gets him back to 30-40. But there\u2019s still a third break point to save, Federer steps in and attempts to put away the forehand ... and thwacks into the net! From 0-40 to deuce. This would be a massive hold for Djokovic. The Serb is a little lucky to get to advantage, is pulled back to deuce, edges to advantage once more, and holds when Federer flings a backhand wide. What looked as if it may be about to become a 5-1 deficit is now 4-2. How crucial could that be in this set? First set: Federer 4-1 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) The spectators are screaming in delight when Federer\u2019s smash gets him to 40-30. And a third ace of the game backs up the break. First set: *Federer 3-1 Djokovic (*denotes next server) Raging against the lack of love from the crowd almost makes Djokovic a better player though. \u201cWhen the crowd is chanting \u2018Roger\u2019 I hear \u2018Novak\u2019,\u201d said the Serb after his Wimbledon win. \u201cIt sounds silly, but it is like that.\u201d He appears on course for the most straightforward hold of this match so far at 40-15 but that quickly becomes deuce and then break point Federer. Djokovic survives and does so again on a second advantage for Federer, but is unable to resist a third break point when, off balance, he makes a mess of his backhand. That\u2019s three breaks in a row and 11 points lost on Djokovic\u2019s serve so far in two games. The crowd are happy but Djokovic is not. \u201cSeeing how tremendously well Federer is playing with just having broken Djokovic, makes knew wonder whether or not he was injured in the previous game ...or was it all a tactic for that opponent and this opponent?\u201d emails Xhindoli Lela. \u201cTennis is such a mental game and this match will surely be nothing short of that.\u201d First set: Federer 2-1 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) Neither of these players is having it easy on serve. No sooner does Federer break than he is broken to 30, with Djokovic demonstrating why he\u2019s considered the game\u2019s greatest returner. The crowd roared in delight when Federer broke; Djokovic\u2019s break is greeted by silence. Poor Novak. He\u2019s the seven-times champion here \u2013 what does he have to do to get some love against Federer? Someone give him a hug. First set: *Federer 2-0 Djokovic (*denotes next server) Federer appears to have that suspect groin strapped but he\u2019s moving freely and flicks away a backhand winner for 15-30 on Djokovic\u2019s serve. Djokovic goes for the sideline but skews his forehand just wide. 15-40. Now Federer has two break points after Djokovic had the same in the opening game. And Federer strikes on the first when he somehow threads a backhand through the eye of a needle to pull off a passing winner with virtually his back to the court! Wow. First set: Federer 1-0 Djokovic* (*denotes next server) So it\u2019s Federer to get this semi-final under way. And it\u2019s not the most auspicious of starts. He slides 0-30 down. A strong serve reduces his arrears to 15-30 but then a longer exchange plays out on the next point \u2013 these are the kind of rallies where you\u2019d put your money on Djokovic \u2013 and Federer eventually flaps into the net after a 17-shot encounter. Two break points for Djokovic right from the off. 15-40. Federer fends off the first and fires away a cross-court forehand winner off Djokovic\u2019s return on the second. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Deuce. Given Federer\u2019s fitness issues he could do without such a long opening duel. Advantage Federer. Deuce. Advantage Federer, courtesy of a third ace. Federer eventually holds after a six-minute game. For the second consecutive match Djokovic is wearing the initials KB on his tracksuit in tribute to his friend and mentor Kobe Bryant. He takes it off for the warm-up, and is once again in green, with Federer in navy and purple. Do remember you can get in touch with any musings via email or Twitter. Let\u2019s talk! Here they come, making their way through the corridors of the Rod Laver Arena, with Federer, the six-times champion, stepping on to court just before Djokovic, the seven-times winner. It\u2019s 7.41pm in the evening in Melbourne and it\u2019s still 38 degrees. Federer says: \u201cNovak also has gone on all these runs like I did for 10 years. He did the same for the last 10 years. I think conditions suit us well here. Start the year strong. Probably something to do with court speed, feeling comfortable down here. It helps when you start the year off with a bang like he did at the ATP Cup.\u201d Djokovic says: \u201cHe is one of the all-time greats and the match-ups against Roger and Rafa have made me the player I am today. You know he\u2019s always going to play at such a high level, regardless of the surface.\u201d So what does Federer need to do? He\u2019ll have to hit the spots with his serve, be laser-like in hitting the lines, take risks and hold his nerve in the big moments. And perhaps put some stones in the Serb\u2019s shoes. But back to Federer v Djokovic. This will be the 50th meeting between the pair. Djokovic leads the head-to-head 26-23, which includes a 3-1 record in Melbourne, and each of those three wins came in the semi-finals (Djokovic has a perfect 14-0 record in semi and final matches at the Australian Open). Federer has also not beaten his rival at a slam since 2012, but it\u2019s not all bad news for him; he did win their last meeting, at the ATP World Tour Finals in November. However that was on a faster court in a best-of-three-set match. This is very different. No Brit managed to make it out of the second round of the singles last week, but Britain will have a finalist in Melbourne because Joe Salisbury and his American partner Rajeev Ram have won their men\u2019s doubles semi. The 11th seeds beat Kazakhstan\u2019s Alexander Bublik and Mikhail Kukushkin 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 on the Evonne Goolagong sorry Margaret Court Arena. They will face the Australian wildcards Luke Saville and Max Purcell in Sunday\u2019s final. Kevin\u2019s been busy. Here\u2019s his preview of Federer v Djokovic: And he\u2019s also been giving his thoughts on Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe\u2019s protest against Margaret Court: Here\u2019s a report from our man in Melbourne, Kevin Mitchell: Ashleigh Barty fell just short of pleasing millions of Australians when the American Sofia Kenin gritted her teeth on the hottest day of the 2020 Australian Open to win their semi-final 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 on Rod Laver Arena on Thursday. Her opponent in the final on Saturday night is Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, who beat the world No 3 Simona Halep in the second semi-final 7-6 (10-8), 7-5. The Spaniard, who arrived with a viral illness and was unseeded in a slam for the first time in six years, took the title favourite out of her stride at key moments in both sets, despite 44 unforced errors in just over two hours. Had Barty been able to drag the match into a third set, they would have had to take a 10-minute break according to the regulations of the tournament. The heat stress reading hovered just below five, which would have required the match to be suspended. Neither player wanted that. Both fought hard all the way. Kenin\u2019s Russian-born father, Alex, (who calls her Sonya) arrived in America with $300 in his pocket \u2013 mirroring the experience of Maria Sharapova and her father \u2013 and he could hardly stop beaming in the stands. The journey has a little way to go, but this was a landmark event, passage into her first slam final at 21, saving two set points in each set against the world No 1. You can read the rest here: And we\u2019ve also got some reaction from Barty: Perhaps Federer can take heart from the fact it\u2019s been the day of the underdog. A short time ago in the women\u2019s semis Garbine Muguruza, unseeded at a slam for the first time in six years, upset the Wimbledon champion Simona Halep, 7-6 (8), 7-5, fighting off four set points in the opening set and twice coming from a break down in the second. Earlier the inspired Russian-born American Sofia Kenin edged out the world No 1 Ashleigh Barty by almost the same score, 7-6 (6), 7-5, in the most sweltering conditions of the tournament so far (just hearing that the mercury hit 40 degrees is warming me up after my winter walk into Guardian Towers). It will be a first grand slam final for the 21-year-old Kenin, a first Australian Open final for the former French Open and Wimbledon champion Muguruza, while for Barty and Australia, the 42-year wait for a home female champion will go on. It\u2019s been a tough week or so for poor Roger Federer. First he was forced to come from 8-4 down in a final-set tie-break to get past Australia\u2019s John Millman in the third round; then he had to save seven match points against the world No 100, Tennys Sandgren, in the quarter-finals when he showed rare physical and mental vulnerability by playing on almost one leg and getting a slap on the wrists for swearing; and now he\u2019s got to face the virtually unbeatable Melbourne machine Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. The same Novak Djokovic who, in their last grand slam meeting six months ago, had the audacity to save two championship points before denying him in that Wimbledon final. The indignity of it all! At least Dominic Thiem did him a favour by bundling out Rafael Nadal yesterday and ending the Spaniard\u2019s bid to draw level with Federer\u2019s record of 20 grand slam titles \u2013 for the time being at least. Had the GOAT become only the joint GOAT by Sunday, that really would have added insult to injury. In contrast Djokovic has been doing what Djokovic does at the Australian Open, moving through the draw with ominous intent. The Serbian cyborg has not dropped a set since his opening match against the big-hitting German Jan-Lennard Struff, has lost serve only once in the past four rounds and dominated a dangerous Milos Raonic as he laid down a marker in the quarter-finals. Djokovic looks to be close to his best and a record-extending eighth title would make him to this slam what Federer is to Wimbledon. It looks as if Federer may need a third Melbourne miracle to beat his great rival in their 50th meeting but, until the last ball is hit, the man who has been down so many times this tournament cannot be entirely ruled out. The players will be on court at around: 7.30pm Melbourne time/8.30am GMT. In the meantime: why not keep yourself entertained with memories of their Wimbledon tussle from last year. The 11-minute highlights are probably preferable to the full four hours and 57 minutes if you want to check back in time for today\u2019s encounter.",

It calls on Palestinians to recognise Israel as a Jewish state with all of Jerusalem as its capital, to give up the right of return that would allow Palestinian refugees to live in Israel, to accept the annexation of the Jordan Valley and the illegal Israeli settlements there, and to live in a series of Bantustans connected by roads and tunnels that would all essentially be controlled by Israel.</p> \n<p>None of this should be surprising.

At the time, however, the Palestinian scholar Edward Said dubbed the much celebrated accords <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v15/n20/edward-said/the-morning-after\" title=\"\">\u201ca Palestinian Versailles\u201d</a>, a degrading spectacle that undermined the liberation struggle and any hopes for future Palestinian sovereignty.

      "bodyText": "At the White House on Tuesday, Donald Trump laid out his \u201cdeal of the century\u201d: a plan for total Palestinian capitulation. It calls on Palestinians to recognise Israel as a Jewish state with all of Jerusalem as its capital, to give up the right of return that would allow Palestinian refugees to live in Israel, to accept the annexation of the Jordan Valley and the illegal Israeli settlements there, and to live in a series of Bantustans connected by roads and tunnels that would all essentially be controlled by Israel. None of this should be surprising. Not only is the plan simply a continuation of the Trump administration\u2019s policy towards Israel and Palestine since the day he took office, but it comes after decades of disregard towards Palestinian aspirations of freedom and sovereignty. When the Oslo peace accords were signed in 1993, they were hailed as the foundation for a negotiated peace between Israel and Palestine \u2013 a stance that most international actors and bodies have continued to hold in the decades since. At the time, however, the Palestinian scholar Edward Said dubbed the much celebrated accords \u201ca Palestinian Versailles\u201d, a degrading spectacle that undermined the liberation struggle and any hopes for future Palestinian sovereignty. Unfortunately, he has been proven right. The division of the West Bank into Areas A, B and C under the accords allowed Israel to dominate the latter two areas while the former became pockets of limited Palestinian autonomy. In other words, it facilitated the complete Bantustanisation of the West Bank and the isolation of Gaza. Meanwhile, the accords failed to properly address the key issues of Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, borders and security; instead, they were designated \u201cfinal status issues\u201d, to be resolved as part of some future peace deal. Inadvertently, then, the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organisation), led by Yasser Arafat, allowed them to become disputed issues, rather than ones central to the Palestinian struggle and defined clearly in international law. This was clear at the White House yesterday when, standing at Trump\u2019s side, Benjamin Netanyahu said that talk of the occupation as \u201cillegal\u201d was outrageous. There were no Palestinians at the White House; indeed, Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and the architect of this plan, barely bothered to speak to any Palestinians. And there is no mention in Trump\u2019s plan of Palestinian rights. Instead Palestinians are promised economic incentives, namely $50bn of investment over the next 10 years, in exchange for their internationally enshrined rights \u2013 another all too familiar component of previous \u201cpeace\u201d plans. As if paying Palestinians off would make them forget the rights to Jerusalem, to return to their villages and towns of origin or to live as equal and full human beings. It is thus clear that Trump\u2019s plan is not only an assault on Palestinian rights and freedom but also an attempt to put forward a new world order that completely undermines international law. Whatever the White House might say, it never expected the Palestinian leadership would accept this plan or even consider some of its terms and conditions.

Depressing as the Trump plan may be, it does suggest one possible opportunity. It stipulates that while negotiations take place, the PLO is not to take part in any action against Israel at the international criminal court \u2013 in a nod to the recent war crimes probe opened by the court\u2019s chief prosecutor.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. China death toll jumps amid scramble to evacuate foreigners China has reported it biggest single-day leap in coronavirus deaths since the start of the outbreak, with the toll now at 170, up from 132 on Wednesday. The World Health Organisation is convening an expert committee on Thursday to decide whether to declare a global health emergency, warning \u201cthe whole world needs to be on alert now,\u201d as other nations scramble to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began. Wildlife markets. A prominent Chinese environmental campaigner has told the Guardian a temporary ban on China\u2019s wildlife markets ought to be made permanent to prevent the spread of other similar diseases in future. Sporting events. The World Indoor Athletics Championships, due to be held in Nanjing in March, has been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, while the Chinese Grand Prix, set to take place in Shanghai in April, is also in doubt. Republican moderates facing pressure over witness vote The likelihood that the senate will hear from witnesses in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial appears to be diminishing, as moderate Republicans such as Mitt Romney and Susan Collins come under increasing pressure from both sides over the impending vote on the matter. The eighth day of the trial on Wednesday saw the opposing legal teams lock horns for the first time, during an interrogation period in which they fielded written questions from senators. Friday vote. If senators decide on Friday not to call witnesses including the former national security adviser John Bolton, then the president may be acquitted before the weekend. Iowa race. In the final days before the Iowa caucuses, several Democratic presidential candidates are stuck in Washington at the impeachment trial, potentially leaving the field open to their rivals. Lauren Gambino reports from Des Moines. Politics blog. As the election looms, we are bringing forward the launch time for our US politics blog to 6am ET. You can read today\u2019s blog here. Will Trump\u2019s Middle East \u2018peace\u2019 plan create more conflict? Trump hailed his new plan for the Middle East as a \u201crealistic two-state solution\u201d, but others including the UN have expressed concerns about its viability and Israel\u2019s imminent annexation of illegal West Bank settlements. Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan called the policy \u201cabsolutely unacceptable,\u201d while Palestinians have outright rejected a plan that they had no hand in crafting. The US proposals will only create more conflict, writes Rashid Khalidi, because they require the Palestinians to accept defeat. Abu Dis. Trump wants the small town of Abu Dis, divided from nearby Jersualem by an Israeli wall, to be the capital of a new Palestinian state. But residents \u2013 and the town\u2019s mayor \u2013 poured scorn on the very idea. British MEPs mourn at their final EU debate on eve of Brexit There were emotional scenes at the European parliament in Brussels on Wednesday, as its members voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Immediately after the agreement was ratified, the chamber broke into a chorus of Auld Lang Syne. Some British MEPs, attending their final debate before the UK\u2019s official departure from the bloc on Friday, were moved to tears as they addressed the parliament for the last time. Nigel Farage. By contrast, the Brexit party leader, who did more than anyone to secure the UK\u2019s departure, left the chamber after being reprimanded for waving a union jack and talking of his \u201chate\u201d for the EU. The Guardian bans fossil fuel advertising The Guardian has announced it will no longer accept ads from oil and gas companies, making it the first major global news organisation to institute an outright ban on taking money from the fossil fuel industry. The move is part of efforts to reduce the Guardian\u2019s carbon footprint as we continue to report on the climate emergency. Read more about the decision here. Cheat sheet A section of Trump\u2019s coveted US-Mexico border wall was reportedly blown over by high winds on Wednesday, between the Californian town of Calexico and Mexicali in Mexico. California lawmakers have failed to pass ambitious new legislation that would have eliminated certain zoning restrictions and enabled the construction of more high-density housing, thereby alleviating the state\u2019s crippling housing crisis. Shares in Facebook fell 7% on Wednesday, despite the firm\u2019s bigger-than-projected fourth quarter earnings, suggesting rolling scandals and regulatory roadblocks may at last be catching up with Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social media giant. A guest on the latest edition of the US Antiques Roadshow, filmed in North Dakota, appeared to collapse after learning that a Rolex watch he purchased in 1974 for less than $350 was now worth more than $400,000. Must-reads Kelis on music, men and her missing money It\u2019s 20 years since Kelis broke out with her debut, Kaleidoscope. Now living a quieter life, writing cookbooks and living with her family on a farm outside LA, she tells Hadley Freeman she is still proud of that first LP: \u201cthe femaleness of the album, of the freaking outspokenness of it, the blackness of it, the alternativeness of it.\u201d Can Brad Parscale cast his spell on Trump voters again? Brad Parscale, the loyalist who fashioned Trump\u2019s digital campaign in 2016, is now the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager. He explains his strategy to David Smith, who asks whether he\u2019s really a brilliant alchemist, or just \u201can over-promoted troll\u201d. LA mourns Kobe: \u2018We didn\u2019t just lose a basketball player\u2019 The death of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant has cast a particular pall over Los Angeles, where unofficial tributes are springing up all over the city. To Angelenos, learns Andrew Gumbel, Kobe was more than a mere sportsman; he was \u201ca pillar of the community\u201d. Why food service changes how much we eat Three-course meals \u2013 starter, main, dessert \u2013 are a relatively modern idea, invented by Russian aristocrats and simplified for the contemporary table. It\u2019s wasteful and individualistic, argues Zoe Williams, which is why we should return to huge, shared platters. Opinion As they claimed the big prizes at Sunday\u2019s Grammys, Billie Eilish and Lizzo both suggested someone else ought to have won. These may be touching displays of sisterhood, says Yomi Adegoke, but they also perpetuate a sense that women are undeserving. Women downplaying our accomplishments is not surprising \u2013 we are, of course, expected to be eternally humble. But this buck-passing goes beyond bashfulness. Sport The US player Sofia Kenin has dashed local hopes by beating the Australian world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 in the semi-final of the Australian Open, and will now meet Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza in the final on Saturday. In his annual state of the league address, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has expressed his concern for the wellbeing of troubled wide receiver Antonio Brown, who remains on bail for charges relating to an attack on a moving-truck driver.

      "bodyText": "Limiting the use of Huawei equipment in BT\u2019s EE 5G mobile and full-fibre broadband networks will cost the telecoms group \u00a3500m over the next five years. BT uses more Huawei equipment in the masts and towers of its mobile network than is allowed under new government rules, meaning it will now have to be stripped out and replaced with hardware from other manufacturers. Earlier this week, the government said it would allow Huawei to be involved in the non-core parts of the UK\u2019s 5G network, the masts and towers, but with a 35% cap on use of the Chinese company\u2019s equipment. Huawei equipment is banned from use in the core of 5G mobile networks, where data is processed, and from locations such as nuclear sites and military bases. The same 35% cap applies to the gigabit-speed full-fibre broadband infrastructure, which is less problematic as the slow rollout to date means it has reached only 10% of UK homes. BT shares fell 7% as investors digested the financial cost of stripping out Huawei, as well as softer-than-expected third quarter results from the telecoms company. The company reported a 3% drop in revenue to \u00a35.8bn in the three months to the end of December, as profits fell 4% to \u00a31.97bn. \u201cThe way it works at the moment is when you put a 5G box on a mast it has to be on top of a 4G box from the same supplier,\u201d said Philip Jansen, the chief executive of BT. \u201cMore than 35% of [our] 4G boxes are Huawei. We are going to have to take out some Huawei 4G boxes and not use them again. That is probably the single biggest cost. In order to make 5G work we are going to have to use other manufacturers\u2019 equipment.\u201d Jansen hinted that the total cost could end up more than \u00a3500m as the 35% cap also applied to how much 5G data traffic was allowed to flow through Huawei equipment, not just the proportion of equipment. This could require additional replacement of Huawei equipment where it is being used in highly populated, high-traffic areas such as London and Manchester. \u201cIt is an estimate, but we are pretty comfortable,\u201d said Jansen. \u201c[The cap] is not just number of masts, it is traffic as well.

Jansen said meeting the 35% Huawei cap in the broadband network would not be a problem. Boris Johnson is aiming to get gigabit speed broadband to every UK home by 2025.

Grace Piper from Worthing, West Sussex, had picked up the eight-week-old from a breeder in Brighton that advertised its puppies on pets4homes.co.uk for \u00a3750 each in cash.</p> <p>\u201cShe started being sick, she had diarrhoea, was lethargic, dehydrated and withdrawn,\u201d Piper told the Guardian. \u201cWe called the vets [and] were told to feed her chicken and rice and hope for an improvement. All the time we were encouraging her to drink or eat something but all she wanted to do was sleep. We were increasingly worried.\u201d</p> <p>Then Maggie collapsed on the floor. \u201cAt this point we knew something was seriously wrong with her. We called the vets again, and were told to bring her in and all of a sudden she stopped breathing. We gave CPR and mouth to mouth \u2026 The vets rushed her in to perform CPR, but after five minutes we were told that they had done everything they could, but that she wasn\u2019t waking up.\u201d</p> <p>Piper is one of a number of people who bought puppies online from the same location in Brighton. The Guardian has spoken to two people, both of whom paid large sums of money for the puppies before losing them to canine parvovirus, a highly contagious disease which causes acute gastrointestinal illness.</p> <p>The deaths come as the RSPCA says that complaints about illegal puppy farming have increased dramatically over the past 10 years and that 87% of <a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/dogs/puppy\">current puppy trade calls</a> are about animals purchased online.</p> <p>\u201cThe owners who sold us Maggie would have most likely seen symptoms before we got her but still sold [to] us anyway. The mother should have been vaccinated but clearly was not,\u201d Piper said.</p> <p>\u201cThey were in a rush to get rid of her, and as soon as we left the door their phone was off, and we could no longer contact them.\u201d</p> <p>Piper, who shared her dilemma on Facebook, heard from other owners who said they had also bought puppies from the same dealers. When she spoke to the RSPCA, they told her that their \u201cinspector is going round to take those dogs out of the house as they are infected and should not be sold\u201d.</p> <p>An RSPCA spokesperson told the Guardian that they were aware of the Brighton breeder in question but said: \u201cUnfortunately, we can\u2019t discuss complaints related to specific people or addresses and what action may have been taken.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSadly, we hear stories like this all too often. This is why we urge people to be extremely careful when buying puppies from breeders.\u201d</p> <p>The RSPCA received 4,357 complaints in 2018 about the puppy trade in England, compared with 980 reports 10 years earlier in 2008. It marks an almost five-fold increase. East Sussex has seen a 127% increase in such reports in a decade.</p> <p>\u201cLooking back after what\u2019s happened to us,\u201d said Piper, \u201cit\u2019s made us realise the house was strange. No toys and the kids weren\u2019t allowed near the puppies. But we assumed then that the kids were kept away at the time for the viewing.\u201d</p> <p>Isabel Winters, who lives in Brighton, bought the last of four labrador puppies advertised by the same breeder on Gumtree. It fell ill within a few days before dying in a veterinary hospital due parvovirus.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole thing is clearly a scam,\u201d she said. \u201cI bought it from Gumtree and thought it was with a pedigree breeder. I thought it was ok.\u201d</p> <p>Winters\u2019 purchase was a present for her son. \u201cMy son\u2019s 14th birthday was coming up. He lost his father when he was nine, so this was a big thing for my son, to have a puppy.

Research by the Kennel Club last year found that about 30% of puppy buyers purchased their dogs from a puppy farm, a rise of 7% compared to 2018. \u201cThe growth of the internet has changed the buying habits of a lot of people and illegal puppy farmers will use advertising websites and social media to hide their true identity and use a website that makes them appear respectable and trustworthy when the reality may be completely different,\u201d said Lambert</p> <p>Lambert said parvovirus attacks the intestines and immune systems of affected puppies and dogs, and can be deadly if left untreated. \u201cIt is highly infectious and is passed from puppy to puppy very quickly.

Wayne Pivac is Wales\u2019s first new coach for 12 years, a change from the times when 12 months was closer to the average tenure, but the New Zealander does not have much in common other than his nationality with Gatland, who took Wales back to the 1970s in terms of success, if not style.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/30/george-north-centre-johnny-mcnicholl-wales-six-nations-rugby-union\">George North lines up at centre for Wales\u2019 Six Nations opener against Italy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wales were underrated under Gatland: beside a defence masterminded by Shaun Edwards, who will make a quick return to Cardiff with France, they had no one outstanding characteristic but became hard to beat.

His first task is to maintain the indomitable spirit that took them to the title and the World Cup semi-finals.

Wayne Pivac is Wales\u2019s first new coach for 12 years, a change from the times when 12 months was closer to the average tenure, but the New Zealander does not have much in common other than his nationality with Gatland, who took Wales back to the 1970s in terms of success, if not style. Wales were underrated under Gatland: beside a defence masterminded by Shaun Edwards, who will make a quick return to Cardiff with France, they had no one outstanding characteristic but became hard to beat. They were not reliant on one part of their game having to function and their grand slam success last year was based on an ability to chase a game, as they showed against France and England, and defend a lead, which they did at Scotland and at home to Ireland. Pivac has pledged to make Wales\u2019s attack more stiletto than bludgeon, although he starts without three of last year\u2019s first-choice backs. His first task is to maintain the indomitable spirit that took them to the title and the World Cup semi-finals. Achieve that, make them more cutting edge and Wales will be contenders again. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

      "body": "<p>On Sunday \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/kobe_bryant_death.php\">amid the wave of public eulogizing that followed the death of Kobe Bryant</a> \u2013 many people on Twitter stressed that we should also remember the time he was credibly accused of raping a hotel worker in Colorado. (Bryant denied the claim, but later settled with the woman, and said he understood \u201chow she feels that she did not consent to this encounter\u201d.)</p> <p>One such tweeter was Felicia Sonmez, a politics reporter at the Washington Post. Sonmez has consistently been vocal on issues of sexual assault; in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/criticism/felicia-sonmez-metoo.php\">she alleged she had been abused by Jon Kaiman</a>, who then worked for the LA Times. (Another woman made a similar claim; Kaiman, who subsequently lost his job, has strongly denied wrongdoing.)</p> <p>On Sunday, Sonmez first linked to <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-disturbing-rape-case-the-dna-evidence-the-accusers-story-and-the-half-confession\">a Daily Beast story</a> (which she didn\u2019t write) about the Bryant rape case without adding commentary of her own. She elaborated, but only after receiving a rash of abusive messages \u2013 including, she said, death threats. \u201cAny public figure is worth remembering in their totality,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat folks are responding with rage &amp; threats toward me \u2026 speaks volumes about the pressure people come under to stay silent in these cases.\u201d She also shared a screenshot of one nasty message she had received, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/business/media/kobe-bryant-washington-post-felicia-sonmez.html\">without masking the sender\u2019s name</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/29/washington-post-felicia-sonmez-kobe-bryant\">The Washington Post silenced one of its reporters. It now owes her an apology | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Managers at the Post were not happy with Sonmez. According to Rachel Abrams of the New York Times, Marty Baron, the paper\u2019s top editor, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/business/media/kobe-bryant-washington-post-felicia-sonmez.html\">emailed Sonmez a screenshot of her first Bryant tweet</a>, along with the message: \u201cFelicia, a real lack of judgment to tweet this. Please stop. You\u2019re hurting this institution by doing this.\u201d Tracy Grant, managing editor at the Post, then told Sonmez to delete the tweets, before suspending her on the grounds that she had strayed beyond her <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/27/posts-misguided-suspension-felicia-sonmez-over-kobe-bryant-tweets/\">\u201ccoverage area</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/27/posts-misguided-suspension-felicia-sonmez-over-kobe-bryant-tweets/\">\u201d</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7932771/Journalist-suspended-tweeting-link-story-Kobe-Bryants-rape-case-2003.html\">\u201cundermined\u201d</a> her colleagues\u2019 work. Responding to the threats Sonmez had faced, Grant added that she \u201cmight want to consider a hotel or a friend\u2019s place for this evening\u201d. (At least one of the threats referenced Sonmez\u2019s home address; Sonmez had contacted Grant to flag the threats, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/business/media/kobe-bryant-washington-post-felicia-sonmez.html\">as mandated by the Post\u2019s security protocols</a>.) This, many critics noted, felt like a dereliction of the paper\u2019s duty to ensure the safety of its staff.</p> <p>Many such critics could be found inside the Post\u2019s newsroom. The paper\u2019s guild wrote <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ErQ7bN352jQZ0Ka8kCzAW8CWr2zEnUIvms5BG2Kdt1E/edit\">an open letter to Baron and Grant</a>, accusing them of failing to protect Sonmez and noting this wasn\u2019t the first time management \u201chas sought to control how Felicia speaks on matters of sexual violence\u201d. Nearly 350 staffers had signed the letter.</p> <p>Opinion writers at the paper used their platforms to come to Sonmez\u2019s defense, too. On Monday, Erik Wemple <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/27/posts-misguided-suspension-felicia-sonmez-over-kobe-bryant-tweets/\">wrote that the backlash against her was rooted in</a> \u201cthe ancient wisdom that urges folks not to speak ill of the dead\u201d, which is \u201ca fine rule for everyone except for historians and journalists\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/remembering-kobe-bryant-is-complicated-but-felicia-sonmez-kept-both-eyes-on-the-truth/2020/01/28/de687214-41f0-11ea-aa6a-083d01b3ed18_story.html\">David Von Drehle concurred with Wemple</a>. Sonmez, he wrote, had been punished for keeping \u201cboth eyes on the truth \u2013 or more precisely, on one particular truth, namely that somewhere a woman was experiencing this outpouring of adulation for a man who choked and lacerated her during an encounter that she called a rape, and which he acknowledged was very much like one\u201d.</p> <p>Late on Tuesday, the Post retreated. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kriscoratti/status/1222281539100250114\">In a statement</a>, it said that following a \u201creview\u201d, it had concluded that Sonmez\u2019s tweets were \u201cill-timed,\u201d but \u201cnot in clear and direct violation of our social media policy\u201d. Sonmez was reinstated, though the statement was notably missing an apology. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/feliciasonmez/status/1222335744687198209\">In a statement of her own</a>, Sonmez hit back, insisting she and her colleagues deserve to hear directly from Baron, and noting that the episode had \u201csown confusion\u201d about the Post\u2019s values.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sonmezgate also exposes a more routine problem: the tyranny of the newsroom social media policy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As some observers (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cwarzel/status/1221953520808521728\">including Charlie Warzel of the New York Times</a>) noted, the Sonmez fiasco is a fresh reminder that newsrooms still struggle when coordinated mobs of online culture warriors target their staff. (Baron and Grant clearly feared institutional blowback, though it\u2019s possible they found Sonmez\u2019s tweets distasteful on their own terms.)</p> <p>The Post isn\u2019t alone here. Last year, the Times caused a mini media panic <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/us/politics/trump-allies-news-media.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">when it reported</a> that \u201ca loose network of conservative operatives\u201d had compiled dossiers incriminating \u201chundreds\u201d of reporters at leading outlets.

      "bodyText": "On Sunday \u2013 amid the wave of public eulogizing that followed the death of Kobe Bryant \u2013 many people on Twitter stressed that we should also remember the time he was credibly accused of raping a hotel worker in Colorado. (Bryant denied the claim, but later settled with the woman, and said he understood \u201chow she feels that she did not consent to this encounter\u201d.) One such tweeter was Felicia Sonmez, a politics reporter at the Washington Post. Sonmez has consistently been vocal on issues of sexual assault; in 2018, she alleged she had been abused by Jon Kaiman, who then worked for the LA Times. (Another woman made a similar claim; Kaiman, who subsequently lost his job, has strongly denied wrongdoing.) On Sunday, Sonmez first linked to a Daily Beast story (which she didn\u2019t write) about the Bryant rape case without adding commentary of her own. She elaborated, but only after receiving a rash of abusive messages \u2013 including, she said, death threats. \u201cAny public figure is worth remembering in their totality,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat folks are responding with rage &amp; threats toward me \u2026 speaks volumes about the pressure people come under to stay silent in these cases.\u201d She also shared a screenshot of one nasty message she had received, without masking the sender\u2019s name. Managers at the Post were not happy with Sonmez. According to Rachel Abrams of the New York Times, Marty Baron, the paper\u2019s top editor, emailed Sonmez a screenshot of her first Bryant tweet, along with the message: \u201cFelicia, a real lack of judgment to tweet this. Please stop. You\u2019re hurting this institution by doing this.\u201d Tracy Grant, managing editor at the Post, then told Sonmez to delete the tweets, before suspending her on the grounds that she had strayed beyond her \u201ccoverage area\u201d and \u201cundermined\u201d her colleagues\u2019 work. Responding to the threats Sonmez had faced, Grant added that she \u201cmight want to consider a hotel or a friend\u2019s place for this evening\u201d. (At least one of the threats referenced Sonmez\u2019s home address; Sonmez had contacted Grant to flag the threats, as mandated by the Post\u2019s security protocols.) This, many critics noted, felt like a dereliction of the paper\u2019s duty to ensure the safety of its staff. Many such critics could be found inside the Post\u2019s newsroom. The paper\u2019s guild wrote an open letter to Baron and Grant, accusing them of failing to protect Sonmez and noting this wasn\u2019t the first time management \u201chas sought to control how Felicia speaks on matters of sexual violence\u201d. Nearly 350 staffers had signed the letter. Opinion writers at the paper used their platforms to come to Sonmez\u2019s defense, too. On Monday, Erik Wemple wrote that the backlash against her was rooted in \u201cthe ancient wisdom that urges folks not to speak ill of the dead\u201d, which is \u201ca fine rule for everyone except for historians and journalists\u201d. David Von Drehle concurred with Wemple. Sonmez, he wrote, had been punished for keeping \u201cboth eyes on the truth \u2013 or more precisely, on one particular truth, namely that somewhere a woman was experiencing this outpouring of adulation for a man who choked and lacerated her during an encounter that she called a rape, and which he acknowledged was very much like one\u201d. Late on Tuesday, the Post retreated. In a statement, it said that following a \u201creview\u201d, it had concluded that Sonmez\u2019s tweets were \u201cill-timed,\u201d but \u201cnot in clear and direct violation of our social media policy\u201d. Sonmez was reinstated, though the statement was notably missing an apology. In a statement of her own, Sonmez hit back, insisting she and her colleagues deserve to hear directly from Baron, and noting that the episode had \u201csown confusion\u201d about the Post\u2019s values. As some observers (including Charlie Warzel of the New York Times) noted, the Sonmez fiasco is a fresh reminder that newsrooms still struggle when coordinated mobs of online culture warriors target their staff. (Baron and Grant clearly feared institutional blowback, though it\u2019s possible they found Sonmez\u2019s tweets distasteful on their own terms.) The Post isn\u2019t alone here. Last year, the Times caused a mini media panic when it reported that \u201ca loose network of conservative operatives\u201d had compiled dossiers incriminating \u201chundreds\u201d of reporters at leading outlets. (The \u201cloose network\u201d has since been mysteriously quiet.) For some reason, AG Sulzberger, the Times\u2019s publisher, deemed this development worthy of public comment; he called it a clear attempt to harass his reporters (which was correct), but added that the paper would nonetheless be diligent in responding to \u201clegitimate problems\u201d raised by \u201canyone \u2013 even those acting in bad faith\u201d. This handed the harassers a victory, at least to some small extent. Sonmezgate also exposes a more routine problem: the tyranny of the newsroom social media policy. Ostensibly, such policies are meant to safeguard journalists and their bosses against the pitfalls of the internet; in practice, they often read like ham-fisted attempts to reconcile competing impulses. That of the Post, for instance, says, in part, that reporters should communicate in \u201cmore personal and informal ways\u201d to better connect with readers, but should also prioritize preserving the paper\u2019s reputation \u201cfor journalistic excellence, fairness, and independence\u201d. Such wording invites flawed \u2013 not to mention inconsistent \u2013 application. \u201cWe have repeatedly seen colleagues \u2013 including members of management \u2013 share contentious opinions on social media platforms without sanction,\u201d the Post Guild wrote in its letter supporting Sonmez. \u201cBut here a valued colleague is being censured for making a statement of fact.\u201d Again, the Post isn\u2019t alone; tensions like these exist across the media industry.

Take heed, carnivores. Oh, but also, there were sausages. Anyway, hours in, when I was on my fourth or fifth helping, I noticed that there was no end to it. No, there was more of it than when we started. There was a lake of chickpeas. We had got to the \u201cWould you like to take some home?\u201d stage.

But they\u2019re still hot on the Real Sociedad goleador Willian Jos\u00e9 even though his release clause is \u00a359m. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are going to make one last effort to prise Edinson Cavani from Paris Saint-Germain, who are demanding that the Spanish club increase their previous bid (\u00a313m) by around \u00a32m. Well, PSG do have Neymar goal bonuses to pay. Remember that time Danny Rose said he definitely wouldn\u2019t be leaving Tottenham in January? Neither does he, apparently. He\u2019s now set to head for Newcastle. And Arsenal are about to nab C\u00e9dric Soares from Southampton. And finally, Everton\u2019s attempt to \u201cbuild a team around Richarlison\u201d continue to founder, with midfielder Mat\u00edas Vecino set to stay at Inter despite interest from the ambitious Goodison club.",

      "body": "<p>Deepa Anappara\u2019s debut novel begins with nine-year-old Jai competing with his older sister in a headstand competition on the bed. From his upside-down perspective, he can see five holes in the tin roof of his house: \u201cThere might be more, but I can\u2019t see them because the black smog outside has wiped the stars off the sky.\u201d On the TV (\u201cthe best thing we own\u201d) he watches a jaunty news item headlined \u201cDilli: Police Commissioner\u2019s Missing Cat Spotted\u201d. He can also see his mother shaping rotis in the kitchen corner, because their house has only one room. Still, as Jai\u2019s father says: \u201cThis room has everything we need for our happiness to grow.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re in the shantytown of an unnamed Indian city, and the TV\u2019s cheerful solicitousness about the missing cat soon seems ironic as the scene is interrupted by a scream, and the family goes outside to learn that Jai\u2019s schoolmate Bahadur has disappeared. What\u2019s more, the authorities are callously indifferent; a police constable allows Bahadur\u2019s terrified parents to bribe him with their only valuable possession, a gold necklace, only to insist that the boy will come back on his own. Jai resolves that, like the heroes of his favourite TV show Police Patrol, he will find Bahadur himself and unmask the evildoers. Soon he\u2019s hot on the trail, enlisting his schoolfriends, Pari and Faiz, in the effort. The sensible and studious Pari is reluctant from the beginning, and Faiz, who is from a Muslim family, keeps insisting that the real culprits are djinni, who are unlikely to be caught by sleuthing. But as more kids disappear, and the grownups seem more interested in blaming their Muslim neighbours than in finding the culprits, Jai\u2019s trio of juvenile detectives seem to be the missing children\u2019s only hope.</p> <p>Most of <em>Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line</em> is narrated by Jai and leavened by his unflappable personality. He knows all about the dangers and cruelties of his world, but talks about them with the glib disapproval of a loved child who assumes that adults will protect him from real harm. Children disappear all around him, but the narrative voice continues to reassure us that this is an adventure story where spunk and resourcefulness will save the day. There are also third-person sections that follow children about to be abducted, but these end with cliffhangers: we never see a child come to harm. The book\u2019s prologue, telling the story of a guardian spirit that protects the rag-picker children of the city, has the reassuring title: \u201cThis Story Will Save Your Life\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A book that starts like a cute comic novel about a ragtag gang of kids turns into an unsparing portrayal of the real world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, the book inhabits a radically harsh world; the rag-pickers\u2019 guardian spirit, Mental, was in life \u201ca boss-man with eighteen or twenty children working for him\u201d, and his methods of disciplining those children were brutal: \u201che turned on them the days they showed up with their noses red, their words mixing together like blood and water, their eyes swollen like full moons from sniffing whitener. Then Mental stubbed out his Gold Flake Kings on their wrists or shoulders, and he called it a waste of a good cigarette.\u201d But the tone remains that of a story where plucky children band together to solve crimes. In a typical subplot, Jai adopts a little street dog whom he clandestinely feeds and names Samosa. The reader absolutely trusts that not only Jai but Samosa is surrounded by a bubble of magical safety. That\u2019s how this kind of book has always worked.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to convey what\u2019s so special about <em>Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line</em> without spoilers, but suffice to say it\u2019s transformed utterly by its concluding chapters. In a day, our child narrator changes beyond recognition, and through his eyes, the world he inhabits does too. A book that started by feeling like a cute comic novel about a ragtag gang of poor kids who ingeniously defeat the baddies turns into an unsparing portrayal of the real world. In this world, stories will not save your life, and, if the powerful will not protect them, poor kids can never be safe. There is no fun adventure story to be told about the trafficking of children.</p> <p>This is a first novel, and it has some of the clumsiness that goes with that. The bad characters can feel like caricatures; at moments, Jai\u2019s voice isn\u2019t convincing as that of a child. Sometimes, too, the political message can be a little heavy-handed. But in the end Anappara, a journalist with a background in reporting on poverty and religious violence, delivers something more powerful and complex than the vast majority of more highly crafted novels. The narrative goes beyond portraying how the poor of India have been betrayed by their government, and suggests they might also be betrayed by the stories we like to tell about them. Jai has to grow up overnight: this book asks that the reader does, too.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sandra Newman\u2019s The Heavens is published by Granta.

The political party of the Israelites of the New Universal Pact won the second largest share of the quick count vote, 8.9%, giving them one of largest blocs of lawmakers in Peru\u2019s fragmented new congress \u2013 and prompting concerns over their fundamentalist views. The Agricultural People\u2019s Front of Peru, known by its acronym Frepap, was previously looked upon as a group of eccentric religious fanatics with marginal electoral prospects.

One of the group\u2019s new lawmakers, Wilmer Cayllahua offered some insight into their political stance in a radio interview on Monday, in which he rejected alliances or deals with any other political grouping. Cayllahua said his party would seek to scrap lawmakers\u2019 parliamentary immunity \u2013 a popular measure backed in a 2018 referendum.

What is the best advice to give them about specifications etc, bearing in mind their finite budgets?</p> <p>A user who wants a desktop PC to deal with email and social media, office files, surfing the web and streaming some video will also need to buy peripherals, including a monitor. Some will need a printer. Often the advice will be to get the best PC possible, but they may not get the full benefit if other parts of the system are too compromised. <strong>David</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Almost every PC on the market will perform basic tasks such as writing emails and browsing the web. Even cheap laptops can run Microsoft Office and its rival suites, which are relatively lightweight by today\u2019s standards. Most can also do simple photo and video editing, though rendering and other video processing tasks can take a very long time. The problem is not so much the type of task as the resources required by the software and the size of your files.</p> <p>Any PC should be able to handle a one-page letter and post messages on Facebook. Editing 500-page illustrated books or Excel spreadsheets with millions of cells is a different proposition.</p> <p>Either way, it\u2019s better to have too much power than too little. It makes everyday computing more comfortable, and provides some future-proofing. Peripherals are peripheral, and replaceable.</p> <h2><strong>Buy desktops, if possible</strong></h2> <p>I don\u2019t want to repeat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/23/which-is-the-best-pc-for-someone-who-has-parkinsons\">last week\u2019s description of the desktop\u2019s advantages over laptops</a> in terms of expandability, reparability and upgradeability, but someone on a finite budget can start with a cheap refurbished desktop and improve it as they go along. But this is only worthwhile if the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPU</a> is fast enough to last a few years, when you can replace the PC and keep the peripherals.</p> <p>For example, you can start with 4GB of memory, a traditional hard drive, a cast-off screen and a cheap printer, and improve the system when you can afford new parts. Most desktops can now handle up to 32GB or more memory \u2013 <a href=\"https://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en/memory-info\">check first</a> \u2013 and you can replace a slow hard drive with a fast, chip-based <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive\">SSD</a>. You can easily replace the original monitor with a bigger, brighter screen, which you can\u2019t do with a laptop.</p> <p>Short of replacing the motherboard, most desktop PCs are easy to upgrade, once you overcome the fear factor.

First, as always, components have become cheaper and more powerful thanks to technological and manufacturing advances. Second, Microsoft has spent a decade making Windows more efficient. Today, Windows 10 usually runs on PCs that could run Vista well in 2006 or Windows 7 from 2009. Not many operating systems can claim that.</p> <p>But the fact that Windows 10 runs in 2GB of RAM does not make it a good idea. You get much better performance with 4GB, which (roughly) provides 2GB for Windows and 2GB for browser tabs.</p> <p>Indeed, given that memory modules are now cheap \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B008KSHQBU/\">you can buy 8GB for </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B008KSHQBU/\">about \u00a330</a> \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense to use less.</p> <p>SSDs have also plunged in price. Today, 120GB drives go for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kingston-Technology-A400-120GB-Serial/dp/B073VFG4C7/\">about \u00a320 or less</a>, and 240GB drives can be had for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/SanDisk-PLUS-Sata-Inch-Internal/dp/B01F9G43WU/\">\u00a330</a>. It makes no sense to buy a PC with a 32GB drive, and for Windows 10 users even 64GB is no longer enough.</p> <p>When a Windows 10 upgrade arrives, you need enough room for the download, the new version of the operating system and the previous version, all at the same time. The old version is stored in the Windows.old folder so that you can restore it if something goes wrong. PCs should update correctly if given extra space on a USB thumbdrive or an external hard drive. However, if you start with only 64GB, you may end up running the <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/266337/what-should-i-remove-in-disk-cleanup-on-windows/\">Disk Clean-up</a> app (remember to click \u201cClean up system files\u201d) and deleting stuff to make space for updates.</p> <p>Today, I think the minimum specification for Windows 10 or <a href=\"https://linuxmint.com/\">Linux Mint</a> is 4GB of memory and a 120GB SSD, but everyone should aim for 8GB and a 240GB or larger SSD. Video editors, photographers, gamers and \u201cpower users\u201d will want, and often need, more.</p> <h2><strong>Real and subjective speeds</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01703ae55aafc679f6ba087999e5f4b2e7b4a9ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01703ae55aafc679f6ba087999e5f4b2e7b4a9ac/0_0_2954_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Intel still rules the roost in most instances, but AMD\u2019s latest chips can offer better value.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Intel still rules the roost in most instances, but AMD\u2019s latest chips can offer better value.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Picking a processor is the trickiest part of buying a PC, because their relative merits are far from obvious. Real-world processor performance is influenced by the amount of memory, the type of storage and the cooling system, which includes the fans and the case. (In thin laptops, the CPU can be throttled to stop it from overheating, reducing performance in the process.)</p> <p>No one who sits down at an unknown PC can tell which CPU it\u2019s using without looking it up. Often, differences don\u2019t become evident until you have real work to do, or try to play a demanding game. If you just run Notepad, a slow system might look like fast one. If you try to reprocess an MP4 video, the fast one may take a few minutes and the slow one hours.</p> <p>Businesses can justify buying PCs that are fast enough to run their business processes because time is money. It\u2019s worth doing a task just a few seconds faster if it\u2019s repeated dozens or hundreds of times a day over many years. Home users usually don\u2019t know how much time their PCs are wasting, and if they did, they probably wouldn\u2019t care. If you\u2019re only using a PC for a few hours a week, you won\u2019t spend a fortune getting a browser to load five seconds faster.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a subjective aspect: speed is what you are used to. For example, one of our seven-year-old Core i5 laptops seems a bit slow from the relative height of my six-core desktop, but some visitors have been impressed by its speed. They have a different concept of \u201cnormal\u201d.</p> <p>So, from a psychological point of view, your clients should try to buy PCs that are as fast as the ones they are using now, or faster. Using what feels like a slow PC can be frustrating, whatever its real performance.</p> <h2><strong>Picking a chip</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0724ab13aee75a235afc7a079bb8a158765d978\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0724ab13aee75a235afc7a079bb8a158765d978/0_0_3058_1835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Intel\u2019s Core i5 line has offered a good balance of performance, energy consumption and cost for years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Intel\u2019s Core i5 line has offered a good balance of performance, energy consumption and cost for years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The good news is that lots of old desktop processors still perform well by today\u2019s standards. In response to the market\u2019s move to ultra-thin laptops, Intel has been developing chips that use less power, generate less heat, need less cooling and provide longer battery life. Since 2005, it has focused on providing more <a href=\"https://techreport.com/review/8721/idf-fall-2005-intel-aims-for-performance-per-watt/\">performance per </a><a href=\"https://techreport.com/review/8721/idf-fall-2005-intel-aims-for-performance-per-watt/\">watt</a>, rather than more raw performance. As a result, the Core i5-2500 that came out a decade ago is still faster than some new laptop chips because it runs at a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power\">TDP</a> of 95W while they run at 15W or even 9W.</p> <p>There are hundreds of different processors in the refurbished PC market, but you can look up each chip\u2019s score on the <a href=\"https://www.passmark.com/\">PassMark benchmark</a> and compare it with your own PC\u2019s score. Chips with significantly better scores should run faster. (Small percentage differences don\u2019t matter.)</p> <p>For a Windows 10 PC that gets more-than-casual use, I think a PassMark score of around 2,500 is the minimum, and anything over 5,000 would probably be acceptable to most of your clients. Doubling that score would make it suitable for me, and doubling it again would satisfy a gamer.</p> <p>Let\u2019s put those PassMark numbers in context. Even a 6W Pentium Silver N5000, designed for thin laptops, manages <a href=\"https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Pentium+Silver+N5000+%40+1.10GHz&amp;id=3204\">2,447</a>, which is my minimum.

      "bodyText": "I am working on a project that helps various groups in the community to become more PC proficient, and some clients now wish to purchase their own systems for the first time. What is the best advice to give them about specifications etc, bearing in mind their finite budgets? A user who wants a desktop PC to deal with email and social media, office files, surfing the web and streaming some video will also need to buy peripherals, including a monitor. Some will need a printer. Often the advice will be to get the best PC possible, but they may not get the full benefit if other parts of the system are too compromised. David Almost every PC on the market will perform basic tasks such as writing emails and browsing the web. Even cheap laptops can run Microsoft Office and its rival suites, which are relatively lightweight by today\u2019s standards. Most can also do simple photo and video editing, though rendering and other video processing tasks can take a very long time. The problem is not so much the type of task as the resources required by the software and the size of your files. Any PC should be able to handle a one-page letter and post messages on Facebook. Editing 500-page illustrated books or Excel spreadsheets with millions of cells is a different proposition. Either way, it\u2019s better to have too much power than too little. It makes everyday computing more comfortable, and provides some future-proofing. Peripherals are peripheral, and replaceable. Buy desktops, if possible I don\u2019t want to repeat last week\u2019s description of the desktop\u2019s advantages over laptops in terms of expandability, reparability and upgradeability, but someone on a finite budget can start with a cheap refurbished desktop and improve it as they go along. But this is only worthwhile if the CPU is fast enough to last a few years, when you can replace the PC and keep the peripherals. For example, you can start with 4GB of memory, a traditional hard drive, a cast-off screen and a cheap printer, and improve the system when you can afford new parts. Most desktops can now handle up to 32GB or more memory \u2013 check first \u2013 and you can replace a slow hard drive with a fast, chip-based SSD. You can easily replace the original monitor with a bigger, brighter screen, which you can\u2019t do with a laptop. Short of replacing the motherboard, most desktop PCs are easy to upgrade, once you overcome the fear factor. Often there are YouTube videos to show you how it\u2019s done. Monitors have improved a lot in the past decade. You can now buy them for \u00a3100 or less, so that\u2019s what I usually recommend. The corollary is that most older screens are not worth very much second hand, no matter how much they cost when new. Second hand printers are even less attractive, unless they are proper business machines or laser printers. Consumer inkjets are cheap and disposable because the real money is made supplying ink cartridges. You may be able to source hardware cheaply, from refurbishers, or free. A worthy community group might be able to get a local newspaper to run their story, along with an appeal for unwanted hardware.

Koones draws on her experience of relocating from a 6,800 sq ft house to a 1,400 sq ft one, and suggests that \u201cthe key is to have a home that is efficiently designed, both in terms of energy use and space\u201d.</p> <p>Of all the annoying lifestyle trends, downsizing is the biggest smack in the face for anyone in the private-renting trap. Shoebox-sized, sub-par rental accommodation is the norm in London, while nationwide studies show that homes are getting smaller. Younger adults who have managed to get on the housing ladder know all about the shortage of affordable, spacious accommodation.</p> <p>As with the new fashion for a sort of capitalist-sanctioned minimalism, the downsizing trend emphasises the growing divide between the haves and have-nots. There are those who actively choose not to consume, and those who have little choice. The former are free to embrace a trend that comes ready-packaged with the sanctimonious status symbol of living frugally; the latter are simply poor. Contrast stylish bare white walls and furniture-less rooms so beautifully satirised by Absolutely Fabulous in the scene where Patsy and Edina struggle to locate the door, with damp, cold rooms containing solitary mattresses that are the reality for many children living in poverty.</p> <p>The rise of co-living spaces in cities tries to reframe shoebox-living as an aspirational lifestyle choice. These buildings come equipped with spas and gyms and \u201cbreakout areas\u201d \u2013 the dystopian phrasing of the latter says it all. They are essentially halls of residence for young professionals who can\u2019t afford their own place.</p> <p>To millions, downsizing is an activity undertaken by your friends\u2019 baby-boomer parents \u2013 often, to free up cash to help their offspring. A nice leg-up if you can get it. Good for them, but to everyone else it just sounds like a humblebrag about how you are struggling to cope with so many bedrooms. So maybe think twice before you go around raving about the simplicity of pocket-size living, especially if a young person you know and love has been in a converted garage for the past two years.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sheri Koones, author of Downsize: Living Large in a Small House, recently suggested renaming the downsizing trend \u201cright-sizing\u201d. Koones draws on her experience of relocating from a 6,800 sq ft house to a 1,400 sq ft one, and suggests that \u201cthe key is to have a home that is efficiently designed, both in terms of energy use and space\u201d. Of all the annoying lifestyle trends, downsizing is the biggest smack in the face for anyone in the private-renting trap. Shoebox-sized, sub-par rental accommodation is the norm in London, while nationwide studies show that homes are getting smaller. Younger adults who have managed to get on the housing ladder know all about the shortage of affordable, spacious accommodation. As with the new fashion for a sort of capitalist-sanctioned minimalism, the downsizing trend emphasises the growing divide between the haves and have-nots. There are those who actively choose not to consume, and those who have little choice. The former are free to embrace a trend that comes ready-packaged with the sanctimonious status symbol of living frugally; the latter are simply poor. Contrast stylish bare white walls and furniture-less rooms so beautifully satirised by Absolutely Fabulous in the scene where Patsy and Edina struggle to locate the door, with damp, cold rooms containing solitary mattresses that are the reality for many children living in poverty. The rise of co-living spaces in cities tries to reframe shoebox-living as an aspirational lifestyle choice. These buildings come equipped with spas and gyms and \u201cbreakout areas\u201d \u2013 the dystopian phrasing of the latter says it all. They are essentially halls of residence for young professionals who can\u2019t afford their own place. To millions, downsizing is an activity undertaken by your friends\u2019 baby-boomer parents \u2013 often, to free up cash to help their offspring. A nice leg-up if you can get it. Good for them, but to everyone else it just sounds like a humblebrag about how you are struggling to cope with so many bedrooms. So maybe think twice before you go around raving about the simplicity of pocket-size living, especially if a young person you know and love has been in a converted garage for the past two years.",

Mediation following that complaint led to ING committing to measure and publish its indirect emissions, reduce its thermal coal exposure to near zero by 2025 and make its portfolio consistent with the Paris goal of keeping global heating well below 2C above pre-industrial levels.</p> \n<p>The complainants in the ANZ claim include Jack Egan, who was approached by Friends of the Earth to join the action after his home near Batemans Bay, on the New South Wales coast, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-04/north-rosedale-bushfire-guts-home-climate-change-sign-survives/11839642\">was destroyed on New Year\u2019s Eve</a>.</p> \n<p>Egan said there was a clear link between ANZ and other institution\u2019s ongoing support of fossil fuels and the extreme hot and dry conditions that exacerbated the fire that left him homeless. \u201cWe are not seeking damages or compensation from ANZ, I just want them to stop fuelling dangerous climate change,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/06/banks-boosted-new-lending-to-fossil-fuel-projects-last-year-figures-show\">Banks boosted new lending to fossil fuel projects last year, figures show</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Friends of the Earth announced the action at a protest outside ANZ headquarters in Melbourne\u2019s Docklands. It lodged the claim with the federal government\u2019s OECD <a href=\"https://ausncp.gov.au/\">national contact point</a>, a section of the federal treasury responsible for hearing complaints of corporate wrongdoing under the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises.</p> \n<p>The national contact point\u2019s initial role is to attempt to broker a mediation between the parties. If agreement cannot be reached, it can make recommendations, but cannot force parties to take action.

      "bodyText": "Three bushfire survivors have joined environment group Friends of the Earth in a claim against ANZ, accusing it of financing the climate crisis by funding fossil fuel projects. The case, lodged under international guidelines agreed by members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), demands the bank disclose its greenhouse gas emissions, including \u201cscope three\u201d emissions resulting from its business lending and investment portfolio, and set ambitious targets that align with the Paris climate agreement. The claim was inspired by a successful complaint against ING bank in the Netherlands by Friends of the Earth, Oxfam and Greenpeace. Mediation following that complaint led to ING committing to measure and publish its indirect emissions, reduce its thermal coal exposure to near zero by 2025 and make its portfolio consistent with the Paris goal of keeping global heating well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. The complainants in the ANZ claim include Jack Egan, who was approached by Friends of the Earth to join the action after his home near Batemans Bay, on the New South Wales coast, was destroyed on New Year\u2019s Eve. Egan said there was a clear link between ANZ and other institution\u2019s ongoing support of fossil fuels and the extreme hot and dry conditions that exacerbated the fire that left him homeless. \u201cWe are not seeking damages or compensation from ANZ, I just want them to stop fuelling dangerous climate change,\u201d he said. Friends of the Earth announced the action at a protest outside ANZ headquarters in Melbourne\u2019s Docklands. It lodged the claim with the federal government\u2019s OECD national contact point, a section of the federal treasury responsible for hearing complaints of corporate wrongdoing under the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. The national contact point\u2019s initial role is to attempt to broker a mediation between the parties. If agreement cannot be reached, it can make recommendations, but cannot force parties to take action. ANZ declined to comment on Thursday. The environment group alleges ANZ\u2019s breaches of the OECD guidelines include misleading consumers by claiming to support the Paris agreement targets while continuing to invest in projects that undermine the meeting of those targets. Emila Nazari, a legal officer with Friends of the Earth, said the bank had increased investment in coal 34% over the past two years as it lent $8.8bn to the fossil fuel sector. She said the bank was Australia\u2019s largest financier of fossil fuel industries, and continued to invest billions of dollars in \u201cclimate wrecking projects\u201d while bushfires raged across Australia. \u201cIt is illegal for someone to light a bushfire, and we believe it is illegal for companies to finance the burning of our common home.

So Sofia Kenin awaits the winner of our next match, to be contested between world No 3 Simona Halep and 32-ranked Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza. They\u2019re already on court, so let\u2019s have a quick look at the tale of the tape between this pair.</p> <p>The Spaniard leads head-to-head 3-2, although she trails 1-0 at grand slams, following Halep\u2019s convincing win on the red dirt of Roland Garros in the 2018 French Open semi-final. Halep\u2019s other win over Muguruza also came on clay - in Stuttgart five years ago - while the Spaniard\u2019s three victories all came on hard courts - in Cincy, at the Fed Cup and in Wuhan.</p> <p>Halep, a former world No 1, is seeking her third grand slam crown, to add to those won in Paris in 2018 and at Wimbledon last year. The Romanian is bidding to reach her second Australian Open final, having lost to the now-retired Caroline Wozniacki in the 2018 decider. </p> <p>For her part, Muguruza is in the last four of the Australian Open for the first time, but like Halep has also won two previous slams \u2013 the French in 2016 and Wimbledon in 2017.</p> <p>Plenty to look forward to.

And what a treat we\u2019re in for, with world No 1 and local hero <strong>Ash Barty</strong> facing American <strong>Sofia Kenin</strong> on her mission to become the first Australian woman to contest her home grand slam final for 40 years.</p> <p>The last to achieve such a feat was <strong>Wendy Turnbull</strong> back in 1980. Some perspective, for you all. That was the year <strong>Evonne Goolagong Cawley</strong> won the last of her seven grand slams at Wimbledon, the year a dingo stole baby Azaria Chamberlain, and when the late Malcolm Fraser was in office and so was Dame Edna Everage\u2019s \u201cwisteria hue\u201d hair. </p> <p>Most pertinently, though, it was 16 years before Barty was born. No pressure, as they say. The 23-year-old Queenslander has already made history at this tournament, having become the first Australian woman since Turnbull in 1984 to make the semi-finals after Tuesday\u2019s straight-sets defeat of two-time major champion <strong>Petra Kvitov\u00e1</strong>.</p> <p>The reigning French Open champion has never ventured this deep into the draw before, and could be on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/29/australian-open-womens-quarter-finals\">final collision course with Simona Halep</a>, the only player in either draw yet to lose a set this fortnight, should the world No 3 see off world No 32 <strong>Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza</strong> in the second semi-final later this afternoon.</p> <p>But first there\u2019s the small matter of 21-year-old Kenin, the world No 14 unexpectedly carrying the weight of her own nation as the only American of either gender still left in the draw.</p> <p>While the attention was on <strong>Serena and Venus Williams</strong> and fast-rising 15-year-old <strong>Coco Gauff</strong>, Kenin was quietly and improbably ploughing her way through a star-studded quarter of the draw, bettering Gauff in the fourth round and then unseeded Tunisian <strong>Ons Jabeur</strong> in the quarter-finals.</p> <p>Both players boast well-balanced games and like to dictate play so this should be a belter.</p> <p>Feel free to share your thoughts via email emma.kemp.casual@theguardian.com or Twitter @emmavkemp.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zanuDA5cuDc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zanuDA5cuDc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-30T02:52:03.553Z\">at 2.52am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

That might not have featured in many people\u2019s predictions a fortnight ago. But it promises to be a decent match-up between two players that have proved the deserve to be in the title decider. Muguruza will go for her third grand slam crown, Kenin, the shock victor over Ash Barty earlier, her first. And with that, I\u2019ll bid you adieu. The evening session, and the potential classic encounter between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, isn\u2019t too far away \u2013 nor is our liveblog, which will appear shortly. But for now, here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s take on proceedings so far at Melbourne Park: Here\u2019s Garbi\u00f1e: \u201cYou don\u2019t think like that [being in the final at the outset of the tournament], that\u2019s two weeks ago. You go day by day, you take each match as it comes. I have one final match on Saturday.\u201d On finding herself behind in this match: \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking I was down, I was thinking keep going. At some point you\u2019ll have your opportunity. \u201cLuckily I have 48 hours to recover and get ready for the last match. We train all our career to get ready for this match.\u201d Second set: Halep* 6-7 (8-10), 5-7 Muguruza Incredible from Muguruza! She reaches the Australian Open final! A deserved victor. She seals it after a sensational point at 30-15 up, when her court coverage comes to the fore, despite the heat. She manages to get to a number of balls before bringing up two match points and the seals it at the second time of asking. Second set: Halep 6-7 (8-10), 5-6 Muguruza* These two are going hell for leather, some of their hitting is sensational. It\u2019s a physical battle out there, and you\u2019d think Muguruza needs to get it wrapped up in two, given Halep was the fresher heading into this one. Muguruza holds, and a third set will not be needed if she can muster one final break of serve now. Second set: Halep* 6-7 (8-10), 5-5 Muguruza The pressure mounts on Halep at 15-30 and then intensifies further at 30-40. Break point, but a Muguruza forehand finds the net and the chance goes... but not for long. Another couple present themselves soon after but Halep saves both those too. A fourth follows, as Halep pummels a forehand into the net, and then she goes long \u2013 by inches \u2013 and Muguruza levels things up! Second set: Halep 6-7 (8-10), 5-4 Muguruza* No problems this time for Muguruza. An ace at 30-0 is followed by Halep returning into the net and the Spaniard has a love hold for the first time today. And she\u2019s still in with a shout of ending the match this set. Second set: Halep* 6-7 (8-10), 5-3 Muguruza Both players look like the heat is beginning to affect them, even though the court on Rod Laver Arena is now in shade. Their exertions over the past hour and 40 minutes-ish could also have something to do with it. Halep holds and Muguruza will not have to serve to stay in the second set. Second set: Halep 6-7 (8-10), 4-3 Muguruza* That high quality continues, as Muguruza aces twice before moving Halep around the court expertly and finishing off with a forehand into the corner. Second set: Halep* 6-7 (8-10), 4-2 Muguruza Halep seems to be in a hurry here, but a brilliant forehand winner punched back past her by Muguruza brings up another break point. It\u2019s not taken, but another one soon follows as the Spaniard moves into the net and finishes off with a smash. Halep hammers a forehand down the line to save it though. And she goes on to hold. This is some high level tennis. Second set: Halep 6-7 (8-10), 3-2 Muguruza* Halep breaks again after one of the longest games of the match so far, and despite Muguruza serving up three aces during it. How will Muguruza respond this time? Second set: Halep* 6-7 (8-10), 2-2 Muguruza Huge credit to Muguruza here as she breaks back straight away, sealing the game with a forehand winner! That could prove to be a huge opportunity lost for Halep... Second set: Halep 6-7 (8-10), 2-1 Muguruza* The pendulum swings once more as Muguruza crumbles to 0-40 on her serve. Halep has three chances to break; she needs all three before finally capitalising as Muguruza hits into the net. Second set: Halep* 6-7 (8-10), 1-1 Muguruza Halep in trouble again as she falls to 15-40. But an ace \u2013 her first of this contest \u2013 and then a successfully challenged line call help her to dig out of the hole she found herself in. The Romanian manages to hold, and you can\u2019t help but think that was a big, big hold in the grand scheme of things. Second set: Halep 6-7 (8-10), 0-1 Muguruza* Halep\u2019s frustration isn\u2019t eased as she challenges an ace call but the replays show the ball to have clipped the line. Muguruza holds and she\u2019s a set and a game up. First set: Halep 6-7 (8-10) Muguruza Muguruza does it! Halep looks incredulous, but the Spaniard takes the lead. A code violation follows for Halep as she vents her frustration by destroying her racket on the court. She\u2019ll have to regain her composure if she\u2019s to recover now. First set tie-break Halep 8-8 Muguruza Now Halep has a chance to secure the first set thanks to an overhit backhand. It\u2019s saved as Muguruza sends down a wide serve that Halep struggles to get to. But a double fault \u2013 her first of the match \u2013 gives Halep another set point. A 20-shot rally ends with Halep firing a forehand wide in the tramlines and we\u2019re at 8 a piece. First set tie-break Halep 6-6 Muguruza Muguruza\u2019s radar has gone awry \u2013 she hits another forehand into the net \u2013 but she recovers well with some deep hitting that Halep has trouble in returning on the next two points. But an big serve later, the Spaniard has two set points at 6-4 up. She wastes the first with a long ball and then Halep saves the second one with a wonderfully hit forehand winner down the line. Boom! We\u2019re level as the players change ends again. First set tie-break Halep 3-3 Muguruza Muguruza, who seems to have found a new lease of life, storms to a 3-0 lead before Halep fights back thanks to a strong serve that the Spaniard cannot return. Another two unforced errors from Muguruza allow Halep right back into contention and there\u2019s nothing to separate them at the halfway stage of this tie-break. First set: Halep 6-6 Muguruza* (* denotes server) Muguruza shows incredible spirit here, having fallen to 15-40, to hold serve and send the first set to a tie-break. An ace saves the first and then the Spaniard refuses to roll over during a lengthy rally on the second. First set: Halep* 6-5 Muguruza (* denotes server) Halep\u2019s momentum continues this game, but Muguruza\u2019s unforced error count continues to rise \u2013 she\u2019s at 21 now, to Halep\u2019s meagre seven. That could well prove to be the difference this set. First set: Halep 5-5 Muguruza* (* denotes server) The sign of a champion player? She needed to break and Halep does just that. Muguruza doesn\u2019t help herself, hitting the net at 0-30 down to give the Romanian three chances. She needs just the one, after a rally featuring two net cords, which make life a bit tricky for the Spaniard. Nothing to separate these two in terms of the scoreboard at the moment. First set: Halep* 4-5 Muguruza (* denotes server) Faced with having to win this game to stay in the first set, Halep rises to the occasion perfectly. A stunning backhand winner to go 30-0 ahead highlights what turns out to be a love service game. But she\u2019ll now have to break Muguruza now if she\u2019s to stay alive. First set: Halep 3-5 Muguruza* (* denotes server) Muguruza finds the net at 30-30 and Halep is presented with a chance to break back immediately. But the Spaniard moves with intent and flashes a forehand winner past Halep to save it. She continues her clean striking of the ball and wraps up the game with a fantastic forehand winner. First set: Halep* 3-4 Muguruza (* denotes server) A wonderful forehand slice brings up another chance for Muguruza to break Halep and this time she gets it with a backhand winner! The Spaniard with the advantage now. First set: Halep 3-3 Muguruza* (* denotes server) This is quick-fire tennis, neither player is standing back, and we\u2019re six games in with just 25 minutes on the clock. Muguruza holds again, without fuss, and it\u2019s on serve midway thought the opening set. First set: Halep* 3-2 Muguruza (* denotes server) A bit of a wobble here from Halep, as Muguruza brings up two break point chances. The Spaniard fails to take either though, and when she adds two more to her unforced error count \u2013 one backhand, one forehand \u2013 any hope of making a breakthrough this game evaporates. First set: Halep 2-2 Muguruza* (* denotes server) A couple of errors creep into Halep\u2019s game at the beginning of this game, giving Muguruza a little helping hand in opening up a 30-0 lead. But it\u2019s contagious and the Spaniard delivers two unforced errors of her own before she manages to secure the game \u2013 thanks to a Halep ball into the net. Still on serve early in this first set. First set: Halep* 2-1 Muguruza (* denotes server) And another for Halep, who serves out to love with the minimum of fuss. She looks the more comfortable of the two players with the ball in hand on the evidence so far today \u2013 she\u2019s boasting a 100% first serve win percentage. First set: Halep 1-1 Muguruza* (* denotes server) Halep, who is coached by Australian Darren Cahill, is through to the final four without dropping a set. Having expended as little energy as possible on her way, that efficiency may prove a key factor in today\u2019s match. Muguruza has to save two break points here, but survives her opening service game. First set: Halep* 1-0 Muguruza (* denotes server) No messing about then, straight into the next match. Halep serves first and eases to a comfortable opening game. It\u2019s getting hot out there, although the roof is still open, which means the heat threshold has still not been reached. That could yet change. It was 4.8 on the scale earlier \u2013 5 is the limit. Thanks Emma. So Sofia Kenin awaits the winner of our next match, to be contested between world No 3 Simona Halep and 32-ranked Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza. They\u2019re already on court, so let\u2019s have a quick look at the tale of the tape between this pair. The Spaniard leads head-to-head 3-2, although she trails 1-0 at grand slams, following Halep\u2019s convincing win on the red dirt of Roland Garros in the 2018 French Open semi-final. Halep\u2019s other win over Muguruza also came on clay - in Stuttgart five years ago - while the Spaniard\u2019s three victories all came on hard courts - in Cincy, at the Fed Cup and in Wuhan. Halep, a former world No 1, is seeking her third grand slam crown, to add to those won in Paris in 2018 and at Wimbledon last year. The Romanian is bidding to reach her second Australian Open final, having lost to the now-retired Caroline Wozniacki in the 2018 decider. For her part, Muguruza is in the last four of the Australian Open for the first time, but like Halep has also won two previous slams \u2013 the French in 2016 and Wimbledon in 2017. Plenty to look forward to. Please do get in touch with an email (mike.hytner@theguardian.com) or on Twitter @mike_hytner. In summary, this wasn\u2019t Barty\u2019s best display. She wasn\u2019t quite the indestructible force she has been throughout an affair in nearly 40-degree heat. Unforced errors did not help her cause - she made 36 to Kenin\u2019s 25 - but it was difficult to fault the 14th-seeded American. Australia\u2019s 42-year wait for a home-grown Australian Open champion continues. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s match report from Rod Laver Arena: Thanks for joining me. I\u2019ll now hand the baton to Mike Hytner, who will keep you up to date with the second semi-final. \u201cIt was really tough,\u201d Kenin (the Barty Crasher) continues. \u201cI knew she was not going to give up to me. I really needed to fight out there. She\u2019s a great player. There\u2019s a reason she\u2019s world No 1.\u201d The dream is over, Australian hearts broken across the seven kingdoms as the nation\u2019s sweetheart bows out one step away from the big dance. The 23-year-old will be bitterly disappointed with that result, beaten in straight sets in a semi-final she was expected to win in straight sets. But blimey, that was some performance from the quiet American, who won four consecutive games from 5-3 down in the second set and could yet go all the way. She has just told Nine she\u2019s actually \u201cfeisty\u201d. We believe her. Second set: Barty* 6-7, 5-7 Kenin (* denotes server): Barty must keep her cool here and not let the pressure get the better of her. She\u2019s down 0-30 but gets one back. Now Kenin has two match points but it is but a flesh wound as Barty fires from all canisters to keep herself in her home grand slam, capping a superb rally with a winner to match it. She can\u2019t quite get this over the line though and smacks the deciding shot out. Game, set and match. Not quite just a flesh wound, then. Second set: Barty* 6-7, 5-6 Kenin (* denotes server): This has taken a real turn. Kenin is fearless and Barty playing it too safe. She\u2019s serving to stay in this now and it\u2019s not looking good. Second set: Barty 6-7, 5-5 Kenin* (* denotes server): Barty has two set points to play with after putting away a winner Kenin barely gets her racquet to. As if shaken awake, a smart-thinking Kenin approaches the net and draws Barty in, before dispatching out of reach. This is a proper scrap now, and Kenin has designs on breaking back, pulling away with the advantage before falling back to deuce via a shanked shot. She\u2019ll have another crack at it, though, after Barty whips one down crosscourt and she responds with interest at an angle even more accute. Kenin makes no mistake this time, and has broken back. Second set: Barty 6-7, 5-4 Kenin* (* denotes server): A couple of missteps allow Kenin, whose intensity has dropped markedly, to hold from 30-30. Barty will now serve for the second set. Second set: Barty* 6-7, 5-3 Kenin (* denotes server): If Barty was a knife the cake would be sliced into smithereens. She has adapted commensurately to this challenge under sapping heat and is now using that low, slow backhand slice to her advantage - 95 per cent of her backhands this set have been that option - and it\u2019s eliciting lots of errors up the other end. Second set: Barty 6-7, 4-3 Kenin* (* denotes server): Kenin cannot allow Barty any further room to move here, after the Australian\u2019s swag of winners. She\u2019s up 40-15 but that thorn in her side slips a little deeper and she\u2019s scratching for a breakthrough moment at 40-30. Barty is engaging in motivating some self-talk but Kenin can\u2019t hear, she\u2019s too busy keeping her cool. She holds. Second set: Barty* 6-7, 4-2 Kenin (* denotes server): Barty is on the ball now in a manner that betrays nothing of her inconsistencies last set. An email! \u201cSo enjoy your humour,\u201d says Freydis Welland. \u201cThanks from a loyal Canadian watching a masterclass at the Royal Opera House just now too.\u201d Enjoy that, Freydis. Send in your best tennis one-liners and we\u2019ll give them a run. Second set: Barty 6-7, 3-2 Kenin* (* denotes server): The heat is rising, quite literally, on Rod Laver Arena. The index is now at 4.8. Once it hits 5 the roof will be closed. Second set: Barty* 6-7, 3-1 Kenin (* denotes server): Barty is problem solving now, asking questions different to the ones Kenin had answers for last set. A strengthening hold. Second set: Barty 6-7, 2-1 Kenin* (* denotes server): Barty breaks. Up a break point, she doesn\u2019t allow it to slip through her fingers as she did one in the opening set. Steely-eyed, she opens both barrels. This is why she\u2019s world No 1. This what the #BartyParty groupies came to see. Second set: Barty* 6-7, 1-1 Kenin (* denotes server): This hold might be Barty\u2019s way of saying she\u2019s got this. That scripts were written to be ripped up and she won\u2019t stop plugging away despite her opponents\u2019 clear confidence away from home. Even still, every point now carries a nervous edge and she lost the first in this service game before taking the next four. Second set: Barty 6-7, 0-1 Kenin* (* denotes server): Three points fly by and Kenin is nearly home free at 40-0 before Barty gets a look-in. She waits patiently and then draws Kenin in with a drop shot before sending a high ball sailing over her head. The next point isn\u2019t so fortunate, though, and Kenin has her tail in the air now. First set tie-break: Barty 6-7(6-8) Kenin: Well well well. Kenin the conqueror is back on top, up 7-6 on serve. Serve she does and Barty shanks the ball straight into the net. Kenin has won the opening set. She can\u2019t be serious? Yes, she is (and don\u2019t call her Shirley). This second set could be a beauty. First set tie-break: Barty 6-6 Kenin: Barty, wielding two set points, serves a fault. Her second is good, but her follow-up shots not good enough for Kenin\u2019s response. The American is back in business. First set tie-break: Barty 4-4 Kenin: No sooner than it\u2019s there, it\u2019s gone again. Perhaps the match\u2019s longest rally to date ends anti-climactically on an unforced error - Barty\u2019s 19th. First set tie-break: Barty 4-2 Kenin: This has been a strange set in that momentum is unclear despite Barty\u2019s easy service games. But Barty has claimed a mini-break with a delightful forehand down the line. First set tie-break: Barty 2-2 Kenin: Barty is slicing herself silly but she finds herself well out of court and Kenin is too smart, ruthlessly so. First set: Barty 6-6 Kenin* (* denotes server): It\u2019s not a straightforward hold but a hold it is, and Kenin charges into an opening-set tie-break with the world No 1, who only days ago endured a nail-biting tie-break against Petra Kvitova. First set: Barty* 6-5 Kenin (* denotes server): This is the first time Barty has encountered real trouble on her serve, going down 0-30 via two unforced errors and on her second serve at that. She claws back to deuce and then claims the advantage then pummels one wide. That\u2019s a bad miss. As if through frustration, it precedes an expeditious first serve and then an unreturnable winner. Kenin, though, is having none of it in the next point, responding in kind and at full stretch for a winner. Big serves follow - the one element of Barty\u2019s game consistently excelling in this match - and Kenin will serve to stay in this set. First set: Barty 5-5 Kenin* (* denotes server): Kenin, it must be said, does not appear to have any issue under the pressure of her breakthrough slam, in the heat, serving second after Barty sets the tone This First set: Barty* 5-4 Kenin (* denotes server): There\u2019s that trademark Barty serve, the one way too big for a figure standing at 166cm. And it\u2019s a gorgeous one that whirs wide on the bounce and well out of reach of her adversary. She follows it with a well-disguised drop shot and Kenin misjudges the back-spin. Barty has now won 20/24 points on serve. First set: Barty 4-4 Kenin* (* denotes server): Kenin is very nearly pushed to deuce again but does well to hold. First set: Barty* 4-3 Kenin (* denotes server): That was a gritty hold from Kenin, whose progression through this tournament is as quiet as Barty\u2019s temperament and who is projected to crack the top 10 if she pulls off an upset here. Unfortunately for her, Barty is getting into her groove and she holds easily to love. But not before a mesmerising rally that brings out the speed and variety in both girls\u2019 games. Kenin ran every edge of the court, always forced to the extra shot. Into the net for a Barty forehand that drops just over, then back for a high lob she smashes, and in again before Barty eventually reigns. First set: Barty 3-3 Kenin* (* denotes server): Both players are clearly trying to adjust to the searing heat and Barty struggles with an ice towel during the change of ends. One point into this game and Barty has challenged Kenin\u2019s second serve, which was called in. Hawkeye reveals it was a smidgen out. That moment seems to have put Kenin off her game slightly and all of a sudden the American is down two break points. Barty, still struggling to get her backhand in range, saves them both for her and we\u2019re at deuce. As ever, I\u2019ve spoken too soon and an absolute peach of a backhand cuts a swathe down the line and gives Australia\u2019s golden girl the advantage. Back to deuce. Advantage Kenin. Deuce. Advantage Kenin. Hold. First set: Barty* 3-2 Kenin (* denotes server): Another backhand unforced error from the Australian here, but we\u2019ll forgive her given it\u2019s sandwiched between four aces. Enough said. First set: Barty 2-2 Kenin* (* denotes server): Barty begins as the aggressor, pumping that forehand repeatedly across court before walloping another errant backhand long. Kenin is up 40-0 before she knows it and takes the risk by going for the sliced dropshot. Barty races into the net and her challenger responds with a lovely lob straight over her head. First set: Barty* 2-1 Kenin (* denotes server): Still on serve here as Barty holds to love. She kicks off with two consecutive aces, cool as you like, followed by a forehand down the line that\u2019s heavy on the top spin and sneaky on the direction. First set: Barty 1-1 Kenin* (* denotes server): Two unforced errors from Barty allow Kenin to take control of this game but the American dispatches one of her own off her forehand to make it 30-30. Two more unforced backhand errors later and Kenin holds. First set: Barty* 1-0 Kenin (* denotes server): Barty\u2019s first service game is safely negotiated. She takes her time to get set and puts away a regulation smash from the net. Up 40-15, she serves a fault and then lands a shot out off her second. But Kenin does the same on the following point. Weather: The forecast is a maximum 39 degrees at Melbourne Arena, which apparently makes it the hottest day of the tournament yet. Will the roof be put up at some point during this contest. Barty gets a big cheer from the home crowd, featuring some serious sporting royalty in Cathy Freeman. Australia\u2019s most celebrated Indigenous athlete is clearly a big fan of Barty, a proud Ngaragu woman. \u201cI can confidently say on behalf of Aussies and particularly the Indigenous community we\u2019re very proud of her,\u201d Freeman said at Thursday\u2019s Inspirational Lunch. \u201cI think the impact that she can have on everybody but particularly young girls is quite profound. Her achievements and her story will get onto the psyche and into the blood of so many young girls around not just Australia, but the world, it\u2019s very cool. She\u2019s an amazing role model. She seems to have a really good head on her shoulders, really community-minded, not too overawed by the success she\u2019s having - it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d In case you missed this excellent pre-tournament piece by Simon Cambers, who predicted Barty can buck the decades-long trend of Australians cracking under pressure at their home major Head to head: Barty owns a 4-1 career record over Kenin, but they\u2019ve split their past two meetings at Toronto and Wuhan. Sam Groth is on Nine expecting there to be nerves at both ends of the court. John McEnroe, of Margaret Court protest fame, believes Barty has the edge over Kevin because \u201cshe\u2019s got more variety than any other players\u201d. \u201cShe drives them a little crazy, unsettles them. They don\u2019t know quite what to do,\u201d McEnroe told the Nine Network. \u201cShe uses that slice great, she\u2019s a very good volleyer, having played a lot of doubles ... she\u2019s got a sneaky big serve for someone who\u2019s not very tall. \u201cPerspective has helped her. Her stepping away from the game when she was younger, a bit overwhelmed I guess by the attention and the expectation. She\u2019s come back a far better player. She\u2019s handled it pretty darn well.\u201d It\u2019s already been a day of days for Australia on Rod Laver Arena, where Max Purcell and Luke Saville have beaten Ivan Dodig and Filip Pol\u00e1\u0161ek in three sets and are into the men\u2019s doubles final. Go one step further and the pair will become the first all-Australian team to win the doubles since the days of the Woodies. Quite something for the wildcards. Greetings everyone and welcome to live coverage of the women\u2019s singles semi-finals at the Australian Open. And what a treat we\u2019re in for, with world No 1 and local hero Ash Barty facing American Sofia Kenin on her mission to become the first Australian woman to contest her home grand slam final for 40 years. The last to achieve such a feat was Wendy Turnbull back in 1980. Some perspective, for you all. That was the year Evonne Goolagong Cawley won the last of her seven grand slams at Wimbledon, the year a dingo stole baby Azaria Chamberlain, and when the late Malcolm Fraser was in office and so was Dame Edna Everage\u2019s \u201cwisteria hue\u201d hair. Most pertinently, though, it was 16 years before Barty was born. No pressure, as they say. The 23-year-old Queenslander has already made history at this tournament, having become the first Australian woman since Turnbull in 1984 to make the semi-finals after Tuesday\u2019s straight-sets defeat of two-time major champion Petra Kvitov\u00e1. The reigning French Open champion has never ventured this deep into the draw before, and could be on a final collision course with Simona Halep, the only player in either draw yet to lose a set this fortnight, should the world No 3 see off world No 32 Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza in the second semi-final later this afternoon. But first there\u2019s the small matter of 21-year-old Kenin, the world No 14 unexpectedly carrying the weight of her own nation as the only American of either gender still left in the draw. While the attention was on Serena and Venus Williams and fast-rising 15-year-old Coco Gauff, Kenin was quietly and improbably ploughing her way through a star-studded quarter of the draw, bettering Gauff in the fourth round and then unseeded Tunisian Ons Jabeur in the quarter-finals. Both players boast well-balanced games and like to dictate play so this should be a belter. Feel free to share your thoughts via email emma.kemp.casual@theguardian.com or Twitter @emmavkemp.",

      "bodyText": "Putting things in perspective has never been a problem for Ash Barty, whose down-to-earth attitude has been a major factor in her ascent to the top of the world rankings. When she walked into her press conference on Thursday after her 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 semi-final defeat by American Sofia Kenin at the Australian Open, she was carrying her 12-week-old niece, Olivia, in her arms. The symbolism could hardly have been more obvious. \u201cHer name is Olivia, she\u2019s telling you that right now,\u201d Barty said. \u201cI mean, perspective is a beautiful thing. Life is a beautiful thing. She brought a smile to my face as soon as I came off the court. I got to give her a hug. It\u2019s all good. It\u2019s all good.\u201d In a match played in brutal conditions with temperatures pushing 40C (100F), Barty had two set points in the first set and another two in the second. But she was undone by the tenacity of Kenin, who fought for everything and in the final analysis played the big points better. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d Barty said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a hell of a summer. If you (had) told me three weeks ago that we would have won a tournament in Adelaide, made the semi-finals of the Australian Open, I\u2019d take that absolutely every single day of the week. \u201cI was two points away from winning that in straight sets, which is disappointing. I put myself in a position to win the match today and just didn\u2019t play the biggest points well enough to be able to win. I have to give credit where credit\u2019s due. Sofia came out and played aggressively on those points and deserved to win.\u201d As the face of the Australian Open, Barty has had to adjust to the demands of being the country\u2019s big hope for a first singles champion since Chris O\u2019Neil in 1978.

Those expectations, she said, come from outside rather than within, which might be important in the long term. \u201cYes, it\u2019s different at home,\u201d she said, (but) \u201cI enjoyed the experience. I love being out there. I\u2019ve loved every minute of playing in Australia over the last month. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt so much.

      "body": "<p>A temporary ban on wildlife markets in China to curb the spread of coronavirus is \u201cnot enough\u201d and should be made permanent, a prominent Chinese environmental leader has told the Guardian.</p> <p>Echoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/calls-for-global-ban-wild-animal-markets-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">calls from experts worldwide</a> who have denounced the trade for its damaging impact on biodiversity as well as the spread of disease, Jinfeng Zhou, secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF), said the ban failed to address the root cause of the outbreak, which was poor regulation and high levels of illegal trade.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/29/what-is-the-coronavirus-symptoms-china-wuhan-virus-sars-infection\">flu-like virus</a> is believed to have emerged from Huanan seafood market in the industrial city of Wuhan where wild animals such as snakes, porcupines and pangolins were kept alive in small cages while waiting to be sold. The national ban means the trade of wild animals will not be allowed in markets, restaurants or on e-commerce sites until the coronavirus outbreak ends, Chinese officials said on Sunday.</p> <p>Zhou told the Guardian: \u201cThis temporary ban is not enough.

      "bodyText": "A temporary ban on wildlife markets in China to curb the spread of coronavirus is \u201cnot enough\u201d and should be made permanent, a prominent Chinese environmental leader has told the Guardian. Echoing calls from experts worldwide who have denounced the trade for its damaging impact on biodiversity as well as the spread of disease, Jinfeng Zhou, secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF), said the ban failed to address the root cause of the outbreak, which was poor regulation and high levels of illegal trade. The flu-like virus is believed to have emerged from Huanan seafood market in the industrial city of Wuhan where wild animals such as snakes, porcupines and pangolins were kept alive in small cages while waiting to be sold. The national ban means the trade of wild animals will not be allowed in markets, restaurants or on e-commerce sites until the coronavirus outbreak ends, Chinese officials said on Sunday. Zhou told the Guardian: \u201cThis temporary ban is not enough. The trade should be banned indefinitely, at least until new rules are introduced. We have had similar diseases caused by illegal wildlife trafficking and if we don\u2019t ban the trade these diseases will happen again.\u201d China has a wildlife protection law that was adopted in 1988 but the list of protected wild animals has not been updated for three decades and critics say the authorities do little to enforce it.

      "bodyText": "The family of Errol Graham, the vulnerable 57-year old grandfather who died of starvation months after having his welfare benefits stopped, has demanded the government act urgently to minimise the chances of such tragedies happening again. The case of Graham, who had a long history of mental illness and weighed just four and a half stone (28.8kg) when he was found dead at his home in Nottingham, has focused attention on how the social security system cares for vulnerable claimants. A coroner subsequently concluded that the removal of his benefits for failing to attend a fit-for-work test was a \u201cdevastating stressor\u201d that had significantly affected his mental health and may have contributed to his death. After finding that Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and NHS staff had missed opportunities to save Graham in the months leading up to his death, the coroner Dr Elizabeth Didcock concluded: \u201cThe safety net that should surround vulnerable people like Errol in our society had holes within it.\u201d Alison Turner, 31, Graham\u2019s daughter-in-law, demanded the DWP overhaul its safeguarding system which she said was inadequate, outdated and could not guarantee the safety of the most vulnerable claimants. Turner, who represented Graham\u2019s family and was a formal witness under oath at the inquest into his death, revealed that the DWP had not apologised or been in contact with her to discuss the case since then, despite it having promised at the inquest to learn from families and their representatives. \u201cI\u2019m not letting Errol die without answers and without the system changing. He was failed left, right and centre,\u201d she told the Guardian. Labour\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood last night called for a fully independent inquiry into benefit-related deaths. \u201cThis is a tragic case. The government must now ensure that Errol Graham\u2019s family receive answers about exactly what happened.\u201d She added: \u201cThis does not appear to be an isolated case and we now need a fully independent inquiry into deaths that may be linked to a social security decision. The government must do all in its power to prevent any further tragedies of this kind.\u201d Graham\u2019s death, which came to light earlier this week, is the latest in a series of tragedies involving the deaths of highly vulnerable people who had their benefits stopped for failing to comply with DWP requests, often because they were ill at the time. Turner said she wanted to understand why DWP officials had not done more to establish her father-in-law\u2019s health and state of mind before cutting off his unemployment and housing benefits in October 2017, leaving him without income. While the DWP carried out two visits to Graham\u2019s home to establish why he had not responded to a DWP letter requesting him to come for an appointment, it seemed incomprehensible that it made no further checks given what they knew of his mental state, she said. \u201cWarning signs should have been ringing off like alarm bells in their heads.\u201d She said it should be compulsory for social security officials to inform a vulnerable claimant\u2019s next of kin or GP, or a police officer, when they were considering a drastic curse of action like stopping benefits. \u201cThey should not be able to stop the money until they have made that welfare check,\u201d she said. Ministers should consider banning all use of financial sanctions on individuals in receipt of incapacity benefits, and look at whether claimants with long-term conditions that are highly unlikely to improve should be exempted from being put through stressful and often unnecessary fit-for-work tests, Turner added. The DWP\u2019s chief psychologist David Carew told Graham\u2019s inquest in June 2019 that the DWP were \u201ccurrently undertaking a safeguarding review\u201d and committed the department to \u201clisten to clients and those representing them \u2026 to ensure that the DWP were focused on support and safety for vulnerable people.\u201d In her inquest report, Didcock insisted Carew\u2019s commitment be turned into robust policy for DWP staff. \u201cThere must be guidance that ensures that all evidence that can reasonably be gathered is put together about a client before a benefit is ceased.\u201d The DWP last night refused to comment on whether it accepted the coroner\u2019s recommendation, or whether or when the review mentioned by Carew might be published.

      "bodyText": "T\u0161epo Molapo gazes into space, worrying about where the next meal will come from. Next to him, his two-year-old granddaughter plays, oblivious of their desperate situation. Molapo\u2019s children all died at illegal mines in neighbouring South Africa, where they had trekked in search of work. Molapo, 80, relies on a monthly government pension payout of about $48 (\u00a337) but the paltry amount cannot feed him and the eight grandchildren he cares for on his own following the death of his wife. \u201cI do not know how I am going to survive with my grandchildren,\u201d Molapo says. According to the UN, more than 500,000 people \u2013 a quarter of Lesotho\u2019s population \u2013 face severe hunger due to droughts that caused a 60% fall in cereal production last year, compared with 2018. At least 71,000 people in rural areas are \u201cone step away from famine\u201d, says Jens Laerke, spokesperson from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which in December launched a $34m flash appeal for more funding. \u201cWe can\u2019t plant any crops in this drought situation. The rains only came last December and everything we had planted had wilted. We have no livestock left to sell or exchange for grain. So, unless we get help, we are just going to starve,\u201d says Molapo. Last October, the government declared a national disaster over the food crisis, appealing to its development partners for help. But the attention of minister appears to have been diverted by internal conflict and unrest in the country. The prime minister, Thomas Thabane, has been at the centre of of a power struggle with his party deputy, Nqosa Mahao. Thabane, who leads the All Basotho Convention, the major player in a four-party governing coalition, has been called for police questioning over alleged links to the murder of his estranged wife, and has said he will step down. The government has also faced strikes and threats of strikes by teachers, nurses and factory workers, who are demanding wage increases and improved working conditions. Unprecedented strike action by magistrates, doctors and police officers has also taken place in recent months. The magistrates and doctors have sued the government for pay rises and better conditions. The government\u2019s efforts to secure budget support from the International Monetary Fund have so far hit a brick wall, with the organisation imposing conditions that include reducing the high public wage bill, public financial management reforms and the implementation of the much-delayed multi-sector reforms, aimed at bringing greater stability to Lesotho, that were recommended by the Southern African Development Community. The EU ambassador to Lesotho, Christian Manahl, told the Guardian that February\u2019s budget speech will indicate what the government intends to do to address the food crisis. \u201cWe are waiting for the new budget to be presented, this will give us an idea about the government\u2019s own efforts to address the challenges created by the drought of last year,\u201d Manahl said. The European commission is mobilising a \u20ac1.5m (\u00a31.2m) humanitarian aid package to support people in the four districts \u2013 Mohale\u2019s Hoek, Mafeteng, Quthing and Qacha\u2019s Nek \u2013 that have been worst hit by drought. The World Food Programme (WFP) is expecting to reach 174,000 people with monthly mobile cash payments to eligible families over the next six months. Those unable to access mobile money will receive food parcels. Napo Ntlou, the WFP\u2019s emergency coordinator for Lesotho, said that even when there is no drought, the agency provides assistance to at least 200,000 people annually in the country. \u201cWe have engaged the government to have some projects related to building the resilience of people in the southern districts. In our five-year country strategic plan, we have a resilience component which is going to be undertaken in the southern parts of the country to ensure that at least when there are shocks, the people can recover very quickly,\u201d Ntlou said. For Mathabo Tlalajoe, from Mohale\u2019s Hoek, it will take more than $52 a month to feed her family of seven. \u201cThe intervention is welcome but it\u2019s still not enough. We hope that the next vulnerability assessment will give us more,\u201d Tlalajoe said.",

      "body": "<p>I have photographed these sisters, Sam and Lizzy, many times, in many costumes, over many years. This was a particularly difficult time in my life. It was late February, and my mum had been killed in a car crash the September before. After she died, I just wasn\u2019t interested in photography. My mother had liked to sew when I was young, so instead I started cutting up old clothes or using scraps to make crude flags. I was just trying to make sense of what was happening in my world. I thought I might use them as props in the future.</p> <p>I was also going for daily walks with my dog, and a few houses down the road I came across this bizarrely tied-together pegboard fence. I see things cinematically. Bits of stories emerge from whatever I\u2019m looking at. This image came from me sitting at my mother\u2019s sewing machine, sewing those flags, and then finding that fence. I called up Sam and Lizzy and said: \u201cI really need to do a picture \u2013 I need you to come over.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve been collecting uniforms for a long time. I link it to my mother and my Roman Catholic upbringing, and the fact that we\u2019re from a military family \u2013 my dad was a pilot. There was always a uniform tucked around somewhere. The ceremony, the iconography, the formality all appealed to me. This shot wasn\u2019t so much about the specific uniform the girls are wearing, but the palette of those red jackets against that pink fence.</p> <p>It was the middle of winter, on a day that had started out cloudy but then we got this really nice band of light. I love how alike the girls look. They\u2019re a year apart, but even their mother couldn\u2019t tell who was who in the picture. They\u2019re not professional models, but I knew I could do something interesting with them. </p> <p>I didn\u2019t realise why at the time, but I needed a sense of forward movement in the poses they struck.

After the shoot, because I wasn\u2019t really working, I had the luxury of being able to spend several months manipulating the image, printing and reprinting it. I was thinking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/diego-velazquez\">Vel\u00e1zquez</a> and working on the lights and darks \u2013 the different blacks, in particular.</p> <p>This was in the months leading up to to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-results-live-clinton-trump?view=map&amp;type=presidential\">the 2016 election</a>. I\u2019m from Texas, and I split my time between Dallas and Marfa, which is about 60 miles from the Mexican border. It\u2019s hard to not think about the border when you live here. This image might not be a traditional version of what Texas looks like, but to me it is quite Texan, at least in my fantasy world.</p> <p>I started thinking about the role fantasy plays in everything \u2013 identity politics, cultural pluralism, nationalism \u2013 and these blended geographic areas that are constantly changing. I started researching the archetypes of the wild west and how they were interpreted by the Italians and the Spanish in spaghetti westerns. I watched a lot of Sergio Leone movies \u2013 I must have rewatched the last 10 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/01/actionandadventure1\">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a> 100 times \u2013 and listened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino\">Quentin Tarantino</a> interviews.

The debate turned raucous at one point when Nigel Farage took the floor. \u201cOnce we have left we are never coming back and the rest is detail.\u201d At the end of his speech Farage and his Brexit party MEPs were asked to leave, and obliged, after brandishing miniature union jacks. Sassoli concluded the session by quoting the murdered British MP Jo Cox, who was killed during the 2016 referendum campaign: \u201cWe have a lot more in common than divides us.\u201d</p> \n<p>British citizens living in the EU remain confused and worried about their post-Brexit healthcare and pension entitlements, despite the fact that both issues were settled in the withdrawal agreement, a Guardian callout suggests. But with 80% of the estimated 1.3 million Britons on the continent of working age or younger, the withdrawal agreement\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/30/britons-in-eu-remain-fearful-of-post-brexit-healthcare-and-pension-provisions\">failure to guarantee continued rights to free movement</a>, cross-border working and recognition of professional qualifications for Britons remains of real concern, says Laura Shields, spokesperson for the lobby group British in Europe. \u201cThe settlement for healthcare provision and state pensions is actually quite satisfactory.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a53db395-7b6d-45ff-8c0b-78e439cf0fbf\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m8ki1Earlvo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Coronavirus latest \u2013 </strong>A British flight to bring about 200 nationals back to the UK has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-deaths-leap-in-china-as-countries-struggle-to-evacuate-citizens\">unable to take off by this morning as planned</a>.

In October, the Local Government Association reported an 807% rise in the number of child victims of modern slavery and human trafficking. Theresa May introduced laws targeting modern slavery in 2015 but there has been disappointment about a lack of funding to implement the legislation.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Britons on continent still worried Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray here to straighten out a few things before the day gets started. The European parliament has ratified the withdrawal agreement with its Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, declaring: \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see a country leaving that twice liberated us, twice gave its blood to liberate Europe.\u201d Emotions ran high, with MEPs breaking into a rendition of Auld Lang Syne after the parliament\u2019s president, David Sassoli, announced the result of the vote \u2013 621 in favour, 49 against and 13 abstentions. The debate turned raucous at one point when Nigel Farage took the floor. \u201cOnce we have left we are never coming back and the rest is detail.\u201d At the end of his speech Farage and his Brexit party MEPs were asked to leave, and obliged, after brandishing miniature union jacks. Sassoli concluded the session by quoting the murdered British MP Jo Cox, who was killed during the 2016 referendum campaign: \u201cWe have a lot more in common than divides us.\u201d British citizens living in the EU remain confused and worried about their post-Brexit healthcare and pension entitlements, despite the fact that both issues were settled in the withdrawal agreement, a Guardian callout suggests. But with 80% of the estimated 1.3 million Britons on the continent of working age or younger, the withdrawal agreement\u2019s failure to guarantee continued rights to free movement, cross-border working and recognition of professional qualifications for Britons remains of real concern, says Laura Shields, spokesperson for the lobby group British in Europe. \u201cThe settlement for healthcare provision and state pensions is actually quite satisfactory.\u201d * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 A British flight to bring about 200 nationals back to the UK has been unable to take off by this morning as planned. The Foreign Office said it was \u201cworking urgently\u201d to organise a flight to the UK \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Delays in obtaining permission from the Chinese government have been reported. The death toll in China from the coronavirus has climbed to 170 \u2013 follow updates at our live blog. * * * Car output driven down \u2013 British car manufacturing has slumped for a third consecutive year, with UK factories producing 1.3m cars in 2019, a decline of more than 14% on 2018 and the lowest level since 2010. One bright spot: Arrival, the UK maker of electric vans, has secured a \u20ac400m (\u00a3339m) order for 10,000 vehicles from the delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS). The Guardian\u2019s final Brexit watch snapshot before Britain\u2019s EU departure shows that warning lights are flashing with zero growth forecast for the final three months of 2019. But the last instalment of our three-year project shows there are also early shoots of recovery from a surge in business confidence since Boris Johnson\u2019s decisive election victory. * * * Javid on board HS2 \u2013 Sajid Javid is expected to throw his weight behind the controversial HS2 rail project at a key meeting today, after the Treasury concluded it will still deliver economic benefits despite spiralling costs. The chancellor is expected to demand tighter budget controls after the National Audit Office said the final cost is \u201cimpossible to estimate with certainty\u201d. A final decision is unlikely to be made until next week. Boris Johnson has faced enthusiastic lobbying in favour of the rail link from northern mayors but opposition from a group of new Conservative MPs in \u201cblue wall\u201d northern seats who want it scrapped in favour of smaller-scale infrastructure projects in the Midlands and the north. * * * Heated dispute over gas power \u2013 The government is being sued for approving the biggest gas power station in Europe, overruling the climate change objections of its own planning authority. The 3.6GW plant, being developed by Drax in north Yorkshire, could produce 75% of the UK\u2019s power sector emissions when fully operational, according to the environmental lawyers ClientEarth, who have brought a judicial review. Andrea Leadsom, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, gave the go-ahead in October despite the planning inspectorate determining it would have significant adverse effects and \u201cundermine the government\u2019s commitment, as set out in the Climate Change Act 2008, to cut greenhouse emissions\u201d. * * * Modern slavery cases surge \u2013 There has been a more than tenfold increase in the number of people identified as victims of modern slavery and human trafficking in London, with a third of all cases nationally discovered in the capital, according to an analysis by the London assembly. In October, the Local Government Association reported an 807% rise in the number of child victims of modern slavery and human trafficking. Theresa May introduced laws targeting modern slavery in 2015 but there has been disappointment about a lack of funding to implement the legislation. The assembly\u2019s police and crime committee is calling for an overhaul of how police and the mayor\u2019s office handle the problem, and has asked Sadiq Khan to put more detectives on the modern slavery taskforce. * * * Staring straight at the sun \u2013 The sun\u2019s turbulent surface has been revealed in unprecedented detail in the first observations by the Inouye solar telescope in Hawaii. The striking images reveal a surprising level of structure hidden within the churning plasma exterior, bringing a previously hazy impression of the sun\u2019s patchwork surface sharply into focus for the first time. \u201cThese are the highest resolution images of the solar surface ever taken,\u201d said Thomas Rimmele, the director of the Inouye solar telescope project. \u201cWhat we previously thought looked like a bright point \u2013 one structure \u2013 is now breaking down into many smaller structures.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Race to contain coronavirus Health editor Sarah Boseley tells Rachel Humphreys that the coronavirus outbreak that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan is serious but not yet a global crisis. Plus Louisa Egbunike looks back at the legacy of the Biafran war in west Africa, 50 years on. Lunchtime read: Why Trump deal is no deal US policy for the Middle East cannot work because it requires the Palestinians to accept they are a defeated people, argues Rashid Khalidi. Sport Manchester City plotted a nervy course into the Carabao Cup final against Aston Villa after losing 1-0 on the night to Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium for a 3-2 aggregate victory, although the occasion was marred by trouble in the stands. Liverpool went 19 points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 victory at West Ham thanks to goals from Mohamed Salah and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. The World Indoor Athletics Championships in Nanjing have been postponed by a year to March 2021 because of the coronavirus, which has now infected around 6,000 people worldwide and caused 132 deaths. The Chinese Football Association has postponed all domestic games. England are taking the scenic route into the Six Nations, opting to relocate from Portugal to Paris in the lead\u2011up to their opening fixture against France rather than returning to home comforts. Nick Cushing\u2019s hopes of a happy sendoff were dented as goals from the Dutch duo of Vivianne Miedema and Dani\u00eblle van de Donk put Arsenal into the Continental Cup final. And Russia has been warned that its track and field athletes face a blanket ban from the Tokyo Olympics \u2013 unless it accepts senior officials forged documents and lied in an attempt to help a world champion escape a doping ban. Ashleigh Barty\u2019s hopes of emulating Christine O\u2019Neil, the last local woman to win the Australian Open back in 1978, ended in stunning fashion as the American 14th seed, Sofia Kenin, beat her in two sets. Business Concerns about the coronavirus have returned to dog the financial markets with Asian shares off sharply in overnight trading. As a succession of airlines suspended flights to China, Ikea closed its stores and Oreo-maker Mondelez said it was shuttering two factories in the country, the prospect of a pronounced slowdown in the world\u2019s second biggest economy is causing the jitters among investors. The FTSE100 is set to fall 0.6% this morning while the pound is stable at $1.302 and \u20ac1.182. Our economics editor Larry Elliott warns that Boris Johnson\u2019s swing to the left on economic policy \u2013 as manifested by the Northern Rail decision \u2013 is a danger to Labour. The papers The most common thread today is the chancellor\u2019s expected nod for high-speed rail. \u201cHS2 should go ahead, Javid tells Johnson\u201d, says the Telegraph, while the FT draws a deep breath then rattles out: \u201cHS2 future clearer as Javid throws support behind \u00a388bn rail project\u201d. \u201cChancellor\u2019s green light for HS2\u201d, says the Express.

The 2020 shortlist, drawn up by food critics, <a href=\"https://gastronomiaycia.republica.com/2019/12/05/cocinero-revelacion-2020-de-madrid-fusion-conoce-a-los-ocho-candidatos/\" title=\"\">featured several startup restaurants</a>.

This year\u2019s winner \u2013 the first woman champion in 17 years of the contest \u2013 is Camila Ferraro, from Seville.

More affordable than its Basque equivalents, Monte San Feliz offers a generous weekend brunch (\u20ac23) and tasting menus of \u20ac35 and \u20ac50 served on tartan tablecloths in a rustic setting. Here, there are foraged mushrooms, wild flowers and herbs, while local hunters contribute hares, partridges, wild boar, venison and trout. \u00c0 la carte options include aged beef, stuffed onions, meatballs with hazelnuts and apples, and an Asturian cheesecake.

The \u20ac22 lunch menu includes drinks (Tuesday to Friday), and tasting menus range from \u20ac45 to \u20ac60 for a monumental 12-courser . \u00c0 la carte choices might include a starter of pickled rabbit with mushrooms and white beans (\u20ac14) or pickled trout with avocado and lentil hummus (\u20ac21). A bonus is the choice of earthy Menc\u00eda reds from the Bierzo, such as Cardona\u2019s favourite, Altos de Losada (\u20ac24).<br>\u2022<em> <a href=\"https://restaurantemuna.com/\" title=\"\">restaurantemuna.com</a></em></p> <h2>Arrels, Sagunto, near Valencia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82a02efd75e7f244d344335b5f5246460de714f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82a02efd75e7f244d344335b5f5246460de714f2/0_0_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"arrels restaurant, near Valencia, Spain.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Head into ancient Roman territory in Sagunto, north of Valencia, to find this unusual restaurant led by the region\u2019s rising star: 26-year-old Vicky Sevilla. Beneath the stone arches of converted 16th-century stables, diners enjoy adventurous combinations of Mediterranean ingredients. Excellent-value options range from a \u20ac15 lunch menu (Tuesday to Friday) to tasting menus at \u20ac30 and \u20ac39. Arrels means roots, and Vicky aims to showcase their gastronomic variety, working with turbot, tuna, scallops and suckling pig, as well as citrus fruits from her father\u2019s orchard. Rice dishes feature, too. For wine she recommends a white or ros\u00e9 from a small Valencian producer, El Celler del Roure (\u20ac22).<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.restaurantarrels.com/\" title=\"\">restaurantarrels.com</a></em></p> <h2>Alejandro Serrano, near Bilbao</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e38e684517ab00b858be3efc80e853d5f1724a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e38e684517ab00b858be3efc80e853d5f1724a7/0_0_4148_4148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alejandro Serrano, chef, Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alejandro Serrano</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The CV of 22-year-old chef Alejandro Serrano glitters with Michelin stars, so it will be interesting to see if his two-month-old restaurant lives up to his mentors. Serrano\u2019s cooking experience started early, in his family\u2019s traditional restaurant in Miranda del Ebro, an industrial hub an hour\u2019s drive south of Bilbao, and where he has opened his own minimalist restaurant. The food focuses on careful calibration, whether oxtail <em>croquetas</em> (\u20ac12), partridge cannelloni (\u20ac16) or on its tasting menus (\u20ac39-\u20ac72). The star dish is grilled Bluefin tuna (\u20ac29).<br>\u2022<em> </em><em><a href=\"http://serranoalejandro.es/\" title=\"\">serranoalejandro.es</a></em></p> <h2>The Alchemix, Barcelona</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c9c491b713c118edbd67ea6dd54f97abf869ca8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c9c491b713c118edbd67ea6dd54f97abf869ca8/53_0_3779_2269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Alchemix, Barcelona\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>New to the Barcelona scene, this \u201cgastro cocktail bar\u201d in the uptown Eixample district fuses Asian and Catalan flavours.

At the bar, cocktails (from \u20ac12) incorporate foam, smoke and caviar. Try Mrs Pots and Little Chip \u2013 gin macerated with Isfahan tea, rose syrup, lychee juice and hibiscus \u2013 while nibbling on an amuse bouche (from \u20ac4.50) of green curry rice toast, <em>shimeji </em>mushroom, carrot, coconut and nori powder. Bigger appetites can shift to the dining area for ambitious tasting menus (from \u20ac55) where <em>dashi</em>, mango, chilli and tamarind meet Iberian pork, red mullet and cauliflower.<br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.thealchemix.com/en/gastro-cocktail-bar/\" title=\"\">thealchemix.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Dr\u00f3mo</strong>, Badajoz, Extremadura</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14d4460494efcc6f7b600806c22af095b6eb16bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14d4460494efcc6f7b600806c22af095b6eb16bd/0_0_1020_1020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish dish at Dr\u00f3mo restaurant, Badajoz, southwest Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At 16, Juan Manuel Salgado set off from Badajoz to study catering, going on to work with Michelin-star chefs such as Mart\u00edn Berasategui, Quique Dacosta and Dani Garc\u00eda. A year ago, Salgado, now 30, opened Dr\u00f3mo to introduce what he calls \u201ccasual fine dining\u201d to his hometown near the Portuguese border. Seafood comes as small-plate dishes, such as a Lima-style seabass ceviche (\u20ac13) or grilled octopus with hummus and crunchy onion (\u20ac18), while carnivores rejoice in <em>bellota</em> ham or roast beef with blue cheese and peanut brittle (\u20ac12).

Here, you will find an amalgam of classic French techniques (learned from chef Romain Fornell, at Caelis) with wild imagination. Dishes include foie gras in a hazelnut-and-apricot sauce, pigeon with its pat\u00e9, beetroot and cocoa dust or artichoke hearts with egg yolk and ham consomm\u00e9.

Most of their chef-owners have chosen to return to their hometowns in attempt to wow customers with extravagant tasting menus, following experience at Spain\u2019s top restaurants. This year\u2019s winner \u2013 the first woman champion in 17 years of the contest \u2013 is Camila Ferraro, from Seville. All eight chefs are worth seeking out for high-quality food at (mostly) reasonable prices. All prices exclude wine Sobretablas, Seville Winning chef Camila Ferraro met sommelier Robert Tetas while working at the illustrious El Celler de Can Roca in Girona (ranked best restaurant in the world on three occasions), before they both moved to Ferraro\u2019s birthplace, Seville. Sobretablas, in a grand 1929 building south of the old city centre, is their luminous plant-filled restaurant where the 32-year-old chef reinterprets seasonal Andaluc\u00edan recipes. There is plenty of technique, too, in dishes such as glazed belly of tuna with ajoblanco (cold soup) and fried quinoa (\u20ac19), fig salmorejo with smoked eel (\u20ac11) or a dessert of cottage cheese with honey and rose petals (\u20ac6). Tetas oversees a tantalising list of 160 wines, many from small producers, some natural, including a great choice of sherries. \u2022 sobretablasrestaurante.es Monte San Feliz, near Oviedo, Asturias The 31-year-old chef, Xune Andrade, who took second place in the competition, has returned to a hamlet near his birthplace in the hills of the Asturias, south of Oviedo. More affordable than its Basque equivalents, Monte San Feliz offers a generous weekend brunch (\u20ac23) and tasting menus of \u20ac35 and \u20ac50 served on tartan tablecloths in a rustic setting. Here, there are foraged mushrooms, wild flowers and herbs, while local hunters contribute hares, partridges, wild boar, venison and trout. \u00c0 la carte options include aged beef, stuffed onions, meatballs with hazelnuts and apples, and an Asturian cheesecake. Wash it down with the house wine (\u20ac16 a bottle) or traditional cider, then chase with a homemade vermouth or herbal liqueur. \u2022 montesanfeliz.com Mu-Na, Ponferrada, Le\u00f3n This informal-yet-stylish restaurant is in the town of Ponferrada, in the Bierzo region of north-western Spain. Run by chef Samuel Naveira, 29, with G\u00e9nesis Cardona, 27, looking after front of house, Mu-Na\u2019s menu changes monthly, using revamped recipes from this pulse- and beef-rich province of Le\u00f3n. The \u20ac22 lunch menu includes drinks (Tuesday to Friday), and tasting menus range from \u20ac45 to \u20ac60 for a monumental 12-courser . \u00c0 la carte choices might include a starter of pickled rabbit with mushrooms and white beans (\u20ac14) or pickled trout with avocado and lentil hummus (\u20ac21). A bonus is the choice of earthy Menc\u00eda reds from the Bierzo, such as Cardona\u2019s favourite, Altos de Losada (\u20ac24). \u2022 restaurantemuna.com Arrels, Sagunto, near Valencia Head into ancient Roman territory in Sagunto, north of Valencia, to find this unusual restaurant led by the region\u2019s rising star: 26-year-old Vicky Sevilla. Beneath the stone arches of converted 16th-century stables, diners enjoy adventurous combinations of Mediterranean ingredients. Excellent-value options range from a \u20ac15 lunch menu (Tuesday to Friday) to tasting menus at \u20ac30 and \u20ac39. Arrels means roots, and Vicky aims to showcase their gastronomic variety, working with turbot, tuna, scallops and suckling pig, as well as citrus fruits from her father\u2019s orchard. Rice dishes feature, too. For wine she recommends a white or ros\u00e9 from a small Valencian producer, El Celler del Roure (\u20ac22). \u2022 restaurantarrels.com Alejandro Serrano, near Bilbao The CV of 22-year-old chef Alejandro Serrano glitters with Michelin stars, so it will be interesting to see if his two-month-old restaurant lives up to his mentors. Serrano\u2019s cooking experience started early, in his family\u2019s traditional restaurant in Miranda del Ebro, an industrial hub an hour\u2019s drive south of Bilbao, and where he has opened his own minimalist restaurant. The food focuses on careful calibration, whether oxtail croquetas (\u20ac12), partridge cannelloni (\u20ac16) or on its tasting menus (\u20ac39-\u20ac72). The star dish is grilled Bluefin tuna (\u20ac29). \u2022 serranoalejandro.es The Alchemix, Barcelona New to the Barcelona scene, this \u201cgastro cocktail bar\u201d in the uptown Eixample district fuses Asian and Catalan flavours. It was kickstarted when chef Sergi Palac\u00edn, 28, met bartender Ignacio Uss\u00eda while working at Bangkok restaurant Gaggan \u2013 and they joined professional forces in 2018. At the bar, cocktails (from \u20ac12) incorporate foam, smoke and caviar. Try Mrs Pots and Little Chip \u2013 gin macerated with Isfahan tea, rose syrup, lychee juice and hibiscus \u2013 while nibbling on an amuse bouche (from \u20ac4.50) of green curry rice toast, shimeji mushroom, carrot, coconut and nori powder. Bigger appetites can shift to the dining area for ambitious tasting menus (from \u20ac55) where dashi, mango, chilli and tamarind meet Iberian pork, red mullet and cauliflower. \u2022 thealchemix.com Dr\u00f3mo, Badajoz, Extremadura At 16, Juan Manuel Salgado set off from Badajoz to study catering, going on to work with Michelin-star chefs such as Mart\u00edn Berasategui, Quique Dacosta and Dani Garc\u00eda. A year ago, Salgado, now 30, opened Dr\u00f3mo to introduce what he calls \u201ccasual fine dining\u201d to his hometown near the Portuguese border. Seafood comes as small-plate dishes, such as a Lima-style seabass ceviche (\u20ac13) or grilled octopus with hummus and crunchy onion (\u20ac18), while carnivores rejoice in bellota ham or roast beef with blue cheese and peanut brittle (\u20ac12). Portions are generous, even in Salgado\u2019s 12-course tasting menu (\u20ac64, order 24 hours in advance). \u2022 dromobadajoz.es Amad\u00eda, Madrid Calm and chic with a compact interior, Amad\u00eda is the six-month-old baby of 29-year-old Victor Cuevas, from Toledo. It\u2019s in Madrid\u2019s smart northern suburb of Las Rozas, a 30-minute train ride from the centre. Here, you will find an amalgam of classic French techniques (learned from chef Romain Fornell, at Caelis) with wild imagination. Dishes include foie gras in a hazelnut-and-apricot sauce, pigeon with its pat\u00e9, beetroot and cocoa dust or artichoke hearts with egg yolk and ham consomm\u00e9. Cuevas\u2019s emphasis on seasonal produce comes to the fore in tasting menus of three to six courses (from \u20ac40). \u2022 On Facebook Fiona Dunlop is author of Andaluz: a Food Journey through Southern Spain (Interlink Books, \u00a324.99).

This was up from only 9% in the last survey conducted in October. Uncertainty over Brexit and the election had led many companies to pause their investment plan. While there are hopes of a bounce in economic activity at the start of the year, analysts warn the improvement could be short-lived if the country appears to be heading for a disruptive no-deal scenario at the end of 2020. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/01/brexit-dashboard-auto\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/07/brexit-dashboard-enhancer-v2\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Corporate tax receipts for the year to date were down by 3.4%, the sharpest annual drop since 2012-13, in a signal that weaker economic growth has dragged down tax receipts. Better than forecast Political clarity boosts housing market Britain\u2019s housing market showed signs of recovering in December, as agreed home sales rose for the first time since May and expectations of future sales jumped after the election. The gauge from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors \u2013 which shows the difference between its members reporting price rises and falls \u2013 picked up to -2 in December from -11 a month earlier, beating the forecasts of City economists. Growth in UK house prices has eased since the Brexit vote, with prices falling on an annual basis in London and some surrounding areas. Prices have continued to rise in the Midlands and the north of England. Separate figures showed the number of mortgages approved by high street banks jumped to the highest level for almost five years in December. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 Business optimism rebounds after Johnson landslide The unequivocal election result in December prompted the highest surge in confidence for 11 years, as hopes rise in the City that Boris Johnson\u2019s unexpectedly decisive victory could lift some of the intense political uncertainty holding back the British economy. According to the accountancy firm Deloitte\u2019s survey of company finance bosses, one of the first early warning indicators since the election, which is closely watched by the Bank and the Treasury, found that 53% of respondents were more optimistic than three months earlier about the outlook. This was up from only 9% in the last survey conducted in October. Uncertainty over Brexit and the election had led many companies to pause their investment plan. While there are hopes of a bounce in economic activity at the start of the year, analysts warn the improvement could be short-lived if the country appears to be heading for a disruptive no-deal scenario at the end of 2020.",

I arrived at Oxford from a state school in Birmingham and spent years attempting to shake off my sense of socioeconomic difference. We should interrogate what the HMC means by that sticky term \u201csuitability\u201d. The very notion of intelligence is confused with the hallmarks of a private education. The confidence of a privileged education often carries you further in a university admissions process than determination or rigour. Private schools furnish children with the rhetorical skills and professional veneer to ensure that questions of competence and ability never really matter. Given how successful the private sector has been in supplanting our understanding of intelligence with these qualities, making admissions processes fairer and more representative of society won\u2019t just be about numbers: it will require a radical cultural shift. At the root of the frustrations about Oxbridge access is the idea that people should have the freedom to buy their offspring access to the upper echelons of the professional society through sending them to private schools, without acknowledging the inequality and discrimination inherent in that aspiration. Among those angered by the news that fewer privileged students will be offered Oxbridge places in the future, I\u2019m sure there will be many who consider themselves fair-minded and progressive. But discussions of inequality, lack of diversity and underrepresentation are futile if they fail to acknowledge the one factor underscoring and exacerbating them all: class. \u2022 Nathalie Olah is the author of Steal As Much As You Can",

Meanwhile, a \u201cwatch and act\u201d alert was issued for a bush blaze near St Marys on Tasmania\u2019s east coast where residents were being urged to enact bushfire plans. It came as heatwave conditions began to hit large swathes of Australia\u2019s eastern and southern coasts, bringing high fire danger to the bushfire-ravaged states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. While both fires in Perth and Tasmania were downgraded on Thursday evening, the Bullsbrook fire northeast of Perth remains out of control despite conditions easing slightly. The blaze is now at \u201cwatch and act\u201d level, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services says. The bushfire about 1.5km west of the St Marys township in Tasmania was brought under control on Thursday evening but severe fire danger will persist on the east coast, southeast and central regions on Friday. As dozens of fires continued to burn across the country, the Bureau of Meteorology forecast a top of 39C in Melbourne on Thursday, while people in Adelaide (42C) and Canberra (37C) were also set to swelter. The NSW government also announced an inquiry into the unprecedented bushfire crisis, which the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, pledged would \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d. Three firefighters were injured, while another has escaped unharmed, after a tree fell on to their truck in the Australian Capital Territory. The crew were working to slow the spread of the 15,000-hectare Orroral Valley fire on Wednesday night when the tree crashed on to the tanker. Three of them suffered non-life threatening injuries. All four crew members were taken by ambulance to the Canberra hospital for assessment. Authorities in Victoria are continuing to open roads in fire-affected communities that had been isolated in the aftermath of devastating fires at the start of the month. After confirming about 250 people had been able to return to Mallacoota, the Victorian emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, warned of the weather ahead. \u201cThursday will be warm, but Friday is a significant day for us with elevated fire conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be storms that come through with the potential for dry lightning, so again it\u2019s a challenging day for us.\u201d In Canberra, where a massive bushfire south-west of the city came dangerously close to homes, authorities used improved conditions on Wednesday to prepare for what was forecast to be four days of sustained dry heat. The temperature was expected to hit 42C by Saturday, before a storm front comes through the city on Sunday. The ACT\u2019s emergency services commissioner, Georgeina Whelan, said authorities hoped backburning operations would slow the spread of the 10,000ha Orroral Valley fire. Smoke from the blaze, which was described as most serious the capital has faced since the deadly 2003 bushfires, was expected to linger over the capital on Thursday morning. The fire is believed to have been started by a defence helicopter\u2019s landing light after it landed in Namadgi national park while on a reconnaissance mission. The ACT\u2019s Emergency Services Agency said a southerly wind change would push smoke from the blaze into the city centre. \u201c There was a \u201cvery high\u201d fire danger rating in place for the ACT on Thursday, with temperatures forecast to reach as high as 38C. Meanwhile, the NSW Rural Fire Service said very high and severe fire danger was forecast for parts of state over the coming days, particularly in the south-east. Sydneysiders will be spared the worst of the heatwave, with a top of 29C on Thursday, steadily rising to 34C on Saturday. But across the fire-ravaged south coast, the bureau of forecast a top of 43C in Bega and 39C in Bermagui. In South Australia, authorities have declared severe bushfire conditions in six districts, with a total fire ban in place on Thursday for lower Eyre Peninsula, the mid-north, the Mount Lofty Ranges, Yorke Peninsula, the lower south-east and on Kangaroo Island. On Kangaroo Island, which has been devastated by fire, earthmoving equipment, water tankers and extra fire crews have been sent to strategic locations amid fears that hot spots across the existing fire ground could flare. The blaze \u2013 which has burnt through more than 210,000ha \u2013 is officially contained but the Country Fire Service has said crews were still finding hotspots in various areas including Blue Gum Hill, Cygnet River and Vivonne Bay. While the mercury was expected 42C on Thursday in Adelaide, it was predicted to soar beyond that in some regional centres, with Cummins, on Eyre Peninsula, among the hottest with a forecast high of 46C. But the heat and high-risk conditions will be relatively short-lived, with storms moving across the state on Friday before heavier rain at the weekend. with Australian Associated Press",

The archaeological reports I come across in the course of my work are marred with colonial interpretations of Indigenous people.

In the course of my work, I often consult with archaeological firms on projects. For instance, a construction company must contract an archaeological firm to complete an Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Assessment (ACHA) before commencing construction. The archaeological firm will then send out EOI\u2019s to interested Indigenous parties (Registered Aboriginal Parties \u2013 RAPs). The extent of consultation varies on each project. Sometimes there may be excavation, other times there may be site visits and report perusal.

      "body": "<p>Only the most die-hard Taika Waititi fan would think that Jojo Rabbit is anything but a plucky outsider when it comes to the best picture race. Comedy notoriously doesn\u2019t do well at the Oscars but a whimsical satire about a fanatical Nazi-loving 10-year-old whose imaginary best friend is a stroppy Adolf Hitler? Well, it\u2019s hard to imagine that going down comfortably with Academy voters who tend to be risk averse and much prefer to stick with worthy prestige dramas.</p> <p>But people love an underdog and Jojo Rabbit is far from an obvious choice for this category. Raising laughs from such a gruesome period of history is a tricky \u2013 and not to mention downright risky \u2013 tightrope to walk, but the New Zealand film-maker takes to it with acrobatic skill and poise; applying his distinctive wit to a big-hearted and ultimately uplifting tale about family, acceptance and how ludicrous racism is.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the consensus across the board. Jojo Rabbit has become one of the most Marmite nominees this year (bar Joker), with critics cleanly divided between love and hate.

      "bodyText": "Only the most die-hard Taika Waititi fan would think that Jojo Rabbit is anything but a plucky outsider when it comes to the best picture race. Comedy notoriously doesn\u2019t do well at the Oscars but a whimsical satire about a fanatical Nazi-loving 10-year-old whose imaginary best friend is a stroppy Adolf Hitler? Well, it\u2019s hard to imagine that going down comfortably with Academy voters who tend to be risk averse and much prefer to stick with worthy prestige dramas. But people love an underdog and Jojo Rabbit is far from an obvious choice for this category. Raising laughs from such a gruesome period of history is a tricky \u2013 and not to mention downright risky \u2013 tightrope to walk, but the New Zealand film-maker takes to it with acrobatic skill and poise; applying his distinctive wit to a big-hearted and ultimately uplifting tale about family, acceptance and how ludicrous racism is. This isn\u2019t the consensus across the board. Jojo Rabbit has become one of the most Marmite nominees this year (bar Joker), with critics cleanly divided between love and hate. Peter Bradshaw didn\u2019t hold back, calling it \u201ca pointless Hitler-spoofy YA adventure with a 12A certificate, obtusely accentuating little-kid cuteness and optimism amid the quaintly imagined non-horror\u201d in a one-star review. Clearly, it\u2019s not to everyone\u2019s taste but, as Waititi said in an interview with the Guardian, appealing to \u201cevery single person\u201d would just be plain \u201cboring\u201d. Still, you can put me firmly in the camp that was effortlessly charmed because it is a genuine delight.

Sure, it doesn\u2019t have the technical brilliance of something like 1917, but Jojo Rabbit is the director\u2019s most mature film to date and the way he navigates the different shifts in tone, ricocheting between absurdity and tragedy so nimbly that it never seems jarring, certainly deserves plaudits. Newcomer Roman Griffin Davis as the brainwashed Jojo makes a hilarious double act with Waititi, a buffoonish Hitler, who becomes increasingly moody and unhinged as he gets shut out by the boy\u2019s growing awareness that his antisemitic beliefs might be wrong.

Not least because recent political developments suggest that there are millions of Laurence Foxes up and down the country, and that their views are mainstream. Note, for example, how David Walliams\u2019 joke about Fox went down at the National Television Awards. Walliams implied that Fox would find himself friendless following his appearance on Question Time, presumably <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/david-walliams-laurence-fox-ntas-monologue-202056308.html\" title=\"\">expecting</a> laughter and not the chorus of \u201coohs\u201d that came instead.

New Labour\u2019s landslide victory in 1997 didn\u2019t signal just a change in government, but an ostensible change in our nation\u2019s culture. Exhausted and demoralised by the polarising Thatcher years, British people were apparently ready for a more liberal and tolerant era.</p> <p>The new received wisdom dictated that women and LGBT+ people were equal (sort of), and racism was to be condemned (unless you were a Muslim). The reason liberals still believe this consensus holds is that the politics New Labour ushered in was so dominant and all-encompassing that almost every opinion that existed outside of it was dismissed as the view of cranks.</p> <p>The most salient example of this is the Conservative party, which under the leadership of David Cameron recognised it would have to lean in to socially liberal values in order to gain a hearing. The culmination of this was that the Tories \u2013 historically the party of homophobic legislation \u2013 would eventually outflank New Labour by overseeing the introduction of equal marriage. In 2006, the Conservative and Blair critic Matthew Parris conceded in the Times: \u201cBritain is a nicer place than when [Blair] entered Downing Street.

It was also fundamentally modernising.

In its place is a new, young left that is more radical on issues of social liberalism, understanding that gender, sexuality and race are bound up with questions about power and privilege, and that these intersecting identities can produce significantly different life experiences. But as the tide of 90s social liberalism has ebbed, it has also revealed another group of people (<a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2019/03/a-reminder-of-how-britain-voted-in-the-eu-referendum-and-why/\" title=\"\">primarily</a> older, white homeowners and pensioners) who had never bought into the consensus in the first place, and are aggressively hostile to its newer, more radical iteration.</p> <p>We all know a member of this demographic: alienated by the modern world and displeased by change, they are fond of complaining that \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything any more!\u201d \u2013 even as their opinions are widely reproduced in the nation\u2019s print media.

      "body": "<p>Early on in mime school, I hit a brick wall. It\u2019s about 6ft high and the width of my outstretched arms, but you can still see my shiny, plum-faced embarrassment through it. \u201cFirst you hate the wall,\u201d internationally renowned mime artist <a href=\"http://www.nolarae.com/\">Nola Rae</a> prompts, as we scratch and smack at the stale air, \u201cand now you love the wall.\u201d We drool and shimmy against the imaginary bricks and I wonder if I\u2019m secretly being filmed for a prank show. I wave my arms awkwardly in a caress, wondering how much shame I\u2019m willing to wade through. \u201cIt is the most beautiful wall you have never seen.\u201d</p> <p>Rae is a co-founder of <a href=\"https://mimelondon.com/\">London international mime festival</a>. Originally a dancer, she trained with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/24/guardianobituaries.france\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/24/guardianobituaries.france\">arcel Marceau</a> in Paris. I\u2019ve joined the 70-year-old Australian performer\u2019s coveted two-day workshop at the festival to attempt to learn her art.</p> <p>A mime artist, Rae offers, is an illusionist. \u201cWe grab things out of the air. We make our audience see what isn\u2019t there.\u201d Over the weekend, she teaches us the skills of rhythm, rupture and articulation. We become zombies, spiders, misers and flies. We bob and crouch and hop as she teaches us snippets of history through Marceau, \u00c9tienne Decroux and commedia dell\u2019arte.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70dbe6533ae715fa28b86ba9fc5fd575ee146aac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70dbe6533ae715fa28b86ba9fc5fd575ee146aac/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate with Eva, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild inventions \u2026 Kate with Eva, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are two dozen of us. Our group includes a clown, an improv duo and drama-school students. They all carry themselves with such confidence. Their exaggerated movements seem to flow effortlessly through their joints and fingertips, while I\u2019m trapped inside my head panicking about how awkward I feel. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about being stupid or making mistakes,\u201d Rae advises. \u201cThat\u2019s how you learn.\u201d And yet, the worry lingers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>To mime is to play a game and stick to the imaginary, wondrously childish rules as well as you can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For comfort, I cling to the few others who have little experience in performing on stage. There\u2019s a young woman who has never acted but wanted to give mime a go, and a retired councillor who has been going to the mime festival for years and thought it would be fun. Then I\u2019m paired up with 10-year-old Eva.</p> <p>An all-round fan of stories (her cat is named after Harry Potter Hermione\u2019s Crookshanks), Eva didn\u2019t realise the class would be full of adults when she signed up but doesn\u2019t seem the slightest bit intimidated. A brilliant performer with an eye for timing, she takes the biggest risks and builds the wildest inventions, encouraging the rest of us to be ever more playful with our actions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2fc9a88b973eda04625758b984842ce6439e4ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2fc9a88b973eda04625758b984842ce6439e4ee/0_0_4134_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Don\u2019t worry about being stupid\u2019 \u2026 Nola Rae in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Don\u2019t worry about being stupid\u2019 \u2026 Nola Rae in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mariano Cieza Moreno/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re partnered up for an exercise where we have to mimic each other while crossing the space to meet in the middle of the room, as if greeting a long lost friend, only to meet, realise it\u2019s the wrong person, and waddle away. When it\u2019s our turn, Eva leads. We shout and grumble and squeal, flinging our arms and legs and jumping around like deer. At one point, she makes me laugh so hard I have to catch my breath before I can copy her, rasping like a wildcat and wobbling like jelly. When we cross in the centre she makes me walk like a crab across the whole length of the space back to the starting line. I can\u2019t stop grinning. Finally rid of my stifling embarrassment, I start to get to grips with the task. Look through the bright eyes of an eager, intelligent child, and mime is all about play.</p> <p>Mime doesn\u2019t have to mean someone in a black-and-white stripy top stuck in an imaginary box (though I can now very effectively push away a heavy invisible box, should the need arise). Instead, the best way to describe it, Rae says, is through \u201cpanto-mime\u201d. Though the word has been hijacked by the glitzy celeb-filled family Christmas show, it originally means \u201cto play all\u201d. While it can come across as a highly pretentious art form \u2013 particularly, Rae says, \u201cif you take yourself too seriously\u201d \u2013 mime celebrates the skill of playfulness. \u201cTo be silly is quite an art.\u201d</p> <p>Mime makes us focus on the little things: eye contact, touch, individual movements. To mime is to play a game and stick to the imaginary, wondrously childish rules as well as you can. It is the comedy in someone falling over and the pleasure of making someone laugh. It is the skill of telling a good story, eyes wide and lips sealed. Mime, I have learned, is the art of paying attention. At least, that\u2019s what I think it\u2019s all about, sweaty and aching as I leap over a brick wall, pick up a heavy suitcase, slip on a puddle of water and wallop into a tree on my way out.</p> <ul> <li><p>The <a href=\"https://mimelondon.com/\">London international mime festival</a> runs until 2 February.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Early on in mime school, I hit a brick wall. It\u2019s about 6ft high and the width of my outstretched arms, but you can still see my shiny, plum-faced embarrassment through it. \u201cFirst you hate the wall,\u201d internationally renowned mime artist Nola Rae prompts, as we scratch and smack at the stale air, \u201cand now you love the wall.\u201d We drool and shimmy against the imaginary bricks and I wonder if I\u2019m secretly being filmed for a prank show. I wave my arms awkwardly in a caress, wondering how much shame I\u2019m willing to wade through. \u201cIt is the most beautiful wall you have never seen.\u201d Rae is a co-founder of London international mime festival. Originally a dancer, she trained with Marcel Marceau in Paris. I\u2019ve joined the 70-year-old Australian performer\u2019s coveted two-day workshop at the festival to attempt to learn her art. A mime artist, Rae offers, is an illusionist. \u201cWe grab things out of the air. We make our audience see what isn\u2019t there.\u201d Over the weekend, she teaches us the skills of rhythm, rupture and articulation. We become zombies, spiders, misers and flies. We bob and crouch and hop as she teaches us snippets of history through Marceau, \u00c9tienne Decroux and commedia dell\u2019arte. There are two dozen of us. Our group includes a clown, an improv duo and drama-school students. They all carry themselves with such confidence. Their exaggerated movements seem to flow effortlessly through their joints and fingertips, while I\u2019m trapped inside my head panicking about how awkward I feel. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about being stupid or making mistakes,\u201d Rae advises. \u201cThat\u2019s how you learn.\u201d And yet, the worry lingers. For comfort, I cling to the few others who have little experience in performing on stage. There\u2019s a young woman who has never acted but wanted to give mime a go, and a retired councillor who has been going to the mime festival for years and thought it would be fun. Then I\u2019m paired up with 10-year-old Eva. An all-round fan of stories (her cat is named after Harry Potter Hermione\u2019s Crookshanks), Eva didn\u2019t realise the class would be full of adults when she signed up but doesn\u2019t seem the slightest bit intimidated. A brilliant performer with an eye for timing, she takes the biggest risks and builds the wildest inventions, encouraging the rest of us to be ever more playful with our actions. We\u2019re partnered up for an exercise where we have to mimic each other while crossing the space to meet in the middle of the room, as if greeting a long lost friend, only to meet, realise it\u2019s the wrong person, and waddle away. When it\u2019s our turn, Eva leads. We shout and grumble and squeal, flinging our arms and legs and jumping around like deer. At one point, she makes me laugh so hard I have to catch my breath before I can copy her, rasping like a wildcat and wobbling like jelly. When we cross in the centre she makes me walk like a crab across the whole length of the space back to the starting line. I can\u2019t stop grinning. Finally rid of my stifling embarrassment, I start to get to grips with the task. Look through the bright eyes of an eager, intelligent child, and mime is all about play. Mime doesn\u2019t have to mean someone in a black-and-white stripy top stuck in an imaginary box (though I can now very effectively push away a heavy invisible box, should the need arise). Instead, the best way to describe it, Rae says, is through \u201cpanto-mime\u201d. Though the word has been hijacked by the glitzy celeb-filled family Christmas show, it originally means \u201cto play all\u201d. While it can come across as a highly pretentious art form \u2013 particularly, Rae says, \u201cif you take yourself too seriously\u201d \u2013 mime celebrates the skill of playfulness. \u201cTo be silly is quite an art.\u201d Mime makes us focus on the little things: eye contact, touch, individual movements. To mime is to play a game and stick to the imaginary, wondrously childish rules as well as you can. It is the comedy in someone falling over and the pleasure of making someone laugh. It is the skill of telling a good story, eyes wide and lips sealed. Mime, I have learned, is the art of paying attention. At least, that\u2019s what I think it\u2019s all about, sweaty and aching as I leap over a brick wall, pick up a heavy suitcase, slip on a puddle of water and wallop into a tree on my way out. The London international mime festival runs until 2 February.",

She is, she adds, considering \u201ca cow situation\u201d.</p> <p>We are about two and a half hours out of LA, deep in wine country. She has given me a quick tour of her beautiful 10-hectare (24-acre) farm. There are no passing cars and the nearest shop is half an hour away. Her farm is bordered by high rocky hills, in case the near isolation did not provide sufficient privacy.</p> <p>\u201cI hate LA. I was only ever there for work. Because it\u2019s not like New York or London, there\u2019s nowhere to go after 10 at night, so suddenly you\u2019re getting up early in the mornings and you\u2019re juicing and you\u2019re hiking and figuring out how much wheatgrass can you actually intake. I hate it,\u201d says the New York singer, unconcernedly reviving the music industry\u2019s old east coast-west coast rivalry. \u201cSo I thought, if I\u2019m going to be in California, I should be where I can appreciate how beautiful it really is, not stuck in LA and pretending it\u2019s a city that\u2019s fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"973c9e45d23074be97660a8791d8d9dd4426a624\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/973c9e45d23074be97660a8791d8d9dd4426a624/0_0_5048_3323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kelis, in around 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kelis, in around 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Ford/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In front of the main house, a handsome man is raking leaves, accompanied by an adorable four-year-old boy. They are her husband, Mike, a photographer, and their son, Shepherd. Kelis also has a 10-year-old son, Knight, with her first husband, the hip-hop artist Nas, and Shepherd proudly shows me the bedroom he shares with his \u201creally big brother\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much my husband and me looking after the farm. You get up in the morning and do what you gotta do, and then you look around and you\u2019re like: Why does it still look like this? Oh my God!\u201d she laughs, barefoot in paint-stained jeans and a loose jumper, her crimson braids swept back into a ponytail. At 40, she looks barely five years older than the precociously dignified, occasionally goofy teenager who broke through in the late 90s screaming \u201cI hate you so much right now!\u201d on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3JFwd1bk4Q\" title=\"\">Caught Out There</a>, from her debut album, Kaleidoscope. This was followed, a few years later, by the world-conquering <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AwXKJoKJz4\" title=\"\">Milkshake</a>, on her third album, Tasty. Since then, there have been more albums, marriages, divorce, children and a recent, somewhat surprising, appearance on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/04/stars-in-their-eyes-meets-teletubbies-is-the-masked-singer-tvs-weirdest-show\" title=\"\">The Masked Singer</a>. She has also made an enthusiastic divergence into cookery, after training as a Cordon Bleu chef, and is now making plans to open a restaurant nearby, using produce from her farm.</p> <p>As a musician, Kelis was often called \u201chard to place\u201d, which is another way of saying that record companies and radio stations did not know how to sell her. Refusing to be restricted to the R&amp;B and hip-hop boxes into which young black artists are often shoved, Kelis\u2019s versatile, distinctive voice meant producers as varied as David Guetta, will.i.am and Dave Sitek were keen to work with her. She has made dance music, soul music and even \u2013 on my favourite of her songs, Like You, from her fourth album, 2006\u2019s Kelis Was Here \u2013 sampled Mozart. But that variety may also have worked against her, because it means she does not have an easy, ready-fit brand. On top of that, she had a run of bewilderingly bad luck with record companies.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3JFwd1bk4Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N3JFwd1bk4Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThe issue of race has been such a big part of my entire career. It was never something that I struggled with personally. But it was other people\u2019s confusions. Macy Gray and I were the first [black women] to be considered alternative. But people were like: \u2018But you\u2019re black and alternative? What is that?\u2019 Which already is a stupid-ass question, but it was put in our faces all the time,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The reason Kelis is taking a break from farming today is to talk about the record where all this \u2013 the career, the confusions and, ultimately, the farm \u2013 began. It is the 20th anniversary of Kaleidoscope, her enduringly beautiful debut album, and she is about to embark on a world tour to mark it. But looking back does not sit comfortably with an artist who has always prided herself on moving forward, and, truth be told, she would not have even noticed it was the anniversary if her manager hadn\u2019t mentioned it.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m struggling a little bit, if I\u2019m honest. It\u2019s a lot harder than I thought it would be. I feel everyone is expecting me to have these deep thoughts about [the anniversary], and I just don\u2019t,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Having established that, she then spends 15 minutes sharing her deep thoughts about the album\u2019s anniversary, which take in everything from President Trump to modern parenting.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up hanging out in jazz clubs, falling asleep there with people stepping over me, because that\u2019s where my parents were, so they just took me. But you look at parents today and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s nap time, I can\u2019t talk to you!\u2019 And it\u2019s all: \u2018We can\u2019t go there because we have kids!\u2019 I\u2019m like, did we die when we had kids?</p> <p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s a disconnect: I\u2019m hypersensitive to the stuff my parents fought for because they weren\u2019t sheltering me from the realities. Now it\u2019s like parents stop everything and shield their kids \u2013 from everything! Then they become these adults who have no taste and no concept of what was being fought for before because they weren\u2019t privy to it,\u201d she says, exasperated.</p> <p>She means, I think, among other issues, that it is good to rerelease quality music, because that is often the only way kids come across it these days, as their parents just played Peppa Pig and Frozen albums for them. But even if it is not always entirely clear how her arguments relate to Kaleidoscope, I enjoy the ride.</p> <p>Kelis was born Kelis Rogers, the daughter of a jazz musician and fashion designer. She has always been interested in music and she is, she says, especially proud of her first album: proud of \u201cthe femaleness of the album, of the freaking outspokenness of it, the blackness of it, the alternativeness of it\u201d. But returning to Kaleidoscope has brought back as many bitter memories as sweet ones. Kelis made it with her then close friend Pharrell and Chad Hugo, AKA the Neptunes, after meeting them through a mutual friend at performing arts school. She was 19 at the time. \u201cI thought it was a beautiful and pure, creative safe space,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it ended up not being that at all.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AwXKJoKJz4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6AwXKJoKJz4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>The story of the music industry is one of young artists getting ripped off, again and again, because they are too young to understand the contracts they have signed until it is too late. What is different in Kelis\u2019s case, she says, is that it was her friends who ripped her off.</p> <p>\u201cI was told we were going to split the whole thing 33/33/33, which we didn\u2019t do,\u201d she says. Instead, she says, she was \u201cblatantly lied to and tricked\u201d, pointing specifically to \u201cthe Neptunes and their management and their lawyers and all that stuff\u201d. As a result, she says she made nothing from sales of her first two albums, which were produced by the Neptunes. But she did not notice for a few years, because she was making money from touring, \u201cand just the fact that I wasn\u2019t poor felt like enough\u201d, she says. She sighs: \u201cTheir argument is: \u2018Well, you signed it.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018Yeah, I signed what I was told, and I was too young and too stupid to double-check it.\u2019\u201d (Pharrell and Hugo did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)</p> <p>And they were your friends so you trusted them, I say.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d she shrugs.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t sound angry. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just stating the facts,\u201d she says. I ask why she isn\u2019t angry.</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest with you, I think if it were not for my faith, I feel like that would probably be the case. It\u2019s very clear to me, especially being on a farm, that whatever you put in the ground, that is what\u2019s going to come back to you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Things eventually came crashing down, she says, when she made her third album, Tasty, and decided to work with a variety of producers, not just the Neptunes, \u201cand I could tell they were really offended\u201d. </p> <p>But she has seen Pharrell. A few years back, he was performing at an industry event and she was in the audience. \u201cAnd he did that thing to me that he\u2019s notorious for, which is making a nod from the stage [to someone in the audience], so it seems like there\u2019s mutual respect, when in reality \u2026\u201d She throws her head back and laughs. \u201cI\u2019m like, OK, I\u2019m not going to yell back: \u2018You stole all my publishing!\u2019 So you end up nodding back and everyone thinks everything\u2019s great. Like, whatever.\u201d</p> <p>Would she work with him again? She looks at me as if I have asked if she would jump into a shark tank: \u201cUmmm, at that point there\u2019s having faith and there is also just stupidity.\u201d</p> <p>Kelis did not talk about any of this publicly for years. Another secret that she kept until recently is that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/27/kelis-accuses-nas-of-domestic-violence-hollywood-unlocked-interview\" title=\"\">according to her</a>, Nas, her first husband, physically abused her. She first mentioned this in an interview in 2018, nine years after she left him while seven months pregnant with their child. (He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/07/nas-denies-kelis-allegations-of-domestic-violence\" title=\"\">strongly denied</a> that he abused her.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b8a46f7a31165ef563a5ecd4225c5bcea661d0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b8a46f7a31165ef563a5ecd4225c5bcea661d0b/0_0_4000_2666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing earlier this month in West Hollywood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing earlier this month in West Hollywood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Araya Diaz/Getty Images for Morrison Hotel Gallery + Equinox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a very private person, and whether it\u2019s the stuff with the Neptunes and being assaulted from a business perspective, to then being assaulted in the home, I fought so hard to have my own voice, even with the umbrella of these men looming over what I was trying to do. I\u2019m not broken. But I don\u2019t feel like protecting the sanctity of the black man any more,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She and Nas met when she was barely out of her teens. \u201cThe red flags were there. I was really young and didn\u2019t know that love isn\u2019t enough. It was crazy from the start, but I think as girls we\u2019re taught that that\u2019s what love is, like you can\u2019t breathe without them. What kind of shit is that? I want to breathe!\u201d she says.</p> <p>The two married in 2005 and, second only to Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, they were seen as music\u2019s coolest couple. But fame, she says, made the abuse worse, and it continued to worsen, until two things finally made her leave. The first was seeing the photos of Rihanna after Chris Brown assaulted her in 2009. \u201cIt just woke me up,\u201d she says. The second was getting pregnant. \u201cI thought, you know, I can endure a lot, but I\u2019m not prepared to bring someone else into this. So I\u2019m done.\u201d</p> <p>Since Kelis first spoke publicly about this, Nas has issued repeated denials that he hit her and insists that she stops him from seeing their son.</p> <p>Kelis rolls her eyes: \u201cAny rational person would look at this situation and say [to Nas]: \u2018Well, if you want to see [your child], you have to actually show up!\u2019 My kid is a really happy child, because I don\u2019t tell him when [his father] says he\u2019s going to come and doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d She talks at length about the problems of co-parenting, and it\u2019s a conversation I\u2019ve heard often from friends who are very much not international pop stars. Death may be the great leveller, but so is divorce.</p> <p>From a distance, Kelis\u2019s story looks like a textbook warning to young artists, young female artists in particular: don\u2019t let record companies sell you short, don\u2019t let producers make you sign anything, don\u2019t let a wolf into your home.</p> <p>Kelis sees it differently. She sees it as a fight against people (men, really) who continually tried to keep her down \u2013 but she always stayed true to herself. Both things can be true \u2013 with her talent, she should have enjoyed more success than she has. But really, who cares about the bread and circuses? She has her farm, her goats and maybe even a cow situation. As she walks me back down towards the driveway, her little boy is walking hand-in-hand with his father towards the vegetable garden. She hugs me goodbye and I say I hope she is OK. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely fine,\u201d she smiles. And she is.</p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://iamkelis.com/#tour\" title=\"\">The Kaleidoscope tour</a> starts on 3 March in Europe.

Kelis also has a 10-year-old son, Knight, with her first husband, the hip-hop artist Nas, and Shepherd proudly shows me the bedroom he shares with his \u201creally big brother\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much my husband and me looking after the farm. You get up in the morning and do what you gotta do, and then you look around and you\u2019re like: Why does it still look like this? Oh my God!\u201d she laughs, barefoot in paint-stained jeans and a loose jumper, her crimson braids swept back into a ponytail. At 40, she looks barely five years older than the precociously dignified, occasionally goofy teenager who broke through in the late 90s screaming \u201cI hate you so much right now!\u201d on Caught Out There, from her debut album, Kaleidoscope. This was followed, a few years later, by the world-conquering Milkshake, on her third album, Tasty. Since then, there have been more albums, marriages, divorce, children and a recent, somewhat surprising, appearance on The Masked Singer. She has also made an enthusiastic divergence into cookery, after training as a Cordon Bleu chef, and is now making plans to open a restaurant nearby, using produce from her farm. As a musician, Kelis was often called \u201chard to place\u201d, which is another way of saying that record companies and radio stations did not know how to sell her. Refusing to be restricted to the R&amp;B and hip-hop boxes into which young black artists are often shoved, Kelis\u2019s versatile, distinctive voice meant producers as varied as David Guetta, will.i.am and Dave Sitek were keen to work with her. She has made dance music, soul music and even \u2013 on my favourite of her songs, Like You, from her fourth album, 2006\u2019s Kelis Was Here \u2013 sampled Mozart. But that variety may also have worked against her, because it means she does not have an easy, ready-fit brand. On top of that, she had a run of bewilderingly bad luck with record companies. \u201cThe issue of race has been such a big part of my entire career. It was never something that I struggled with personally. But it was other people\u2019s confusions. Macy Gray and I were the first [black women] to be considered alternative. But people were like: \u2018But you\u2019re black and alternative? What is that?\u2019 Which already is a stupid-ass question, but it was put in our faces all the time,\u201d she says. The reason Kelis is taking a break from farming today is to talk about the record where all this \u2013 the career, the confusions and, ultimately, the farm \u2013 began. It is the 20th anniversary of Kaleidoscope, her enduringly beautiful debut album, and she is about to embark on a world tour to mark it. But looking back does not sit comfortably with an artist who has always prided herself on moving forward, and, truth be told, she would not have even noticed it was the anniversary if her manager hadn\u2019t mentioned it. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m struggling a little bit, if I\u2019m honest. It\u2019s a lot harder than I thought it would be. I feel everyone is expecting me to have these deep thoughts about [the anniversary], and I just don\u2019t,\u201d she says. Having established that, she then spends 15 minutes sharing her deep thoughts about the album\u2019s anniversary, which take in everything from President Trump to modern parenting. \u201cI grew up hanging out in jazz clubs, falling asleep there with people stepping over me, because that\u2019s where my parents were, so they just took me. But you look at parents today and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s nap time, I can\u2019t talk to you!\u2019 And it\u2019s all: \u2018We can\u2019t go there because we have kids!\u2019 I\u2019m like, did we die when we had kids? \u201cAnd then there\u2019s a disconnect: I\u2019m hypersensitive to the stuff my parents fought for because they weren\u2019t sheltering me from the realities. Now it\u2019s like parents stop everything and shield their kids \u2013 from everything! Then they become these adults who have no taste and no concept of what was being fought for before because they weren\u2019t privy to it,\u201d she says, exasperated. She means, I think, among other issues, that it is good to rerelease quality music, because that is often the only way kids come across it these days, as their parents just played Peppa Pig and Frozen albums for them. But even if it is not always entirely clear how her arguments relate to Kaleidoscope, I enjoy the ride. Kelis was born Kelis Rogers, the daughter of a jazz musician and fashion designer. She has always been interested in music and she is, she says, especially proud of her first album: proud of \u201cthe femaleness of the album, of the freaking outspokenness of it, the blackness of it, the alternativeness of it\u201d. But returning to Kaleidoscope has brought back as many bitter memories as sweet ones. Kelis made it with her then close friend Pharrell and Chad Hugo, AKA the Neptunes, after meeting them through a mutual friend at performing arts school. She was 19 at the time. \u201cI thought it was a beautiful and pure, creative safe space,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it ended up not being that at all.\u201d The story of the music industry is one of young artists getting ripped off, again and again, because they are too young to understand the contracts they have signed until it is too late. What is different in Kelis\u2019s case, she says, is that it was her friends who ripped her off. \u201cI was told we were going to split the whole thing 33/33/33, which we didn\u2019t do,\u201d she says. Instead, she says, she was \u201cblatantly lied to and tricked\u201d, pointing specifically to \u201cthe Neptunes and their management and their lawyers and all that stuff\u201d. As a result, she says she made nothing from sales of her first two albums, which were produced by the Neptunes. But she did not notice for a few years, because she was making money from touring, \u201cand just the fact that I wasn\u2019t poor felt like enough\u201d, she says. She sighs: \u201cTheir argument is: \u2018Well, you signed it.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018Yeah, I signed what I was told, and I was too young and too stupid to double-check it.\u2019\u201d (Pharrell and Hugo did not respond to repeated requests for comment.) And they were your friends so you trusted them, I say. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d she shrugs. She doesn\u2019t sound angry. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just stating the facts,\u201d she says. I ask why she isn\u2019t angry. \u201cTo be honest with you, I think if it were not for my faith, I feel like that would probably be the case. It\u2019s very clear to me, especially being on a farm, that whatever you put in the ground, that is what\u2019s going to come back to you,\u201d she says. Things eventually came crashing down, she says, when she made her third album, Tasty, and decided to work with a variety of producers, not just the Neptunes, \u201cand I could tell they were really offended\u201d. But she has seen Pharrell. A few years back, he was performing at an industry event and she was in the audience. \u201cAnd he did that thing to me that he\u2019s notorious for, which is making a nod from the stage [to someone in the audience], so it seems like there\u2019s mutual respect, when in reality \u2026\u201d She throws her head back and laughs. \u201cI\u2019m like, OK, I\u2019m not going to yell back: \u2018You stole all my publishing!\u2019 So you end up nodding back and everyone thinks everything\u2019s great. Like, whatever.\u201d Would she work with him again? She looks at me as if I have asked if she would jump into a shark tank: \u201cUmmm, at that point there\u2019s having faith and there is also just stupidity.\u201d Kelis did not talk about any of this publicly for years. Another secret that she kept until recently is that, according to her, Nas, her first husband, physically abused her. She first mentioned this in an interview in 2018, nine years after she left him while seven months pregnant with their child. (He has strongly denied that he abused her.) \u201cWell, I\u2019m a very private person, and whether it\u2019s the stuff with the Neptunes and being assaulted from a business perspective, to then being assaulted in the home, I fought so hard to have my own voice, even with the umbrella of these men looming over what I was trying to do. I\u2019m not broken. But I don\u2019t feel like protecting the sanctity of the black man any more,\u201d she says. She and Nas met when she was barely out of her teens. \u201cThe red flags were there. I was really young and didn\u2019t know that love isn\u2019t enough. It was crazy from the start, but I think as girls we\u2019re taught that that\u2019s what love is, like you can\u2019t breathe without them. What kind of shit is that? I want to breathe!\u201d she says. The two married in 2005 and, second only to Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, they were seen as music\u2019s coolest couple. But fame, she says, made the abuse worse, and it continued to worsen, until two things finally made her leave. The first was seeing the photos of Rihanna after Chris Brown assaulted her in 2009. \u201cIt just woke me up,\u201d she says. The second was getting pregnant. \u201cI thought, you know, I can endure a lot, but I\u2019m not prepared to bring someone else into this. So I\u2019m done.\u201d Since Kelis first spoke publicly about this, Nas has issued repeated denials that he hit her and insists that she stops him from seeing their son. Kelis rolls her eyes: \u201cAny rational person would look at this situation and say [to Nas]: \u2018Well, if you want to see [your child], you have to actually show up!\u2019 My kid is a really happy child, because I don\u2019t tell him when [his father] says he\u2019s going to come and doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d She talks at length about the problems of co-parenting, and it\u2019s a conversation I\u2019ve heard often from friends who are very much not international pop stars. Death may be the great leveller, but so is divorce. From a distance, Kelis\u2019s story looks like a textbook warning to young artists, young female artists in particular: don\u2019t let record companies sell you short, don\u2019t let producers make you sign anything, don\u2019t let a wolf into your home. Kelis sees it differently. She sees it as a fight against people (men, really) who continually tried to keep her down \u2013 but she always stayed true to herself. Both things can be true \u2013 with her talent, she should have enjoyed more success than she has. But really, who cares about the bread and circuses? She has her farm, her goats and maybe even a cow situation. As she walks me back down towards the driveway, her little boy is walking hand-in-hand with his father towards the vegetable garden. She hugs me goodbye and I say I hope she is OK. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely fine,\u201d she smiles. And she is. \u2022 The Kaleidoscope tour starts on 3 March in Europe. It will be at the Albert Hall, Manchester on 16 March and at the Roundhouse, London on 17 March. The reissue of the Kaleidoscope album is out on 21 February.",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Thursday\u2019s blog: The Senate trial has adjourned for the day. Today\u2019s question-and-answer session focused on whether or not to call witnesses \u2013 especially John Bolton \u2013 and the motivations behind Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine. Over eight hours, senators often lobbed softball questions in order to give their side a chance to reiterate their case for or against removing Donald Trump from office. The president\u2019s lawyers contended that the president was right and reasonable to investigate his political rivals, and reiterated their view that nothing short of a statutory crime was grounds for impeaching a president. House managers hit back that the defense\u2019s position ran counter to that of a consensus of legal scholars. As the Iowa caucus approaches, Democratic senators who are running for president have had to get creative about how they campaign. The trial will resume at 1pm ET tomorrow. Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz is now trying another strategy to dissuade senators from indicting the president: He\u2019s arguing removing Donald Trump from office was deepen political divisions. \u201cFamilies are broken up, friends won\u2019t speak to each other,\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that the. impeachment decision by the House has brought that on us \u2014perhaps it\u2019s merely a symptom.\u201d He urged those who object to Trump\u2019s conduct to \u201ccampaign against the president\u201d, noting that Democrats could rid the country of Trump in a mere eight months. Dershowitz was responding to a softball question from GOP Senators Wicker, McSally and Moran tossed at him: \u201cWhat specific danger does this impeachment pose to our republic, to its citizens?\u201d During a brief recess in the Senate trial, Bernie Sanders called into a campaign event in Iowa. As the Iowa caucus approaches, Senators Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet have been juggling their \u201cconstitutional duty\u201d with their presidential campaigns. Warren sent her dog to campaign in her stead. Writes The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino: The rules of the trial effectively prohibit double-duty: senators must be in their seats six days a week. No cellphones. And absolutely no talking, archaically but loosely enforced on \u201cpain of imprisonment\u201d. The situation has forced the Democrats to get creative about how they campaign from hundreds of miles away, in a state where voters famously like to meet their candidates before making a decision. Senators took another brief recess before resuming the question and answer session. Most often, senators have been fishing for answers. Democratic senators have given House managers a chance to reiterate the key arguments they laid out during their opening statement. Republican senators have been giving Trump\u2019s defense team many chances to double down on the Bidens and Burisma. For instance, Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat of Michigan, asked to House managers: \u201cDoes an impeachable abuse of power require that a President\u2019s corrupt plan actually succeed?\u201d and gave Zoe Lofgren a chance to reiterate what the managers have been saying all along \u2014 the plan need not have panned out, it\u2019s the intention that\u2019s impeachable. Right after, GOP Senators Barrasso, Risch, Hawley and Moran asked the president\u2019s counsel, almost rhetorically: \u201cCan the Senate convict the US sitting President of obstruction of Congress for exercising the President\u2019s Constitutional authorities or rights.\u201d Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz has argued that it was right for Donald Trump to decide to investigate Joe Biden and his family after Biden announced his presidential campaign. At that point, Biden\u2019s went from being \u201chas-been\u201d to a public figure deserving of scrutiny, Derschowitz said, seemingly leaning into the Democrats\u2019 argument that Trump abused power by asking Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. If a presidential candidate has a \u201ccorrupt\u201d son there\u2019s a \u201cgood reason for upping the interest in his son\u201d, Dershowitz said. The question of whether or not to call witnesses \u2013 especially John Bolton \u2013 has, as Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow noted, been \u201cun undercurrent\u201d of today\u2019s impeachment proceedings. Impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s defense have continued to clash over the issue. The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy notes: If the Senate votes to call witnesses, Trump\u2019s legal team warned, \u201cthat changes the nature and scope of the proceedings\u201d and could lead to court challenges that would draw the trial out. Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, argued that Roberts, \u201ca perfectly good chief justice\u201d, could make fast rulings that would prevent the testimony of Bolton or others from creating a lengthy detour in the trial. \u201cThey could no longer contest the facts,\u201d Schiff said of Trump\u2019s defense team. \u201cSo now they have fallen back on, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t hear any further evidence on this subject.\u2019 Think about the precedent you would be setting if you don\u2019t allow witnesses in a trial.\u201d The relatively fast-paced question period, which allowed five minutes per response to each of 54 questions before the dinner break, came after a week in which the two sides made strictly siloed opening arguments, speaking for multiple days each to lay out their cases to the senators. The last two questions have come from presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Sanders asked: \u201cWhy should we be expected to believe that anything President Trump says has credibility?\u201d He noted that the media have documented \u201cthousands of lies\u201d from Trump, and forcing Chief Justice John Roberts to read out the tally: \u201cmore than 16,200 as of Jan. 20.\u201d Warren posed a hypothetical: \u201cIf Ukrainian president Zelenskiy called President Trump and offered dirt on President Trump\u2019s political rivals in exchange for Trump handing over hundreds of millions in military aid, that would clearly be bribery and an impeachable offense. So why would it be more acceptable and somehow not impeachable for the reverse?\u201d More on how the impeachment trial is affecting the Democratic primary race: Donald Trump\u2019s defense has argued that if senators were to call witnesses, the trial would drag on for too long. \u201cI want Adam Schiff. I want Hunter Biden. I want Joe Biden. I want the whistleblower,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, the lead attorney defending Trump. \u201cIf we get anybody we want, we\u2019ll be here for a very long time.\u201d He added: \u201cThe fact of the matter is, we\u2019re not here to argue witnesses tonight, but obviously it is an undercurrent.\u201d Lead House manager Adam Schiff, in turn, appealed to the floor: \u201cDon\u2019t be thrown off by this claim that if we call witnesses, we will make you pay.\u201d Appealing to senators, once again, to consider calling former national security adviser John Bolton as a witness, Schiff added: \u201cI\u2019m no fan of John Bolton but I like him a little more than I used to.\u201d Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, told reporters during the dinner break that he\u2019s \u201ckeeping an open mind to hear all the evidence\u201d in the trial. Jones has been viewed as a potential swing vote on the question of whether to acquit or indict Donald Trump. \u201cI\u2019m open to acquit, I\u2019m open to convict,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay? I want to hear all the evidence, I want to hear witnesses.\u201d Still, Jones seemed unimpressed with Trump\u2019s defense team, taking issue with their focus on the Bidens. \u201cIf they wanted to go after the Bidens, they should have done it a long time ago and nobody did that. Nobody did that, ever,\u201d he said. He also seemed unconvinced by Alan Dershowitz\u2019s argument that nothing short of a crime was ground for impeachment. \u201cWe should probably just abolish the Supreme Court and let professor Dershowitz be the Supreme Court justice,\u201d Jones snarked. Senator Rand Paul\u2019s question has been rejected, possibly because it names the whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment inquiry. Chief Justice John Roberts essentially refused to read the question out, according to reports. Donald Trump has his supporters have previously publicized the alleged name of the whistleblower, and have called for the whistleblower to testify in the impeachment inquiry. Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was fired by Donald Trump in 2018 has waded into the debate over whether John Bolton should testify in the Senate trial. Bolton\u2019s behavior \u201cis an act of disloyalty to the administration one serves and tends to undermine the unity and teamwork needed to reach the highest level of effectiveness,\u201d Sessions wrote in a series of tweets. Trump has said he never would have named Sessions Attorney General had he known that Sessions would recuse himself from the investigation into Russian election interference. Since then, Sessions has endeavored to repair his relationship with Trump, especially now that he is campaigning to take back his former Senate seat in Alabama. An endorsement from Trump could give Sessions a huge boost in a competitive primary battle. Senator Joe Manchin posed a question pointed toward Alan Dershowitz, noting that \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d clearly doesn\u2019t refer to a statutory crime. \u201cWhat has happened in the past 22 years to change the original intent of the framers?\u201d he asked. Dershowitz\u2019s response: \u201cWhat happened was that the current president was impeached.\u201d Democrats have been repeatedly harkening back to comments Dershowitz made more two decades ago, during Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. Back then, Dershowitz said that \u201cif you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty, you don\u2019t need technical crime.\u201d Throughout Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, Dershowitz has said his views have evolved since, insisting that despite a consensus of legal scholars arguing otherwise, nothing short of a criminal act is grounds to impeach a president. At one point, the Trump lawyer and Harvard Law professor took aim at one of his Harvard colleagues, Laurence Tribe, who has advised House Democrats on impeachment. \u201cProfessor Tribe got woke, and with no apparent new research, he came to the conclusion, \u2018Oh, but this president can be charged while sitting in office.\u2019 That\u2019s not the kind of scholarship that should influence your decision,\u201d Dershowitz said. House manager Adam Schiff hit back: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can write off the consensus of constitutional opinion by saying they\u2019re all Never Trumpers.\u201d The Senate has now taken a 45-minute dinner break. As senators mull the merits of calling John Bolton as a witness, an attorney for the former national security adviser has issued a statement. \u201cI have received no response whatever to my urgent request for the NSC\u2019s immediate guidance as to any concerns it may have with respect to the chapter of the manuscript dealing with Ambassador Bolton\u2019s involvement in matters related to Ukraine,\u201d said Charles Cooper, an attorney for Bolton. Cooper also shared his reply to a National Security Council letter saying Bolton\u2019s manuscript contained classified information. \u201cWe do not believe that any of the information could reasonably be considered classified,\u201d he wrote in an emailed response. The lawyer requested \u201curgent\u201d guidance from the NSC given that Bolton may be called to testify in the Senate trial. \u201cIf he is asked to testify, it seems certain he will be asked questions that will elicit much of the information contained in the chapter of the manuscript dealing with his involvement in matters related to Ukraine,\u201d Cooper wrote. Lisa Murkowski, along with other senators asked another interesting question, posed to both the House managers and Trump\u2019s defense: What standard of proof should be used in impeachment trials. House manage Zoe Lofgren said the House Judiciary Committee followed the same standard used during Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment process, only admitting evidence that was more likely true than not true. White House counsel Patrick Philbin argued that neither a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d nor a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d amount met the standard. Lawmakers must make a case \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d, he said. Ted Cruz, a Republican senator of Texas, asked Adam Schiff if the whistleblower whose complaint kicked off the impeachment inquiry worked with Joe Biden to take down Donald Trump. In response, Schiff said he did not know who the whistleblower is. \u201cI have not met them,\u201d he said, adding the idea that the whistleblower tried to get Trump impeached \u201cis a complete and total fiction\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go anything which would reveal the name of the whistleblower,\u201d Schiff said. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague Maanvi Singh will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: One of Trump\u2019s lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, made the controversial argument that the president\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate Democrats was in the public interest because Trump considered his reelection to be in the public interest. Many commentators responded by pointing out that such logic could justify nearly any action carried out by a sitting president. The White House sent a letter to John Bolton\u2019s lawyer saying the former national security adviser\u2019s book contained \u201csignificant amounts of classified information\u201d and \u201cmay not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information.\u201d The impeachment managers used their answers in today\u2019s proceedings to argue in favor of calling witnesses, including Bolton, to testify in the trial. Trump\u2019s Republican allies appear confident they will be able to block witness testimony in the impeachment trial, potentially setting up a Friday night vote to acquit the president. Maanvi will have more updates and analysis of the trial coming up, so stay tuned. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, two of the Republican senators considered most likely to support witness testimony, have asked a question about whether Trump raised any concerns about Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities in Ukraine before Joe Biden launched his presidential bid. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin responded by blaming House Democrats for not waiting to hear from senior administration officials who could shed more light on that question. (Of course, many of those officials were subpoenaed by the House but refused to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.) Philbin also pointed to two phone calls that Trump previously had with the Ukrainian president, in which the general subject of anti-corruption efforts was raised, to argue the request for investigations of Democrats was an extension of that goal. Responding to a question from Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito, deputy White House counsel Mike Purpura said Ukraine did not know about the hold on its military assistance until it was publicly reported. Purpura insisted Ukrainian officials first learned of the hold on the aid when Politico reported about it in late August. But the New York Times has reported that Ukraine\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Olena Zerkal, learned of the aid freeze in July. Trump and his allies have argued that the president\u2019s July phone call could not have been interpreted as a quid pro quo because Ukrainian officials did not yet know of the aid freeze. Responding to a question from Senate Democrats, deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin said the White House counsel\u2019s office was \u201cnotified\u201d when John Bolton\u2019s manuscript was sent to the national security council for review. Philbin reiterated that no outside the NSC has reviewed the manuscript and then read the White House\u2019s letter to Bolton\u2019s lawyer regarding the book. In the letter, the NSC said Bolton\u2019s book contained \u201csignificant amounts of classified information\u201d and \u201cmay not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information.\u201d Jay Sekulow, one of the Trump\u2019s lawyers, said that the president\u2019s team would call witnesses if the Democratic proposal for witness testimony were approved. \u201cOf course, if witnesses are called by the House managers ... the president\u2019s counsel would have the opportunity to call witnesses as well, which we would,\u201d Sekulow said. But at the moment, Republican senators appear confident they will be able to defeat a motion to call witnesses in the impeachment trial. If they do, the Senate could move to a vote on whether to remove Trump from office as soon as Friday night. During the recess, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer downplayed expectations about the vote on witness testimony, as Trump\u2019s Senate allies voiced confidence that a vote to acquit would take place on Friday night. The Senate impeachment trial has resumed, and the first question is on the Republican side for Trump\u2019s legal team. A group of Senate Republicans, led by Jim Inhofe, asked a question about the Obama administration\u2019s decision not to provide lethal aid to Ukraine. The question was clearly setting up an opportunity for Trump\u2019s lawyers to repeat their talking points about the current administration providing anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, an opportunity that deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin jumped at. Republican senators say they are planning on a vote to acquit on Friday night if the Democratic proposal to call witnesses fails. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has called for a brief recess; the impeachment trial will resume in about 20 minutes. Posing a question to the impeachment managers, Democratic senator Kamala Harris invoked the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, in which Trump described groping women. At one point in the tape, Trump said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\u201d Harris compared that comment to Richard Nixon saying, \u201cWhen the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.\u201d Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts read both of these quotes aloud. Harris\u2019 question centered on whether it would undermine the US justice system if the Senate fails to hold Trump accountable. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff warned that a Senate acquittal could set a dangerous precedent for future presidents. \u201cIf you look in the pattern of the president\u2019s conduct and his words, what you see is a president who identifies the state as being himself,\u201d Schiff said. The question-and-answer session has been going on for about two and a half hours now, so five and a half hours remain in today\u2019s proceedings. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell just said each side would get one more question before the impeachment trial recesses for 15 minutes. When his Senate colleagues Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz posed their hypothetical question about his son being involved with a corrupt Russian company, Mitt Romney appeared bemused. In their question, Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz flipped lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff\u2019s hypothetical about Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on its head. Schiff earlier asked the senators to imagine a situation in which Obama had asked Russia to investigate Romney, the former president\u2019s 2012 election opponent, arguing Obama absolutely would have been impeached for such behavior. Clearly targeting Joe Biden and his son, Graham and Cruz asked, \u201cIf Obama had evidence that Mitt Romney\u2019s son was being paid $1 million a year by a corrupt Russian company ... would Obama have authority to ask if that potential corruption be investigated?\u201d Schiff replied, \u201cThat hypothetical is a bit off.\u201d Nonetheless, the impeachment manager went on to make the argument that a president requesting an probe of his political rival tainted any potential investigation, even if there were legitimate questions about corruption. Schiff added that Trump\u2019s alleged request focused on Ukraine announcing an investigation of the Bidens rather than actually launching them, which casts doubt upon his interest in cracking down on corruption. The impeachment managers have repeatedly used their answers to make an argument for calling witnesses, specifically John Bolton. Impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries made the argument that witnesses have been called in every one of the Senate\u2019s 15 impeachment trials. (Obviously, not all of those impeachment trials were against presidents.) \u201cWhy should this president be treated differently?\u201d Jeffries asked. Democratic senators were visibly stunned when Alan Dershowitz made his argument that Trump was acting in the public interest by pushing for investigations of Democrats because the president considers his reelection to be in the public interest. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin has retaken the podium on behalf of the president\u2019s team, but fellow Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz has delivered the most controversial answer of the day so far. Asked whether a quid pro quo matters in deciding to remove a president from office, Dershowitz argued Trump was acting in the public interest by pushing for investigations of Democrats because an officeholder\u2019s reelection can be in the public interest. Many commentators warned that this sweepingly broad definition of the public interest could justify almost any action of a sitting president. Responding to the question about whether a quid pro quo matters, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff criticized Alan Dershowitz argument that Trump acted out of \u201cmixed motives.\u201d Schiff asked the senators to imagine a scenario in which Barack Obama asked a foreign country to investigate Mitt Romney, the former president\u2019s 2012 election opponent who is now sitting in the Senate chamber. \u201cDoes any of us have a question that Barack Obama would be impeached?\u201d Schiff asked. The House intelligence committee chairman concluded by saying that not all quid pro quos are the same. \u201cSome are legitimate; some are corrupt,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t need to be a mindreader to figure out which is which.\u201d Republican senator Ted Cruz posed this question to Trump\u2019s lawyers: does it matter if there was a quid pro quo? Alan Dershowitz, who previously argued it would not be impeachable if Trump did tie Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats, responded by saying a quid pro quo is only against the law if the \u201cquo\u201d is illegal. Dershowitz said the president\u2019s actions were at least partly motivated by the public interest, arguing that Trump cannot be impeached based on \u201cmixed motives.\u201d Inside the Senate chamber where the impeachment trial is being held, the impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s lawyers are scrambling to produce the best responses to the senators\u2019 questions. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin described impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries\u2019 answer as a \u201cmisrepresentation of the record.\u201d Jeffries said in response to a question from Senate Republicans that Trump had not made any claims of executive privilege, instead pursuing a strategy of \u201cblanket defiance.\u201d But Philbin said the White House never cited executive privilege because they considered House subpoenas to be \u201cinvalid\u201d and based on a rushed timeline. John Kennedy has just become the first Republican senator to pose a question to the impeachment managers, although he also posed it to Trump\u2019s lawyers. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts said each side would be given two and a half minutes to answer the question, which centered on why the House did not challenge the president\u2019s claims of executive privilege during the impeachment inquiry. Impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries pointed out that Trump never officially invoked executive privilege, instead resting his defense on \u201cthis notion of blanket defiance.\u201d So far, the questions in today\u2019s proceedings have served as another opportunity for the impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s lawyers to repeat their talking points from the opening arguments. Mitt Romney, one of only a few Republican senators who has indicated support for calling witnesses in the impeachment trial, has released the six questions he intends to ask during the question-and-answer sessions. The questions are wide-ranging, covering everything from Rudy Giulaini\u2019s activities in Ukraine to the timeline of the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance. But Romney\u2019s last question concerns Joe Biden, asking the impeachment managers whether they believe the former vice president or his son did anything corrupt or \u201cotherwise inappropriate\u201d in Ukraine. The House impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s lawyers are presenting polar opposite arguments about potentially calling witnesses to testify in the trial. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin warned that calling witnesses could set a dangerous precedent by transforming the Senate into an investigative body. But lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff replied, \u201cThink about the precedent you would be setting if you don\u2019t call witnesses in a trial. ... That to me is the much more dangerous precedent.\u201d Cory Gardner, a Republican senator who is facing a difficult reelection in Colorado later this year, has issued a statement saying he does not support witness testimony in the impeachment trial. \u201cI do not believe we need to hear from an 18th witness,\u201d Gardner told Colorado Politics, referring to the officials who testified during the House impeachment inquiry. \u201cI have approached every aspect of this grave constitutional duty with the respect and attention required by law, and have reached this decision after carefully weighing the House managers and defense arguments and closely reviewing the evidence from the House, which included well over 100 hours of testimony from 17 witnesses.\u201d During a meeting with other Republican senators yesterday, Gardner expressed a fear that a prolonged trial could lead to more Democratic attacks on vulnerable incumbents. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin made the dubious claim that Mick Mulvaney\u2019s comments at his October press conference, at which he infamously confirmed a quid pro quo in the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military assistance, were \u201cgarbled or misunderstood.\u201d In reality, Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, repeatedly said during the press conference that the aid freeze was tied to a request for an investigation into the 2016 election. Mulvaney later walked back those comments, but there was nothing \u201cgarbled\u201d about them. The first question from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer was posed to the House impeachment managers and centered on the potential testimony of John Bolton. Schumer asked whether it was possible to have a fair trial without senators hearing more information about the former national security adviser, who has reportedly alleged that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. \u201cThe short answer to that question is no,\u201d said lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff. The House intelligence committee chairman argued that Bolton\u2019s testimony was \u201cessential\u201d to determining Trump\u2019s motivation in holding up Ukraine\u2019s aid. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for the book,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait until March 17, when it is in black and white, to find out the answer to your question.\u201d Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin responded to the question from Republican senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney by arguing the impeachment managers had not met their burden of proof for the first article of impeachment. Philbin said the evidence showed Trump was acting, at least partly, out of \u201clegitimate public interest\u201d in his interactions with Ukraine and thus his pushing for investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election was justified. The impeachment managers would have to show there was no public interest concern to make their case, Philbin said, claiming that the managers had failed at that task. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said questions should be kept to five minutes, and questions will alternate between Republicans and Democrats. The first question is from three Republican senators who appear to be currently leaning toward allowing witness testimony in the trial: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney. The three senators posed a question to the president\u2019s legal team: \u201cIf President Trump had more than one motive for his alleged conduct ... how should the Senate consider more than one motive in its assessment of article I?\u201d The first article of impeachment is abuse of power. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts has assumed his post, and the Senate impeachment trial has now officially resumed. Today will be the first of two eight-hour sessions in which senators can submit questions, read by Roberts, to the impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s lawyers. The White House has indeed sent a letter to John Bolton\u2019s attorney saying his client\u2019s book cannot be published in its current form, confirming CNN\u2019s earlier scoop. The letter claims Bolton\u2019s manuscripts contains \u201csignificant amounts of classified information\u201d and \u201cmay not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information.\u201d Bolton\u2019s team has said the former national security adviser does not believe the manuscript contains classified information, but he still submitted it to the national security council as a precaution. Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House foreign relations committee, has just put out a statement contradicting Trump\u2019s claim that John Bolton did not raise concerns about Ukraine when he left the administration in September. \u201cPresident Trump is wrong that John Bolton didn\u2019t say anything about the Trump-Ukraine Scandal at the time the President fired him,\u201d Engel said in the statement. \u201cHe said something to me. \u201cOn September 19, shortly after Ambassador Bolton\u2019s departure as national security advisor, my staff reached out to him at my request. ... \u201cHe and I spoke by telephone on September 23. On that call, Ambassador Bolton suggested to me\u2014unprompted\u2014that the committee look into the recall of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. He strongly implied that something improper had occurred around her removal as our top diplomat in Kyiv.\u201d Yovanovitch\u2019s removal as ambassador to Ukraine has become a key point of interest in the impeachment trial, after the longtime diplomat testified that she was ousted due to a smear campaign led by some of Trump\u2019s allies, including Rudy Giuliani, as they pushed for investigations into the Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s telling that, of all people, John Bolton is now the target of right-wing ire,\u201d Engel concluded. \u201cIt underscores just how important it is that the Senate subpoena Ambassador Bolton as a witness.\u201d The impeachment trial is set to resume with the first of two question-and-answer sessions in about 30 minutes. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump lashed out against John Bolton, as questions lingered over whether Republicans had the votes to block witness testimony in the impeachment trial. Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani who has been indicted on campaign-finance charges, arrived at the Capitol but was not allowed into the Senate chamber where the trial is being held because of his ankle monitor. Trump signed the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, hailing the deal as a \u201ccolossal victory\u201d even as economists voiced skepticism of its ultimate benefits. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. According to CNN, the White House has threatened John Bolton not to publish his book, which reportedly includes an allegation that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. Trump has been tweeting about the former national security adviser\u2019s book today, confusingly arguing that the unpublished memoir includes both false and classified information. The book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,\u201d is set for publication on March 17, likely after the Senate votes on whether to remove Trump from office. Senate Democrats have insisted Bolton should testify in the impeachment trial to make the details of the book available before the vote on acquittal. Trump has officially signed the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, hailing the deal as a \u201ccolossal victory\u201d that replaces the \u201cnightmare\u201d of NAFTA. However, a number of economists have noted that the deal\u2019s greatest selling point is putting an end to the market uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s repeated threats to kill the North American trade agreement. After a very dramatic arrival at the Capitol, Lev Parnas will not be allowed to enter the Senate chamber where the impeachment trial is being held, because of his ankle monitor. His attorney will be allowed to enter the chamber, and Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani, will watch the proceedings elsewhere. Although Lev Parnas has arrived on Capitol Hill, it appears the former associate of Rudy Giuliani may not be able to actually enter the Senate chamber where the impeachment trial is being held. A spokesperson for Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said the lawyer of Lev Parnas reached out to request tickets for the impeachment trial. Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani, was just spotted on Capitol Hill and told congressional reporters that senators should call witnesses in the trial. As Trump continues to speak at the USMCA signing ceremony, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry has appeared on Capitol Hill. Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani who has been indicted on campaign-finance charges, arrived at the Capitol and immediately went to the office of Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer. Asked what he wanted to tell senators, Parnas replied, \u201cCall the witnesses.\u201d A reporter followed up by asking what he would want senators to know if he wasn\u2019t called to testify. \u201cThe president knew everything that was going on in Ukraine,\u201d Parnas replied, adding that there were \u201cmany quid pro quos.\u201d Speaking at the White House for the signing of USMCA, Trump made repeated reference to the impeachment trial, suggesting that Lindsey Graham was probably missing the ceremony to hold a press conference. When he mentioned Ted Cruz, the president joked that the Republican senator was \u201cdying to get back there and ask those questions,\u201d referring to today\u2019s proceedings. The president also praised John Cornyn, who is up for reelection in Texas this year. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about Beto either, do you, John?\u201d Trump asked, apparently mocking former Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke. Trump has now started addressing a crowd at the White House for the signing ceremony of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. The president described the renegotiated deal as a \u201ccolossal victory\u201d that cleaned up the \u201cnightmare\u201d of NAFTA. Trump praised Republican senators like Chuck Grassley, Pat Roberts and Martha McSally for their work on the deal but then added, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just being nice to them because I want their vote.\u201d The president joked that he already had the House vote, citing the 197 members who opposed his impeachment, even though both articles of impeachment were approved. Trump did not mention the House Democrats who administration officials have credited for helping to craft the trade deal. Lindsey Graham, one of the president\u2019s closest Senate allies, said he considered witness testimony to be \u201cunnecessary\u201d for the impeachment trial. Graham expressed concern about efforts to discredit John Bolton, as the president\u2019s lawyers tried to do yesterday as they concluded their opening arguments. But echoing the president\u2019s team, Graham said Trump\u2019s actions would not be impeachable even if he did directly tie Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats, as Bolton has reportedly alleged. \u201cFor the sake of argument, one could assume everything attributable to John Bolton is accurate and still the House case would fall well below the standards to remove a president from office,\u201d Graham said. Trump will soon participate in a White House signing ceremony for the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, known as USMCA. Administration officials worked with House Democrats to craft the final deal, and some at the White House have acknowledged the agreement was significantly improved thanks to the work of Democratic lawmakers. Despite that, Trump did not invite House Democrats to the signing ceremony, although speaker Nancy Pelosi highlighted USMCA during a press conference this morning. As Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell tries to wrangle the votes to block witness testimony, another Republican senator appears to be leaning against calling witnesses in the impeachment trial. Pat Toomey, a Republican of Pennsylvania, told a reporter that he was \u201cvery, very skeptical\u201d any witness would change his mind on acquittal, while emphasizing both sides should be allowed to call witnesses if the Democrats\u2019 proposal passes. Toomey specifically mentioned Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, and Democratic senator Joe Manchin also appeared open to calling Biden to testify earlier today. Democratic senator Doug Jones, who faces a difficult reelection race in Alabama later this year, said the ultimate decision over witness testimony could affect his vote on whether to remove Trump from office. But Jones made clear he is not rushing to make any decisions about acquittal until all of the evidence is presented. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI\u2019ve sat in on so many jury trials, and every one I sit in, the judge says \u2018do not make up your minds until you\u2019ve heard all the evidence and consider everything.\u2019\u201d A new poll from Iowa shows a close race in the first voting state between five Democratic presidential candidates: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. The Monmouth University poll found that Biden and Sanders lead the pack at 23% and 21%, respectively. Buttigieg and Warren are effectively tied at 16% and 15%, and Klobuchar slightly trails at 10%. But perhaps most interestingly, only 47% of likely caucusgoers say they are firmly decided on which candidate they will support, meaning more than half of Iowa Democrats could change their mind before the caucuses on Monday. Iowa voters are notoriously indecisive about their presidential choices, with polls often swinging significantly up until the day of the caucuses. However, voters in Iowa also expect to see the candidates they are supporting in person, which could pose a problem for the four Democratic senators -- Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar and Michael Bennet -- who are currently stuck in Washington because of the impeachment trial. Joe Manchin suggested on MSNBC this morning that he would support calling Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, to testify in the impeachment trial. \u201cYou know, I think so. I really do,\u201d Manchin said when asked if Biden was a \u201crelevant witness.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem there, because this is why we are where we are. Now, I think that he can clear himself, what I know and what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d Manchin is the first Democratic senator to indicate support for Biden\u2019s potential testimony. His comments come a week after minority leader Chuck Schumer said a potential witness trade involving the Bidens was \u201coff the table.\u201d Republicans have tried to paint Biden\u2019s business activities in Ukraine as corrupt, even though Ukrainian and US officials have dismissed those allegations. Manchin later made clear that he considered calling Joe Biden to testify to be a \u201cbridge too far.\u201d Trump has already been tweeting away this morning, attacking John Bolton for his \u201cnasty &amp; untrue book,\u201d which reportedly alleges that the president directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. But Trump also claimed the former national security adviser\u2019s book was filled with classified information, which would seem to contradict his assertion that the book\u2019s details were false. Bolton\u2019s allegations are now at the heart of the debate over whether the Senate will approve witness testimony in the impeachment trial, as Democrats say they must hear from the former administration official. Bolton left the administration in September, and he and Trump publicly sparred over whether the departure was the result of a firing or a resignation. Bolton also served as the US ambassador to the UN under George W Bush, but the hawkish official was unable to secure Senate confirmation, so he resigned at the end of his recess appointment in 2006. The impeachment trial of Donald Trump continues today with the first of two days of question-and-answer sessions, beginning at 1pm ET. But the real question remains whether Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell will be able to wrangle the votes to block witnesses from testifying in the trial, as Democrats try to pick off four Republicans to back their proposal. At a meeting yesterday following the conclusion of the trial\u2019s opening arguments, McConnell said he does not yet have the votes to block witness testimony, but an administration official said the White House is confident the proposal will be rejected. The matter will likely come up for a vote on Friday. If it fails, Trump could be acquitted in as soon as two days. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will sign the renegotiated North American trade deal (USMCA) at 11am ET. Several Democratic presidential candidates, including Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, are in Iowa, with only five days to go until the caucuses. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo is expected to skip an appearance before the House foreign relations committee. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "New Zealand is launching an independent rescue mission to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, chartering an Air New Zealand plane a day after saying it was working on a joint operation with Australia. The foreign minister, Winston Peters, said the government has agreed with the national carrier to arrange a plane that can carry 300 people from Wuhan to New Zealand. There are currently 82 New Zealanders registered on Safetravel as being in Wuhan, and 57 of those have sought consular assistance. Any additional seats on the Air New Zealand flight would be allocated to Pacific Islanders and Australians \u201cas a matter of priority\u201d, Peters said. The announcement comes a day after Australia announced that its evacuated citizens would be quarantined on Christmas Island. New Zealand quickly confirmed any of its citizens evacuated from Wuhan would not be sent to Christmas Island \u2013 which was formerly one of Australia\u2019s most prominent asylum processing centres \u2013 but would instead be quarantined somewhere in New Zealand. New Zealand consular officials joined an Australian consular team in Wuhan on Thursday to work through the details of the evacuation plan, the ministry of foreign affairs said, but it appears the two governments are no longer collaborating on a joint rescue mission. \u201cThis is a complex operation as we work through all the necessary requirements but we are working to have the aircraft depart as soon as possible,\u201d Peters said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage all New Zealanders in the Hubei region to register on Safetravel and ensure all their details are accurate and up to date. This will give us a better understanding of the level of demand for this flight.\u201d Passengers on the Air New Zealand would be asked to pay a nominal fee for their rescue flight, although the New Zealand government would be footing most of the bill. It is unclear whether other governments have asked their citizens to help pay for the cost of their travel. Consular teams are working with health officials to ensure that the risks of transmission of the coronavirus to New Zealand are carefully managed throughout the evacuation process, Peters said, and officials are working on procedures for pre-departure health screenings, infection control inflight, and isolation of all passengers arriving in New Zealand for up to two weeks. It was not yet known where the Wuhan evacuees would be quarantined once they arrive in New Zealand, though the country\u2019s director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said teams were already preparing for their arrival. Peters said it was not clear yet whether New Zealand consular staff would be evacuated from China but all options were being looked at and the situation on the ground was \u201cof major concern\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to overreact until we know what we\u2019re reacting too, and against,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Australia and New Zealand agreed to a joint rescue mission to bring their citizens home, and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said more than 400 Australians would be flown to Christmas Island to be screened and quarantined. Qantas has offered a plane for the mission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the whole world must be on alert to deal with the spread of coronavirus, and urged countries to prepare. WHO will reconvene its expert committee on Thursday to decide whether to declare the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Total deaths now stand at 170, all in China, with 7,183 confirmed cases. Just 68 cases have been confirmed outside China, in 15 countries, but in three countries, Germany, Vietnam and Japan, there is evidence of human-to-human transmission, raising fears over the spread of the disease. There have been no cases of the virus detected in New Zealand, but flights arriving from China are being met by public health officials in Auckland and Christchurch, and anyone feeling unwell has been asked to self-quarantine.",

Known as the Bileola family after the Queensland town where they had built a life, Priya, Nadesalingam and their children, Kopika, 4, and Tharunicaa, 2, were sent to Christmas Island in August after the federal court granted an injunction to halt their deportation. The family are the sole inhabitants of the island\u2019s detention centre, which was controversially re-opened by the Morrison government in March and has so far cost taxpayers $26.8m. Freelance journalist Rebekah Holt said the family was in the dark about Scott Morrison\u2019s announcement that the island would be used as a quarantine area until she contacted them. \u201cThey hadn\u2019t been informed of any of the government\u2019s plans to use the centre as an evacuation centre for the Wuhan people. \u201cIt was rough, [Priya] burst into tears,\u201d Holt added. At a press conference on Thursday, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton said that the area where the family is staying was a \u201ccompletely separate area\u201d from the isolation zone the government intends to establish. \u201cPeople stay within the centre until we get medical clearance for them to come out,\u201d he said. \u201cMy clear message to people on Christmas Island is we won\u2019t be using the medical centre or the health facilities on Christmas Island. \u201cPeople who have come from China from this province will be restricted to the isolation area and there is a decision that\u2019s made under the Biosecurity Act to declare that zone.\u201d But Holt said she has spent her phone call with Priya \u201ctrying to reassure her because she was very upset\u201d. \u201cShe was just in shock at the idea that people who are that sick were being bought to the island,\u201d Holt said. Those concerns compound the difficulties the family is already facing on the island. Both children have experienced health issues while in detention. More recently, Kopika has just started school, but Holt said she has been experiencing an allergic reaction believed to be related to mosquitos. Holt added Priya has been told she cannot access a Cat scan on the island to assess an injury, which she said she sustained when the family was taken to Christmas Island. \u201cPriya wanted to know what I knew about how the viruses spread,\u201d Holt said. \u201cAnd I said, look it\u2019s person-to-person, there\u2019s got to be proximity. \u201cBut she was \u2026 really sort of agitated trying to understand about the coronavirus \u2026 She said, \u2018How is it spread because there\u2019s lots of big flies that come?\u2019 \u2026 She had these very, kind of, basic concerns.\u201d The family are awaiting court dates next month as they fight to avoid deportation to Sri Lanka.

      "bodyText": "VicForests has been forced to immediately stop logging in parts of Victoria\u2019s central highlands after the supreme court granted an injunction to a citizen science group pushing for a stop to logging of unburnt areas in the wake of bushfires. Wildlife of the Central Highlands (Wotch) has launched a fresh case against VicForests in a bid to stop logging of threatened species habitat after the country\u2019s unprecedented fire season. Late on Wednesday, the court granted an interim injunction to halt clearing of forest in three coupes that were being logged. A larger injunction covering 10 coupes for the duration of the case will be sought when the matter is before the court again in February. Wotch brought the case because the areas targeted for logging are habitat for the greater glider, the smoky mouse, the sooty owl and the powerful owl. The Victorian government has identified each of these among the species it holds immediate concern for as a result of the unprecedented bushfire crisis. Wotch alleges that logging in areas where threatened species affected by the fires have been sighted or where there is known habitat is illegal until the state and federal governments conclude their responses to the bushfires for wildlife. The court accepted that there was \u201cprima facie\u201d evidence of a threat of \u201cserious or irreversible damage\u201d to threatened species and their habitat if harvesting operations continued in the coupes. The court said \u201cthe recent bushfires have caused extensive environmental damage, the severity of which is only beginning to be understood\u201d. Danya Jacobs, a senior lawyer with Environmental Justice Australia, said it was a good result for threatened species \u201cwho suffered a huge blow after the catastrophic bushfires\u201d. \u201cImportant unburnt habitat is now safe from logging, while this case moves to the next stage,\u201d she said. Philip Marshall, a citizen scientist with Wotch, said it was important the forests were protected. \u201cWe cannot allow logging to continue the widespread destruction inflicted by these bushfires when the central highlands are among the last refuges for these precious species,\u201d he said. VicForests said it was unable to comment on matters that were before the court.",

      "bodyText": "Controversial Australia Day awards recipient, former sex therapist and media commentator Bettina Arndt has defended claims she has misrepresented herself in interviews to be a clinical psychologist, despite not being legally registered. On Sunday, Arndt was made a Member of the Order of Australia, the third-highest rank in Australia\u2019s civic orders system, for services \u201cto gender equity\u201d. Arndt has been a source of controversy for several years, particularly for her speaking tour arguing there is a \u201cfake rape crisis\u201d at university campuses, her book #MenToo, and most recently for a 2018 interview conducted with convicted paedophile Nicolaas Bester. Bester was jailed for grooming and repeatedly raping his 15-year-old student. After being released from prison, Bester said on an internet forum in 2015 that his crime was \u201cawesome\u201d. In the interview, Arndt described female students as being \u201csexually provocative\u201d to male teachers. New Matilda reported this week close to 200 instances where Arndt had been interviewed on TV or radio or referred to in articles, in parliament or at conferences and was introduced as a psychologist, a clinical psychologist or a doctor, despite not being registered with the regulator, Ahpra (Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency). This includes the Guardian in 2010. New Matilda found 10 videos on Arndt\u2019s own YouTube channel that had been viewed more than 200,000 times where Arndt was introduced as a psychologist, and reported that the 2009 first edition of her book The Sex Diaries, referred to her as a clinical psychologist. This was corrected in the 2010 version. On her own Facebook page, an image of a promo for a Sydney University Liberal Club event about rape on campuses refers to Arndt as \u201ca sex therapist, a psychologist and a prominent social commentator\u201d. Under federal legislation that came into effect in 2010, it is an offence to hold yourself out to be registered when you are not. In 2018, a counsellor was fined $9,500 for claiming to be a registered psychologist, after Ahpra filed a charge in the local court of New South Wales. This law also covers media, an Ahpra spokeswoman said. \u201cThird parties, such as news organisations, also have an obligation under the national law to not knowingly hold someone out to be registered when they are not,\u201d the Ahpra spokeswoman told Guardian Australia. Prior to 2010, Arndt would have been subject to the NSW law, which from 1989 required psychologists to be registered. Guardian Australia has sought comment from Arndt. In a Facebook post, Arndt explained when she obtained her Master of Clinical Psychology in 1973, it was not a requirement for psychologists to be registered. Arndt said she never registered because she had decided to do her work on sex education as a media commentator and writer, but said someone\u2019s historical work is often how they\u2019re described in media. Arndt said she tried to control how she was introduced. \u201cAs professional registration of psychologists tightened up, I tried to control how I was described more carefully when being introduced on radio and television. This isn\u2019t always so easy. Producers and researchers looking after these programs change jobs frequently and it requires constant monitoring,\u201d she said. Arndt said she refers to herself as being \u201ctrained as a clinical psychologist.\u201d The Ahpra spokeswoman said the agency was \u201clooking closely at the material outlined in the New Matilda article\u201d. Arndt\u2019s Australia Day honour prompted outrage from family violence campaigners including Rosie Batty, and Victorian attorney general Jill Hennessy, who has written to the governor general, David Hurley, calling for the honour to be rescinded. \u201cMs Arndt\u2019s views and activities diminish the devastating experiences of victim-survivors of family and sexual violence, promote division and discourage victim-survivors from taking steps to ensure their survival and safety,\u201d Hennessy said in the letter. Arndt told ABC Melbourne the letter was \u201cludicrous\u201d.",

For the Sydney Opera House, the story that the Unesco world heritage-listed design was fished out of a rejection pile before being declared a work of genius is a pleasing fable, despite its dubious origins.</p> <p>What is not in dispute is that the clashes that plagued the Opera House\u2019s origins have reverberated \u2013 not always pleasingly \u2013 down the decades. The ambition of the Danish architect J\u00f8rn Utzon\u2019s design, his walkout mid-project, and Peter Hall\u2019s subsequent takeover in 1966 resulted in compromises that have bedevilled the building ever since.</p> <p>Now, as part of a five-year program in which the Opera House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/11/sydney-opera-house-gets-202m-renovation-in-first-big-facelift-since-1973\">has been progressively upgrading its core infrastructure</a>, construction is about to begin on a $150m revamp of its largest performance space, the 2,500-seat concert hall, designed to remedy the shortcomings born of the project\u2019s messy origins.</p> <p>The irony of the Sydney Opera House is that it has become an international cultural landmark for the way it looks, rather than for being \u201cthe best opera house that can be built\u201d, as the New South Wales premier Joe Cahill hoped when he launched the design competition in 1954.</p> <p>It is very far from the best in the eyes, and ears, of some who have experienced it at close quarters.

Members of the resident Sydney Symphony Orchestra have long complained that they cannot hear their fellow musicians on stage. And the rise of the rock concert has further challenged the venue, with amplified music and electronic sets being precisely the opposite of what the hall\u2019s infrastructure was built to accommodate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f8d2b03efbaddf87edede9490d2661e3242b81fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8d2b03efbaddf87edede9490d2661e3242b81fb/0_0_4500_2451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The concert hall roof\" width=\"1000\" height=\"545\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New automatic drapes and improvements to the weight capacity of the concert hall roof will reduce artistic compromises and pre-show manual labour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brook Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A multipurpose hall designed as a \u2018big echo chamber\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cThe problem with our concert hall is that it was originally designed to have a grid, a flying system [theatrical rigging] above the stage so it could be used for opera and plays. It was called a multipurpose hall,\u201d says Louise Herron, the Opera House\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>That concept was thrown out midway through construction \u2013 after Utzon\u2019s enraged departure \u2013 and the objectives of the building\u2019s two main venues were switched. Operas and plays were moved to the smaller Joan Sutherland theatre, where rigging was installed to support theatrical performances, and the concert hall was decked out for classical music instead, the justification being that symphonies would be more popular.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2018/oct/13/sydney-opera-house-at-45-from-inception-to-icon-in-pictures\">Sydney Opera House at 45: from inception to icon \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, at 45 metres, the concert hall is at least 10 metres longer than most acoustic-oriented spaces, and double the optimum height. As a consequence, much effort has gone into compensating for its cavernous proportions, including wood-panelled walls to aid reverberation, and fibreglass acoustic reflectors hung from the roof to create a sonic ceiling.</p> <p>But in the years since it was built interest in symphonies has been challenged by the ubiquity of pop, hip-hop and rock. While rock bands \u2013 including Massive Attack and the National \u2013 are often set up in the outdoor forecourt, acts including Lizzo, Interpol, Nick Cave, Iggy Pop, the Wu-Tang Clan, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez and Hot Chip have played the concert hall.</p> <p>They take some wrangling.</p> <p>\u201cThe shows that we currently put in there were never in the initial scope for the hall,\u201d says Andrew Mackonis, Sydney Opera House\u2019s production manager. He leads a team of nine.</p> <p>\u201cEssentially it\u2019s designed to be a big echo chamber, and that\u2019s the opposite of what you want when you\u2019re doing an amplified event,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want the space to be as dead as possible. You have these two diametrically opposed ideals.\u201d</p> <p>The space has had multiple smaller upgrades along the way to help it cope, including a high-quality PA system being installed and heavy drapery created to hang over the wood panelling.

      "bodyText": "Significant buildings generate their own mythology. For the Sydney Opera House, the story that the Unesco world heritage-listed design was fished out of a rejection pile before being declared a work of genius is a pleasing fable, despite its dubious origins. What is not in dispute is that the clashes that plagued the Opera House\u2019s origins have reverberated \u2013 not always pleasingly \u2013 down the decades. The ambition of the Danish architect J\u00f8rn Utzon\u2019s design, his walkout mid-project, and Peter Hall\u2019s subsequent takeover in 1966 resulted in compromises that have bedevilled the building ever since. Now, as part of a five-year program in which the Opera House has been progressively upgrading its core infrastructure, construction is about to begin on a $150m revamp of its largest performance space, the 2,500-seat concert hall, designed to remedy the shortcomings born of the project\u2019s messy origins. The irony of the Sydney Opera House is that it has become an international cultural landmark for the way it looks, rather than for being \u201cthe best opera house that can be built\u201d, as the New South Wales premier Joe Cahill hoped when he launched the design competition in 1954. It is very far from the best in the eyes, and ears, of some who have experienced it at close quarters. The actor John Malkovich once said the acoustics in the concert hall \u201cwould do an aeroplane hangar a disservice\u201d. Members of the resident Sydney Symphony Orchestra have long complained that they cannot hear their fellow musicians on stage. And the rise of the rock concert has further challenged the venue, with amplified music and electronic sets being precisely the opposite of what the hall\u2019s infrastructure was built to accommodate. A multipurpose hall designed as a \u2018big echo chamber\u2019 \u201cThe problem with our concert hall is that it was originally designed to have a grid, a flying system [theatrical rigging] above the stage so it could be used for opera and plays. It was called a multipurpose hall,\u201d says Louise Herron, the Opera House\u2019s chief executive. That concept was thrown out midway through construction \u2013 after Utzon\u2019s enraged departure \u2013 and the objectives of the building\u2019s two main venues were switched. Operas and plays were moved to the smaller Joan Sutherland theatre, where rigging was installed to support theatrical performances, and the concert hall was decked out for classical music instead, the justification being that symphonies would be more popular. But, at 45 metres, the concert hall is at least 10 metres longer than most acoustic-oriented spaces, and double the optimum height. As a consequence, much effort has gone into compensating for its cavernous proportions, including wood-panelled walls to aid reverberation, and fibreglass acoustic reflectors hung from the roof to create a sonic ceiling. But in the years since it was built interest in symphonies has been challenged by the ubiquity of pop, hip-hop and rock. While rock bands \u2013 including Massive Attack and the National \u2013 are often set up in the outdoor forecourt, acts including Lizzo, Interpol, Nick Cave, Iggy Pop, the Wu-Tang Clan, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez and Hot Chip have played the concert hall. They take some wrangling. \u201cThe shows that we currently put in there were never in the initial scope for the hall,\u201d says Andrew Mackonis, Sydney Opera House\u2019s production manager. He leads a team of nine. \u201cEssentially it\u2019s designed to be a big echo chamber, and that\u2019s the opposite of what you want when you\u2019re doing an amplified event,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want the space to be as dead as possible. You have these two diametrically opposed ideals.\u201d The space has had multiple smaller upgrades along the way to help it cope, including a high-quality PA system being installed and heavy drapery created to hang over the wood panelling. But the process of getting the hall ready for an amplified show is cumbersome \u2013 the drapes alone take hours to install \u2013 and the PA system is long past its prime. The other problem is weight. Contemporary musicians, especially dance acts, will often tour with complicated sets \u2013 big LED walls and lots of light production, in addition to their sound requirements. That all has to hang off the roof \u2013 which at the moment can only support 10 tonnes. \u2018The Opera House belongs to everyone\u2019 \u201cYou could say we are the masters of the compromise,\u201d Mackonis says. \u201cBetween budget, safety, timeline and the artistic values of the show that we\u2019re putting in there, we are the ones who have to find the compromise.\u201d He hopes the increased weight capacity of the roof \u2013 up to 38 tonnes when completed \u2013 will mean compromising fewer artistic visions, and that the new automatic drape system will cut down on pre-show manual labour. But that\u2019s not all. The stage, which is now flat and fixed in height, obscuring the view from the stalls in favour of the boxes, will be put on multiple hydraulics. This will allow it to be elevated in sections, to give it the traditional orchestral horseshoe shape \u2013 helping the musicians to hear one another \u2013 or raised or lowered entirely if required. The boxes will be reoriented to reduce competition with the sightlines from the stalls, and more accessible seating and passageways will be installed. In measures aimed at further improving sound for classical performances, the fibreglass acoustic reflectors on the roof will be upgraded, and new wood panelling with a rippled surface will replace the flat timber walls, to give what Herron calls \u201ca softer, more surrounding sound \u2013 a truer sound\u201d. The singer Solange will perform the last concerts in the space this year on 31 January, though her health has reportedly reduced what was originally a four-night residency to two. Once the show is bumped out, the concert hall and sections of the viewing deck will be boarded up for a full two years while the work takes place. While some sections of the community may balk at the idea of a heritage venue hosting hip-hop artists and electronic dance acts \u2013 especially given the scale of the works required to accommodate them \u2013 Herron is firm about the necessity of the Opera House moving with the times. \u201cThe Opera House belongs to everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Opera House needs to cater to all of the community, not just certain sections of the community.\u201d The numbers suggest this strategy is solid: Herron says 40.7% of the 1.4m tickets sold in 2019 were for contemporary music and performance. \u201cWe need to not only maintain our fabulous heritage but we need to be as prepared as we possibly can be for the next 50 years. What is it that audiences of now and the future are going to want and how can we best prepare the Concert Hall for that?

      "bodyText": "Los Angeles firefighters rescued terrified residents from the rooftop of a 25-story residential building, where a fire broke out on a sixth-floor balcony and sent choking smoke billowing through the upper levels. Firefighters also made a dramatic ladder rescue of a man about to jump. Six people were hospitalized, two in critical condition, including the would-be jumper, in the fire, which occurred in a building where a similar blaze broke out seven years ago, authorities said. Some people who fled to the roof of the building were rescued by helicopters. Arson investigators are looking into whether it was deliberately set, and the fire chief, Ralph Terrazas, said the fire had been deemed \u201csuspicious\u201d. Fire crews had swarmed the building on the city\u2019s west side on Wednesday morning, after reports of a fire came in around 8.30am. The deputy fire chief, Armando Hogan, said the fire was put out about 10am, about 90 minutes after firefighters responded. Residents described a frightening flight to safety, as they tried to move down crowded stairwells that forced some to turn back and go to the roof. Firefighters were coming up the stairs as people with children, pets and some elderly tenants moved slowly downward. A panicked Cecilee Mathieson tried to push past in her rush from her 25th-floor penthouse. When she reached the floor on fire, she could see the orange glow under the door. \u201cI really thought I was going to die today,\u201d Mathieson said hours later. In 2013, a fire erupted on the building\u2019s 11th floor, injuring several people and displacing more than 100, the Los Angeles Times reported. The chief said on Wednesday the building did not have a sprinkler system. The building owners did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The newspaper reported after the 2013 fire that the building was not required to have one under state regulations because it was built 52 years ago. Dr Tom Grogan, an orthopedic surgeon who works in the building next door, was arriving at his office when he saw flames shooting from the building. His office manager called 911 and Grogan, who had seen the building burn in 2013, watched as firefighters struggled to get water to the fire on the sixth floor. A resident of the building with burns on his arms was hanging from a window as if he was going to jump. Firefighters inflated an airbag below but managed to get a ladder to him to save him. \u201cIt was scary to watch,\u201d Grogan said.",

      "bodyText": "The opposing legal teams in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial locked horns directly for the first time on Wednesday, as an interrogation period began in which senators submitted questions in writing to be read aloud by Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding. The format set up clashes over Trump\u2019s motivations, the power of Congress to call witnesses from the executive branch and, most of all, the need \u2013 or not \u2013 for the former national security adviser John Bolton and possibly other witnesses to testify at the trial. In its eighth full day, the trial drew ever nearer to a crossroads, expected on Friday, at which the senators will decide whether to call witnesses \u2013 or to move on to a vote for Trump\u2019s acquittal. If the Senate votes to call witnesses, Trump\u2019s legal team warned, \u201cthat changes the nature and scope of the proceedings\u201d and could lead to court challenges that would draw the trial out. Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, argued that Roberts, \u201ca perfectly good chief justice\u201d, could make fast rulings that would prevent the testimony of Bolton or others from creating a lengthy detour in the trial. \u201cThey could no longer contest the facts,\u201d Schiff said of Trump\u2019s defense team. \u201cSo now they have fallen back on, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t hear any further evidence on this subject.\u2019 Think about the precedent you would be setting if you don\u2019t allow witnesses in a trial.\u201d The relatively fast-paced question period, which allowed five minutes per response to each of 54 questions before the dinner break, came after a week in which the two sides made strictly siloed opening arguments, speaking for multiple days each to lay out their cases to the senators. Apart from the legal clashes, the question-and-answer format requiring Roberts to read the senators\u2019 queries produced some awkwardness, as when Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, said that Trump appeared to believe that being president gave him unlimited powers, including the ability to stonewall Congress. \u201cNixon said \u2018when the president does it it\u2019s not illegal\u2019,\u201d Roberts said, reading Harris\u2019s question. \u201cPresident Trump said, \u2018When you\u2019re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything.\u2019\u201d The words in the chief justice\u2019s mouth were from the Access Hollywood tape that surfaced a month before Trump was elected. Trump was impeached for abuse of power for allegedly conditioning military aid for Ukraine on the receipt of personal political favors, and for obstruction of Congress for attempting to cover the scheme up. Trump\u2019s defense team has argued that the president withheld aid from Ukraine out of a desire to combat internal corruption in the country, although prosecutors in the case have pointed out that nowhere else in his life or presidency has Trump taken up anti-corruption measures as a priority. Any senators with lingering questions about Trump\u2019s motives for suspending aid to Ukraine have an easy solution at hand, Schiff said: call Bolton to testify. In a manuscript to be published in March, Bolton reportedly describes a conversation with Trump in August 2019 in which Trump said he did not want to release aid for Ukraine until the country announced investigations, including one into the former vice-president Joe Biden. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for the book,\u201d Schiff urged the Senate. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for March 17 when it is in black and white.

      "bodyText": "Bridget McKenzie gave a $500,000 grant to the Northern Territory shooting club of Nigel Scullion, her former Coalition colleague and fellow shooting enthusiast. Guardian Australia also understands that the club\u2019s application for the grant was initially given a low score of 60 out of 100 by Sport Australia, well below the 74-point cut-off identified by the auditor-general as necessary for projects to be awarded money. Scullion is a longtime member and \u201cdiehard\u201d supporter of the NT Field and Game Association, a popular gun club for the territory\u2019s hunters and clay target shooters. The former Coalition senator and Indigenous affairs minister, who resigned at the last election, strongly supported his gun club\u2019s bid for a $500,000 grant through the government\u2019s controversial community sport infrastructure program. The gun club wanted to undertake significant upgrades to its facilities, including lighting for twilight shooting, showers for female shooters, and upgrades to allow for all-weather access. McKenzie signed off on the decision to award the grant and was present at the club when it was announced just weeks before the federal election. The club praised Scullion and other Country Liberal party members for their efforts in \u201csecuring the grant\u201d. Scullion and McKenzie were parliamentary colleagues until he resigned. He sat with her and her fellow Nationals senators in federal parliament, and the pair were shooting enthusiasts. They have been pictured together at multiple shooting events. Scullion and McKenzie also combined to publicly encourage NT sports clubs to apply for grants to the community sport infrastructure program in August 2018. There is no suggestion the club was not eligible to receive funds through the program. Scullion listed his membership of the NT Field and Game Association on his parliamentary register of interests last year. A spokesman for Scullion told Guardian Australia he had strongly supported the grant application. The club was not only eligible but also \u201cvery deserving\u201d, given sport shooting was one of the fastest growing sports in the NT and the association\u2019s membership had grown rapidly in recent years. \u201cNTFGA should not be excluded and their members punished by virtue of Nigel\u2019s membership of the club,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cOf course Nigel and all of his [Country Liberal] colleagues strongly supported the NTFGA application and were pleased that the application was successful. \u201cA number of other sporting codes in the NT which Nigel has no association with received significant funding, including netball and soccer.\u201d McKenzie has her own interests in shooting. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age revealed last week she is a member of another gun club \u2013 the Wangaratta clay target club, which received $36,000 in the grant scheme \u2013 and is the official patron of the Australian Clay Target Association, but had declared neither on her register of interests. The papers reported she had awarded $1m to shooting clubs, including the $500,000 to the NT Field and Game Association. The continued revelations about the $100m grant scheme have continued to put pressure on the government. The ABC reported on Tuesday that Sport Australia, the body responsible for administering the program, had voiced concerns to McKenzie\u2019s office about political interference. It also reported that her office was at one stage working from a spreadsheet of grant applications that were colour-coded by electorate and political party. The reports follow a damning auditor general\u2019s report that found the grants had been used to help the Coalition in targeted or marginal seats. The audit report found Sport Australia\u2019s objective, independent assessment of the merits of each grant application had been subverted by the minister\u2019s office.

Whether Manchester United\u2019s Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r possesses the tactical vision to outmanoeuvre a coach of Pep Guardiola\u2019s ilk has become a prevailing debate regarding the Norwegian. The argument goes that a man who failed badly at Cardiff City and whose two titles as a No 1 \u201conly\u201d came with Molde in Norway\u2019s top flight is a babe in a land of managerial giants embodied by the Spaniard who leads Manchester City. After his year-plus in charge the Solskj\u00e6r blueprint is familiar: soak up pressure, break with pace and hope a frontline marksman \u2013 Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial or Mason Greenwood \u2013 can finish. Rashford is injured so United came into the contest missing the 19-goal threat of their top scorer. It meant that on to Martial, who had 12, and Greenwood (10) fell the burden as strikes from midfield and defence in this team are a collectors\u2019 item. Perhaps in recognition of this their manager fielded them as twin forwards at the tip of a 3-4-1-2. If a common criticism of the Solskj\u00e6r system is that it is one-dimensional, then the manner of City\u2019s start illuminated this. Guardiola chose a 3-2-4-1 that intrigued as the sight of him deploying two holding players \u2013 in Rodri and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan \u2013 is a rarity. Yet it pinned United back as Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez led the charge against opponents who were overrun in central areas. Conversely, it also allowed the chance of a quick United counter if the ball was stolen and City were turned quickly \u2013 precisely in keeping with the Solskj\u00e6r way. So it was that this mode of attack raised Guardiola\u2019s fury when, from deep inside United\u2019s half, Aaron Wan\u2011Bissaka skated forward, and suddenly a blur of red shirts appeared which was reminiscent of how City conceded twice before the break in this stadium last month. That display had a surreal feel as Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s fragile team morphed into a vibrant force that made City appear a little too old, a little too slow. Fast-forward to the semi-final first leg three weeks ago and that 2-1 league win felt even stranger as Guardiola\u2019s side handed United a severe hounding that could have made it 8-0 at the interval rather than 3-0. Asked in the buildup to this return how United could offer such contrasting displays, Guardiola spoke of their \u201cweapons\u201d. The prime ones are pace and youth and a confusing ability often to match the level of loftier opponents \u2013 as they did again here. Clearer is what the 49\u2011year\u2011old\u2019s team have that Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s lack: nuance and guile. Guardiola\u2019s constantly calculating football brain was again evident on the touchline \u2013 his arms a whir of semaphore as he coaxed and pleaded and demanded his players keep up with the pictures in his head. For most of the first half \u2013 and before a concerning dip in the second period \u2013 he could be pleased with how his side exhausted United with a dizzying pass-and-move game. It stymied Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s hopes of as quick a start as December\u2019s when, by the half hour, United had scored both goals, the Norwegian\u2019s plan executed impressively. Instead Solskj\u00e6r had to act, and did: showing his naysayers an in-game flexibility by tweaking the shape to drop Greenwood alongside Jesse Lingard in an attempt to stem the blue wave. Moments later it yielded the kind of product managers dream of. The added man in midfield meant United enjoyed a sequence in City half\u2019s and won a free-kick via Lingard, who drew Rodri into foul. Now came a smash-and-grab strike in character for Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team as Fred\u2019s delivery was followed by Nemanja Matic rifling home. The second goal United craved nearly arrived in the second half via the same opportunist mode: Harry Maguire should rue the header he spooned over from another Fred free-kick. But while City take the garlands for reaching a third successive final United became more potent as the game aged, despite Matic\u2019s sending-off. Here then is some encouragement for Solskj\u00e6r and the manager he must become.",

Households have paid at least \u00a31bn more than necessary over recent years, according to the National Audit Office, because the regulator, Ofgem, was not tough enough on the electricity network companies. A report from the NAO, published today, found that the companies that run Britain\u2019s regional electricity grids received extra profits because the regulator overestimated the cost of upgrading their networks by using out of date financial information. The regulator is tasked with keeping a tight rein on how much each firm can spend to limit how much they can claim back through energy bills. The typical cost of running the UK\u2019s electricity cables and networks makes up around a fifth of the average electricity bill, or \u00a3130 a year.

Almost half of those killed, 47%, were 65 or older, despite this demographic making up only 20% of the combined populations.</p> <p>Over the period 19,450 cyclists were killed, 83% struck by motor vehicles.

      "bodyText": "Significant reductions in road casualties for vehicle occupants across Europe in the last decade have not been matched by equivalent safety gains for pedestrians and cyclists, a report has shown, with the UK performing particularly badly in some areas. Road safety groups have called for more government action to protect vulnerable road users after the report showed that while deaths for people in vehicles have dropped by 24% since 2010, the number of cyclist fatalities has stayed virtually the same. Across the EU, pedestrian deaths fell by 19% over the period. However, the report by the European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) found that the UK was one of only three of the 28 EU nations where pedestrian casualties increased. The report found that of the 51,300 pedestrians killed across the EU between 2010 and 2018, the latest year for which there are full statistics, 99% were struck by motor vehicles, with 1% hit by bicycles. Almost half of those killed, 47%, were 65 or older, despite this demographic making up only 20% of the combined populations. Over the period 19,450 cyclists were killed, 83% struck by motor vehicles. Those aged 65-plus comprised 44% of the total fatalities. While the UK is ranked consistently better than the EU average in road safety \u2013 its pedestrian death rate per million inhabitants is 8th-best out of the 28 EU nations \u2013 some of the trends in the ETSC report have alarmed campaigners. EU-wide over the period covered by the report, pedestrian deaths fell 2.6% on average each year, against a 3.1% annual reduction for people in motor vehicles. But the UK performed worst in this metric, rising on average by 1.3% a year. In contrast, countries such as Norway and Slovenia saw average annual drops of 9% and 8% respectively. On cycling, the UK was less of an outlier, with the 13th-best average annual drop in fatalities of 1.3% \u2013 but with the context that cycling rates have remained largely static in the UK in recent years, while rising in a number of other EU nations. Across the EU, cyclist deaths fell by just 0.4% on average each year. Beyond the 83% struck by motor vehicles, 16% of the fatalities were single-bike incidents, and 1% involved another cyclist. Comparisons over injuries are more difficult since not all nations compile equivalent figures. But the report found that across 21 EU nations, including the UK, the annual total for seriously injured cyclists was 28% higher in 2018 than in 2010. Governments in a number of countries are struggling with recent rises in casualties among pedestrians and cyclists, with possible explanations raised including distraction from phone use at the wheel, increased danger from large and heavy 4x4 vehicles, and the increasing sense of safety of being inside a car making drivers more reckless. Joshua Harris, head of campaigns for the road safety group Brake, said the study was \u201ca damning report that highlights the need for urgent government action to protect people cycling and walking in the UK\u201d. He said: \u201cWe need significantly increased investment in active travel, building more segregated cycle and foot paths, to give people safe and healthy ways to get around. \u201cThe government must also be bold in its approach to improving the safety of our existing road network, lowering default speed limits to 20mph in urban areas and reviewing rural road speed.\u201d",

West Suffolk Hospital\u2019s demand for fingerprints to track down a whistleblower \u2013 as revealed by the Guardian last month \u2013 was \u201cunprecedented and concerning\u201d, according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). This and a series of other failings around patient safety has led to the first ever relegation of a hospital from an \u201coutstanding\u201d status to \u201crequires improvement\u201d by CQC inspectors. The regulator\u2019s in-depth inspection was triggered after 10 separate whistleblowers from the hospital voiced alarm. When the CQC went in they found: Management and doctors at loggerheads and that had led to a damaging breakdown in relationships. What a senior doctor at the hospital called a \u201c\u2018them and us\u2019 situation\u201d. Tensions so great that they were affecting the running of the hospital\u2019s medical services. Staff \u201cfeared reprisals if they raised concerns\u201d. Widespread concern about \u201cbullying and harassment\u201d. The trust hired fingerprint and handwriting experts to track down the member of staff who had anonymously tipped off a family about medical blunders that had occurred before a patient \u2013 57-year-old Susan Warby \u2013 died. Staff felt the written demands for fingerprints was \u201cquite threatening in nature with a focus for apportioning blame\u201d, inspectors found. The heavy-handed tactics \u201chad far-reaching effects\u2026impacting on [staff] health and wellbeing, culture and morale of those involved\u201d. Executives were more focussed on who had sent the letter rather than why they had done so and whether the hospital\u2019s systems were strong enough to ensure patient safety, they added. The British Medical Association (BMA) said the CQC\u2019s findings were \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d and condemned the hospital\u2019s \u201ctoxic culture [and] bullying\u201d. \u201cDoctors should be able to raise genuine concerns, particularly where patient safety is at risk, without fear of retribution, said Dr Rob Harwood, chair of the BMA\u2019s consultants committee. \u201cIt is totally unacceptable that some staff have reported feeling threatened or blamed in relation to internal investigations.\u201d The CQC\u2019s conclusions raise awkward questions for Hancock about what he knew regarding the deep internal divisions, and demand for fingerprints, and what he did to redress the issues. Hancock, who has championed NHS whistleblowers\u2019 role in exposing lapses in care, is a keen admirer of Steve Dunn, the hospital\u2019s chief executive, who in 2018 was made a CBE for services to health and patient safety. Hancock has recused himself from a separate independent \u201crapid review\u201d of the hospital, ordered by his own department, after a series of revelations by the Guardian, because he is the MP for West Suffolk. Officials said his dual role meant he could not comment on the CQC\u2019s findings. In recent weeks the Guardian has reported how Hancock ignored concerns being raised about the hospital, including by some of its doctors, the trust was slow to correct a potentially fatal failure to monitor patients at risk of a burst aneurysm and a second family received a whistleblower tipoff about serious failings in the care of a loved one who later died. Relatives of Horace Nunn were not told of suspected mistakes in his care until two months after an injury in hospital that contributed to his death in July 2016. The Doctors\u2019 Association UK, which represents grassroots medics, said the findings \u2013 and the review, which NHS England is undertaking \u2013 should lead to changes in the hospital\u2019s leadership. \u201cWe do feel that this should raise questions for the health secretary. Despite previously committing to work with doctors on a Learn Not Blame culture in the NHS, Hancock appears to have stuck his head in the sand when clinicians have tried to raise concerns with him directly regarding patient safety issues. \u201cHis silence on this issue has been deafening, and will do little to reassure staff across the NHS that their concerns will be listened to.\u201d However, no changes to the hospital\u2019s leadership are planned, despite the CQC\u2019s report, the Guardian understands. Shortcomings in the quality of some of the care the hospital provides also played a key part in its spectacular fall from grace in the CQC ratings. Inspectors found problems in the hospital\u2019s maternity unit and served a warning notice on it demanding urgent improvements; there was a growing number of patients waiting longer than they should for cancer care, diagnostic tests and non-urgent treatment due to \u201ca lack of systemic waiting list control\u201d; and inspectors found that management and storage of medicines was \u201cinconsistent\u201d. However, the hospital has enough staff to do its job properly, said the CQC, which praised them highly. Sheila Childerhouse, the chair of the hospital\u2019s board, said: \u201cWe will be reviewing our culture and openness to make sure there is an environment where everyone \u2013 including our patients, our staff and our commissioners \u2013 has an opportunity to contribute and play a full part in our improvement.\u201d Dunn pledged to tackle the shortcomings identified by the CQC, including in its maternity care.

The report from The People\u2019s Pension, a provider with nearly five million members, said minority ethnic pensioners were, on average, 24% \u2013 or \u00a33,350 a year \u2013 worse off than other people their age. This is the difference in pension income for those who belong to an ethnic minority group compared to pensioners of a white ethnicity, and relates to 2017-18.

Many of the findings in the study are based on an analysis of a survey of more than 40,000 households carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions. The People\u2019s Pension report said the data showed that pension income inequality was a particular issue for Asian ethnic groups \u2013 where the gap was 30% \u2013 and for the \u201cblack African, Caribbean or black British\u201d groups, where the figure was just under 27%. The report also indicated that average pension incomes for one category \u2013 listed as \u201cother ethnic group (Arab, other ethnic group)\u201d \u2013 were 6% higher than for pensioners from white ethnic groups. The researchers said the ethnicity gap was driven by several factors, including lower average earnings, variable employment rates and the greater likelihood of minority ethnic workers being self-employed.

For example, DWP data showed that while 98% of white pensioner households received the state pension, it was 85% for Asian pensioner households. \u201cOur report highlights large inequalities, which will become starker as the growing ethnic minority population reaches retirement age,\u201d said Gregg McClymont, director of policy at The People\u2019s Pension, which is one of the biggest \u201cauto-enrolment\u201d pension providers with \u00a39bn of assets under management. He added: \u201cUnderstanding the size of the problem and causes is a vital first step in devising appropriate policies for closing the gap.\u201d",
