He confirmed such an option \u2013 which would allow the Premier League to charge directly for a \u201cPremflix\u201dchannel rather than sell the rights to TV companies \u2013 was on the table for the 2022-25 seasons. \u201cDuring the last process we spent quite a lot of time and invested a lot of recourse in building out our expertise and capacity in \u2018direct consumer\u2019,\u201d said Masters. \u201cWe considered whether it would be the right time to test a few markets and decided not to. But we are going to continue for the planning phase in the next commercial term to build out those capabilities.\u201d He added: \u201cWe were ready last time and we will be ready next time should the opportunity arise.\u201d The Premier League makes \u00a33.1bn a year from TV rights, of which \u00a31.4bn comes from foreign buyers.

Rose, 78, accepted a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation commissioned by MLB concluded he bet on games involving the Reds while he managed and played for the team. On Saturday, Trump tweeted: \u201cPete Rose played Major League Baseball for 24 seasons, from 1963-1986, and had more hits, 4,256, than any other player (by a wide margin). He gambled, but only on his own team winning, and paid a decades long price. GET PETE ROSE INTO THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME. It\u2019s Time!\u201d Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997 and met with then-commissioner Bud Selig in November 2002, but Selig never ruled on Rose\u2019s application. Manfred succeeded Selig in 2015, and Rose again applied unsuccessfully to end the ban. The switch hitter nicknamed Charlie Hustle, who is also MLB\u2019s all-time leader in games played (3,562) and at-bats (14,053), repeatedly denied betting on baseball until in his 2004 autobiography. But he subsequently reversed his stand and acknowledged he bet on the Reds while managing Cincinnati. At the time the ban agreement was announced, then-Commissioner A Bartlett Giamatti said: \u201cThe burden is entirely on Mr. Rose to reconfigure his life in a way he deems appropriate.\u201d The Hall of Fame\u2019s board of directors voted in 1991 to ban those on the permanently ineligible list from the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America ballot. A 17-time All-Star, Rose was the 1963 NL Rookie of the Year, 1973 MVP and 1975 World Series MVP. A three-time NL batting champion, he had 4,256 hits from 1963-86, topping the mark of 4,191 set by Ty Cobb from 1905-28.",

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones has lashed out at Scotland supporters for being disrespectful after England\u2019s head of performance, Neil Craig, was struck on the head by a beer bottle and Owen Farrell was repeatedly booed when kicking at goal. Craig was hit as England arrived at Murrayfield before their 13-6 victory. It is understood the Scottish Rugby Union apologised to the England management before kick-off. Jones was far from impressed, however, and equally incensed the crowd did not stay silent when Farrell was taking his kicks, as tradition dictates. He missed three penalties but scored eight points as England got their Six Nations back on track and England clinched the Calcutta Cup for the first time in three years. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting beer bottles to be thrown, that\u2019s a new trick,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good achievement, throwing beer bottles, you\u2019ve got to be brave to throw a beer bottle. Neil has a hard head, I know that, and there\u2019s not much inside it. He will be all right.\u201d Asked if England would be making a formal complaint, Jones added: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to do anything is it.

I wish it wasn\u2019t such a big deal, but this week shows it still is.\u201d",

They say there is clear evidence this is already being done by companies and organisations that have bought data from the DHSC, having identified individuals whose medical histories are of particular interest.</p> <p>Concerns that the data is not truly \u201canonymous\u201d have been raised by senior NHS officials, who believe the public are not being told the full truth. But the DHSC insists it only sells on information after thorough measures have been taken to ensure the complete anonymity and confidentiality of patients\u2019 personal information.</p> <p>In December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/07/nhs-medical-data-sales-american-pharma-lack-transparency\" title=\"\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/07/nhs-medical-data-sales-american-pharma-lack-transparency\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/07/nhs-medical-data-sales-american-pharma-lack-transparency\" title=\"\"> revealed </a>that the government had raised \u00a310m in 2018 by granting licences to commercial and academic organisations across the world that wanted access to so-called anonymised data. If patients do not want their data to be used for research they have to actively \u201copt out\u201d of the system at their GP surgery.</p> <p>Access to NHS data is increasingly sought by researchers and global drugs companies because it is one of the largest and most centralised public organisations of its kind in the world, with unique data resources.</p> <p>Washington has already made clear it wants unrestricted access to Britain\u2019s 55 million health records \u2013 estimated to have a total value of \u00a310bn a year \u2013 as part of any post-Brexit trade agreement. Leaked details of meetings between US and UK trade officials late last year showed that the acquisition of as much UK medical data as possible is a top priority for the US drugs industry.</p> <p>Now the DHSC and the agencies responsible for handling and selling data are increasingly under pressure to tighten up controls, to protect patient privacy and prevent information being misused.</p> <p>Asked if it was right to say that the patient data was anonymous, as claimed, Professor Eerke Boiten, director of the Cyber Technology Institute at De Montfort University in Leicester, said: \u201cThe answer is no, it is not anonymous.</p> <p>\u201cIf it is rich medical data about individuals then the richer that data is, the easier it is for people who are experts to reconstruct it and re-identify individuals.\u201d</p> <p>Boiten believes more thought should be given to controlling and limiting the sale of data to prevent it potentially being sold on by the initial purchaser to companies with huge information stores and global reach. \u201cIf Google, for instance, were to use this data and end up finding a cure for cancer, and then sold the cure back to the NHS for huge sums of money, then I think we could say we had missed a trick,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The NHS has previously faced claims that medical data from millions of patients has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/19/nhs-patient-data-available-companies-buy\" title=\"\">sold to insurance companies</a>.</p> <p>Phil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, which campaigns for the privacy of health data, said the public was being betrayed by claims that the information could not be linked back to individuals. \u201cRemoving or obscuring a few obvious identifiers, like someone\u2019s name or NHS number from the data, doesn\u2019t make their medical history anonymous,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, the unique combination of medical events that makes individuals\u2019 health data so ripe for exploitation is precisely what makes it so identifiable. Your medical record is like a fingerprint of your whole life.</p> <p>\u201cPatients must know how their data is used, and by who. Alleging their data is anonymous when it isn\u2019t, then selling it to drugs and tech companies \u2013 or, through intermediaries, to heaven knows who \u2013 is a gross betrayal of trust.

      "bodyText": "The Department of Health and Social Care has been selling the medical data of millions of NHS patients to American and other international drugs companies having misled the public into believing the information would be \u201canonymous\u201d, according to leading experts in the field. Senior NHS figures have told the Observer that patient data compiled from GP surgeries and hospitals \u2013 and then sold for huge sums for research \u2013 can routinely be linked back to individual patients\u2019 medical records via their GP surgeries. They say there is clear evidence this is already being done by companies and organisations that have bought data from the DHSC, having identified individuals whose medical histories are of particular interest. Concerns that the data is not truly \u201canonymous\u201d have been raised by senior NHS officials, who believe the public are not being told the full truth. But the DHSC insists it only sells on information after thorough measures have been taken to ensure the complete anonymity and confidentiality of patients\u2019 personal information. In December, the Observer revealed that the government had raised \u00a310m in 2018 by granting licences to commercial and academic organisations across the world that wanted access to so-called anonymised data. If patients do not want their data to be used for research they have to actively \u201copt out\u201d of the system at their GP surgery. Access to NHS data is increasingly sought by researchers and global drugs companies because it is one of the largest and most centralised public organisations of its kind in the world, with unique data resources. Washington has already made clear it wants unrestricted access to Britain\u2019s 55 million health records \u2013 estimated to have a total value of \u00a310bn a year \u2013 as part of any post-Brexit trade agreement. Leaked details of meetings between US and UK trade officials late last year showed that the acquisition of as much UK medical data as possible is a top priority for the US drugs industry. Now the DHSC and the agencies responsible for handling and selling data are increasingly under pressure to tighten up controls, to protect patient privacy and prevent information being misused. Asked if it was right to say that the patient data was anonymous, as claimed, Professor Eerke Boiten, director of the Cyber Technology Institute at De Montfort University in Leicester, said: \u201cThe answer is no, it is not anonymous. \u201cIf it is rich medical data about individuals then the richer that data is, the easier it is for people who are experts to reconstruct it and re-identify individuals.\u201d Boiten believes more thought should be given to controlling and limiting the sale of data to prevent it potentially being sold on by the initial purchaser to companies with huge information stores and global reach. \u201cIf Google, for instance, were to use this data and end up finding a cure for cancer, and then sold the cure back to the NHS for huge sums of money, then I think we could say we had missed a trick,\u201d he said. The NHS has previously faced claims that medical data from millions of patients has been sold to insurance companies. Phil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, which campaigns for the privacy of health data, said the public was being betrayed by claims that the information could not be linked back to individuals. \u201cRemoving or obscuring a few obvious identifiers, like someone\u2019s name or NHS number from the data, doesn\u2019t make their medical history anonymous,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, the unique combination of medical events that makes individuals\u2019 health data so ripe for exploitation is precisely what makes it so identifiable. Your medical record is like a fingerprint of your whole life. \u201cPatients must know how their data is used, and by who. Alleging their data is anonymous when it isn\u2019t, then selling it to drugs and tech companies \u2013 or, through intermediaries, to heaven knows who \u2013 is a gross betrayal of trust. People who are rightly concerned about such guile and lack of respect have every right to opt out, if they want their and their family\u2019s medical information kept confidential and for their own care.\u201d Licences to buy data are issued by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), part of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). A spokesman said any information sold had been \u201canonymised in accordance with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) anonymisation code of practice\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The lawyer for Lt Col Alexander Vindman condemned Donald Trump on Saturday for making \u201cobviously false statements\u201d about the decorated military veteran, after the president defended sacking him through several critical tweets. Ambassador David Pressman, who represents Vindman, said: \u201cThe president this morning made a series of obviously false statements concerning Lt Col Vindman; they conflict with the clear personnel record and the entirety of the impeachment record of which the president is well aware.\u201d He went on: \u201cWhile the most powerful man in the world continues his campaign of intimidation, while too many entrusted with political office continue to remain silent, Lt Col Vindman continues his service to our country as a decorated, active duty member of our military.\u201d Pressman\u2019s statement came several hours after Trump said that the \u201cFake News @CNN &amp; MSDNC keep talking about \u2018Lt Col\u2019 Vindman as though I should think only how wonderful he was. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know him, never spoke to him, or met him (I don\u2019t believe!) but, he was very insubordinate, reported contents of my \u2018perfect\u2019 calls incorrectly, &amp;\u2026\u201d The next tweet from Trump said Vindman \u201cwas given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, \u2018OUT\u2019.\u201d Vindman was a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, delivering damaging testimony despite Trump\u2019s opposition to the proceedings. While Vindman, a Ukraine expert and Purple Heart recipient, was set to rotate out of his national security council (NSC) post this summer, he was abruptly axed and escorted out of the White House on Friday. Vindman\u2019s twin brother \u2013 who was not an impeachment witness \u2013 was also booted from his job on the NSC, reports said. Gordon Sondland, who also provided testimony in the inquiry, was sacked from his post as US ambassador to the EU just hours after Vindman\u2019s firing.",

This one took longer to write,\u201d Stoppard, 82, will say on Tuesday when he is interviewed by John Wilson on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Front Row. \u201cAnd the other thing is, what on earth can you write about after that? When I finished <em>Leopoldstadt </em>I thought, \u2018I can\u2019t go through all that again\u2019. Four years tend to go by between my plays, so I will be 86 or 87 before I write another, and I wondered whether people who are 87 do have plays on. It seemed a bit implausible,\u201d said the writer of the critically acclaimed <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/05/travesties-review-tom-hollander-tom-stoppard-patrick-marber\" title=\"\">Travesties</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/31/the-real-thing-review-ewan-mcgregor-maggie-gyllenhaal-tom-stoppard\" title=\"\">The Real Thing</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/08/rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead-review-daniel-radcliffe-stoppard-old-vic-london\" title=\"\">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</a></em>.</p> <p>Inspired by his own Jewish heritage, the new play is directed by fellow playwright Patrick Marber.</p> <p>It centres on the Jewish quarter of Vienna that gives the play its name, as fascism rises across Europe and threatens the newly found security of its inhabitants. The topic proved unexpectedly emotional for Stoppard, he admits.</p> <p>\u201cIt stole up on me. I didn\u2019t think, \u2018I must finish this off and have people sobbing\u2019, but in the end I was sobbing myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel a bit foolish sitting there and I have to stop myself making a public spectacle of myself, crying at my own play.

      "bodyText": "Sir Tom Stoppard, Britain\u2019s most celebrated living playwright, believes he may have written his last play. Leopoldstadt, which opens in London\u2019s West End on 12 February, telling the story of a Jewish family in Vienna as the 20th century begins, is the work that has moved him most, and, he will reveal this week, may mark his final contribution to theatre. \u201cI am slowing up. This one took longer to write,\u201d Stoppard, 82, will say on Tuesday when he is interviewed by John Wilson on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Front Row. \u201cAnd the other thing is, what on earth can you write about after that? When I finished Leopoldstadt I thought, \u2018I can\u2019t go through all that again\u2019. Four years tend to go by between my plays, so I will be 86 or 87 before I write another, and I wondered whether people who are 87 do have plays on. It seemed a bit implausible,\u201d said the writer of the critically acclaimed Travesties, The Real Thing and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. Inspired by his own Jewish heritage, the new play is directed by fellow playwright Patrick Marber. It centres on the Jewish quarter of Vienna that gives the play its name, as fascism rises across Europe and threatens the newly found security of its inhabitants. The topic proved unexpectedly emotional for Stoppard, he admits. \u201cIt stole up on me. I didn\u2019t think, \u2018I must finish this off and have people sobbing\u2019, but in the end I was sobbing myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel a bit foolish sitting there and I have to stop myself making a public spectacle of myself, crying at my own play. I mean, I wrote it. I ought to have some sort of writer\u2019s objectivity. It has not happened before. Honestly, nothing I have written has had that effect on me.\u201d It was not until the early 1990s that Stoppard discovered the extent of his Jewish heritage and the death of many relatives in Nazi concentration camps. After the war, his mother married her second husband, a British army officer, and moved to England from Singapore to start a new life. \u201cI once asked my mother to write down what she remembered and she said \u2018wrongly or rightly, I decided to draw a line and never looked back\u2019. So she never practised as a Jew.\u201d Stoppard finally heard the truth from the daughter of one of his mother\u2019s cousins. \u201cShe said, \u2018What do you mean, how Jewish are you? You are Jewish!\u2019\u201d He discovered that his mother\u2019s sisters and all four of his grandparents had been killed. \u201cThe thing that I feel I still need to explain to myself, let alone to anyone else, is that I didn\u2019t go up to [my mother] and say, \u2018what is all this about then?\u2019 I felt she would feel I was rebuking her. \u201cShe had her own reasons for not talking about it. And so we never did talk about it in any comprehensive or deep way, which I think I regret now.\u201d The playwright also tells Wilson that at the time he started to plan the play in 2017, discussion of antisemitism had not yet returned as a current political issue. \u201cI did not sniff the air and say to myself, \u2018Now is the time for a play that celebrates the costs of being a Jew.\u2019\u201d",

Nigel Pearson\u2019s new manager bounce has slowed a little and his team are second-bottom after two defeats. If he is to enjoy his solo walks up Snowdonia and Scafell Pike during his own winter break next week, he will want a win here and three points to pull Graham Potter\u2019s Brighton back into the mire. <br><br>Brighton have rather quietly slipped back into trouble by not having won any of their last five matches, and they are in a worse position than they were this time last year under Chris Hughton, two points off the bottom three. There does, though, seem to be faith in the able and very likeable Potter and his Britpop tonsorial style. It will take time to change a team\u2019s outlook and if Albion can survive, then the future may be bright beyond that. <br><br><strong>Kick-off is 5.30pm, UK time.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s Paul MacInnes\u2019s report from the Amex. Graham Potter speaks, through a crossed line with Jonathan Pearce counting from one to ten. It was great strike but I thought we pushed and pushed and I was really delighted with the spirit we showed. I thought we did really well in the game. We look to our next game, Sheffield United and we have a break now. I will have a little break, spend some time away with the family and recharge. Shane Duffy has been speaking to Brighton\u2019s media team. A telling stat here. Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 speaks In the first game of the season I scored an own-goal and I wanted to score. We are a little disappointed and we carry on and we fight until the end. I score more goals and it helps the team. The team is the most important. We were unlucky to concede a goal, it\u2019s happened a lot this season. The lads did a good job and it was unlucky in the end. Ben Foster speaks. Watford\u2019s next matches are Manchester United and Liverpool. The way the goal went in was very disappointing. He isn\u2019t trying to score an own-goal, that\u2019s football sometimes. They threw it all at us, the back eight, if you like, and they stood strong through it. We dropped, and that\u2019s a symptom of where we are in the league. It\u2019s human nature, we have a massive scrap on our hands. We have already beaten Manchester United and we did well at Liverpool; we have no fear whatsoever. Brighton should be the happier after their second-half improvement. Watford will think they chucked this one away, but they tired and Adrian Mariappa\u2019s own-goal came as they were put under serious pressure. 90+4 min: March gets a yellow card for some petulance after being penalised for fouling a defender holding the ball in the corner. Ben Foster takes his time over the goal kick, plenty of time. 90+2 min: Mooy in the corner, and Trossard, try their best to force a chance but Watford are back in numbers. 90+1 min: Five minutes added, with some questions to be asked where they came from. 90 min: There are still three points up for grabs, but only one team looks to be chasing them, and that\u2019s Brighton. Mooy and Trossard try to link up but Watford sit back in numbers. Jahanbakhsh plays in Trossard but the Belgian\u2019s touch is loose and he balloons over. 87 min: Watford look tired, and to be hanging on for a draw that is useful but not what they wanted. Capoue\u2019s shot shows off their fatigue. 86 min: Mat Ryan\u2019s long pass finds Trossard and the Belgian almost conjures a chance. It\u2019s last-ditch stuff to get it clear. Welbeck is on, with Deulofeu making way. Welbeck is not yet 30, it might be mentioned. 85 min: Danny Welbeck, a player of genuine quality, is an imminent sub. Watford are far more in need of a winner than Brighton, remember. 83 min: More Deeney rage as Deulofeu fails to read his flick-on. Watford a little ragged but still possess some danger. 82 min: First Watford change. Nigel Pearson and Craig Shakespeare swap Pereyra for Pussetto, their recent signing. 81 min: Watford rested on their laurels, and paid the price. Troy Deeney set to be even more angrier than he was before. 80 min: That Watford margin for error proved far too narrow, and now it\u2019s Brighton who fancy the win. Jahanbakhsh lashes a ball across goal and the Watford defender lashes it into his own net. He feared Glenn Murray behind him and fell into a moment of madness. 77 min: Big chance for Brighton! Trossard lays the ball off to Mooy, whose shot is true but Ben Foster makes a fine save with his left leg. 76 min: It\u2019s Watford with the impetus now, with Brighton a little shapeless with all those attacking players on the field. Doucoure takes on a chance to score from distance but lightning will not strike twice for him. 74 min: A break in play as Adam Masina has a shoulder problem but he looks as if he might be alright to play on. Watford have taken their time over it. 73 min: Off goes Schelotto, and on comes Jahanbakhsh the Iranian winger. Graham Potter is going for broke. 72 min: Brighton\u2019s flurry after all those subs seems to have abated. This a big last 20 minutes for both teams here. 70 min: Watford, rather uncharacteristically, play the ball too much - do an Arsenal walking of the ball into the net - and make a mess of a good chance. Then, the ball fails to get to Deeney, whose anger is audible when Masina does not find him with a pass. The pass looked difficult, and that seemed a little harsh from the captain. 69 min: Nice move from Brighton. Flick from Trossard finds Mooy and his cross is a diagonal that Murray fails to get to. They are getting closer. 68 min: Watford have been solid but their margin for error is small. Nigel Pearson is in arm-folding mode, and is prowling the touchline. 66 min: Mariappa booked now, and for a late tackle on Solly March by the touchline. Trossard\u2019s free-kick is blasted across rather than placed and then cleared. 64 min: Watford now looking harried and pressured. It\u2019s Brighton who are doing the unsettling. Hughes fouls Maupay and is booked for a tactical foul. A free-kick is launched from the left-hand side, with Trossard chipping forward. Watford are solid under that and the ball is cleared. It keeps, though, coming back at Watford. 62 min: Second Brighton sub: Alzate on for the somewhat negligible Gross. 61 min: There is a hint that Brighton have finally found some flow, though the fans in the stand sound restless. Watford are sitting back on this, and with quite a long time to go that\u2019s a risky strategy. 60 min: Mooy and Trossard link up play, which hasn\u2019t happened enough, but it\u2019s too far out of goal. Watford are compressing the play at both ends. 58 min: Deulofeu is given far too much space, and shoots wide. Pascal Gross had offered him the freedom of Falmer. 57 min: And that sub is made, with Maupay making it two up front. Solly March will now play at left-back. Potter is an adept manager when it comes to in-game alterations. Chelsea were on the end of that on New Year\u2019s Day. 56 min: More Brighton pressure with not much threat involved, and Neal Maupay is coming on, with Dan Burn to be relieved of his touchline-hugging duties. 54 min: Brighton weave some pretty patterns, and struggle to find a space. Graham Potter is in deep discussion with his bench. They agonise as Schelotto fires across goal and Murray cannot reach the ball. 53 min: Burn, in his role as a Brighton\u2019s answer to Roberto Carlos, pings in a cross that Cathcart deals with and with some ease. 51 min: Brighton again pushed back by Watford\u2019s pressing game. Their best hope is that Watford tire later on as they have a manacle on the match at present. 49 min: Etienne Capoue goes down, looks in pain and then stages a miraculous recovery. 48 min: JR in Illinois has a pertinent question. \u201cI\u2019m no tactical soccer expert but is the best use of Dan Burn really to have him glued to the left touchline sending in crosses?\u201d To be fair, until his recent injury, he had done well in that position, but he is also the man who headed away 900 Manchester United crosses when a Fulham player in 2014 and David Moyes was melting down. 47 min: Stats corner. Doucoure has become an important player in Nige\u2019s Red Adair act. 46 min: Ok, we are back underway and Brighton have plenty to do. They have never won a Premier League home game when 1-0 down at half-time in the Premier League. Poor from Brighton, far better from Watford, who took their chance well through Doucoure. Their pressing game drove Graham Potter\u2019s team to distraction and stopped their passing game working. Plenty of work to be done at half-time. 44 min: More Brighton wobbles as Watford push up on them. This time it\u2019s Dan Burn who look panicked. Up the other end, March makes a mess of pass and when it eventually gets to Trossard he hoofs the ball into the stands to deserved jeers. 42 min: Penalty shout? Schelotto goes down from a challenge from Deulofeu that was barely a challenge. VAR gets its job done quickly and there will be no penalty. There is insurrection in the Sussex air but the truth is that the Brighton defender made a meal of it. 40 min: More panic from Brighton as Deeney almost whips the ball off the feet of Duffy. And the fans getting restless when a ball hit forward doesn\u2019t have a single home player chasing it. Glenn Murray\u2019s lack of speed and numbers around him mean Brighton are not presenting much of a threat. 38 min: A rare touch for Trossard on the left flank, and he almost makes a chance for Murray but Cathcart is excellent again in clearing the danger. 37 min: Shane Duffy dithers and Deeney is all over him, the Watford press causing real problems. Brighton get the ball clear, but they have been unnerved. 36 min: First booking of the match goes to Schelotto, for a foul on Deulofeu. It\u2019s a soft one, and puts pressure on the full-back. 35 min: Peter Oh writes in: \u201cStrong suckerpunch quality to Docoure\u2019s goal. Brighton had strung together a sequence of combinations under pressure to neatly play out of their defensive third, but Mooy\u2019s attempt to split two opponents and get the ball into the final third was blocked and Watford stormed the other way.\u201d Exactly right. 33 min: Solly March is the man most likely to make something happen for Brighton but this time the move comes from the other side of the field. It requires Cathcart, a free transfer who has provided great service to Watford, to nod calmly back to his keeper to avert the danger. 31 min: March scampers to the byline, and Schelotto swings his leg at the ball. That\u2019s better from Brighton. 30 min: Close again from Watford. Deulofeu gets down the left, and sets up Hughes, whose shot is deflected behind the goal. Dunk heads away the corner but he has to deal with another. Deeney gets a snap-shot of a chance but can\u2019t trouble Ryan with his shot. 29 min: A waste from Schelotto, as he wellies a cross straight into the hands of Ben Foster. 28 min: Watford look good for the win here, and not like a team second-bottom of the league. Nothing really coming off for Brighton. 26 min: Brighton carve a half-chance. Mooy smashes over, and looks as disappointed as he might. He was culpable in that Doucoure goal, too. 25 min: Schelotto\u2019s dart down the flank is stopped by a rampaging Capoue challenge. Watford now baring their teeth in the style of their manager, who was actually quite a decent, classy player under all the brawn. 24 min: Watford\u2019s fans really enjoying themselves here, and why not? A fun night in Brighton and a Thameslink home await, National Rail permitting. 22 min: So, what can Brighton find? They had been the better team, and more likely to score. They will persevere with their passing game but it will be a worry for Graham Potter that they were picked off so easily. 20 min: Doucoure\u2019s goal reminded of a Yaya Toure stride through midfield and finish. Powerful, skilful and a precise and powerful finish. It came from nothing, a charging run and he surges on and then wallops it past Ryan. A fine goal, completely unbefitting of what came before. 17 min: The excellent Ian Darke, commentating on BT, reminds that Graham Potter played in the Southampton 6-3 Manchester United game from 1996, as mentioned in number 5 here. That also means that Potter must have been at The Dell when Ali Dia, the king of all listicles, was there. 16 min: Solly March looks to be the player most likely to, and he sets up a move which allows Mooy to try and send Glenn Murray on at goal, only for the veteran striker to be stopped in his tracks. 14 min: This has few signs of being a relegation six-point classic. Both teams look to be yearning for their week off in Dubai, the Maldives or Skegness. 12 min: Will Hughes stops Trossard sending Gross away. But then March, given time, zings in an angled ball, which Murray climbs towards though Kabasele\u2019s intervention prevents him getting a true contact on the ball. 10 min: Propper caught in possession but Deulofeu cannot get away without committing a foul. Neither side showing much confidence in possession, which suggests nerves. 9 min: Both Capoue and Murray down after an accidental clash between them but they are ok to carry on. 7 min: Mat Ryan launches the ball long and Watford can deal with that kind of stuff all day. The early flashes petering out already? Not a good sign. Nigel looks pensive. 6 min: Watford look a little sluggish, not what we have come to expect from a team coached by Nigel Pearson, who seemed relaxed in the preliminaries, in that rather wry fashion of his. 4 min: Brighton with all the vigour and rigour so far. Watford having to get through some heavy defensive work, though they have dealt well with set pieces so far. 3 min: March\u2019s corner causes trouble and Troy Deeney has to head behind. The second loops over, and Propper attempts a volley that comes off Hughes midriff, but not the hand that Watford were claiming. VAR says no. 1 min: It starts with some rather loose stuff from both teams before Mooy and Trossard link up, Dan Burn, er, burns down the left before the ball comes across to March and his shot is blocked for a corner. Ok, we are go...no sign of the storm that has hit the Scotland v England Six Nations game as yet. That comes tomorrow. The teams are out and the music is playing. This Is the Day...This Is the Hour...This Is This! Nigel Pearson speaks I think it\u2019s really about trying to refocus on what has got us some success. The most important thing is that we function as well as we can, we work hard and on top of that we need to be expressive when he have the ball. Graham Potter speaks It was really important point; we played well in the second half versus West Ham. It doesn\u2019t count for anything now, we start again. [On Nigel Pearson] He\u2019s done really well, it\u2019s a team with a lot of talent that\u2019s not had the best of seasons so far. There\u2019s been a couple of managerial changes which can happen. Big game for Mat Ryan, who has been raising cash, along with Aaron Mooy, old pal and teammate for the Australian bushfires fund. Four places but just three points between Watford and Brighton. This is a must-win game for Mad King Nigel. Troy Deeney is a real football man. What does those teams signify? For Brighton, Shane Duffy and Big Dan Burn return from injury to start in two of four changes from the side that drew 3-3 with West Ham. Ezequiel Schelotto comes in as full-back as the long-serving Solly March returns as Martin Montoya, Adam Webster, Bernardo and Dale Stephens drop out. Watford have made just one change from the team beaten 3-2 by Everton. Nathaniel Chalobah drops to the bench with Will Hughes replacing him. Simon Burnton spoke to a Watford player with a real - and harrowing - tale to tell. Paul Doyle wrote this week about the new Brighton - not New Brighton, which is an entirely different matter. Brighton: Ryan, Duffy, Dunk, Burn, Schelotto, Propper, Mooy, March, Gross, Murray, Trossard. Subs: Maupay, Webster, Jahanbakhsh, Button, Bernardo, Connolly, Alzate. Watford: Foster, Mariappa, Kabasele, Cathcart, Masina, Doucoure, Capoue, Pereyra, Hughes, Deulofeu, Deeney. Subs: Gomes, Dawson, Welbeck, Chalobah, Gray, Holebas, Pussetto. Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire) While much of the rest of the Premier League is sunning itself in Dubai, here\u2019s a relegation six-pointer for you. Nigel Pearson\u2019s new manager bounce has slowed a little and his team are second-bottom after two defeats. If he is to enjoy his solo walks up Snowdonia and Scafell Pike during his own winter break next week, he will want a win here and three points to pull Graham Potter\u2019s Brighton back into the mire. Brighton have rather quietly slipped back into trouble by not having won any of their last five matches, and they are in a worse position than they were this time last year under Chris Hughton, two points off the bottom three. There does, though, seem to be faith in the able and very likeable Potter and his Britpop tonsorial style. It will take time to change a team\u2019s outlook and if Albion can survive, then the future may be bright beyond that. Kick-off is 5.30pm, UK time. Join me.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Malaysian health authorities first revealed the virus\u2019s link to the conference when they confirmed the case of a 41-year-old Malaysian who had attended it alongside colleagues from China, according to the <em>New Straits Times</em>.</p> \n<p>South Korea has confirmed that two of its nationals who attended the conference also have the virus.

      "bodyText": "Ellis Genge scored the decisive try as England edged a tense encounter played in truly appalling conditions at Murrayfield. Eddie Jones speaks: \u201cI think it gave us the confidence to play the way we knew we\u2019d have to play,\u201d he says of his decision to have six forwards on the bench. \u201cIt was a classic Calcutta Cup game, with a swirling wind and a crowd who didn\u2019t have much manners. I thought you were supposed to respect the kicker.\u201d He is clearly unimpressed with those in the crowd who booed Owen Farrell as he was lining up kicks at goal. Ellis Genge speaks: Asked to describe his match-winning try he says: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember. It happened about 20 minutes ago.\u201d He then goes on quite the rant about media critics writing the team and Eddie Jones off after England lost last week. Gregor Townsend speaks: \u201cTo show what we did for the first 15 or 20 minutes in the second half was excellent,\u201d Scotland\u2019s head coach tells the BBC. \u201cThere was just that moment when England got in our 22 and got over. You\u2019re better not having the ball in those conditions and getting points is very difficult.\u201d Scotland\u2019s captain speaks: \u201cWe\u2019re gutted with that,\u201d says Stuart Hogg, looking on the verge of death from hypothermia. \u201cThe same as last week, I\u2019m proud of the boys\u2019 efforts but these things happen. We\u2019ve done some good things in the past two games, but we\u2019re here to win Test matches and so far we haven\u2019t done that.\u201d Owen Farrell lifts the Calcutta Cup: He and his team-mates look like they can\u2019t wait to escape to the sanctuary of the showers, but he does his duty and then summons the rest of the troops to pose for photos in the middle of the almost empty stadium. Sam Underhill speaks: \u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t the prettiest of things but it probably came down to game management and things went our way,\u201d he tells the BBC, as the perspex advertising hoarding behind him wobbles worryingly in the wind. England secure the win! They keep their Six Nations hopes alive, while Scotland\u2019s are all but over. It was an intriguing, error-strewn game played in awful conditions and could have gone either way, but England did just enough to secure the win. 80 min Scotland 6-13 England: We\u2019re in the final minute and Scotland need a converted try to draw this game. England are in possession, however and Ellis Genge tries to bulldoze his way up the field. The clock is in the red zone ... 78 min: Adam Hastings slots over a penalty to give Scotland faint hope, while Brian Moore awards the Man of the Match gong to England\u2019s No7 Sam Underhill. 77 min Scotland 3-13 England: Farrell, assisted by Genge again, makes no mistake. England lead by 10 points. 77 min Scotland 3-10 England: Blair Kinghorn drops a high ball and England win possession on the Scotland 22. Ben Youngs pops up a pass and Ben Earl, on off the bench, crashes into the tackle. England win a penalty straight in front of the posts on the Scotland 22. If this goes over, you\u2019d think the jig is up for Scotland. 74 min Scotland 3-10 England: Scotland are in possession just inside their own half. Ali Price attempts a box-kick which is practically blown back into his arms. Another kick from Price sails out on the full. Scotland line-out on the halfway line. 73 min Scotland 3-10 England: Joe Launchbury comes on for England, replacing George Kruis. 70 min Relentless pressure from England after a solid scrum.Their forwards drive over and Ellis Genge looks to have grounded it one-handed, ably assisted by additional shoving from Tom Curry and Maro Itoje. It\u2019s his second try for England and the extras are duly added. 68 min Scotland 3-3 England: Stuart Hogg tries to pick the ball up under his own posts but it\u2019s like a bar of soap and slips out of his grasp. He drops on the ball with his midriff, before it squirms out from under him and Owen Farrell touches down. The TMO decides Hogg carried the ball over the line before grounding it and the referee awards a five-metre scrum to England. 67 min Scotland 3-3 England: In the BBC commentary box, Brian Moore doesn\u2019t think much of Ellis Genge\u2019s attempt to holkd the ball up on the tee for that most recent kick. The prop took his finger off the ball before Farrell kicked it, but Moore, who used to do the job in his day, says you need to keep your finger on it, but not with so much pressure that you affect the trajectory of the ball. 64 min Scotland 3-3 England: England win a penalty after Scotland are penalised for wheeling the scrum more than 90 degrees. Ordinarily, it would be a piece of cake for Owen Farrell, but this looks tricky in these horrible conditions. Ellis Genge is delegated to lie down on his stomach and hold the ball up on the tee with his finger, in the old school style. Farrell pulls the penalty wide and the scores remain level. 62 min Scotland 3-3 England: Youngs kicks the ball long towasrds the Scotland 22, where Sean Maitland gathers allow it to squirm out of his grasp in the tackle. England have possession in the Scotland 22. Scotland have replaced their props, with Allan Dell and Simon Berghan coming on. 61 min Scotland 3-3 England: Scotland lose their seventh line-out of the game and Ben Youngs, on for Willi Heinz presumably, kicks for touch. He gets a sarcastic round of applause from the crowd as the ball bounces on its way out. 59 min Scotland 3-3 England: Scotland winger Sean Maitland gets behind George Ford to field a high ball, but knocks it on. England scrum halfway between the Scotland 22 and the halfway line. Elliot Daly kicks for touch and the ball sails out on the full again. The conditions are terrible, but the English players don\u2019t seem to be adapting particularly well. 58 min Scotland 3-3 England: England keep kicking the ball out for touch on the full from tight angles, the wind repeatedly getting the better of them. 57 min Scotland 3-3 England: Elliot Daly kicks for touch from inside his own 22 after England win a penalty. Ellis Genge comes off the bench and Mako Vunipola gets to put his feet up. 56 min Scotland 3-3 England: More changes for Scotland: Chris Harris replaces outside centre Huw Jones. Ben Toolis comes on for second-row Scott Cummings. 54 min Scotland 3-3 England: Brilliant play from Hogg, who takes the ball in hand, ducks and dodges his way past two England defenders, turns Jonathan Joseph inside-out and then sends a low grubber kick out over the line. Courtney Lawes is on for England, in place of Lewis Ludlam in the back row. Scotland reserve hooker Stuart Mcinally is on for Fraser Brown. 51 min Scotland 3-3 England: England clear their lines with a long kick and Scotland have a line-out. Fraser Brown\u2019s throw-in looks as crooked as a ram\u2019s horn, but referee Pascal Gauzere let\u2019s it go. England hooker Jamie George has had a few questionable throw-ins go unpenalised too. 49 min Scotland 3-3 England: Confusion and slapstick reigns in the English ranks as they struggle to control and deal with a fly-kick in behind. Jonny May eventually hacks it out of play, as Scotland appear to have the upper hand for the first time in this match. 47 min Scotland 3-3 England: An England line-out on the halfway line. Willi Heinz kicks long, but his kick for touch goes out on the full . He raises a hand by way of apology to his team-mates. Scotland line-out just inside the England half. 46 min Scotland 3-3 England: Adam Hastings bisects the post with a decent kick from a fairly straightforward position, albeit in ludicrously difficult conditions. It\u2019s all square at Murrayfield. 44 min Scotland 0-3 England: Hamish Watson tunnels his way through a thicket of legs to within five or six yards from the English line. Scotland win a penalty just to the right of the posts after Sam Underhill fails to release the ball. They\u2019re going to go for the points. 43 min Scotland 0-3 England: Scotland have the ball under the English posts, about seven yards from the try line. They move through the phases in the face of defiant English tackling. 42 min Scotland 0-3 England: More pressure from Scotland as they try to crash through the English defence. England are punished, Kyle Sinckler the culprit for not rolling away from the tackle and Scotland have a penalty in the English 22. They ought to kick for the corner or ask for a scrum. The opt for the former option and win themselves a line-out. 41 min Scotland 0-3 England: Sutherland the loose head prop breaks through the English defence and charges into the England 22, getting Scotland\u2019s fans on their feet. 41 min: After a first half in which the ball was kicked a total of 36 times \u2013 just under once a minute \u2013 play resumes. The wind is still blowing a gale and the rain is pelting down from the heavens. I remember, as a kid, playing rugby in those kind of conditions and it was a thoroughly miserable experience. England kick off with the wind at their back. Earlier this afternoon, Ireland beat Wales in Dublin, earning themselves a bonus point in the process. Paul Rees was there for the Guardian. England lead by the most slender of margins. In filthy, incredibly difficult conditions, England lead by Owen Farrell\u2019s penalty after 10 minutes. \u201cThe playbook has been ripped up and it\u2019s about thinking on your feet,\u201d says BBC pundit Jeremy Guscott. \u201cIt\u2019s not had structure, it\u2019s not had shape,\u201d says Martin Johnson, who is sitting alongside him. 40+1 min Scotland 0-3 England: England are penalised for an early push in the scrum and Scotland have a free-kick. In their subsequent surge up the field, Huw Jones is penalised for a knock on. 40 min Scotland 0-3 England: Scottish hooker Fraser Brown is penalised after his line-out throw-in fails to go five metres. Sloppy from Scotland - the wind isn\u2019t that strong. 38 min Scotland 0-3 England: England line-out on the Scotland 22. There\u2019s not a lot in this game, on the field or the scoreboard, but England\u2019s superiority is quite apparent. George Ford tries with a fairly ambitious attempt at a drop goal, but sends his effort wide. It was worth having a go as he didn\u2019t miss by much. 37 min Scotland 0-3 England: Scotland scrum, just outside their own 22. Hastings boots the ball long and Jonny May catches it comfortably. England are in possession on the halfway line. 35 min Scotland 0-3 England: Hogg tries and fails to find touch in the corner and Jonny May boots it back into the Scotland half. 34 min Scotland 0-3 England: The ball\u2019s kicked high, but Stuart Hogg catches reasonably tidily under his own posts. He\u2019s tackled, but feeds the ball to Adam Hastings, who finds touch with a long kick. 33 min Scotland 0-3 England: A handling error from Fraser Brown, who drops the ball, giving England a scrum. 31 min Scotland 0-3 England: Referee Pascal Gauzere gives both sets of forwards another lecture as he resets the scrum. Scotland win their own scrum and Ali Price sends Blair Kinghorn on his way again. 29 min Scotland 0-3 England: Adam Hastings catches an attempt to kick for the touchline from George Ford and finds touch on the halfway line. Jamie George is penalised for not throwing the ball in straight. \u201cThat\u2019s my bad, lads,\u201d he says by way of apology to his team-mates. The ball is soaking wet and the wind is high, which is making life difficult for the hookers at line-out time. 29 min Scotland 0-3 England: Not for the first time this evening, Scotland lose their own line-out, gifting possession to England. 27 min Scotland 0-3 England: The wind gets the better of Owen Farrell again. He pushes his penalty attempt wide of the far upright. 24 min Scotland 0-3 England: Elliot Daly gallops down the left flank with ball in hand, before being tackled by Ali Price. England subsequently win a penalty when Sam Underhill wins his side a penalty. 24 min Scotland 0-3 England: A long, long kick from Ali Price almost sails over the head of Jonny May in his own 22, but the England winger leaps to catch athletically. 22 min Scotland 0-3 England: A high kick from Ford hangs in the wind, but Adam Hastings catches comfortably when it eventually deigns to drop from the sky. 21 min Scotland 0-3 England: Scotland win a penalty just inside their own half and Zander Ferguson drives forward. Moments later, Kinghorn makes about 20 metres with a powerful run, but England stop him in his tracks turn it over again. 20 min Scotland 0-3 England: The weather at Murrayfield is getting increasingly foul, the rain now hammering down and the wind blowing hard. 17 min Scotland 0-3 England: Referee Pascal Gauzere orders a re-set, muttering something about \u201cpre-engaging\u201d to the forwards from both teams. After another re-set, England are awarded a free kick. I have no idea why and on the BBC commentary team, former England hooker Brian Moore hasn\u2019t either. 16 min Scotland 0-3 England: Scotland have the ball 10 yards from the England line. The maul collapses and England are given the scrum. 14 min Scotland 0-3 England: George Ford kicks for touch from the middle of the park, but his kick into the wind doesn\u2019t travel too far before bobbling over the touchline. 12 min Scotland 0-3 England: A high ball from Willi Heinz is fielded on the touchline by Kinghorn. Scotland have the ball and Magnus Bradbury takes it towards the English 22. He\u2019s brought to ground and play goes back to the halfway line for a Scottish penalty. A high tackle by Maro Itoje on Heinz earns them the kick, but it wasn\u2019t serious enough to merit a yellow card. 10 min Scotland 0-3 England: Scott Cummings is penalised for not rolling away from the tackle and England win another penalty in a similar(ish) area to the last one but much nearer the posts. Farrell decides to take it on and makes no mistake this time. 9 min Scotland 0-0 England: Kicking into the wind, Farrell\u2019s penalty attempt fails to reach the posts and was drifting wide of the far post anyway. Blair Kinghorn catches it and kicks away. 8 min Scotland 0-0 England: England win a penalty when Scott Cummings commits some manner of infringement or other at the breakdown. I think he went off his feet. Owen Farrell is going for the three points about 40 metres out, 10 metres the far touchline. 6 min Scotland 0-0 England: Elliot Daly looks to be offside on the touchline as he waits under a highball from Owen Farrell, but plays go on. The ball goes out for a Scotland line-out 10 metres from their own 22. 5 min Scotland 0-0 England: After taking a big hit while fielding the ball from the kick-off, Jonny May ships another one from Blair Kinghorn. 4 min Scotland 0-0 England: Another penalty for England as Scotland fail to move when ordered to by the referee during a line-out. The ball\u2019s hoisted high in the air and almost blows backwards. England are playing into a strong wind. 2 min Scotland 0-0 England: Scotland head into double figures as they go through the phases, but don\u2019t make much ground. This is stout defending from England, who win a penalty deep inside their own half. 1 min Scotland 0-0 England: Scotland are in possession on the edge of the English 22 with Zander Fagerson in possession. Maro Itoje brings him to ground. 1 min Scotland 0-0 England: Scotland get the ball in the air and play is under way. Flower of Scotland: The pipers stop midway through Scotland\u2019s anthem, leaving it to the crowd to do the remaining heavy lifting. As is customary, they do their team proud. Kick-off is just moments away. Correction: The wind has materialised and despite their tight fit, the tracksuit tops of the England players are visibly flapping as they stand for their anthem. The weather: The flags in the stadium are flapping in the wind, but not too vigorously. The awful weather forecast earlier in the week hasn\u2019t materialised ... yet although winds of over 50 miles per hour are still expected before the evening is out. Not long now: Stuart Hogg and Owen Farrell lead both sets of players out on to the Murrayfield sward, to a booming soundtrack being played over the PA rapturous reception from the crowd. They line up to be presented to the patron of the Scottish rugby football union, Anne the Princess Royal, who stands at the entrance of the tunnel waiting for the music to conclude. Ah, here she comes to bagpipe accompaniment, passing the Calcutta Cup trophy on the way ... Eddie Jones speaks: In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Sonia McLaughlin, England\u2019s head coach insists that he picked the right team to face France last week was the right one for the job. He also insists wing forward Tom Curry is the right man to play at the base of the scrum for England, rather than a bona fide No8. He insists Curry has the \u201cpotential\u201d to become a great No8 and says he is willing to take the hit if England continue losing matches as Curry develops in his new role. Ireland see off Wales in Dublin: Ireland have followed up last week\u2019s unconvincing win against Scotland with a more emphatic performance against the defending champions at the Avivia Stadium. They ran out 24-14 winners, although Wales Hadleigh Parkes had a try ruled out by the TMO after failing to ground the ball properly following a burst through the Irish defence and a desperate one-handed stretch for the line. Column: Eddie Jones does not have the players to simply blast through Scotland, so guile and speed will have to be to the fore, writes the former England international Ugo Monye. Today\u2019s match officials Referee: Pascal Gauzere (France) Assistants: Mathieu Raynal (France) and Federico Anselmi (Argentina) TMO: James Leckie (Australia) There\u2019s a storm coming ... With Storm Ciara approaching from the west and forecast to hit Edinburgh around about kick-off time, conditions are expected to be extremely unpleasant for all involved on the pitch in Murrayfield. Presumably aware that this match is likely to be settled up front by the forwards, Eddie Jones has loaded his bench with six scrummagers, while forecast winds of up to 70 miles per hour could wreak all sorts of havoc for players under high, dropping balls. With Anthony Watson still injured, George Furbank keeps his place at full-back following a torrid debut against France last week. The atrocious weather should prove a stern test of the 23-year-old\u2019s mettle. Scotland: 15-Stuart Hogg (c), 14-Sean Maitland, 13-Huw Jones, 12-Sam Johnson, 11-Blair Kinghorn, 10-Adam Hastings, 9-Ali Price; 1-Rory Sutherland, 2-Fraser Brown, 3-Zander Fagerson, 4-Scott Cummings, 5-Jonny Gray, 6-Jamie Ritchie, 7-Hamish Watson, 8-Magnus Bradbury. Replacements: 16-Stuart McInally, 17-Allan Dell, 18-Simon Berghan, 19-Ben Toolis, 20-Nick Haining, 21-George Horne, 22-Rory Hutchinson, 23-Chris Harris. England: 15-George Furbank, 14-Jonny May, 13-Jonathan Joseph, 12-Owen Farrell (c), 11-Elliot Daly, 10-George Ford, 9-Willi Heinz; 1-Mako Vunipola, 2-Jamie George, 3-Kyle Sinckler, 4-Maro Itoje, 5-George Kruis, 6-Lewis Ludlam, 7-Sam Underhill, 8-Tom Curry. Replacements: 16-Tom Dunn, 17-Ellis Genge, 18-Will Stuart, 19-Joe Launchbury, 20-Courtney Lawes, 21-Ben Earl, 22-Ben Youngs, 23-Ollie Devoto. England team news Townsend\u2019s England counterpart Eddie Jones has made five changes to the team that got turned over by France last Sunday, with Willi Heinz coming in at scrum-half in place of Ben Youngs, who drops to the bench. The Gloucester No9 will make his first Six Nations start at Murrayfield. With Leicester\u2019s Manu Tuilagi ruled out with a groin injury, Bath\u2019s Jonathan Joseph starts at outside centre, while Saracens duo Mako Vunipola and George Kruis, and Leciester\u2019s Lewis Ludlam come into the pack. Scotland team news Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend has made just one change to the team that was a little unlucky to lose in Dublin last weekend, bringing in No8 Magnus Bradbury for his Edinburgh team-mate Nick Haining. Fly-half Finn Russell remains banished from the squad after missing a training session following a night on the ale in the build-up to their game. He has been told his situation will be reviewed by Townsend some time next week, although the Guardian\u2019s Andy Bull reports that the Scotland coach is believed to be waiting for a proper apology from his gifted No10. In Russell\u2019s ongoing absence, Adam Hastings will play at out-half. Having lost their respective Six Nations openers last weekend, both sides are desperate for the win required to keep their title hopes alive. While Scotland need no added motivation to beat their most bitter rugby rivals, they have been given plenty by England head coach Eddie Jones, whose arrogant pre-match pontificating will have raised hackles north of Hadrian\u2019s Wall. The weather forecast is dire which means the rugby may not be too pretty, but an extremely eventful and entertaining evening seems assured at Murrayfield regardless of the quality. Kick-off is at 4.45pm (GMT), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

Yes, they\u2019re that good, even without the nahm prik chilli relishes that they are commonly served with in Thai cuisine. They\u2019re a crowd pleaser.

And because of their shape and size, they require minimal cooking time. Plus, they can be cut to fit a baking dish for eggplant parmigiana perfectly.</p> <p>My friend, the very clever chef Josh Lewis of the infamous Fleet in Brunswick, has been using this eggplant ingenuously. He slowly cooks it with chicken fat in the dreamiest pairing with chargrilled local mackerel, finished off with a roasted fish bone broth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7cbnz8DkfG/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m a little miffed that the only eggplant emoji is purple. I guess it\u2019s understandable as Japan is where emojis originated, and they don\u2019t have long green eggplants over there. I won\u2019t even go into what the kids are using purple eggplant emoji for these days. Moving on, there are only two cultivated varieties of long green eggplants \u2013 the Louisiana Green is banana shaped, but the Thai long green silken is in my humble opinion peerless in all the Solanum melongena realm. Unlike an apple eggplant, it\u2019s not bitter. It is a lot less seedy and more applicable across the board \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong, apple eggplants and pea eggplants are the eggplants of choice when my longing for green curry starts to stir. However, the Thai long green silken eggplant embodies everything you want from an eggplant and then some. It\u2019s still not a well-known variety, but in Australia during summer, you will spot it at many Asian grocers. It is often grown by home gardeners and brought in to sell. Eggplants are at their peak now, so go forth and buy one \u2013 heck buy three. Better yet, make like the gardeners supplying those grocers and grow a couple of plants. Seeds for these can be found easily enough on Australian heirloom seed websites, or from mail order catalogues such as the Diggers Club. Most eggplant varieties will cook down and reduce in volume \u2013 they\u2019re approximately 92% water. But not so the long green ones! The perform very well in drought conditions too. If you grill them they will retain much of their structure and leave you not with a tasteless, spongy meaty thing that needs a sauce or flavouring to make them sing. Instead, they\u2019ll turn into a vegetable so tender and luscious you won\u2019t be able to bring yourself to buy or grow any other eggplants ever again. They are a one-stop shop eggplant. They can be cooked any way, in any cuisine and they will delight even the most sceptical eggplant consumer. Sliced and dipped in a beaten egg batter, fried and salted is possibly the easiest and most gratifying way. I\u2019ve made it for countless fellow chefs and all asked me what I did to make them taste better than any fried chicken they\u2019d had. Yes, they\u2019re that good, even without the nahm prik chilli relishes that they are commonly served with in Thai cuisine. They\u2019re a crowd pleaser. My kids greedily consume them as fast as I can fry them and they\u2019re healthier and more satisfying than a doughnut too. I\u2019ve also used them grilled (peeled and used in dips and salads), stir fried (recipe below), roasted (dengaku style), stuffed (with meat and baked, delicious!), in stews (ratatouille), curries (Thai, Indian, Sri Lankan anyone?) and soups (lovely in a miso soup). You won\u2019t need any fiddly acidulated water, as long green eggplants won\u2019t oxidise the moment you slice them. And because of their shape and size, they require minimal cooking time. Plus, they can be cut to fit a baking dish for eggplant parmigiana perfectly. My friend, the very clever chef Josh Lewis of the infamous Fleet in Brunswick, has been using this eggplant ingenuously. He slowly cooks it with chicken fat in the dreamiest pairing with chargrilled local mackerel, finished off with a roasted fish bone broth. My favourite Thai dishes of the entire cookery canon involve this eggplant. One is the Isaan salad/chilli relish dtum makheua, made by first chargrilling eggplants, long green chillies, shallots and garlic over coals until they\u2019re blackened, slipping the skins off when it is cool, then pounding them in a mortar pestle until they are a lovely sludgy paste \u2013 at which point you season them with bpla raa - a fermented fish sauce with lime juice, then finish it off with fresh soft herbs such as coriander, sawtooth herb and Vietnamese mint. Eaten with a soft-boiled egg and freshly made pork crackling it is probably my death row meal. Thai cooking savant Andy Ricker of Pok Pok in Portland agrees \u2013 he\u2019s green with envy that we in Australia have access to this eggplant to use in our restaurants and at home. So get cooking. Stir fried eggplant and Thai basil in yellow bean sauce Serves Two 3tbs olive oil 2 medium sized Thai long green silken eggplants, sliced on an angle 5 cloves of garlic, minced 2 tbs fermented yellow bean sauce 2 tbs fermented chilli sauce 1.5tbs dark soy sauce 1tbs coconut nectar 1 long red chilli, sliced thinly on an angle 2 spring onions, sliced thinly on an angle 6 stalks of Thai basil, picked Prepare all your ingredients and have them all on hand, as everything will cook very fast. Heat your wok on the highest element for a good minute or so, add the olive oil and wait until the oil starts to ripple a little. At the same time, add the garlic and eggplant slices, agitating the wok constantly so the garlic does not burn. When the eggplant starts to brown add the coconut nectar, dark soy, fermented chilli and fermented yellow bean sauces. Keep agitating the wok and move the contents of the wok around with a spatula. When the eggplant has thoroughly cooked and the sauces are equally covering the surface of the eggplant, turn the heat off and add the spring onion, long red chilli and Thai basil.

      "bodyText": "While listening this week to the Guardian Australia editor, Lenore Taylor, on the Full Story podcast speaking with sadness and exasperation about the past 30 years of climate change policy, I thought about good intentions and perfection. We often hear that \u201cthe road to hell is paved with good intentions\u201d. It\u2019s one of those sayings that, when you really think about it, is just a squib. The reality is these good intentions that are paving our way to hell are not so much good as ignorant, and quite often (such as with much of Indigenous policy) outright racist. They are really considered good only by those seeking to excuse the action in the first place. And while good people might occasionally do wrong with actual good intentions, there is a much higher strike rate of people with bad intentions doing bad things. That the road to hell may be paved with good intentions means we should ensure our good intentions are not ignorant or biased; and it sure as heck does not give an excuse to those with bad intent. We certainly have seen a plethora of bad intent with respect to climate-change policy since 1990. Similarly, you could probably fill a long list of quotes by people over the past decade or so who have suggested of climate change policy that \u201cwe should not make the perfect the enemy of the good\u201d. And yet rather than this suggesting we need to compromise, what it has come to mean is that we should excuse policy that is bad, because it is not perfect. If we are so worried about the perfect being the enemy of the good, wouldn\u2019t we at least see some evidence of someone in the major parties actually suggesting a policy that could be described as perfect? The science of climate change tells us we need to reduce emissions and the sooner we do it the less the impact will be. And yet rather than see any \u201cperfect\u201d policy with this aim, instead we get supposedly good policy accompanied with caveats \u2013 talk of the need for transitional fuels such as gas or that a coalmine is fine \u2013 hey, let\u2019s not be perfect! (And please don\u2019t not argue about just how good something has to be before perfect becomes its enemy). So bad has this become that the carbon price instituted by the Gillard government is now considered some perfect policy too far beyond our political grasp. Why are we so lacking in ambition? And given the other side have an ambition fuelled by bad intentions, it might be worthwhile when trying to compromise to ensure negotiation starts from a position rather closer to perfect than just \u201cgood\u201d. Because let us be honest: the government is paving the way to climate change hell with bad intentions. The government is replete with climate-change deniers who intend to block and retard any action to reduce emissions. They will do this through obfuscation and outright misinformation \u2013 such as the lies about the impact of the ALP\u2019s electric car policy during the last election, or the current lies about the bushfires. On Wednesday, Peter Dutton told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing that \u201cobviously, as we\u2019ve all pointed out, we\u2019re experiencing hotter weather, longer summers, but did the bushfires start in some of these regions because of climate change? No. It started because somebody lit a match. There are 250 people, as I understand it, or more that have been charged with arson. That\u2019s not climate change.\u201d It\u2019s also not the truth. The prime minister has equally betrayed his bad intentions on the issue. He told the media on Thursday that, \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow a confined, narrow debate when it comes to understanding what it means to live in the climate we\u2019re going to live in. It\u2019s not just about emissions reduction. That\u2019s important. But it\u2019s also about resilience and it\u2019s also about adaptation\u201d His intent is clearly to actually narrow the debate by excluding as much as possible any discussion of emissions, and instead to focus on building dams as though that is some saviour for a country affected by climate change and by greater periods of drought. Scott Morrison \u2013 and other members of his cabinet \u2013 have no good intentions when they suggest Australia is doing well by meeting and beating out Kyoto commitments. Those commitments are frauds. The Howard government purposefully ensured Australia alone could include land use because the Kyoto base year of 1990 involved a spectacular level of land clearing, as does 2005, the base year for our Paris agreement. Saying we will meet and beat our targets is like bragging that you are meeting your target of drinking less beer by comparing how many glasses you drink per day now to what you drank on the day of your 21st birthday party. Last week Morrison told the National Press Club the United States were doing great because of its increase in gas-produced electricity and that \u201cbetween 2005 and 2017 US emissions fell by about 13 per cent, that\u2019s just a click over what we have achieved, which is 12.8 per cent by the way.\u201d What he failed to note was those drops occurred prior to the election of Trump and its withdrawal from the Paris agreement and that it is not on target to meet what were the US\u2019s Paris targets. His suggestion that Australia is nearly doing just as well is also one of bad faith. Yes, from 2005 to 2017 we reduced our emissions by 12.8%, just below that of the US, but only if we include land use. If we exclude that very dodgy measure, the US\u2019s emissions still fell by 12%, but Australia\u2019s actually rose by 6.2%. We are not doing our bit, and you would only argue we are if your intention was to ensure that good policy is not merely blocked but bad policy is pushed. There has been some talk this week about new Greens leader Adam Bandt\u2019s call for a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and whether or not Australia should adopt such a US-style political term. To be honest I\u2019m not all that fussed about the marketing, so long as the policy has large ambition. We need some good intentions and we need to aim for perfection. The challenges and forces against action on climate change are large and powerful. As the past 30 years have shown us, being content to argue for a \u201cgood\u201d third- or fourth-best policy is no way to win this fight, and neither is allowing those with bad intentions to tell us that what they want is good.",

In December, Adams said further hearings slated for late January or February would \u201cfocus on the psychological issues raised by strip-searching of young persons\u201d. He had also told the inquiry that the LECC would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/23/nsw-police-watchdog-investigates-if-its-illegal-to-force-people-to-squat-during-strip-searches\">review whether it was legal for officers to force people to squat during a strip search</a>, a common practice.</p> <p>But this week the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/06/strip-search-inquiry-cut-short-after-nsw-government-sacks-commissioner\">following Adams\u2019 departure, the hearings will no longer go ahead</a>. Instead, sources said a truncated version of the investigation\u2019s findings will most likely be released in two parts in February and April.</p> <p>The decision to cut short the strip-search inquiry has been widely criticised. Andrew Stone SC, the NSW state president of the Australian Lawyers Alliance, said the issue \u201cgoes to the very heart of public confidence in the police and must be fully examined\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence heard by this inquiry to date requires thorough, ongoing investigation to determine whether police have conducted illegal strip-searches of minors,\u201d Stone said.</p> <p>\u201cWe ask that [acting LECC chief commissioner Reginald Blanch QC] explains why this inquiry was terminated and reconsiders this decision. If the LECC does not continue this inquiry, it is essential that a parliamentary committee be given responsibility to do so.</p> <p>\u201cThe public hearings held last year revealed disturbing evidence of police misusing strip-search powers on minors and indicated that there is confusion among police in relation to the laws governing strip-searches.\u201d</p> <p>But the timing and nature of Adams\u2019 dismissal also raises questions about the LECC\u2019s power to hold police to account. The strip-search inquiry was embarrassing for the NSW government and police, but the former supreme court justice had already proven he was unafraid of taking on the government that appointed him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/07/why-is-this-happening-shocking-evidence-builds-pressure-for-strip-search-reform-in-nsw\">'Why is this happening?'

Authored by respected Sydney barrister Bruce McClintock SC, it was based on complaints made against Adams by a fellow LECC commissioner, Patrick Saidi.</p> <p>But McClintock\u2019s report cleared Adams of any wrongdoing. While Saidi had accused Adams of running the LECC in an \u201cautocratic\u201d manner, McClintock\u2019s report concluded that \u201con the contrary\u201d, Adams had \u201cbehaved in a consultative manner showing very considerable forbearance towards Mr Saidi in the face of rudeness and provocation\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, McClintock considered whether Saidi himself may have engaged in \u201cmaladministration or misconduct\u201d. He did not make a finding on that point. Guardian Australia understands Saidi was removed from the LECC in January, shortly after Adams.</p> <p>On Friday Harwin\u2019s office would not comment on whether the report had been the basis for Adams\u2019 dismissal.</p> <p>Sam Lee, the head of police accountability at the Redfern Legal Centre,<em> </em>said the government needed to be more transparent about the reasons for Adams\u2019 removal.</p> <p>\u201cAn independent police watchdog plays a pivotal role in ensuring the integrity and accountability of NSW police,\u201d she said. \u201cAny disruption to this body via the removal of its chief commissioner should also be transparent and accountable.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government has relied on a report that found no wrong doing by the chief commissioner to remove him from office, then the public may rightly be concerned.\u201d</p> <p>In any case, Adams\u2019 removal is a hammer blow for justice advocates in NSW.</p> <p>Adams had barely gotten comfortable in his chair in 2017 when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/nsw-police-may-be-investigated-for-secret-blacklist-used-to-target-children?utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=GU+Today+AUS+v1+-+AUS+morning+mail+callout&amp;utm_term=249497&amp;subid=17034102&amp;CMP=ema_632\">flagged that the LECC would begin investigating the Suspect Target Management Plan</a>, a \u201chidden\u201d blacklist used by the state\u2019s police force to target children as young as 10 for monitoring despite them not having committed any crime.</p> <p>Under his watch the LECC also revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/31/girl-abused-and-men-jailed-unlawfully-amid-widespread-child-sex-offender-register-failures\">widespread mismanagement of the NSW child protection register</a> that led to a child being sexually abused by a sex offender who should have been monitored by police and two people being unlawfully imprisoned.</p> <p>\u201cIt is vital that New South Wales has a well-funded, highly resourced and independent police watchdog, one which can act with integrity and independence,\u201d Lee said.</p> <p>\u201cThe recent removal of two LECC commissioners and the cutting short of the strip-search inquiry will not instil public confidence in such processes.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two days before Christmas, as bushfires raged across New South Wales, the special minister of state, Don Harwin, quietly announced the departure of the chief commissioner of the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, Michael Adams QC. In a short statement, Harwin said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for Adams\u2019 leadership and thanked him \u201cfor his efforts as the inaugural head of the NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission\u201d. The timing was interesting. Adams, the inaugural head of the police watchdog introduced in 2017 to replace the Police Integrity Commission, the Ombudsman and the NSW Crime Commission, was part way through leading an explosive inquiry into the use of strip-search powers on minors by police. In the most high profile investigation undertaken in the agency\u2019s short history, two sets of public hearings uncovered evidence of police conducting potentially illegal searches on children and revealed many police did not understand the laws governing strip-searches. In one case, a 15-year-old boy said he \u201cshook with nerves\u201d after a police officer told him to \u201chold your dick and lift your balls up and show me your gooch\u201d during a search at an under-18s music festival in February last year. The investigation had not yet concluded. In December, Adams said further hearings slated for late January or February would \u201cfocus on the psychological issues raised by strip-searching of young persons\u201d. He had also told the inquiry that the LECC would review whether it was legal for officers to force people to squat during a strip search, a common practice. But this week the Guardian revealed that following Adams\u2019 departure, the hearings will no longer go ahead. Instead, sources said a truncated version of the investigation\u2019s findings will most likely be released in two parts in February and April. The decision to cut short the strip-search inquiry has been widely criticised. Andrew Stone SC, the NSW state president of the Australian Lawyers Alliance, said the issue \u201cgoes to the very heart of public confidence in the police and must be fully examined\u201d. \u201cThe evidence heard by this inquiry to date requires thorough, ongoing investigation to determine whether police have conducted illegal strip-searches of minors,\u201d Stone said. \u201cWe ask that [acting LECC chief commissioner Reginald Blanch QC] explains why this inquiry was terminated and reconsiders this decision. If the LECC does not continue this inquiry, it is essential that a parliamentary committee be given responsibility to do so. \u201cThe public hearings held last year revealed disturbing evidence of police misusing strip-search powers on minors and indicated that there is confusion among police in relation to the laws governing strip-searches.\u201d But the timing and nature of Adams\u2019 dismissal also raises questions about the LECC\u2019s power to hold police to account. The strip-search inquiry was embarrassing for the NSW government and police, but the former supreme court justice had already proven he was unafraid of taking on the government that appointed him. During his term he was relentless in pointing out that the NSW government has failed to adequately fund the agency since its inception, and in 2018 accused the former police minister Troy Grant of seeking to improperly influence staffing decisions at the LECC in order to placate the police union. The day after Harwin announced Adams\u2019 departure, a story published in the Australian quoted an unnamed government official saying the decision not to renew his term was based on the findings of a confidential inquiry which found the agency was \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and \u201craised concerns about leadership at the highest levels\u201d. That report was released this week. Authored by respected Sydney barrister Bruce McClintock SC, it was based on complaints made against Adams by a fellow LECC commissioner, Patrick Saidi. But McClintock\u2019s report cleared Adams of any wrongdoing. While Saidi had accused Adams of running the LECC in an \u201cautocratic\u201d manner, McClintock\u2019s report concluded that \u201con the contrary\u201d, Adams had \u201cbehaved in a consultative manner showing very considerable forbearance towards Mr Saidi in the face of rudeness and provocation\u201d. Instead, McClintock considered whether Saidi himself may have engaged in \u201cmaladministration or misconduct\u201d. He did not make a finding on that point. Guardian Australia understands Saidi was removed from the LECC in January, shortly after Adams. On Friday Harwin\u2019s office would not comment on whether the report had been the basis for Adams\u2019 dismissal. Sam Lee, the head of police accountability at the Redfern Legal Centre, said the government needed to be more transparent about the reasons for Adams\u2019 removal. \u201cAn independent police watchdog plays a pivotal role in ensuring the integrity and accountability of NSW police,\u201d she said. \u201cAny disruption to this body via the removal of its chief commissioner should also be transparent and accountable. \u201cIf the government has relied on a report that found no wrong doing by the chief commissioner to remove him from office, then the public may rightly be concerned.\u201d In any case, Adams\u2019 removal is a hammer blow for justice advocates in NSW. Adams had barely gotten comfortable in his chair in 2017 when he flagged that the LECC would begin investigating the Suspect Target Management Plan, a \u201chidden\u201d blacklist used by the state\u2019s police force to target children as young as 10 for monitoring despite them not having committed any crime. Under his watch the LECC also revealed widespread mismanagement of the NSW child protection register that led to a child being sexually abused by a sex offender who should have been monitored by police and two people being unlawfully imprisoned. \u201cIt is vital that New South Wales has a well-funded, highly resourced and independent police watchdog, one which can act with integrity and independence,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe recent removal of two LECC commissioners and the cutting short of the strip-search inquiry will not instil public confidence in such processes.\u201d",

Sure, it\u2019s not for everyone, but if it\u2019s for you, you\u2019ll get exactly that at this year\u2019s Perth Fringe World, in A Young Man Dressed as a Gorilla Dressed as an Old Man Sits Rocking in a Rocking Chair for Fifty-Six Minutes and Then Leaves. Those walking away disappointed only have themselves to blame. If that doesn\u2019t tickle your fancy, there are more than 700 other shows from which to choose. Since 2014, Fringe World has nearly doubled the number of events, more than doubled attendance (up to 857,000), and quadrupled its box office (up to $12.1m). Bigger is better sounds like a winning strategy for the organisation, but it\u2019s not necessarily so for artists, for whom the biggest problem is bums on seats. Anyone who has tried running the main-street gauntlet of flyering artists at festival time can attest to a perceptible level of desperation. Their fears are well-founded: average attendance at Fringe World in 2019 was 59% of capacity per session, up 2% from 2018 yet down from 2017\u2019s figure of 63%. The fact is, for many artists facing a nearly two-fifths empty audience each night would be a best-case scenario. Artists at the forthcoming Adelaide fringe face a similar dilemma. It\u2019s doubled its volume of shows and box office over the last decade \u2013 now at 1200 and $19.5 million respectively. But 40% of 2018 shows sold fewer than 100 tickets across their seasons, and 20% of all shows sold fewer than 50. With the average ticket in Perth increasing by nearly $10 to $32.25 since 2014, punters have reason to be selective. So how can comedians, cabaret and circus acts, who may have to spend thousands of dollars to put on a show and cover travel and accommodation, cut through? Stand-up comedian and Triple J host Michael Hing, who has previously toured Michael Hing \u2013 Dressed as a Lobster for a Portion of the Evening, is no stranger to fighting for attention at fringe. \u201cEven if you feel like you\u2019ve broken through one year, you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve broken through another year,\u201d he says. \u201cThe next year, the work starts again.\u201d Hing describes the different methods acts use to stand out. The descriptive title and unambiguous hook is a popular one. A quick perusal of the attractions at Fringe World this year turns up 100 Years of the History of Dance as Told by One Man in 60 Minutes With an Energetic Group Finale, Melon the Human Attempts to Top His Last Show Which Got Him Into the Largest Circus in the World, I Was Birthed From an Egg in a Crater on Uranus, and so on. Some game the system by seeking early placement on fringe\u2019s alphabetically ordered website, like Aaaaaaaargh! It\u2019s the Best of UK Fringe Comedy \u2013 though they didn\u2019t account for the 20 numerically titled productions that would precede them. Kieran Bullock will put his title to the test when he brings Kieran Bullock Builds IKEA Furniture and Talks to the Audience to Perth and Adelaide fringe following a run in Melbourne. \u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily remember me or remember my name, but they remember the hook of, \u2018Oh yeah, a show where a man is building IKEA furniture on stage\u2019,\u201d he says.

Policewomen in Pennsylvania, schoolteachers in South Dakota and veterans in Vermont have all publicly married same-sex partners. Neither the sky nor the stock market has fallen in. The frontier in the battle for equality has moved.</p> <p>If we do this autumn witness a presidential debate between Buttigieg and Donald Trump and the latter hints at their personal differences, a temptation he would surely find almost impossible to resist, Buttigieg could retort that when called on by his country he went to Afghanistan; Trump dodged the draft. While this president might never have taken himself to a frontline voluntarily, the frontline in an important culture war may now, courtesy of Mayor Pete\u2019s rising star, be coming to him.</p> <p><em>Ben Summerskill was chief executive of Stonewall from 2003-2014</em></p>",

In 2015 and 2018, it saw thousands of young Irish people return from abroad to vote in same-sex marriage and abortion referendums that they thought \u2013 rightly \u2013 would help signally change their home nation. Just as most Americans have in recent years reconciled themselves to Rock Hudson being gay and Ellen DeGeneres being lesbian, they have also \u2013 courtesy of the supreme court in 2015 \u2013 been undergoing exactly the same sort of quiet political education that civil partnership provided in Britain. Policewomen in Pennsylvania, schoolteachers in South Dakota and veterans in Vermont have all publicly married same-sex partners. Neither the sky nor the stock market has fallen in. The frontier in the battle for equality has moved. If we do this autumn witness a presidential debate between Buttigieg and Donald Trump and the latter hints at their personal differences, a temptation he would surely find almost impossible to resist, Buttigieg could retort that when called on by his country he went to Afghanistan; Trump dodged the draft. While this president might never have taken himself to a frontline voluntarily, the frontline in an important culture war may now, courtesy of Mayor Pete\u2019s rising star, be coming to him.

About 60 protesters were taking part in the defiant act of impromptu sculpture making as the museum in London attempted to close its doors at 5pm on Saturday. The action, entitled Monument, is the first of its kind to be conducted by the theatrical protest group BP or not BP? \u201cWe are imagining a world in which the British Museum has stopped celebrating those causing the climate crisis and is instead allying itself with those who have, currently are, and will be putting their bodies on the line in the fight for climate justice,\u201d said a plaque describing the protest. The civil disobedience campaign began on Friday night when protesters dressed as ancient Greek warriors smuggled a 13-foot Trojan horse into the museum\u2019s foyer. The protest was in response to an exhibition, Troy: Myth and Reality, which is described as \u201csupported by BP\u201d. Two guards slept inside its belly overnight, despite a downpour at around 4am, to prevent it being removed. The group estimated that as many as 1,500 supporters took part in the action on Saturday. Protesters occupied 11 of the museum\u2019s rooms, which became host to spoken word performances, singalongs and talks by campaigners from West Papua and Senegal. Origami swans were scattered throughout the museum adorned with messages including: \u201cChoose sponsors who care about our future\u201d. Protesters finished the day by tearing apart paper versions of BP\u2019s logo near the museum\u2019s main entrance. \u201cWe feel that the museum\u2019s attitudes towards climate change and colonialism are not what they should be in the 21st century,\u201d said the group\u2019s Jess Worth. Suzanne Savage, from Malvern, Worcestershire, was among a gathering of fee-paying British Museum members who unfurled a banner emblazoned with the words \u201cBP must fall\u201d.

The Serb pounced to convert Joe Bryan\u2019s cross midway through the second half, before Fulham rode out a nervy final half-hour \u2013 including a late Darragh Lenihan goal being disallowed for offside \u2013 to secure a vital win that took them level on points with Leeds and one point behind leaders West Brom. Two points behind Fulham are in-form Brentford, who came away winners from a five-goal thriller against Middlesbrough. Thomas Frank\u2019s men twice saw their leads cancelled out by the visitors before Ollie Watkins rifled home his 20th goal of the season three minutes from time to clinch the points. Nottingham Forest\u2019s 2-0 win over Leeds in the evening kick-off means just three points separate the top five. Five more goals were scored at Swansea, where the hosts lost ground in the race for the playoff positions thanks to Tom Lawrence\u2019s superb 80th-minute winner for Derby County, while Preston leapfrogged Bristol City into sixth, Daniel Johnson scoring one and laying on the other in a 2-1 victory at Wigan, who occupy the third relegation place. Elsewhere at the bottom, Luton remain marooned at the foot of the table after Lee Tomlin\u2019s curler saw Cardiff run out 1-0 winners at Kenilworth Road, while Stoke and Huddersfield both picked up crucial wins against Charlton and QPR respectively to put daylight between themselves and the relegation zone. Making up the bottom three are Barnsley, who salvaged a point 1-1 at home to Sheffield Wednesday after Cauley Woodrow capitalised on a goalkeeping error to score from 35 yards. League One Wycombe kept themselves within three points of leaders Rotherham as an early poacher\u2019s goal from Adebayo Akinfenwa set them on their way to a 3-1 defeat of Bristol Rovers. Peterborough\u2019s 4-0 demolition of Oxford United means they stay a point behind Wycombe in third, Ivan Toney scoring a double for the hosts who won at a canter despite playing the final half-hour with 10 men. Maxime Biamou\u2019s stoppage-time winner for Coventry sealed a 2-1 win over Bolton that took his side up to fourth, while Portsmouth and Sunderland round off the playoff spots after their respective triumphs against Tranmere and Ipswich, whose alarming recent form has left them in seventh. AFC Wimbledon remain six points above the drop zone despite losing 2-1 at home to Fleetwood, while Southend\u2019s hopes of survival are dwindling rapidly after a goal in each half from Blackpool\u2019s Armand Gnanduillet saw his side run out 2-1 winners. League Two Crewe threw open the title race in dramatic style, coming from a goal down to clinch a 2-1 win against Oldham with a goal from Charlie Kirk in the 97th minute. They move to within two points of top spot and have a game in hand over leaders Swindon, who could only draw 1-1 at Carlisle, Rarmani Edmonds-Green giving the visitors an early lead before for Aaron Hayden levelled on the hour mark. Exeter move up to third after Matt Jay\u2019s late goal delivered a 2-1 win over rock-bottom Stevenage, while Plymouth and Northampton each suffered blows to their promotions bid with defeats against Colchester and Port Vale respectively. Cheltenham sit in the final playoff spot despite a meek 1-0 loss at Scunthorpe, but only goal difference separates them from John Askey\u2019s Valiants and Bradford, where Stuart McCall was denied a winning start to his third spell as manager by a 92nd-minute effort from Grimsby\u2019s Luke Hendrie. Another late equaliser, from Alex Kenyon, rescued a 1-1 draw for Morecambe against Mansfield that keeps the Shrimps six points above the sole relegation spot, while Macclesfield stay two points above them after Jacob Blyth\u2019s powerful stoppage-time strike ensured the same scoreline at Leyton Orient.",

Attacks on the independence of the judiciary and civil service are now standard for a right that cannot tolerate constraints. Britain is not Hungary. But if you want to stop your country heading that way, is it not more effective to start fighting back at the first sign of danger rather than waiting until it is too late? \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>First published just under a year ago, Candice Carty-Williams\u2019s debut novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/16/queenie-candice-carty-williams-review\" title=\"\"><em>Queenie</em></a>, has become not just a bestseller but a publishing phenomenon. Now out in paperback, the book has blazed a trail with its smart and funny portrayal of black womanhood and black British life. A hit with critics and readers alike, it was shortlisted for numerous prizes, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/26/debut-author-of-queenie-caps-success-with-costa-prize-shortlisting\" title=\"\">Costa first novel award,</a> and won Blackwell\u2019s debut of the year prize. Carty-Williams is now adapting it for a Channel 4 series.</p> <p>Born in south London in 1989, she wrote much of the novel at a writers\u2019 retreat at the home of author Jojo Moyes during a week off from her job at the publisher 4th Estate. Booker prize winner Bernardine Evaristo described it as \u201ca deliciously funny, characterful, topical and thrilling novel for our times\u201d. </p> <p><strong>How has it felt seeing <em>Queenie</em> out in the world and doing so </strong><strong>well?</strong><br>Seeing it in a bookshop is wild but when I first saw someone reading it on the tube that was even wilder. At Brixton station I was recognised and someone wanted to take a selfie. My nan calls <em>Queenie</em> my \u201clittle project\u201d, so having grown up with people who are like, \u201cDo your work\u201d \u2013 that keeps me grounded.</p> <p><strong>Are you often asked if you are Queenie?</strong><br>All the time. We\u2019re very different \u2013 I\u2019m way more controlled than she is. But like Queenie I tend to catastrophise. The whole book was written in one burst over six months. It was a year in someone\u2019s life. It had to have that energy and drama.</p> <p><strong>You show the precariousness of life for Queenie, including her being trapped in the housing crisis</strong><strong>.</strong><br>I was living in a horrible flatshare in Brixton Hill at the time. I\u2019d lived in at least 10 houses by this point. I applied to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/07/jojo-moyes-must-government-tackle-shameful-adult-literacy\" title=\"\">Jojo Moyes</a>\u2019s writers\u2019 retreat. I was very frank \u2013 I said I do work in publishing but I don\u2019t have the access my peers have. I never get to go on holiday. I don\u2019t have anywhere to go as all my family are in south London. I don\u2019t have space and time to write. I started writing this novel on that retreat. What I needed to say in <em>Queenie</em> is that we are all living variations of the same life but for some it is harder. How much money you have, the colour of your skin, your cultural capital can make it harder.</p> <p><strong>Tell me about <em>Queenie</em>\u2019s exploration of self-esteem</strong><strong>.</strong><br>When you haven\u2019t been represented in fiction, TV, film, advertising, you feel invisible. If you don\u2019t see yourself you feel like you don\u2019t fit in. And I didn\u2019t want people to feel anxious about feeling lonely or having casual sex or being irritating to their friends \u2013 because for loads of us that\u2019s the reality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All of the odds have been against black women since the beginning of time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Did you draw on your own experiences of racism in online dating?</strong><br>I drew on some of my own experiences. I haven\u2019t been on apps for years because they\u2019re horrible. I wanted to show how black women are fetishised. One of the storylines came out of something that happened to me and my friend Lydia. She was on Happn and I was on OkCupid, and we ended up talking to the same white guy. Lydia\u2019s white. He said to Lydia: \u201cLet\u2019s go for coffee so we can talk\u201d but his opening gambit to me was: \u201cCan you take a day off work so I can fuck you?\u201d I was like: \u201cErm, no.\u201d Things like that show you how other people devalue you.</p> <p><strong>Where does \u201cthe black Bridget Jones\u201d tagline come from?</strong><br>I chose that \u2013 I was working as a marketer in publishing and I thought this was going to be a hard sell because there hadn\u2019t been any books like it. <em>Bridget Jones </em>is the closest. Also, most fiction by black authors gets pigeonholed into literary fiction. I wanted <em>Queenie</em> to be widely read and understood.</p> <p><strong>The book shows relationships more enduring than </strong><strong>romantic ones, such as friendship</strong><strong>.</strong><br>Friendships are there for you unequivocally. I have really good friends. The Corgis [Queenie\u2019s group of friends] were necessary to show that you do need your support systems.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve written movingly about a friend, Dan, who encouraged your writing</strong><strong>.</strong><br>The book is dedicated to two friends who died young, Anton and Dan. When I was 23 to 25, I had panic attacks all the time because my best friend, Dan, had just been diagnosed with cancer. I also had loads of unresolved childhood stuff. I talked to Dan about it and he said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you write about it \u2013 but rather than a diary, why don\u2019t you fictionalise it, so it isn\u2019t necessarily about you, but you\u2019re still getting the stuff out.\u201d So yes, Queenie and I have similarities but also much of it is fiction.</p> <p><strong>Can you describe your childhood?</strong><br>My mum worked as a hospital receptionist. My dad was a cab driver. My childhood was shit and lonely. I just read all the time. That started when there was an incident that led to me being excluded from school \u2013 I went to Lewisham library instead. I read a lot of Judy Blume, Malorie Blackman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/11/sue-townsend-1946-2014\" title=\"\">Sue Townsend</a>. Those were my childhood reads that formed me, that I loved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/16/queenie-candice-carty-williams-review\">Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams review \u2013 a smart and breezy debut</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Has humour been an important part of your life? For Queenie, it seems like a survival mechanism</strong><strong>.</strong><br>My nan always used to say: \u201cIf you don\u2019t laugh, you\u2019ll cry.\u201d That literally is how we\u2019ve always had to live. When I was growing up and trying to be strong, humour was definitely a deflection. And for Queenie it\u2019s a deflection. Sometimes, life can be stranger than fiction and you have to laugh about it, as there\u2019s nothing else you can do. I\u2019ve also grown up around funny people.

      "bodyText": "First published just under a year ago, Candice Carty-Williams\u2019s debut novel, Queenie, has become not just a bestseller but a publishing phenomenon. Now out in paperback, the book has blazed a trail with its smart and funny portrayal of black womanhood and black British life. A hit with critics and readers alike, it was shortlisted for numerous prizes, including the Costa first novel award, and won Blackwell\u2019s debut of the year prize. Carty-Williams is now adapting it for a Channel 4 series. Born in south London in 1989, she wrote much of the novel at a writers\u2019 retreat at the home of author Jojo Moyes during a week off from her job at the publisher 4th Estate. Booker prize winner Bernardine Evaristo described it as \u201ca deliciously funny, characterful, topical and thrilling novel for our times\u201d. How has it felt seeing Queenie out in the world and doing so well? Seeing it in a bookshop is wild but when I first saw someone reading it on the tube that was even wilder. At Brixton station I was recognised and someone wanted to take a selfie. My nan calls Queenie my \u201clittle project\u201d, so having grown up with people who are like, \u201cDo your work\u201d \u2013 that keeps me grounded. Are you often asked if you are Queenie? All the time. We\u2019re very different \u2013 I\u2019m way more controlled than she is. But like Queenie I tend to catastrophise. The whole book was written in one burst over six months. It was a year in someone\u2019s life. It had to have that energy and drama. You show the precariousness of life for Queenie, including her being trapped in the housing crisis. I was living in a horrible flatshare in Brixton Hill at the time. I\u2019d lived in at least 10 houses by this point. I applied to Jojo Moyes\u2019s writers\u2019 retreat. I was very frank \u2013 I said I do work in publishing but I don\u2019t have the access my peers have. I never get to go on holiday. I don\u2019t have anywhere to go as all my family are in south London. I don\u2019t have space and time to write. I started writing this novel on that retreat. What I needed to say in Queenie is that we are all living variations of the same life but for some it is harder. How much money you have, the colour of your skin, your cultural capital can make it harder. Tell me about Queenie\u2019s exploration of self-esteem. When you haven\u2019t been represented in fiction, TV, film, advertising, you feel invisible. If you don\u2019t see yourself you feel like you don\u2019t fit in. And I didn\u2019t want people to feel anxious about feeling lonely or having casual sex or being irritating to their friends \u2013 because for loads of us that\u2019s the reality. Did you draw on your own experiences of racism in online dating? I drew on some of my own experiences. I haven\u2019t been on apps for years because they\u2019re horrible. I wanted to show how black women are fetishised. One of the storylines came out of something that happened to me and my friend Lydia. She was on Happn and I was on OkCupid, and we ended up talking to the same white guy. Lydia\u2019s white. He said to Lydia: \u201cLet\u2019s go for coffee so we can talk\u201d but his opening gambit to me was: \u201cCan you take a day off work so I can fuck you?\u201d I was like: \u201cErm, no.\u201d Things like that show you how other people devalue you. Where does \u201cthe black Bridget Jones\u201d tagline come from? I chose that \u2013 I was working as a marketer in publishing and I thought this was going to be a hard sell because there hadn\u2019t been any books like it. Bridget Jones is the closest. Also, most fiction by black authors gets pigeonholed into literary fiction. I wanted Queenie to be widely read and understood. The book shows relationships more enduring than romantic ones, such as friendship. Friendships are there for you unequivocally. I have really good friends. The Corgis [Queenie\u2019s group of friends] were necessary to show that you do need your support systems. You\u2019ve written movingly about a friend, Dan, who encouraged your writing. The book is dedicated to two friends who died young, Anton and Dan. When I was 23 to 25, I had panic attacks all the time because my best friend, Dan, had just been diagnosed with cancer. I also had loads of unresolved childhood stuff. I talked to Dan about it and he said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you write about it \u2013 but rather than a diary, why don\u2019t you fictionalise it, so it isn\u2019t necessarily about you, but you\u2019re still getting the stuff out.\u201d So yes, Queenie and I have similarities but also much of it is fiction. Can you describe your childhood? My mum worked as a hospital receptionist. My dad was a cab driver. My childhood was shit and lonely. I just read all the time. That started when there was an incident that led to me being excluded from school \u2013 I went to Lewisham library instead. I read a lot of Judy Blume, Malorie Blackman, Sue Townsend. Those were my childhood reads that formed me, that I loved. Has humour been an important part of your life? For Queenie, it seems like a survival mechanism. My nan always used to say: \u201cIf you don\u2019t laugh, you\u2019ll cry.\u201d That literally is how we\u2019ve always had to live. When I was growing up and trying to be strong, humour was definitely a deflection. And for Queenie it\u2019s a deflection. Sometimes, life can be stranger than fiction and you have to laugh about it, as there\u2019s nothing else you can do. I\u2019ve also grown up around funny people. My mum is the funniest person I know. You founded the Guardian 4th Estate BAME short story prize. Would you see yourself as an activist? I\u2019ve always been someone who spots what is fair and what is not and I really operate on fairness. When I was growing up I would always recognise something unfair and think: \u201cHow can I change that?\u201d When I worked at 4th Estate I thought this whole industry was quite staid. Queenie is part of the same thing \u2013 I wanted to bring forth that representation. What is your second novel about? It\u2019s about grief and how grief doesn\u2019t ever really leave you. My friend Dan has a plaque at St Bride\u2019s church [in Fleet Street] and I go to it every year on his birthday, Christmas and the anniversary of when he passed away, and I have a chat. Last year, when I went for his birthday, I found it hardest.

I started this book in 1998 \u2013 I have a floppy disk that I\u2019ve now framed from that year \u2013 and finished it in 2018, so it took 20 years, though in between I wrote other things.

The most interesting snippets, I weaved into the story. I learned Swahili to write this book \u2013 it\u2019s an amazing language. I lived in Zanzibar to write some of it. I did research at the <a href=\"https://www.david-livingstone-trust.org/legacy-exhibition\" title=\"\">David Livingstone Memorial Trust</a>. It was so moving to see the room where he grew up with his family and to understand the poverty of his life.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

      "bodyText": "Brazilian nationals evacuated from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus crisis, will land shortly in national territory and will be taken to an airforce base where they will be quarantined for 18 days. The rescue comes after a video plea made to the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro last week. One of those in the video, Adrielly Eger, 18, a model, told the Band news network she was \u201cvery grateful\u201d. The 34 Brazilians, a mixed group of students, professionals, couples and children, should arrive at An\u00e1polis airbase, 150km from the capital Bras\u00edlia at 1am local time in an operation labelled Return to Homeland Brazil . They will be isolated in transit hotels on the airbase, which according to local media will have access to video games, internet and the opportunity to watch military bands play live outside. Roberto Naves, the mayor of An\u00e1polis, which is in the mid-western state of Goi\u00e1s, told local radio that residents of the city of 362,000 had first been apprehensive about hosting the evacuees but had no reason to worry. But in a note, Sandro Mabel, the president of Goi\u00e1s industry federation, called the quarantine a \u201cdisaster for the state\u201d, arguing that they should be hosted somewhere else. \u201cWe could suffer segregation of what is produced in Goi\u00e1s, affecting the export of processed products and meat, for example,\u201d he wrote. Ronaldo Caiado, Goi\u00e1s\u2019 conservative governor and a staunch Bolsonaro ally, told reporters that Mabel\u2019s comments were \u201cinhumane\u201d and called him a \u201cscoundrel\u201d. Also travelling on the two planes from Wuhan were four Poles and a Chinese national, who disembarked during refuelling in Warsaw, Poland. The Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported that Brazil had refused to evacuate citizens from neighbouring South American nations including Argentina, Bolivia and Colombia. In the article, one Argentinian diplomat speculated the preference for the Poles was \u201cideological\u201d, with Bolsonaro favouring Poland\u2019s Christian nationalist government. Brazil\u2019s foreign office \u2013 led by minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, who believes climate change is a Marxist plot \u2013 refuted the claims saying there was not sufficient space and that Poland offered authorisation to refuel first. Brazil declared the coronavirus a public health emergency earlier this week. According to the health ministry, there are eight possible coronavirus cases being monitored, while 24 cases have been dismissed. The ministry has also been issuing regular online warnings about \u201cfake news\u201d relating to the virus, with one of the latest being that it is \u201csimilar to HIV\u201d and \u201cwas created in a lab\u201d. Meanwhile, a woman in Rio de Janeiro was arrested for faking coronavirus symptoms and saying she had recently returned from Hong Kong in an attempt to jump the queue at a local health clinic.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for reading. And while you digest the full-time results, head over to John Brewin\u2019s minute-by-minute updates from Brighton v Watford: In League Two, Swindon stay top but their lead has been halved from four points to two after being held 1-1 by Carlisle. In the mayhem of whirling vidiprinters spewing out full-time results, Crewe popped up with a late, late winner (yep, well worthy of two lates as it was recorded as 90+7) at home to Oldham. That 2-1 win put them just two back from Swindon and, wouldn\u2019t you know it, they have a game in hand too. In League One, Wycombe end the day three back from leaders Rotherham after a 3-1 win over Bristol Rovers. Sunderland 1-0 Ipswich was a key result. It puts Sunderland into the top six and drops Ipswich to seventh and outside the play-off spots. Nottingham Forest team news: Samba, Cash, Worrall, Figueiredo, Ribeiro, Watson, Slow, Lolley, Silva, Ameobi, Grabban. Subs: Muric, Bong, Diakhaby, Jenkinson, Dawson, Yates, Walker. Here\u2019s the Leeds line-up for the trip to Nottingham Forest... So, over to you Leeds. Worst fears were realised for the Whites with wins for the chasing pack today. Fulham now trail Leeds only on goal difference after grinding out a 1-0 win at Blackburn while Brentford are up to fourth and just two points back after coming through a goal-laden second half to beat Middlesbrough 3-2. Leeds can get get some breathing space again by beating Nottingham Forest in the 5.30pm kick-off but if the hosts take victory then they\u2019ll be just one behind Marco Bielsa\u2019s side. If Leeds win, they\u2019ll go two clear again of West Brom, who travel to Millwall tomorrow. And here\u2019s how it ended... Championship Wigan 1-2 Preston Barnsley 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday Blackburn 0-1 Fulham Brentford 3-2 Middlesbrough Huddersfield 2-0 QPR Luton 0-1 Cardiff Reading 1-1 Hull Stoke 3-1 Charlton Swansea 2-3 Derby League One AFC Wimbledon 1-2 Fleetwood Blackpool 2-1 Southend Burton 0-0 Gillingham Coventry 2-1 Bolton Doncaster 1-1 Rochdale Peterborough 4-0 Oxford Utd Shrewsbury 1-1 MK Dons Sunderland 1-0 Ipswich Tranmere 0-2 Portsmouth Wycombe 3-1 Bristol Rovers League Two Bradford 1-1 Grimsby Carlisle 1-1 Swindon Colchester 3-0 Plymouth Crewe 2-1 Oldham Exeter 2-1 Stevenage Forest Green 1-2 Walsall Leyton Orient 1-1 Macclesfield Morecambe 1-1 Mansfield Newport 0-1 Cambridge Utd Northampton 0-1 Port Vale Salford 0-0 Crawley Scunthorpe 1-0 Cheltenham Scottish FA Cup fifth round Hamilton 1-4 Rangers Aberdeen 0-0 Kilmarnock Ayr 1-2 St. Johnstone Inverness CT 1-0 Livingston St. Mirren 1-1 Motherwell Bit of a sickener for Bradford as Grimsby\u2019s Luke Hendrie equalises in the second minute of added time. 1-1. Late goal in League One as Maxime Biamou puts Coventry 2-1 up on Bolton. That live Championship table then... West Brom 56 Leeds 55 Fulham 55 Brentford 53 Gulp! The top two have a game in hand but surely teams want actual points on the board rather than theoretical opportunities to win them at this stage of the campaign. Worst fears realised for Leeds fans as Brentford go back in front against Middlesbrough and there\u2019s just three minutes plus stoppage time remaining. Ollie Watkins gets the goal in what we\u2019re surely calling a five-goal thriller. Drama in Exeter. Basement dwellers Stevenage level through Daniel Kemp in the 79th minute but Matt Jay restores Exeter\u2019s lead on 81. The hosts will end the say second in League Two if they see this out. A goal for Bradford to greet Stuart McCall\u2019s 27th stint in charge of the West Yorkshire outfit. The Bantams lead Grimsby 1-0 thanks to Lee Novak\u2019s 80th-minute goal. More goals in the Championship! Mallik Wilks levels for Hull at Reading (1-1) while Derby are now 3-2 up at Swansea via Tom Lawrence having trailed 2-1 at the hour mark. The live League One table now shows Sunderland in the top six after the Black Cats take an 81st-minute lead at home to fourth-placed Ipswich. Chris Maguire sparks the scenes of jubilation. Dennis Politic - great name - gives bottom side Bolton a 1-1 equaliser at Coventry, who had been 1-0 up from the third minute. Back to the Scottish FA Cup fifth round and St. Mirren are level at home to Motherwell. Alex Jakubiak restores parity (1-1) with 16 minutes remaining. Full-times from the early afternoon games in the German Bundesliga: Freiburg 1-0 Hoffenheim Hertha Berlin 1-3 Mainz Schalke 1-1 Paderborn Werder Bremen 0-2 Union Berlin Wolfsburg 1-1 Dusseldorf Schalke miss the chance to close on the top four after conceding an 81st-minute equaliser at bottom side Paderborn. GOALS! More to report and let\u2019s start at Stoke where Nick Powell has given the hosts a 3-1 lead at home to Charlton. In League Two, the journey home for leaders Swindon is set to be a little muted now after Carlisle pull level via Aaron Hayden. The deadlock is broken at Ewood Park and no prizes who gets the Fulham goal. Yes, it\u2019s Aleksandar Mitrovic with his 20th Championship goal of the season. Leeds fans\u2019 nerves in shreds and their game hasn\u2019t even kicked off. As it stands, Fulham are now level with the Yorkshire outfit on 55 points. And another goal at Brentford. Leeds fans unmoved, muttering that Brentford will inevitably go back in front shortly. The goal spree continues as the third in five minutes and second equaliser for the visitors comes from Ashley Fletcher. 2-2. Everywhere you look in the Championship there\u2019s a goal. The latest to join this onion bag festival are Huddersfield, who go 1-0 up on QPR through Elias Kachunga. A chorus of \u201cbloody knew its\u201d in Leeds as Brentford quickly restore their advantage. Bryan Mbeumo puts the hosts 2-1 up. It\u2019s a complete turnaround at Swansea as Wayne Routledge gives them a 2-1 lead at home to Derby. Whoops of joy in Leeds as Brentford are pegged back by Middlesbrough. Lewis Wing gets the goal. It\u2019s all happening in the Championship now as Swansea level things up at home to Derby. Yan Dhanda\u2019s 56th-minute strike makes it 1-1. Another goal in the Championship as Reading break the deadlock at home to Hull via Jordan Obita. Some breathing space for Portsmouth in League One as Ryan Williams gives the visitors a 2-0 lead at Tranmere. If Pompey hang on, they\u2019ll be six points behind leaders Rotherham but with two games in hand. GOAL! Our wishes are granted as Tom Ince nets in the 47th-minute to restore Stoke\u2019s lead at home to Charlton. 2-1 to the Potters. \u201cInce looked offside but the flag stayed down,\u201d squawks their Twitter page. That\u2019s his first goal since August when he scored against... Charlton. Beautiful symmetry from son of Paul. Back underway in today\u2019s 3pm games. Hopefully some more goals in the Championship in this second 45. This seems to sum up Fulham\u2019s goalless first half at Blackburn... Brentford are currently third in the live Championship table after taking a 1-0 half-time lead against Middlesbrough. In La Liga, third-placed Getafe are in action at home to Valencia but it\u2019s 0-0 at the break. Fifth round Hamilton 1-4 Rangers (R) Aberdeen 0-0 Kilmarnock Ayr 1-2 St. Johnstone Inverness CT 0-0 Livingston St. Mirren 0-1 Motherwell Championship Wigan 1-2 Preston (R) Barnsley 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday (R) Blackburn 0-0 Fulham Brentford 1-0 Middlesbrough Huddersfield 0-0 QPR Luton 0-0 Cardiff Reading 0-0 Hull Stoke 1-1 Charlton Swansea 0-1 Derby League One AFC Wimbledon 1-1 Fleetwood Blackpool 1-0 Southend Burton 0-0 Gillingham Coventry 1-0 Bolton Doncaster 1-0 Rochdale Peterborough 1-0 Oxford Utd Shrewsbury 0-0 MK Dons Sunderland 0-0 Ipswich Tranmere 0-1 Portsmouth Wycombe 3-1 Bristol Rovers League Two Bradford 0-0 Grimsby Carlisle 0-1 Swindon Colchester 3-0 Plymouth Crewe 0-0 Oldham Exeter 1-0 Stevenage Forest Green 0-0 Walsall Leyton Orient 0-0 Macclesfield Morecambe 0-0 Mansfield Newport 0-0 Cambridge Utd Northampton 0-0 Port Vale Salford 0-0 Crawley Scunthorpe 1-0 Cheltenham Half-times rolling in but we have an injury-time goal in the Championship as Ben Purrington levels for Charlton at Stoke. 1-1. Action in Germany and here\u2019s a bit of a laugh. Wolfsburg are reduced to 10 men as Marin Pongracic is sent off but two minutes later they equalise at home to Fortuna Dusseldorf through Renato Steffen. GOALS! Some notable strikes in League One and Two. Second-placed Wycombe are 2-1 in front against Bristol Rovers while the live League Two table shows Exeter up to second thanks to Randell Williams giving them a 1-0 lead at home to Stevenage. And as my fingers wander over the keyboard, Wycombe now lead 3-1 thanks to Matt Bloomfield. Two in the space of three minutes for the hosts. More misery for third-placed Plymouth in League Two as Theo Robinson\u2019s second of the afternoon gives Colchester a 3-0 lead inside 36 minutes. Still just three goals in the seven Championship kick-offs. Brentford, Stoke and Derby are the trio to have given their fans a first-half roar. Over to Europe now and Serie A where Ruslan Malinovskyi has given Champions League last 16\u2019s Atalanta a 2-1 lead at Fiorentina. GOALS! Callum Hendry puts St. Johnstone 2-1 up at Ayr in the Scottish Cup while improving Stoke take the lead at home to Charlton. It\u2019s James McClean with the goal and they\u2019re up to 19th in the live standings. In League One, Jayden Mitchell-Lawson gives Bristol Rovers an equaliser (1-1) at Wycombe and in League Two Theo Robinson\u2019s strike doubles Colchester\u2019s lead at home to Plymouth. 2-0. Brentford break the deadlock as Julian Jeanvier gives the Bees a 24th-minute lead. As it stands, the hosts would move up to third, just two behind Leeds and three adrift of West Brom. A scrappy goal and goalline technology has to alert the ref that the ball had crossed the line. Another goal in the Scottish Cup with Mark O\u2019Hara putting Motherwell 1-0 in front at St. Mirren. Lack of goals in the Championship so far. Fulham (at Blackburn) and Brentford (home to Middlesbrough) have the chance to close the gap on top two West Brom and Leeds but no goals so far in both those fixtures after 22 minutes. In the Scottish Cup fifth round, Aaron Muirhead\u2019s own goal has gifted St. Johnstone an equaliser at Ayr. 1-1. Half-time scores in Germany: Binary in Bundesliga... Freiburg 1-0 Hoffenheim Hertha Berlin 0-1 Mainz Schalke 0-0 Paderborn Werder Bremen 0-0 Union Berlin Wolfsburg 0-1 Dusseldorf A match report from Rangers\u2019 4-1 Scottish Cup win: GOALS! Martyn Waghorn puts Derby 1-0 up at Swansea in the Championship while Rarmani Edmonds-Green has given League Two leaders Swindon an early advantage at Carlisle. Not so good for third-placed Plymouth though as they trail Colchester 1-0 after a 14th-minute strike from Ben Stevenson. GOAL! Wycombe 1-0 Bristol Rovers (Akinfenwa 9) Wycombe have a game in hand on League One\u2019s six-point leaders Rotherham and they\u2019re on track to cut it in half after Adebayo Akinfenway\u2019s early goal. Back to the Scottish Cup and Aaron Drinan has put Ayr 1-0 up on St. Johnstone at Somerset Park. Another goal for a home team in League One, well sort of, as Coventry go 1-0 up on bottom side Bolton. It comes from Sierra Leone\u2019s Amadou Bakayoko. GOAL! The first of the day in the 3pm games and Doncaster lead Rochdale 1-0 through Duran Duran bass player Jon Taylor. Peeeep! The 3pm games are underway. We also have fifth-round Scottish Cup action and Rangers have moved into the last eight after beating Hamilton Academical 4-1. Sounds easy but Steven Gerrard\u2019s side were being held 1-1 by the hosts with a quarter of the game remaining before pulling away. Just over an hour gone in the other early Championship game and it\u2019s 1-1 between local rivals Barnsley and Sheffield Wednesday. Josh Windass (16) put the visitors ahead but the lead lasted just eight minutes before Cauley Woodrow equalised for the Tykes. In Germany, top two Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig meet tomorrow. Here\u2019s a preview from Marcus Christenson: In League One, Matt Crooks\u2019 10th goal of the season took Rotherham six points clear in League One after a 1-0 win at Lincoln last night. Wycombe will hope to narrow the gap to three again by scoring a home win over Bristol Rovers, one of 10 games kicking off at 3pm in the third tier. Swindon start the day with a four-point lead in League Two. They face the long trip north to Carlisle. While the difference between first and second in the Premier League is 22 points, that same gap in the Championship covers the top 18 teams. It\u2019s particularly tight at the top and, ahead of the six 3pm kick-offs, there are seven teams separated by by just six points. Leaders West Brom (56 points) play Millwall tomorrow while Preston have just joined a trio of sides on 50 points by scoring a 2-1 win at Wigan in Saturday\u2019s early kick-off to move up to sixth. Leeds fans have a few hours before the fingernail chewing begins as their game today is a 5.30pm kick-off at fourth-placed Nottingham Forest.",

      "body": "<p>Things seem to be clicking for Derby County at just the right time. Phillip Cocu\u2019s side continue to creep up the Championship table after Tom Lawrence lashed home the winning goal in a topsy-turvy game to earn their first away league win since the opening day.</p> <p>This season has been a slow-burner for Derby but, after a victory at Swansea in which they fought back from 2-1 down, they are poised for a late play-off push. As Cocu acknowledged, it is no coincidence that their upturn in fortunes corresponds with Wayne Rooney\u2019s arrival last month, having won six of their nine matches since the former England striker pulled on a Derby shirt for the first time</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/sunderland-ipswich-league-one-match-report\">Chris Maguire pounces late to give Sunderland victory over Ipswich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think he is a decent player,\u201d joked Cocu. \u201cOf course, it is no surprise because he is a quality, class player but also a good character and a link-up between the technical staff and the players.</p> <p>\u201cWe have somebody on the pitch that when we discuss one or two options before the game, I only have to wave and call his name and then [we can change tactics] and that gives something extra to us. He speaks a lot to the young players, he gives organisation and also works together with Martyn Waghorn. He has a lot of influence on other players and the team benefits from it.\u201d</p> <p>The main beneficiaries at Derby are undoubtedly the teenage academy graduates Jason Knight and Max Bird, with the latter\u2019s driving run kickstarting the move which led to Lawrence powering in the winner 10 minutes from time. Duane Holmes, too, has relished the attacking freedom that Rooney\u2019s arrival has generated and the midfielder hammered home his third goal in six matches to equalise with half an hour to play after Swansea scored two goals in two second-half minutes to cancel out Waghorn\u2019s early opener.</p> <p>This was far from a Rooney masterclass but there is no denying his impact, with the 34-year-old racking up another 90 minutes here \u2013 he has missed only 17 minutes of action across Derby\u2019s nine matches this year. \u201cIt is easier for him now because when he joined us [as a player-coach in December] he was a lot in our office and we gave him all the insights into how we worked. We don\u2019t have any secrets \u2013 I\u2019m happy to be very open \u2013 but still he is one of the let\u2019s say coaches during the games. Now he has seen how we work and is playing so his influence is only getting bigger and of course the team benefits from a world-class player like Rooney.\u201d</p> <p>Derby remain seven points off the play-off places but they have wrestled themselves into the chasing pack and on Wednesday travel to Bristol City, who also have their eyes fixed on a top-six finish, looking to extend their impressive form. Lee Johnson was among the interested spectators here and will surely have noted that his side cannot allow Lawrence as much room as Swansea did to strike. It was the rebound from Lawrence\u2019s rasping shot that Waghorn scooped up after eight minutes to fire in the opener and the Wales international had the final say after goals by half-time substitute Yan Dhanda and Kyle Naughton had put Swansea into pole position.</p> <p>\u201cWe have got to be careful that if we don\u2019t start winning games the gap will get bigger and bigger, we\u2019re aware of that,\u201d said the Swansea manager Steve Cooper, whose side are four points adrift of the play-off places. \u201cWe have to react on Tuesday [against QPR]. We are in a part of the season where we have to win games, especially at home. It is frustrating because we shot ourselves in the foot, rather than make Derby work really hard to earn it.\u201d</p>",

As Cocu acknowledged, it is no coincidence that their upturn in fortunes corresponds with Wayne Rooney\u2019s arrival last month, having won six of their nine matches since the former England striker pulled on a Derby shirt for the first time \u201cI think he is a decent player,\u201d joked Cocu. \u201cOf course, it is no surprise because he is a quality, class player but also a good character and a link-up between the technical staff and the players. \u201cWe have somebody on the pitch that when we discuss one or two options before the game, I only have to wave and call his name and then [we can change tactics] and that gives something extra to us. He speaks a lot to the young players, he gives organisation and also works together with Martyn Waghorn. He has a lot of influence on other players and the team benefits from it.\u201d The main beneficiaries at Derby are undoubtedly the teenage academy graduates Jason Knight and Max Bird, with the latter\u2019s driving run kickstarting the move which led to Lawrence powering in the winner 10 minutes from time. Duane Holmes, too, has relished the attacking freedom that Rooney\u2019s arrival has generated and the midfielder hammered home his third goal in six matches to equalise with half an hour to play after Swansea scored two goals in two second-half minutes to cancel out Waghorn\u2019s early opener. This was far from a Rooney masterclass but there is no denying his impact, with the 34-year-old racking up another 90 minutes here \u2013 he has missed only 17 minutes of action across Derby\u2019s nine matches this year. \u201cIt is easier for him now because when he joined us [as a player-coach in December] he was a lot in our office and we gave him all the insights into how we worked. We don\u2019t have any secrets \u2013 I\u2019m happy to be very open \u2013 but still he is one of the let\u2019s say coaches during the games. Now he has seen how we work and is playing so his influence is only getting bigger and of course the team benefits from a world-class player like Rooney.\u201d Derby remain seven points off the play-off places but they have wrestled themselves into the chasing pack and on Wednesday travel to Bristol City, who also have their eyes fixed on a top-six finish, looking to extend their impressive form. Lee Johnson was among the interested spectators here and will surely have noted that his side cannot allow Lawrence as much room as Swansea did to strike. It was the rebound from Lawrence\u2019s rasping shot that Waghorn scooped up after eight minutes to fire in the opener and the Wales international had the final say after goals by half-time substitute Yan Dhanda and Kyle Naughton had put Swansea into pole position. \u201cWe have got to be careful that if we don\u2019t start winning games the gap will get bigger and bigger, we\u2019re aware of that,\u201d said the Swansea manager Steve Cooper, whose side are four points adrift of the play-off places. \u201cWe have to react on Tuesday [against QPR]. We are in a part of the season where we have to win games, especially at home. It is frustrating because we shot ourselves in the foot, rather than make Derby work really hard to earn it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A nine-year-old British child diagnosed with coronavirus is in hospital in France. The child is one of five Britons who tested positive for the virus. Another six UK nationals are being kept under observation in French hospitals. The group had been staying in two apartments in a ski chalet in the Haute-Savoie region in the eastern French Alps when they were visited by a Briton who had been in Singapore and was found to have the virus when he returned to the UK at the end of last month. The French health minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said none of the patients were in a serious condition. She described the new outbreak as a \u201ccluster, grouping around one original case\u201d. Jean-Yves Grall, the head of the regional health authority, told journalists the child lived in the ski resort with their parents and two siblings. The child\u2019s mother was in the UK taking exams and the children were with their father. The six other Britons were in a second apartment in the same chalet. He did not give details of where the visitor believed to have brought the virus from Singapore had stayed. The local health authority is disinfecting the building and is searching for anyone who might have come into contact with the group. Grall said the infected child had attended school in Les Contamines-Montjoie and had recently spent a day at a second school in the nearby town of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains. He said the schools would be shut next week as the authorities tried to determine with whom the child had come into contact. \u00c9tienne Jacquet, the mayor of Les Contamines-Montjoie, said: \u201cI was called by the regional health agency at 12.30am [on Saturday] about two British families. Seven were in one chalet and four in another. Of the 11 people, five have tested positive for the coronavirus.\u201d \u00c9douard Philippe, the French prime minister, called a meeting of health ministers on Saturday and the ministry has opened a UK hotline (0800 100 379) in an attempt to find out who else may have been in contact with the Britons. Buzyn said: \u201cWe\u2019re starting an important operation to identify cases of those in contact. \u201cThat original case was brought to our attention last night. It is a British national who had returned from Singapore where he had stayed between 20 and 23 January, and he arrived in France on 24 January for four days.\u201d As well as the five who tested positive for the virus, the others were being kept under surveillance in hospitals in Lyon, Saint Etienne and Grenoble. The Briton at the origin of the cluster returned to the UK on 28 January, a French health official said. Grenoble hospital said it was not authorised to give any more information. The local newspaper Le Dauphin\u00e9, reported that Marie-Charlotte Pasquier of the Les Contamines-Montjoie tourist office had spent the morning reassuring tourists in the resort. There has been no public announcement but the town hall has been distributing leaflets with advice on how to avoid transmitting coronavirus. Local doctors have sent a consignment of disinfectant and face masks to the town hall. Pasquier said: \u201cWe are in permanent contact with the local health authorities and have put in place a number where people can contact and ask questions and a doctor will reply. We are there to inform and reassure people.\u201d The latest outbreak brings the total number of people infected with the virus in France to 11. Health officials said some of the original six cases, who are being treated in hospital in Paris and Bordeaux, were ready to be released. This Saturday is one of the busiest days of the year for French ski resorts because it is the start of school holidays in the Paris region. The February holidays in France begin on three consecutive Saturdays and are staggered over five weeks. At a newsagents shop in Les Contamines-Montjoie one resident said local people were worried. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the news but the disinformation that\u2019s worrying,\u201d she said. Other shops and hotels referred callers to the local town hall. Les Contamines-Montjoie, 75 minutes from Geneva and sitting between Chamonix and Meg\u00e8ve, has a population of about 1,160 people, which increases during the tourist season in winter. It is close to Mont Blanc and popular with mountaineers and skiiers. The word contamines does not mean \u201ccontaminated\u201d as some supposed on social media but \u201cploughable land on the squire\u2019s estate\u201d. Meanwhile, a student in Brighton has been told to self-isolate after a confirmed case of coronavirus, according to Sky News. The middle-aged man was the first British national to contract the virus after he travelled to the UK from Singapore. In a message sent to parents on Friday, Portslade Aldridge community academy (Paca) said: \u201cToday we have been contacted by a parent of a student at Paca who was contacted by Public Health England as part of their investigation concerning the confirmed case that was reported in the press yesterday. \u201cWe have been informed by the parent that they have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate their child at home for 14 days. If at any point the child is found to be symptomatic we will be notified.\u201d Four members of a British family living in Mallorca are being tested for coronavirus after coming into contact with a person who recently tested positive for the virus in France. The Balearic Islands health department said the father of the family had gone to Mallorca\u2019s Son Espases hospital after feeling ill and was placed in isolation. His partner and their two daughters were being evaluated in the same hospital. The health department said it had activated its coronavirus protocol. \u201cIn accordance with professional guidelines, the man remains in isolation and all members of the family have been tested and the tests sent to a laboratory. All remain at the hospital,\u201d it said. The department urged people to remain calm while the tests were carried out and said it was working closely with Spain\u2019s health ministry. Spain confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on 31 January after a man was diagnosed on the remote La Gomera island in the Canaries. The patient is part of a group of five people in isolation and under observation on the island after it emerged they had come into contact with a German man diagnosed with the virus. US officials have announced that a 60-year-old citizen had become the first foreign victim of the coronavirus in China. A Japanese man also died in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, having had symptoms consistent with the disease. A US embassy spokesman in Beijing told Reuters: \u201cWe offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss. Out of respect for the family\u2019s privacy, we have no further comment.\u201d A British man with the virus is said to be feeling well and in good spirits after being transferred from the cruise ship Diamond Princess to hospital in Japan. Alan Steele, of Wolverhampton, who was on honeymoon on the ship, was moved to hospital on Friday while his wife, Wendy Marshall Steele, remained onboard. She had been in telephone contact with her husband and said on Saturday that he was still feeling healthy. \u201cAlan is well, Japanese doctors are excellent,\u201d she posted on Facebook. \u201cHe is in a little room. Just doctor and nurse visit him.\u201d She said she was also doing well but had \u201ccabin fever\u201d as she continued to be confined to her room on the ship. There are nearly 3,700 other passengers and crew being quarantined on the ship. They have been offered access to mental health counselling and enhanced internet access. In a video posted on Twitter, Rai Caluori, the executive vice-president at Princess Cruises, said: \u201cWe recognise that a situation like this can create unprecedented stress, so we\u2019re also offering our guests and crew specialised telephonic mental health counselling if they should be experiencing such stress and mental health issues.\u201d",

It\u2019s mood-altering and life-enhancing, and whether you\u2019re looking to cast a cosy glow or light up your living space, it\u2019s often the quickest way to refresh a room without lifting a paint brush. Even a stand-alone floor or table lamp can provide direct pools of light and a welcome glow where it\u2019s needed.</p> <p>The spherical design of <strong>Cult Furniture\u2019s Abel 3 Globe</strong> floor lamp not only looks good, but will warmly illuminate the space. If you are balancing out grander fixtures, try more subtle and cosy lighting with directional elements, such as <strong>H&amp;M\u2019s gold cylindrical metal table lamp</strong>, or opt for the nifty design of the <strong>Bover Beddy LED wall lamp</strong> with its moulded shelf. It\u2019s great for bedtime reading as you can angle the light wherever it\u2019s needed.</p> <p>Adding a playful and decorative flourish will also help set the tone. Channel a surrealist feel with unusual bases with <strong>Next\u2019s Peacock floor lamp</strong>. Glare-free is usually the way to go, especially in a bathroom \u2013 nobody wants to highlight the top of their head in a mirror. Place lights evenly on either side instead. The <strong>Artemide Dioscuri</strong> can be used on the wall or ceiling. In the bedroom choose a warm and relaxing directional LED, or switch on to the current trend for portable USB chargeable lamps, such as the <strong>Marset Bicoca</strong>, which works well as a bedside light with three dimming settings and an adjustable shade. It\u2019s perfect for picking up and plonking down wherever you are.</p> <p><strong>On your shopping list: 1.

Don\u2019t rule out cheap LEDs. Ikea\u2019s Ryet uses about 85% less energy than a regular bulb and lasts up to 15,000 hours, all for just \u00a31.</p> <p><strong>4. </strong>LEDs really are the lights of the future: Philips\u2019 Hue White and Colour Ambience bulbs are smart LEDs that will radiate different colours and change in hue as they respond to the sound of your voice.</p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Get the right bulb brightness by comparing lumens instead of watts. The higher the lumens, the brighter the bulb. If you need help with conversion: 450 lumens = 40 watts; 1,000 lumens = 75 watts; 2,600 lumens = 150 watts.</p> <p><strong>6. </strong>Choose the right shape of bulb, as each one provides a different spread and angle of light.

      "bodyText": "Lighting up: soft focus, portable and directional, lamps will enhance the ambience of any room Lighting can be used in many ways to transform and illuminate a home. It\u2019s mood-altering and life-enhancing, and whether you\u2019re looking to cast a cosy glow or light up your living space, it\u2019s often the quickest way to refresh a room without lifting a paint brush. Even a stand-alone floor or table lamp can provide direct pools of light and a welcome glow where it\u2019s needed. The spherical design of Cult Furniture\u2019s Abel 3 Globe floor lamp not only looks good, but will warmly illuminate the space. If you are balancing out grander fixtures, try more subtle and cosy lighting with directional elements, such as H&amp;M\u2019s gold cylindrical metal table lamp, or opt for the nifty design of the Bover Beddy LED wall lamp with its moulded shelf. It\u2019s great for bedtime reading as you can angle the light wherever it\u2019s needed. Adding a playful and decorative flourish will also help set the tone. Channel a surrealist feel with unusual bases with Next\u2019s Peacock floor lamp. Glare-free is usually the way to go, especially in a bathroom \u2013 nobody wants to highlight the top of their head in a mirror. Place lights evenly on either side instead. The Artemide Dioscuri can be used on the wall or ceiling. In the bedroom choose a warm and relaxing directional LED, or switch on to the current trend for portable USB chargeable lamps, such as the Marset Bicoca, which works well as a bedside light with three dimming settings and an adjustable shade. It\u2019s perfect for picking up and plonking down wherever you are. On your shopping list: 1. Tripode \u00a3518, Santa and Cole 2. Abel \u00a3129 Cult Furniture 3. Java \u00a369, Made 4.

Milano Tripod \u00a366, Maisons du Monde In the swing: pendants and modern chandeliers can be functional and practical works of art If you don\u2019t want your dinner lit up like a crime scene, you can shun LED ceiling spotlights above dining tables and turn on to designs such as the Secto Octo pendant. Handmade in Finland from sustainably sourced birch, it hangs as a trio over your table and will transform a flat, lifeless space into a calming dining den. Or choose a metallic finish, such as brass and copper. The long shimmering Bolha pendants from Heal\u2019s will add some glam and help differentiate the dining space from the work zones. Practical considerations often dictate feature lighting \u2013 oversize pendants and sculptural chandeliers demand high ceilings to avoid bumping your head. Jonathan Adler\u2019s extraterrestrial Electrum Kinetic chandelier is guaranteed to turn heads wherever it hangs. But just because your ceiling is low doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t go for illuminations with impact. The Kolding Ball Cluster from BHS or Le Klint\u2019s 161 pendant will cast a light through the geometric folds of the shade. With advances in materials and technology, designers are now exploring more possibilities in lighting as art, with the bonus that the pendant looks as good when the lights are turned off. Ethereal glowing orbs, tubes and rings, often linked together like giant minimalist jewellery, softly diffuse light, with no obvious source, adapting to all rooms and styles of interior. Lee Broom\u2019s Orion is a beautiful example. Each piece can be personalised to create bespoke constellations of light with infinite adaptations. A less expensive but still luxe-looking option is Made\u2019s Remi Pendant with its clouded opal white glass in a brushed brass ring. On your shopping list: 1. Kolding \u00a3180, BHS 2.

Claiming he was practising \u201cdefensive medicine\u201d, he gave healthy women under 25 smear tests (generally performed by a nurse) and performed unnecessary breast examinations on women under 50. Shah breached NHS guidelines by not offering a chaperone for intimate examinations and didn\u2019t always wear gloves. He left one patient entirely naked on the table. The youngest of his victims was 15, and her experiences left her \u201canxious, fearful and shaking\u201d and afraid of visiting doctors.</p> <p>In some ways, this case serves as a masterclass in determined and manipulative abuse. Shah would frighten patients about their family medical history. At other times, he\u2019d mention celebrities such as Angelina Jolie (who underwent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/24/angelina-jolie-surgery-heralded-ovarian-cancer-doctors\" title=\"\">a preventive double mastectomy</a> after testing positive for the BRCA gene mutation) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/22/jade-goody-obituary\" title=\"\">Jade Goody</a> (who died in 2009 from cervical cancer). There it is \u2013 the contempt. And not just for those patients, for all women \u2013 including Jolie and Goody, whose suffering he so cynically exploited.</p> <p>Here, you could make a guess at Shah\u2019s thought processes \u2013 dazzle patients with celebrity names and they\u2019ll let you do anything you want. What rot. Those patients would have instinctively trusted Shah, not because he bandied around famous names, but because he was a doctor.</p> <p>Who are these people who put themselves in positions of trust but can\u2019t be trusted? Maybe that\u2019s part of the problem \u2013 the automatic deference given to medical professionals leading, in some, to a weaponised sense of entitlement. Characters such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/04/ian-paterson-inquiry-culture-of-denial-allowed-rogue-breast-surgery\" title=\"\">Ian Paterson</a>, the breast surgeon given 20 years in 2017, who subjected more than 1,000 patients to unnecessary and damaging surgery, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paterson-inquiry-report\" title=\"\">an inquiry</a> last week citing \u201ca culture of avoidance and denial\u201d in a \u201cdysfunctional\u201d healthcare system.</p> <p>Such cases shatter trust in the medical profession, just as trust has been destroyed in myriad other areas, from the clergy to the care system to education. Now, it seems, women aren\u2019t even able to walk into their GP surgery to normally, routinely, discuss their health. They have to be wary and alert and, if they require an intimate examination by a male GP, should seriously consider the option of a chaperone and fight against that all-powerful female urge not to be \u201cdemanding\u201d, not to make a \u201cfuss\u201d.</p> <p>Is this the future \u2013 mandatory chaperoned medicine between the sexes? All that extra expense for the NHS, and pressure on patients, just because some men abuse their power? Well, if that\u2019s what it takes\u2026 People see medics when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable \u2013 they <em>need</em> to feel safe. Now women know that their GP surgery could be just another unsafe space to deal with.</p> <h2>When the going gets tough, the desperate start growing beards</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1913bacda0533b8a8ea9e54a6bfcfa78080375b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1913bacda0533b8a8ea9e54a6bfcfa78080375b6/0_12_3095_1857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Harry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Harry: taking it on the chin/</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seems that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/06/stubble-in-mind-what-growing-a-crisis-beard-represents\" title=\"\">men who suddenly sport beards</a> may be trying to tell us something and it\u2019s not just: \u201cI can\u2019t find the razor.\u201d</p> <p>The US website Vox coined the phrase \u201ccrisis beard\u201d for face-fluff that sprouts under extreme pressure. For instance, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has been getting hairier with each new political crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/14/worlddispatch.julianborger\" title=\"\">Al Gore</a> grew a beard after losing the presidency to George W Bush. David Letterman morphed into Grizzly Adams when he stopped doing his chatshow. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mh1_jdK-9E\" title=\"\">Prince Harry</a> also has a beard: he had it before he married Meghan Markle, but don\u2019t be alarmed \u2013 this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t blame her for it.</p> <p>Crisis beards are thought to be about rebellion, individualism and deep, existential despair. Respect to men. Women also express themselves via hair, but only men can cover two-thirds of their faces with anguished cries for help from their very souls.</p> <p>It\u2019s also interesting to see politicos go this route. The crisis beard could be the chic new way to express political anxiety, sorrow and humility. Which is all very timely, after just reading that the former prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/david-cameron-accounts-brexit-vote-2016\" title=\"\">David Cameron has made \u00a31.6m</a> (at least!) since his Brexit resignation.

While deepfakes already exist in porn, often that is to humiliate real people, grafting their heads on to bodies. This would be about replacing humans altogether, stopping the exploitation and degradation of real-life porn workers, the rationale being that, whatever happens during porn wouldn\u2019t matter because the women wouldn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>This is being viewed as a Good Thing, but is it really? Women <em>already</em> don\u2019t exist in any valid way in porn. They may be there bodily; otherwise, they\u2019re mere ciphers for an increasingly normalised hardcore roster of male sexual demands. Female behaviour, language and reactions are performed to order for the exclusive satisfaction of men. Female sexual autonomy is nowhere to be found: desire is faked, or explicitly unwanted, such as in hugely popular rape porn, where female fear and distress are the chief erotic components.</p> <p>Deepfaked visuals wouldn\u2019t render porn ethical, because the mentality would still be there. While you could fake the imagery, it would be impossible to computer-generate away the violent and misogynistic mindset that drives porn. You would not stop porn warping and damaging male minds in the real world, where all the real women live.</p> <p>If realistic deepfake \u201cmen\u201d could be depicted gang-raping a realistic deepfake \u201cwoman\u201d, how does this improve anything for real women? If nothing is real, and anything goes, porn imagery could even become worse, further sexualising and trivialising the rape, battery and murder of women. The safety and wellbeing of vulnerable porn-workers is extremely important, but how porn is made is not the end of the story. It\u2019s also about the harmful messages and imagery it sends out into the world, and the damage that wreaks, however it\u2019s produced.</p> <p>\u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist</p>",

At other times, he\u2019d mention celebrities such as Angelina Jolie (who underwent a preventive double mastectomy after testing positive for the BRCA gene mutation) and Jade Goody (who died in 2009 from cervical cancer). There it is \u2013 the contempt. And not just for those patients, for all women \u2013 including Jolie and Goody, whose suffering he so cynically exploited. Here, you could make a guess at Shah\u2019s thought processes \u2013 dazzle patients with celebrity names and they\u2019ll let you do anything you want. What rot. Those patients would have instinctively trusted Shah, not because he bandied around famous names, but because he was a doctor. Who are these people who put themselves in positions of trust but can\u2019t be trusted? Maybe that\u2019s part of the problem \u2013 the automatic deference given to medical professionals leading, in some, to a weaponised sense of entitlement. Characters such as Ian Paterson, the breast surgeon given 20 years in 2017, who subjected more than 1,000 patients to unnecessary and damaging surgery, an inquiry last week citing \u201ca culture of avoidance and denial\u201d in a \u201cdysfunctional\u201d healthcare system. Such cases shatter trust in the medical profession, just as trust has been destroyed in myriad other areas, from the clergy to the care system to education. Now, it seems, women aren\u2019t even able to walk into their GP surgery to normally, routinely, discuss their health. They have to be wary and alert and, if they require an intimate examination by a male GP, should seriously consider the option of a chaperone and fight against that all-powerful female urge not to be \u201cdemanding\u201d, not to make a \u201cfuss\u201d. Is this the future \u2013 mandatory chaperoned medicine between the sexes? All that extra expense for the NHS, and pressure on patients, just because some men abuse their power? Well, if that\u2019s what it takes\u2026 People see medics when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable \u2013 they need to feel safe. Now women know that their GP surgery could be just another unsafe space to deal with. When the going gets tough, the desperate start growing beards It seems that men who suddenly sport beards may be trying to tell us something and it\u2019s not just: \u201cI can\u2019t find the razor.\u201d The US website Vox coined the phrase \u201ccrisis beard\u201d for face-fluff that sprouts under extreme pressure. For instance, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has been getting hairier with each new political crisis. Al Gore grew a beard after losing the presidency to George W Bush. David Letterman morphed into Grizzly Adams when he stopped doing his chatshow. Prince Harry also has a beard: he had it before he married Meghan Markle, but don\u2019t be alarmed \u2013 this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t blame her for it. Crisis beards are thought to be about rebellion, individualism and deep, existential despair. Respect to men. Women also express themselves via hair, but only men can cover two-thirds of their faces with anguished cries for help from their very souls. It\u2019s also interesting to see politicos go this route. The crisis beard could be the chic new way to express political anxiety, sorrow and humility. Which is all very timely, after just reading that the former prime minister David Cameron has made \u00a31.6m (at least!) since his Brexit resignation. Why is this man still clean shaven? Mr Cameron, you owe the UK a beard. Make it a big one. Computer-generated porn is as degrading as the real thing Are women meant to cheer because the violent porn of the future may be computer-generated? An algorithm has been developed to produce deep-fake images that could replace performers in porn. While deepfakes already exist in porn, often that is to humiliate real people, grafting their heads on to bodies. This would be about replacing humans altogether, stopping the exploitation and degradation of real-life porn workers, the rationale being that, whatever happens during porn wouldn\u2019t matter because the women wouldn\u2019t exist. This is being viewed as a Good Thing, but is it really? Women already don\u2019t exist in any valid way in porn. They may be there bodily; otherwise, they\u2019re mere ciphers for an increasingly normalised hardcore roster of male sexual demands. Female behaviour, language and reactions are performed to order for the exclusive satisfaction of men. Female sexual autonomy is nowhere to be found: desire is faked, or explicitly unwanted, such as in hugely popular rape porn, where female fear and distress are the chief erotic components. Deepfaked visuals wouldn\u2019t render porn ethical, because the mentality would still be there. While you could fake the imagery, it would be impossible to computer-generate away the violent and misogynistic mindset that drives porn. You would not stop porn warping and damaging male minds in the real world, where all the real women live. If realistic deepfake \u201cmen\u201d could be depicted gang-raping a realistic deepfake \u201cwoman\u201d, how does this improve anything for real women? If nothing is real, and anything goes, porn imagery could even become worse, further sexualising and trivialising the rape, battery and murder of women. The safety and wellbeing of vulnerable porn-workers is extremely important, but how porn is made is not the end of the story. It\u2019s also about the harmful messages and imagery it sends out into the world, and the damage that wreaks, however it\u2019s produced. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

His latest book is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/until-the-end-of-time-9780241295984.html\" title=\"\">Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe</a></em>.</p> <p><strong>What got you into physics?</strong><br>As a kid I had the same kinds of questions that most kids struggle with at one time or another: why am I here, how did I come to be here, is there a purpose to it all? I remember thinking that if there was an answer I would know it, because everyone would know it. But no one did. So it struck me that seeking an answer to those questions was unlikely to yield anything deeply interesting. Instead, I got interested in the context: not why am I here, but how did I come to be here? Not why is there a universe, but how did it come to be? And those questions take you to the heart of physics.</p> <p><strong>When you were a student, a gas oven exploded in your face when you tried to cook a pizza. Did it have any impact on your life as a scientist?</strong><br>It was the last experiment I ever did, and an unwitting experiment at that. I don\u2019t touch equipment. I\u2019m a theorist through and through: pens, paper, pencils, computers. Even when I was in college, I somehow managed to slip through the requirement that students had to take a laboratory course. I found a way of getting out of it. No doubt, the exploding oven was looming in the background.</p> <p><strong>Expertise has come under attack in the US and the UK in recent years. Should we be worried? </strong><br>There are questions that have right and wrong answers as opposed to opinions, and we\u2019ve unfortunately come to a place where many people don\u2019t make that distinction. It\u2019s a vital one, especially when some of the questions are going to determine the fate of humankind and the fate of the planet. The solution has to be education. We need to impress upon kids at an early age that there are ways of investigating the world that can yield demonstrable truths. That\u2019s an exciting thing for a kid to learn. And it\u2019s essential.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/25/has-physicists-gravity-theory-solved-impossible-dark-energy-riddle\">Has physicist's gravity theory solved 'impossible' dark energy riddle?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Physicists are vying to build a new particle collider to super</strong><strong>sede the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/large-hadron-collider\" title=\"\">Large Hadron Collider</a>.

I\u2019d like to think it doesn\u2019t matter in which country it\u2019s built, because it\u2019ll be a machine for all humanity. Science is this beautiful place, perhaps the sole place, where the world comes together to work shoulder-to-shoulder on questions that transcend national borders, and that\u2019s a powerful thing. Is there a fifth force? Are there other particles? Is there an explanation for why matter particles have the properties they do? In other words, is there an explanation for why reality has the properties that it does? These are the kinds of universal questions the next machine can help us answer.</p> <p><strong>If you had a time machine, where and when would you go?</strong><br>I would go forwards instead of backwards, which is a good thing because I don\u2019t think you can go backwards and I know for a fact that you can go forwards. Hanging out near the edge of a black hole is a popular technique. You spend a year near the edge and if you are close enough, you come back and it will be a billion years later. Or you go out on a rocket ship near the speed of light for six months, and turn around and come back, and depending on how close to the speed of light you travelled, when you return it\u2019ll be thousands or millions or billions of years into the future. So we know how to time travel in theory, we just don\u2019t know how to execute it in practice. I would go as far forward as the device allowed me to, because once I got there, I could always read about what happened beforehand. I would want to be in an era when there are still planets and stars. I would probably not go beyond a trillion years from now. It would be very lonely though. I would only do it if I could take my family.</p> <p><strong>In your book, you talk about the rising disorder \u2013 the increasing entropy \u2013 of the universe, and how that shapes its future. If the universe is becoming more and more disordered, why do stars, planets and people form? </strong><br>This is absolutely fundamental. The beauty of the second law of thermodynamics is that while it stipulates that the overall amount of disorder has to increase, little pockets of order can form so long as, in the process, they create enough disorder in the surrounding environment to compensate. For stars and planets, we can establish that the formation process discards enough waste and disorder to the surrounding environment that the overall disorder goes up. Indeed, we humans are contraptions that squeeze out the disorder that is locked inside of matter. We eat things, we breathe, and when we metabolise all that we take in, we use it to create our internal order, to grow bigger, stronger and so forth, but in the process we release enough heat and waste so that the overall disorder balance sheet is totally in the direction of disorder.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Life and mind are fleeting phenomena on the cosmic timeline\u2026 we have each been given a precious opportunity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What big problem would you like to see solved in your lifetime? </strong><br>The nature of time.

That\u2019s not the right yardstick. There are many others who recognise that the value of religion is found in its capacity to provide a sense of community, to allow us to see our lives within a larger context, to connect us through ritual to our forebears, to alleviate anxiety in the face of mortality, among other thoroughly subjective benefits. When I\u2019m looking to understand myself as a human, and how I fit in to the long chain of human culture that reaches back thousands of years, religion is a deeply valuable part of that story.</p> <p><strong>How big a part has music played in your life? </strong><br>My dad was a composer and a singer. He dropped out of school early on to travel around the country as a singer-songwriter and later on as a vocal coach. That was a deep part of my upbringing.

Beales, the Bournemouth-based chain, collapsed into administration last month and announced on Friday the closure of 12 of its 23 stores.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/sharon-white\" title=\"\">Sharon White</a>, the new chair of the John Lewis Partnership, warned it faced making \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/06/new-john-lewis-chair-sharon-white-store-closures-job-losses\" title=\"\">difficult decisions about stores and about jobs</a>\u201d.

I don\u2019t think it has. They are paying a heavy price for rapid expansion online, which has hit the trading economics of stores.\u201d</p> <p>In common with other bricks-and-mortar retailers, John Lewis\u2019s business rates bill has rocketed \u2013 up 30% since the 2017 revaluation \u2013 to \u00a357m this year, according to property advisory firm Colliers International. It has been trying to save money where it can and wrangling with landlords over rents and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49918002\" title=\"\">increases in service charges</a>.</p> <p>Last week it was announced that the House of Fraser in Dublin\u2019s affluent Dundrum mall was being pushed out in favour of Brown Thomas, the swanky homegrown luxury department store operator that is part of the same group as Selfridges.</p> <p>The signing is a coup for the centre\u2019s listed owner Hammerson and a blow to Mike Ashley\u2019s purported ambition to revive House of Fraser. In a sign of the times, however, the new Brown Thomas will be about half the size of the House of Fraser, with two rather than four floors dedicated to the designer clothing and beauty brands that pull in its well-heeled shoppers.</p> <p>Mark Bourgeois, the property group\u2019s managing director for the UK and Ireland<strong>,</strong> billed it as \u201crepurposing department store space to ensure our destinations are as attractive and engaging as possible\u201d. In the Oracle in Reading, another Hammerson shopping centre, the company is looking to carve up the House of Fraser store, with a bowling alley, mini-golf and restaurant tipped to be among the attractions on the list of potential replacements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb73e69f52e5f960cf1bb263d23b1a3330fc61b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb73e69f52e5f960cf1bb263d23b1a3330fc61b2/1884_0_2387_2985/800.jpg\" alt=\"New John Lewis chair Sharon White has warned of tough decisions ahead.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New John Lewis chair Sharon White has warned of tough decisions ahead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lewis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But landlords with properties in less desirable locations face a big headache. Around \u00a31 in every \u00a35 spent at shops is online \u2013 a figure predicted to rise to 50% within a decade. The property industry\u2019s view is that 30% of UK retail space is obsolete and would better serve communities as hotels and gyms \u2013 or, particularly within the M25, as housing. And the sooner it happens the better.</p> <p>Dundrum is likely to be an exception to the rule. But the Debenhams store in Guildford, which has views of the River Wey, was recently put on the market with a \u00a320m price tag; no one is talking about another retailer moving in and the store is considered ripe for redevelopment.</p> <p>While big deal-making has all but ground to a halt as investors wait out the retail maelstrom, others see opportunity in this huge swath of unloved retail property. One such business is Quadrant Repurpose, a new company set up by experienced property industry figures to redevelop department stores. \u201cThe UK has more than 1,000 department stores \u2026 and a substantial proportion of these stores are facing the prospect of no longer having a retailing future,\u201d explains Quadrant Repurpose\u2019s Mark Phillipson. With an initial budget of \u00a350m, the business will either work with landlords or buy assets outright.</p> <p>But are department stores doomed? The current shake-out could ultimately help John Lewis to emerge stronger in the long run; Debenhams, despite recent its own closure programme, still has nearly twice as much retail space on its hands.</p> <p>Hyman says it is not about what you do \u2013 in this case run department stores \u2013 but \u201chow you do it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHarvey Nichols is not doing so brilliantly, Harrods is Harrods and in my opinion Selfridges is the best department store in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat there isn\u2019t room for in this market is mediocre department stores\u201d like House of Fraser and Debenhams. \u201cJohn Lewis is still a very strong brand but the market will not wait for it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "So it seems John Lewis is contemplating doing the unthinkable, with the middle classes\u2019s favourite retailer hinting at store closures as it too is engulfed by the high street crisis. Department stores are in the frontline of the retail downturn: rival chains House of Fraser and Debenhams are hitting financial trouble as changing shopping habits move sales online, while the cost of running big shops, with their hefty rent bills, continues to rise. Beales, the Bournemouth-based chain, collapsed into administration last month and announced on Friday the closure of 12 of its 23 stores. Last week Sharon White, the new chair of the John Lewis Partnership, warned it faced making \u201cdifficult decisions about stores and about jobs\u201d. She did not state where the axe would fall \u2013 Waitrose shut 12 supermarkets in 2019 \u2013 but analysts think some of John Lewis\u2019s 36 department stores look vulnerable in an overall picture of falling sales. Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman worries about John Lewis\u2019s website, which has effectively become the chain\u2019s biggest branch in sales terms, but to the detriment of its stores: \u201cHas the website massively increased demand for John Lewis? I don\u2019t think it has. They are paying a heavy price for rapid expansion online, which has hit the trading economics of stores.\u201d In common with other bricks-and-mortar retailers, John Lewis\u2019s business rates bill has rocketed \u2013 up 30% since the 2017 revaluation \u2013 to \u00a357m this year, according to property advisory firm Colliers International. It has been trying to save money where it can and wrangling with landlords over rents and increases in service charges. Last week it was announced that the House of Fraser in Dublin\u2019s affluent Dundrum mall was being pushed out in favour of Brown Thomas, the swanky homegrown luxury department store operator that is part of the same group as Selfridges. The signing is a coup for the centre\u2019s listed owner Hammerson and a blow to Mike Ashley\u2019s purported ambition to revive House of Fraser. In a sign of the times, however, the new Brown Thomas will be about half the size of the House of Fraser, with two rather than four floors dedicated to the designer clothing and beauty brands that pull in its well-heeled shoppers. Mark Bourgeois, the property group\u2019s managing director for the UK and Ireland, billed it as \u201crepurposing department store space to ensure our destinations are as attractive and engaging as possible\u201d. In the Oracle in Reading, another Hammerson shopping centre, the company is looking to carve up the House of Fraser store, with a bowling alley, mini-golf and restaurant tipped to be among the attractions on the list of potential replacements. But landlords with properties in less desirable locations face a big headache. Around \u00a31 in every \u00a35 spent at shops is online \u2013 a figure predicted to rise to 50% within a decade. The property industry\u2019s view is that 30% of UK retail space is obsolete and would better serve communities as hotels and gyms \u2013 or, particularly within the M25, as housing. And the sooner it happens the better. Dundrum is likely to be an exception to the rule. But the Debenhams store in Guildford, which has views of the River Wey, was recently put on the market with a \u00a320m price tag; no one is talking about another retailer moving in and the store is considered ripe for redevelopment. While big deal-making has all but ground to a halt as investors wait out the retail maelstrom, others see opportunity in this huge swath of unloved retail property. One such business is Quadrant Repurpose, a new company set up by experienced property industry figures to redevelop department stores. \u201cThe UK has more than 1,000 department stores \u2026 and a substantial proportion of these stores are facing the prospect of no longer having a retailing future,\u201d explains Quadrant Repurpose\u2019s Mark Phillipson. With an initial budget of \u00a350m, the business will either work with landlords or buy assets outright. But are department stores doomed? The current shake-out could ultimately help John Lewis to emerge stronger in the long run; Debenhams, despite recent its own closure programme, still has nearly twice as much retail space on its hands. Hyman says it is not about what you do \u2013 in this case run department stores \u2013 but \u201chow you do it\u201d. \u201cHarvey Nichols is not doing so brilliantly, Harrods is Harrods and in my opinion Selfridges is the best department store in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat there isn\u2019t room for in this market is mediocre department stores\u201d like House of Fraser and Debenhams. \u201cJohn Lewis is still a very strong brand but the market will not wait for it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Waleed Zuaiter has the look of a Hollywood icon: salt-and-pepper hair, five o\u2019clock shadow, beaded wooden bracelets worn in a way that projects affluence rather than crustiness, and those intense leading-man eyes. In reality, his acting career has always dangled just out of reach of superstar status. Born in California, but raised in Kuwait, he\u2019s been acting since taking theatre at college. Now 49, he\u2019s had chunky supporting roles in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/homeland\" title=\"\">Homeland</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/06/the-spy-review-sacha-baron-cohen-israeli-espionage-drama-gideon-raff\" title=\"\">The Spy</a></em>, the Netflix mini-series about the life of Mossad agent Eli Cohen. His biggest break came in 2013, when he produced <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/01/omar-review-love-is-battlefield-palestinian\" title=\"\">Omar</a></em>, a film about love on the Palestinian border, which was nominated for an Oscar and in which Waleed also played a coercive Israeli agent. He\u2019s shared the stage with Meryl Streep, in a New York production of <em>Mother Courage</em>, and the screen with George Clooney, in the film adaptation of Jon Ronson\u2019s book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/06/the-men-who-stare-at-goats-review\" title=\"\">The Men Who Stare at Goats</a></em>. But, until now, he\u2019s never seen his own name given top billing.</p> <p>We meet at the west London home of a very rich stranger, the kind of place where every fixture looks like it should be in a design museum: <a href=\"https://www.vitsoe.com/gb\" title=\"\">Vitsoe</a> kitchen shelves, art deco chaises longues, a 6ft sculpture of the word \u201cpoo\u201d on the toilet wall. The house has been loaned for a photoshoot, so while Waleed is spread out on the sofa looking every inch the celebrity, shoes kicked off, posing, I wait in the kitchen with his wife Joana.</p> <p>Joana is a producing partner in a film fund they are setting up and \u201cunofficially his unpaid assistant\u201d. I\u2019d been told she would be at the interview. But I\u2019m surprised how open she is. Within the time it takes to make a pot of coffee, she\u2019s given me the outline of their high-school romance (\u201cWaleed was very short in third grade, he only got tall by the ninth\u201d) and told me a scandalous anecdote about a night they dined with a Hollywood A-lister and husband at a fancy hotel. It\u2019s a story that ends with some consensual groping in the ladies\u2019 toilet.</p> <p>When we begin talking, in a caf\u00e9 around the corner, Zuaiter is just as open as his partner, but more serious in tone, maintaining eye contact, making sure every word is heard. He begins by explaining how, in the years since <em>Omar</em>, his career reached a ceiling. Zuaiter, who is Palestinian, was always getting the same offers: small parts in TV shows, a Middle Eastern character that disappears after a few episodes. All too often, those roles involved playing a terrorist. On <em>Law &amp; Order Criminal Intent</em> he was part of a terrorist sleeper cell planning an attack on New York. In the first season of <em>Homeland</em> he played a torturer. In the cartoonish thriller <em>London </em><em>has Fallen</em> he played Kamran, a terrorist mastermind who launches a series of major attacks on the capital.</p> <p>Zuaiter has a complicated relationship with these roles. He likes that he\u2019s able to offer a realistic depiction of a person driven to violence in the name of ideology, and often insists on script changes when he finds sections offensive. On one project he refused to put on a hammy Arab accent, pointing out that many terrorists who have carried out attacks in recent years were born in America.</p> <p>But he still worries that he has helped, in some way, to propagate an unsophisticated narrative about the Middle East, perhaps even to glorify terrorism. At one point he was asked by a network television show to play the head of Isis. He said no. \u201cI just thought, look at my r\u00e9sum\u00e9! Look at what I\u2019ve done! I was actually so emotional because I was watching Trump on TV at the time, saying all these things against my people. I thought I might regret the decision in a couple of months, when I had to pay the rent. But it was so offensive, it was the right thing to do.\u201d Joana shares his unease, but she puts on a glam spin. Once, when she read that <em>Homeland</em> was the then US President\u2019s favourite show, she began telling everyone: \u201cObama\u2019s seen Waleed in his underwear!\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Two years ago,</strong></em> the lack of opportunities was getting Zuaiter down. His father, a Palestinian businessman who\u2019d always been unsure of Waleed\u2019s decision to become an actor, had warned that he \u201cwould never talk to him\u201d if he played a terrorist. He didn\u2019t follow through on the threat, but relations were sometimes strained. \u201cHis background was in business and finance,\u201d Zuaiter says. \u201cMy two older brothers went into that world. He resisted my career as an actor, it was just so foreign to him, and he felt so impotent because he couldn\u2019t help.\u201d</p> <p>Zuaiter went to visit his father that December, and the trip was full of tension and fighting. A few months later, his father died suddenly. \u201cThat haunted me \u2013 that somehow I may have caused this. All these things go through your head. I\u2019d pretty much hit rock bottom.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5592359d1530d483f383180448248e223bf8eb68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5592359d1530d483f383180448248e223bf8eb68/0_168_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waleed Zuaiter and July Namir in Baghdad Central.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Changing the story: Waleed Zuaiter and July Namir in Baghdad Central.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sife Elamine/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So when the script for a British TV show about Iraq came in, Zuaiter didn\u2019t even want to audition for it. Another accented role, he thought. \u201cIt took my manager, my agent and my wife to collaborate behind the scenes to get me to do it,\u201d he says. But once Zuaiter had been convinced to look at the script, he realised that the role was more than just another Middle Eastern bit-part. Based on the novel by Elliott Colla, <em>Baghdad Central</em> is a big budget new drama for Channel 4 and Hulu. It tells the story of corruption and power struggles in post-invasion Iraq from the perspective of Iraqi citizens. Zuaiter plays the lead, Muhsin al-Khafaji, a liberal patriotic ex-policeman who is offered medical treatment for his daughter in return for collaboration with British and American forces in their apparent bid to rebuild law and order in Iraq. Al-Khafaji is constantly conflicted, a noirish antihero who drinks and hustles to get through his situation. It\u2019s a role Zuaiter felt powerfully connected to. Often it\u2019s al-Khafaji\u2019s sick daughter who ends up caring for him \u2013 a co-dependent relationship Zuaiter connected with.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this sense of a father taking care of his ill daughter, yet it\u2019s one of those relationships where the child is taking care of the parent,\u201d he says. \u201cAs an actor who is going from job to job \u2013 and often times there are these big gaps without work, when you\u2019re not sure if you can pay the rent \u2013 you have a responsibility to be their beacon of strength because they look up to you [Waleed and Joana have two grown-up children, Laith and Nour]. That\u2019s tough. I\u2019ve given up a couple of times. My wife has been an incredible rock for me. It\u2019s not easy for me, but it\u2019s not easy for her when she has to put up with my depressions.\u201d</p> <p>The script is rich with complex political dialogue in both English and Iraqi, which Zuaiter found incredibly challenging. Twice he missed filming because learning the lines had induced a panic attack. But getting into the role had been made easier because he had first-hand experience of life under Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>He was born in Sacramento, where he lived until the age of five. But his family then moved to Kuwait, where his father had grown up, and where he had many business interests. Kuwait in the 80s was a land of opportunity, particularly for Palestinians who\u2019d fled their homeland and helped build the infrastructure: water, electricity, the oil rigs that allowed prosperity to flow.</p> <p>Zuaiter would return to America for summer camps, and he loved his upbringing in two worlds and with two languages, English and Arabic. He met Joana, who also travelled between the US and the Middle East, in elementary school, and once they were teenagers they began an on-and-off romance that would last a lifetime. \u201cShe was my real high-school sweetheart,\u201d he says. \u201cI took her to prom.\u201d</p> <p>His family weren\u2019t especially political, but they largely considered Saddam a good thing. \u201cHe was saying a lot of things that supported the Palestinian cause,\u201d Zuaiter says. \u201cHe said he was going to get Israel out of Palestine. The sentiment was: \u2018Let\u2019s get behind him. He\u2019s got the fourth largest army in the world, he could make a difference.\u2019 Unfortunately, when anyone wants to gain support in the Middle East, they\u2019ll use the Palestinian cause as a way. At the time we were blinded by that. We thought he could affect some change.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>In 1990, things</strong></em> changed rapidly. Saddam invaded Kuwait, and Zuaiter, who had both an American and a Jordanian passport, had to flee. He hid his US documentation under his bed, concerned that Saddam\u2019s forces \u2013 who were sympathetic to Jordanians \u2013 would discover his American background.</p> <p>\u201cI was trying to be as Jordanian as possible when they would stop us at checkpoints,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause American citizens were most at risk. You switch into survival instinct. Everything becomes heightened; you\u2019re very aware. You see things that you haven\u2019t really seen before \u2013 Iraqi tanks towing extravagant Kuwaiti yachts through the street. People were in such panic that they didn\u2019t have time to bury their dead. They just had to keep going. You saw death, you saw endless lines at the gas station, but you had to get gas because if you ran out of fuel on the road, nobody\u2019s going to stop for you.\u201d</p> <p>After he left, his focus then became on getting Joana out of the country. He continually pestered the British embassy, calling every day to tell them they needed to help get Joana out (Joana had a Fijian passport; Fiji had only recently become independent of the UK).</p> <p>But Saddam was keen to hold Britons in the country as human hostages, as a way of preventing foreign strikes. In the end he agreed to the release of a small number, including Joana and her mother, but not before they posed in a bizarre press opportunity with him in front of members of the foreign press.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this famous news footage of the British citizens,\u201d Zuaiter says. \u201cSaddam Hussein with this little British kid sitting on his lap. Saddam was trying to show the world how friendly he was, but the kid was terrified.\u201d Joana was in that group; you can see her in the footage. They were the last people who left Iraq and got into the UK before Operation Desert Shield began in August 1990.</p> <p>\u201cI consider my childhood up until that point very innocent,\u201d Zuaiter says. \u201cThat was a loss of innocence. I had all this stuff in my room and then when we left my dad gave me a small bag and said, \u2018This is all you can take.\u2019 All that made it easier for me as an entry point to getting into the character \u2013 to understand what loss meant.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Although there\u2019s already</strong></em> hope of a second season of <em>Baghdad Central</em>, Zuaiter says he has felt \u201cliberated\u201d by opportunities he\u2019s recently been given to play characters that are clean-shaven and speak in an American accent. He hopes that if he\u2019s to play another leading role, it\u2019s a character who is a bit more like him.</p> <p>I wonder if he ever feels the limited roles that he has offered are more than just an issue of typecasting? There\u2019s a stereotype that everyone in Hollywood shares similar liberal views, but one area in which there is serious divergence is the Israel-Palestine conflict. In 2014, when Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Javier Bardem criticised the Israeli state for strikes on Palestine that killed thousands of civilians, Jon Voight published an <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jon-voight-pens-letter-ignorant-723007\" title=\"\">open letter</a> in the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> chastising the pair, saying they could \u201cincite antisemitism all over the world\u201d and were \u201coblivious to the damage they have caused.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8171e9127fe007ecec005069297aa0a0b70fb719\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8171e9127fe007ecec005069297aa0a0b70fb719/0_899_4754_3982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019ve given up a couple of times.

I said I was Palestinian and she said, \u2018Oh,\u2019 and gave me a look. So I said to her, \u2018With all due respect, I\u2019ve seen that reaction before, when I say I\u2019m Palestinian \u2013 can you tell me what that is?\u2019 She said: \u2018Do you want me to be honest with you? Everything I know about Palestine is from what I hear on the news. It\u2019s all about terrorism. When you say you\u2019re Palestinian, it\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to claim something that\u2019s not yours.\u2019 I was grateful for her honesty. It gave me an insight into what the general public thinks.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For my family, I want people to know I\u2019m Palestinian</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The mood has changed since then, he points out. \u201cEven when I did <em>The Men Who Stare at Goats</em>, and I told George Clooney I was Palestinian, he joked, \u2018Oh, I wouldn\u2019t say that in the industry.\u2019 But he totally got it, and said something to the effect of, it\u2019s actually cool now to say you\u2019re Palestinian. I\u2019m very proud of being Palestinian.

      "bodyText": "Waleed Zuaiter has the look of a Hollywood icon: salt-and-pepper hair, five o\u2019clock shadow, beaded wooden bracelets worn in a way that projects affluence rather than crustiness, and those intense leading-man eyes. In reality, his acting career has always dangled just out of reach of superstar status. Born in California, but raised in Kuwait, he\u2019s been acting since taking theatre at college. Now 49, he\u2019s had chunky supporting roles in Homeland and The Spy, the Netflix mini-series about the life of Mossad agent Eli Cohen. His biggest break came in 2013, when he produced Omar, a film about love on the Palestinian border, which was nominated for an Oscar and in which Waleed also played a coercive Israeli agent. He\u2019s shared the stage with Meryl Streep, in a New York production of Mother Courage, and the screen with George Clooney, in the film adaptation of Jon Ronson\u2019s book The Men Who Stare at Goats. But, until now, he\u2019s never seen his own name given top billing. We meet at the west London home of a very rich stranger, the kind of place where every fixture looks like it should be in a design museum: Vitsoe kitchen shelves, art deco chaises longues, a 6ft sculpture of the word \u201cpoo\u201d on the toilet wall. The house has been loaned for a photoshoot, so while Waleed is spread out on the sofa looking every inch the celebrity, shoes kicked off, posing, I wait in the kitchen with his wife Joana. Joana is a producing partner in a film fund they are setting up and \u201cunofficially his unpaid assistant\u201d. I\u2019d been told she would be at the interview. But I\u2019m surprised how open she is. Within the time it takes to make a pot of coffee, she\u2019s given me the outline of their high-school romance (\u201cWaleed was very short in third grade, he only got tall by the ninth\u201d) and told me a scandalous anecdote about a night they dined with a Hollywood A-lister and husband at a fancy hotel. It\u2019s a story that ends with some consensual groping in the ladies\u2019 toilet. When we begin talking, in a caf\u00e9 around the corner, Zuaiter is just as open as his partner, but more serious in tone, maintaining eye contact, making sure every word is heard. He begins by explaining how, in the years since Omar, his career reached a ceiling. Zuaiter, who is Palestinian, was always getting the same offers: small parts in TV shows, a Middle Eastern character that disappears after a few episodes. All too often, those roles involved playing a terrorist. On Law &amp; Order Criminal Intent he was part of a terrorist sleeper cell planning an attack on New York. In the first season of Homeland he played a torturer. In the cartoonish thriller London has Fallen he played Kamran, a terrorist mastermind who launches a series of major attacks on the capital. Zuaiter has a complicated relationship with these roles. He likes that he\u2019s able to offer a realistic depiction of a person driven to violence in the name of ideology, and often insists on script changes when he finds sections offensive. On one project he refused to put on a hammy Arab accent, pointing out that many terrorists who have carried out attacks in recent years were born in America. But he still worries that he has helped, in some way, to propagate an unsophisticated narrative about the Middle East, perhaps even to glorify terrorism. At one point he was asked by a network television show to play the head of Isis. He said no. \u201cI just thought, look at my r\u00e9sum\u00e9! Look at what I\u2019ve done! I was actually so emotional because I was watching Trump on TV at the time, saying all these things against my people. I thought I might regret the decision in a couple of months, when I had to pay the rent. But it was so offensive, it was the right thing to do.\u201d Joana shares his unease, but she puts on a glam spin. Once, when she read that Homeland was the then US President\u2019s favourite show, she began telling everyone: \u201cObama\u2019s seen Waleed in his underwear!\u201d Two years ago, the lack of opportunities was getting Zuaiter down. His father, a Palestinian businessman who\u2019d always been unsure of Waleed\u2019s decision to become an actor, had warned that he \u201cwould never talk to him\u201d if he played a terrorist. He didn\u2019t follow through on the threat, but relations were sometimes strained. \u201cHis background was in business and finance,\u201d Zuaiter says. \u201cMy two older brothers went into that world. He resisted my career as an actor, it was just so foreign to him, and he felt so impotent because he couldn\u2019t help.\u201d Zuaiter went to visit his father that December, and the trip was full of tension and fighting. A few months later, his father died suddenly. \u201cThat haunted me \u2013 that somehow I may have caused this. All these things go through your head. I\u2019d pretty much hit rock bottom.\u201d So when the script for a British TV show about Iraq came in, Zuaiter didn\u2019t even want to audition for it. Another accented role, he thought. \u201cIt took my manager, my agent and my wife to collaborate behind the scenes to get me to do it,\u201d he says. But once Zuaiter had been convinced to look at the script, he realised that the role was more than just another Middle Eastern bit-part. Based on the novel by Elliott Colla, Baghdad Central is a big budget new drama for Channel 4 and Hulu. It tells the story of corruption and power struggles in post-invasion Iraq from the perspective of Iraqi citizens. Zuaiter plays the lead, Muhsin al-Khafaji, a liberal patriotic ex-policeman who is offered medical treatment for his daughter in return for collaboration with British and American forces in their apparent bid to rebuild law and order in Iraq. Al-Khafaji is constantly conflicted, a noirish antihero who drinks and hustles to get through his situation. It\u2019s a role Zuaiter felt powerfully connected to. Often it\u2019s al-Khafaji\u2019s sick daughter who ends up caring for him \u2013 a co-dependent relationship Zuaiter connected with. \u201cThere\u2019s this sense of a father taking care of his ill daughter, yet it\u2019s one of those relationships where the child is taking care of the parent,\u201d he says. \u201cAs an actor who is going from job to job \u2013 and often times there are these big gaps without work, when you\u2019re not sure if you can pay the rent \u2013 you have a responsibility to be their beacon of strength because they look up to you [Waleed and Joana have two grown-up children, Laith and Nour]. That\u2019s tough. I\u2019ve given up a couple of times. My wife has been an incredible rock for me. It\u2019s not easy for me, but it\u2019s not easy for her when she has to put up with my depressions.\u201d The script is rich with complex political dialogue in both English and Iraqi, which Zuaiter found incredibly challenging. Twice he missed filming because learning the lines had induced a panic attack. But getting into the role had been made easier because he had first-hand experience of life under Saddam Hussein. He was born in Sacramento, where he lived until the age of five. But his family then moved to Kuwait, where his father had grown up, and where he had many business interests. Kuwait in the 80s was a land of opportunity, particularly for Palestinians who\u2019d fled their homeland and helped build the infrastructure: water, electricity, the oil rigs that allowed prosperity to flow. Zuaiter would return to America for summer camps, and he loved his upbringing in two worlds and with two languages, English and Arabic. He met Joana, who also travelled between the US and the Middle East, in elementary school, and once they were teenagers they began an on-and-off romance that would last a lifetime. \u201cShe was my real high-school sweetheart,\u201d he says. \u201cI took her to prom.\u201d His family weren\u2019t especially political, but they largely considered Saddam a good thing. \u201cHe was saying a lot of things that supported the Palestinian cause,\u201d Zuaiter says. \u201cHe said he was going to get Israel out of Palestine. The sentiment was: \u2018Let\u2019s get behind him. He\u2019s got the fourth largest army in the world, he could make a difference.\u2019 Unfortunately, when anyone wants to gain support in the Middle East, they\u2019ll use the Palestinian cause as a way. At the time we were blinded by that. We thought he could affect some change.\u201d In 1990, things changed rapidly. Saddam invaded Kuwait, and Zuaiter, who had both an American and a Jordanian passport, had to flee. He hid his US documentation under his bed, concerned that Saddam\u2019s forces \u2013 who were sympathetic to Jordanians \u2013 would discover his American background. \u201cI was trying to be as Jordanian as possible when they would stop us at checkpoints,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause American citizens were most at risk. You switch into survival instinct. Everything becomes heightened; you\u2019re very aware. You see things that you haven\u2019t really seen before \u2013 Iraqi tanks towing extravagant Kuwaiti yachts through the street. People were in such panic that they didn\u2019t have time to bury their dead. They just had to keep going. You saw death, you saw endless lines at the gas station, but you had to get gas because if you ran out of fuel on the road, nobody\u2019s going to stop for you.\u201d After he left, his focus then became on getting Joana out of the country. He continually pestered the British embassy, calling every day to tell them they needed to help get Joana out (Joana had a Fijian passport; Fiji had only recently become independent of the UK). But Saddam was keen to hold Britons in the country as human hostages, as a way of preventing foreign strikes. In the end he agreed to the release of a small number, including Joana and her mother, but not before they posed in a bizarre press opportunity with him in front of members of the foreign press. \u201cThere\u2019s this famous news footage of the British citizens,\u201d Zuaiter says. \u201cSaddam Hussein with this little British kid sitting on his lap. Saddam was trying to show the world how friendly he was, but the kid was terrified.\u201d Joana was in that group; you can see her in the footage. They were the last people who left Iraq and got into the UK before Operation Desert Shield began in August 1990. \u201cI consider my childhood up until that point very innocent,\u201d Zuaiter says. \u201cThat was a loss of innocence. I had all this stuff in my room and then when we left my dad gave me a small bag and said, \u2018This is all you can take.\u2019 All that made it easier for me as an entry point to getting into the character \u2013 to understand what loss meant.\u201d Although there\u2019s already hope of a second season of Baghdad Central, Zuaiter says he has felt \u201cliberated\u201d by opportunities he\u2019s recently been given to play characters that are clean-shaven and speak in an American accent. He hopes that if he\u2019s to play another leading role, it\u2019s a character who is a bit more like him. I wonder if he ever feels the limited roles that he has offered are more than just an issue of typecasting? There\u2019s a stereotype that everyone in Hollywood shares similar liberal views, but one area in which there is serious divergence is the Israel-Palestine conflict. In 2014, when Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Javier Bardem criticised the Israeli state for strikes on Palestine that killed thousands of civilians, Jon Voight published an open letter in the Hollywood Reporter chastising the pair, saying they could \u201cincite antisemitism all over the world\u201d and were \u201coblivious to the damage they have caused.\u201d In 2018, the Jewish film producer Jason Blum was booed off stage at the Israeli Film Festival in Beverly Hills for saying that he didn\u2019t like Trump \u2013 shortly after the president had moved the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I ask Zuaiter whether he\u2019s ever found that the film industry is actively hostile to a Palestinian actor playing American roles, and he says that while he\u2019s never knowingly been discriminated against, throughout his career people have said to him he should say that he\u2019s Jordanian or Lebanese rather than Palestinian. \u201cPerhaps Americans are not as educated as people in Europe \u2013 about the conflict, its history and complexity,\u201d he says. \u201cI had one manager who I met with early in my career.

      "body": "<p>Who needs the Russians when the Democratic party of Iowa is perfectly capable of screwing up the democratic process all by itself? The political world waited on Monday night with bated breath to see which of the Democratic candidates would emerge from the arcane \u201ccaucus\u201d process in the state. But when the polls closed, no results were available.</p> <p>There were, the party, stated, \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in the reported figures coming through from the precincts. No results would be issued until the results had been properly and accurately collated. The information was to have come from a recently developed smartphone app, with a back-up option that would enable precinct captains to phone in their results. Neither channel worked. CNN reported that one official who was trying to report his results was on hold <em>for an hour</em> and had apparently just got through to party headquarters when the party hung up on him \u2013 on live television. It was, to use a technical term, a shambles.</p> <p>To put it into context, we should note that the Iowa caucus system is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/new-rules-might-complicate-iowa-caucus/605950/\" title=\"\">Byzantine-lite</a>. Voters come to an assigned venue \u2013 a church or an elementary school in their neighbourhood, say \u2013 and stand under a sign or in a corner associated with their favourite candidate. For half an hour, people hustle between groups, trying to coax supporters of other candidates to join their team. Then organisers count each candidate\u2019s supporters, and there is a realignment period, during which people can switch allegiances. Members of any candidate group that doesn\u2019t get at least 15% of caucus-goers must move to a new candidate. Once this part is done, delegates are assigned to the remaining contenders using a mathematical formula, and reported to the state party.</p> <p>This year, there were some additional refinements which seem to have made it even more complicated, but you get the idea. This may be why some genius in the state\u2019s party HQ had the idea that the whole reporting process could be done with an app. So the party commissioned a private firm called <a href=\"https://shadowinc.io\" title=\"\">Shadow Inc</a> (whose mission is \u201cto build political power for the progressive movement by developing affordable and easy-to-use tools for teams and budgets of any size\u201d) to develop one, but gave them only two months and $60,000 in which to do it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You don't develop a mission-critical smartphone app without stress-testing it to oblivion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From the outset, there <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/bad-app-not-russians-plunged-iowa-into-chaos/606052/\" title=\"\">seem to have been concerns</a> about the app \u2013 concerns which were <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/y3m33x/heres-the-shadow-inc-app-that-failed-in-iowa-last-night\" title=\"\">amply vindicated</a> on the night. When they were expressed, though, the party leadership seems to have pooh-poohed them. At any rate, Troy Price, Iowa Democratic party chairman, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/iowa-caucus-app-sparks-election-security-concerns-n1121581\" title=\"\">said at a press briefing</a> that the app was just one part of how the state\u2019s vote was tracked, along with paper backups, a phone hotline and other, unspecified safeguards. \u201cIf there is a challenge,\u201d he burbled, \u201cwe\u2019ll be ready with a backup and a backup to that backup and a backup to the backup to the backup.\u201d</p> <p>No one who knows anything about the technology will have been surprised by what happened. You don\u2019t develop a high-profile, mission-critical smartphone app that will be used by hundreds of technically illiterate citizens who have downloaded it on to dozens of different kinds of smartphones without stress-testing it to oblivion. And that takes more than two months. And if you have a backup call centre you make sure it has the capacity to handle every call at peak time. It\u2019s not rocket science, just common sense. Otherwise, it\u2019s like issuing delicate clocks to monkeys.</p> <p>Screw-ups like this cost votes \u2013 and maybe elections.

      "bodyText": "Who needs the Russians when the Democratic party of Iowa is perfectly capable of screwing up the democratic process all by itself? The political world waited on Monday night with bated breath to see which of the Democratic candidates would emerge from the arcane \u201ccaucus\u201d process in the state. But when the polls closed, no results were available. There were, the party, stated, \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in the reported figures coming through from the precincts. No results would be issued until the results had been properly and accurately collated. The information was to have come from a recently developed smartphone app, with a back-up option that would enable precinct captains to phone in their results. Neither channel worked. CNN reported that one official who was trying to report his results was on hold for an hour and had apparently just got through to party headquarters when the party hung up on him \u2013 on live television. It was, to use a technical term, a shambles. To put it into context, we should note that the Iowa caucus system is Byzantine-lite. Voters come to an assigned venue \u2013 a church or an elementary school in their neighbourhood, say \u2013 and stand under a sign or in a corner associated with their favourite candidate. For half an hour, people hustle between groups, trying to coax supporters of other candidates to join their team. Then organisers count each candidate\u2019s supporters, and there is a realignment period, during which people can switch allegiances. Members of any candidate group that doesn\u2019t get at least 15% of caucus-goers must move to a new candidate. Once this part is done, delegates are assigned to the remaining contenders using a mathematical formula, and reported to the state party. This year, there were some additional refinements which seem to have made it even more complicated, but you get the idea. This may be why some genius in the state\u2019s party HQ had the idea that the whole reporting process could be done with an app. So the party commissioned a private firm called Shadow Inc (whose mission is \u201cto build political power for the progressive movement by developing affordable and easy-to-use tools for teams and budgets of any size\u201d) to develop one, but gave them only two months and $60,000 in which to do it. From the outset, there seem to have been concerns about the app \u2013 concerns which were amply vindicated on the night. When they were expressed, though, the party leadership seems to have pooh-poohed them. At any rate, Troy Price, Iowa Democratic party chairman, said at a press briefing that the app was just one part of how the state\u2019s vote was tracked, along with paper backups, a phone hotline and other, unspecified safeguards. \u201cIf there is a challenge,\u201d he burbled, \u201cwe\u2019ll be ready with a backup and a backup to that backup and a backup to the backup to the backup.\u201d No one who knows anything about the technology will have been surprised by what happened. You don\u2019t develop a high-profile, mission-critical smartphone app that will be used by hundreds of technically illiterate citizens who have downloaded it on to dozens of different kinds of smartphones without stress-testing it to oblivion. And that takes more than two months. And if you have a backup call centre you make sure it has the capacity to handle every call at peak time. It\u2019s not rocket science, just common sense. Otherwise, it\u2019s like issuing delicate clocks to monkeys. Screw-ups like this cost votes \u2013 and maybe elections. In October 2013, when Obama\u2019s biggest political initiative launched Healthcare.gov \u2013 the website to help people find coverage under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 it failed so badly that it took a team of people from Silicon Valley working seven-day weeks for months to fix it. The damage to Obamacare was incalculable. In that context, the chaos in Iowa has been a gift to the Trump crowd.

When the Observer visited, Lyrissa and Matthew Donnelly had been for lunch with their three-year-old daughter Ella at Bon Pan Asian, a buffet restaurant in the mall\u2019s leisure extension which opened in 2015 and where diners were queuing for seats. \u201cWe come every week, mostly for food,\u201d said Lyrissa. Retired couple Chris and Tony Horton said they rarely visited, despite living locally. \u201cThey have tried hard with the restaurants and the cinema,\u201d said Chris, \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing for us here.\u201d Intu will have its work cut out convincing shoppers and investors to spend their money with it.",

In fact, they could be the crucial ingredients in the wardrobe of the future as growing numbers of designers try to create fashion that doesn\u2019t harm the environment.</p> <p>Examine a garment\u2019s care label and you may find that it was made out of pineapple stalks or cactus leaves, or a tote bag was woven with thread made from banana trees. From mushroom leather to algae T-shirts, the search is on for alternative materials with smaller carbon footprints. And the latest result are carbon-negative clothes made with algae that absorb carbon dioxide from the air.</p> <p>\u201cFashion is part of the problem but it\u2019s also part of the solution,\u201d said Nina Marenzi, founder and director of the Sustainable Angle, a not-for-profit organisation which promotes green textiles at its annual <a href=\"https://thesustainableangle.org/future-fabrics/\" title=\"\">Future Fabric Expo</a>. \u201cWe begin with materials and making them sustainable, and if fashion supply chains can change, then we start to address that.\u201d</p> <p>The New York designer <a href=\"http://www.charlottemccurdy.com/about\" title=\"\">Charlotte McCurdy</a> has made a see-through bioplastic mac using algae \u2013 specifically algae powder used in vegan food products. She worked with glass casters to find a way to heat the algae and cool it in a controlled fashion to make it transparent. The material is carbon-negative because the algae <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/carbon-dioxide-chemicals-fibres-jet-fuel-photosynthesis\" title=\"\">draw carbon out of the atmosphere</a>, meaning the coat acts as a carbon sink.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"998f0d735a95df8800e6df03c3932ca7c389f95b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/998f0d735a95df8800e6df03c3932ca7c389f95b/0_259_4604_2764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dian-Jen Lin, co-founder of Post Carbon Lab, wearing their Euglena Print Jacket which has a living coating consisting of layers of photosynthetic micro-organisms that can turn carbon dioxide into oxygen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dian-Jen Lin, co-founder of Post Carbon Lab, wearing their Euglena Print Jacket which has a living coating consisting of layers of photosynthetic micro-organisms that can turn carbon dioxide into oxygen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Post Carbon Lab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFollow the carbon \u2013 where did it come from?\u201d she said. \u201cHas it come from carbon taken out of the atmosphere millions of years ago and put in the ground? We talk a lot about what happens to materials after we use them, but not where they come from in the first place.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.postcarbonlab.com/post-carbon-fashion\" title=\"\">Post Carbon Lab</a> is using the same principle with another algae prototype \u2013 clothes that photosynthesise. The start-up in London has created photosynthesis coating, a layer of living algae on the fabric of garments that absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen, turning the carbon into sugar. One large T-shirt \u2013 nearly a square metre of material \u2013 generates about as much oxygen as a six-year-old oak tree, according to the co-founder <a href=\"https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/london-college-of-fashion/people/dian-jen-lin\" title=\"\">Dian-Jen Lin</a>.</p> <p>The start-up has been working with designers and industry to translate its photosynthesis coating into a marketable product, and Lin said it could be used in shoes, backpacks, curtains, pillow cases, umbrellas and building canopies.</p> <p>The care instructions were rather different to normal clothes, she said. Wearing algae was not without its perils. \u201cYou can\u2019t put it into your dark wardrobe. It needs light and carbon dioxide, so you have to put it in a well-ventilated area, like the back of your chair.\u201d Washing machines would harm the algae, so \u201cit\u2019s handwash only \u2013 you have to be a bit careful. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this coating for your underwear but maybe for a windbreaker or a jacket.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec29a8c8de258880d00f7c3bb367f7ddf4c4e2db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec29a8c8de258880d00f7c3bb367f7ddf4c4e2db/0_0_2645_2645/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Algae being grown in the lab is made into a fabric for the designer Charlotte McCurdy\u2019s carbon-negative raincoat, After Ancient Sunlight..\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Algae being grown in the lab is made into a fabric for the designer Charlotte McCurdy\u2019s carbon-negative raincoat, After Ancient Sunlight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte McCurdy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lin and her co-founder Hannes Hulstaert are testing the limits of the coating, which she says can be applied to almost any garments, either as a full coating or a print. \u201cBut it might change colour if it\u2019s really upset, if it didn\u2019t like the light or temperature,\u201d Lin said. \u201cMost of the organisms are in the green shade. In the healthy state they are dark brownish green, orangeish green. When it\u2019s unhappy it might turn yellow, orange, brown, purple or white or transparent.\u201d</p> <p>However, it seems remarkably resilient. \u201cWe\u2019ve had samples for three years which have come back to life,\u201d Lin said.</p> <p>Other textiles include Pi\u00f1atex, made from pineapple leaves and used by Hugo Boss and H&amp;M, and Mycotex, a substance grown from mushrooms. Cactus is the next plant-based leather to emerge, the creation of Desserto, a Mexican company that makes leather from leaves.</p> <p>The challenges facing the fashion industry in its quest to become greener are huge. The UK throws about 300,000 tonnes of clothes into landfill each year, and some studies suggest global textile production creates 1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year \u2013 more than <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmenvaud/1952/full-report.html#heading-7\" title=\"\">airlines and shipping combined.</a></p>",

In fact, they could be the crucial ingredients in the wardrobe of the future as growing numbers of designers try to create fashion that doesn\u2019t harm the environment. Examine a garment\u2019s care label and you may find that it was made out of pineapple stalks or cactus leaves, or a tote bag was woven with thread made from banana trees. From mushroom leather to algae T-shirts, the search is on for alternative materials with smaller carbon footprints. And the latest result are carbon-negative clothes made with algae that absorb carbon dioxide from the air. \u201cFashion is part of the problem but it\u2019s also part of the solution,\u201d said Nina Marenzi, founder and director of the Sustainable Angle, a not-for-profit organisation which promotes green textiles at its annual Future Fabric Expo. \u201cWe begin with materials and making them sustainable, and if fashion supply chains can change, then we start to address that.\u201d The New York designer Charlotte McCurdy has made a see-through bioplastic mac using algae \u2013 specifically algae powder used in vegan food products. She worked with glass casters to find a way to heat the algae and cool it in a controlled fashion to make it transparent. The material is carbon-negative because the algae draw carbon out of the atmosphere, meaning the coat acts as a carbon sink. \u201cFollow the carbon \u2013 where did it come from?\u201d she said. \u201cHas it come from carbon taken out of the atmosphere millions of years ago and put in the ground? We talk a lot about what happens to materials after we use them, but not where they come from in the first place.\u201d Post Carbon Lab is using the same principle with another algae prototype \u2013 clothes that photosynthesise. The start-up in London has created photosynthesis coating, a layer of living algae on the fabric of garments that absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen, turning the carbon into sugar. One large T-shirt \u2013 nearly a square metre of material \u2013 generates about as much oxygen as a six-year-old oak tree, according to the co-founder Dian-Jen Lin. The start-up has been working with designers and industry to translate its photosynthesis coating into a marketable product, and Lin said it could be used in shoes, backpacks, curtains, pillow cases, umbrellas and building canopies. The care instructions were rather different to normal clothes, she said. Wearing algae was not without its perils. \u201cYou can\u2019t put it into your dark wardrobe. It needs light and carbon dioxide, so you have to put it in a well-ventilated area, like the back of your chair.\u201d Washing machines would harm the algae, so \u201cit\u2019s handwash only \u2013 you have to be a bit careful. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this coating for your underwear but maybe for a windbreaker or a jacket.\u201d Lin and her co-founder Hannes Hulstaert are testing the limits of the coating, which she says can be applied to almost any garments, either as a full coating or a print. \u201cBut it might change colour if it\u2019s really upset, if it didn\u2019t like the light or temperature,\u201d Lin said. \u201cMost of the organisms are in the green shade. In the healthy state they are dark brownish green, orangeish green. When it\u2019s unhappy it might turn yellow, orange, brown, purple or white or transparent.\u201d However, it seems remarkably resilient. \u201cWe\u2019ve had samples for three years which have come back to life,\u201d Lin said. Other textiles include Pi\u00f1atex, made from pineapple leaves and used by Hugo Boss and H&amp;M, and Mycotex, a substance grown from mushrooms. Cactus is the next plant-based leather to emerge, the creation of Desserto, a Mexican company that makes leather from leaves. The challenges facing the fashion industry in its quest to become greener are huge. The UK throws about 300,000 tonnes of clothes into landfill each year, and some studies suggest global textile production creates 1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year \u2013 more than airlines and shipping combined.",

But some conservationists fret they are a byproduct of the violence that has long troubled the state of Michoac\u00e1n, which stretches from the mountains of central Mexico to the west coast.</p> \n<p>As they have done across the country, organized crime groups linked to the drug trade have diversified into many other activities, including kidnapping, avocado cultivation, land theft \u2013 and the lucrative market in pine, fir and cedar wood.</p> \n<p>Logging is supposedly under tight controls, but high prices mean lumber mafias often stray into protected areas \u2013 and are prepared to use violence. \u201cIn Michoac\u00e1n, a tree is worth more than a human life,\u201d said one former state official.</p> \n<p>\u201cHomero G\u00f3mez was in conflict with these loggers,\u201d said Homero Aridjis, an environmentalist and poet, who is a longtime defender of the monarch butterfly sanctuaries. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been a very dangerous group because there are always politicians, businessmen involved in deforestation.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d3feedcd053e88d7cb325c55cb938854ec2b836b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3feedcd053e88d7cb325c55cb938854ec2b836b/0_26_1869_1121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People mourn next to the coffin with the remains of Mexican environmentalist Homero Gomez, during his funeral in El Rosario village, Michoac\u00e1n, on 30 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People mourn next to the coffin with the remains of Mexican environmentalist Homero Gomez, during his funeral in El Rosario village, Michoac\u00e1n, on 30 January.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enrique Castro/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Aridjis said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/23/the-man-who-would-save-mexicos-natural-wonders\">his own activism against illegal logging</a>, the planting of avocado orchards and the proposed construction of a mine near the sanctuaries has brought threats. He largely stays away from the butterfly sanctuaries due to security concerns.</p> \n<p>But others suggest G\u00f3mez may have fallen foul of a backlash to his buccaneering self-promotion and questions over his role as the former leader of the El Rosario community, which is run as an <em>ejido</em> \u2013 a traditional Mexican collectivist arrangement where residents share ownership of the land and its bounty.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn this system, it\u2019s easy for a leader to become abusive with the community\u2019s income,\u201d said a Michoac\u00e1n conservationist who was familiar with G\u00f3mez and the sanctuary but did not want to be named. The conservationist insisted it was still safe for butterfly guardians to do their work.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was an outspoken person, he drew a lot of attention to himself. I don\u2019t know why he was killed, but because of the non-transparent management of the <em>ejido</em> he had a lot of enemies. It\u2019s difficult to say this in Mexico because the press has portrayed him nearly as a saint.\u201d</p> \n<p>Regardless, Amado G\u00f3mez\u2019s fears that \u201clarge groups\u201d might seize the sanctuary are not without foundation. Criminal groups have already moved in on resources such as water, forests and minerals \u2013 most famously in the indigenous Pur\u00e9pecha community of Cher\u00e1n, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/mexico-indigenous-town-banned-politicians-cheran\">where locals rose up in 2011</a> to halt illegal loggers, backed by a drug cartel, from clearcutting their forests.</p> \n<p>The demise of G\u00f3mez also highlights the misery suffered by Mexico\u2019s beleaguered environmental defenders, who have been murdered with impunity in shocking numbers. Fourteen defenders <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/enemies-state/\">were murdered</a> in Mexico in 2018, according to Global Witness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/feb/2020-02-07T21:20:02.html\" data-alt=\"monarch map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/feb/2020-02-07T21:20:02.html\">monarch map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Security concerns are rife in the region, and many prefer silence. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult [to speak out], and even more so for those who live here,\u201d said a local researcher, who preferred to remain anonymous.</p> \n<p>While the reasons for the deaths of the two men have yet to fully emerge, concerns are already swelling that the incidents will hurt tourism. The fragile security situation across Mexico has been blamed for a quiet winter for visitors in one of the major sanctuaries, Sierra Chincua, even before the deaths.</p> \n<p>The monarch butterflies themselves are also coming under growing pressures. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/14/mexican-monarch-butterfly-numbers\">historic low in overwintering populations </a>was recorded in 2013-14, amid a longer-term slump that has prompted mayors in cities across North America to promise remedial action. It\u2019s suspected that butterfly numbers have been winnowed away by the use of toxic pesticides and razing of critical monarch habitat in the US and Canada.</p> \n<p>The decline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/30/mexico-monarch-butterflies-wintering-population-increase\">was reversed somewhat last year</a> but scientists warn the annual monarch migration faces an existential threat due to the climate crisis.

      "bodyText": "The annual migration of monarch butterflies from the US and Canada is one of the most resplendent sights in the natural world \u2013 a rippling orange-and-black wave containing millions of butterflies fluttering instinctively southward to escape the winter cold. The spectacle when they reach their destination in central Mexico is perhaps even more astonishing. Patches of alpine forest turn from green to orange as the monarchs roost in the fir trees, the sheer weight of butterflies causing branches to sag to the point of snapping. Tens of thousands of the insects bounce haphazardly overhead, searching replenishment from nearby plants. To witness this sight is as if to enter a waking dream. \u201cPeople have a spiritual and emotional connection to monarchs,\u201d said Sonia Altizer, a monarch butterfly researcher at the University of Georgia. \u201cMany people tell me that seeing them was a highlight of their life.\u201d The recent deaths of two butterfly conservationists in the region has, however, drawn attention to a troubling tangle of disputes, resentments and occasional bouts of harrowing violence that has lingered over the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, a sprawling world heritage site situated 60 miles north-west of Mexico City. Mustachioed and gregarious, Homero G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez tirelessly promoted the El Rosario sanctuary, a section of the butterfly reserve that receives the bulk of tourists who come from around the world to see the monarchs. He featured in mesmerizing social media videos \u2013 posing with butterflies fluttering around him \u2013 and called the creatures \u201ca marvel of nature\u201d. G\u00f3mez, who was 50, disappeared on 13 January after attending a patron saint festival in the municipality of Ocampo; his body was found two weeks later at the bottom of a watering hole. His death has yet to be ruled a murder, although police say he suffered a blunt trauma to the head. The incident raised fears that gangs, possibly tied to the illegal logging of the butterfly reserve, had targeted G\u00f3mez for his advocacy of ecotourism over the felling of trees in this rugged swath of Mexico where communities, often beset by poverty, have traditionally relied upon the harvesting of timber, potatoes and wheat. Those concerns were further heightened this week after the death of a part-time tour guide from another nearby butterfly sanctuary, called Ra\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez Romero. His body was found 1 February with injuries possibly inflicted by a sharp object. \u201cThe panorama for the community, the forest and the monarch butterflies is now very complicated and uncertain,\u201d Amado G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez, one of G\u00f3mez\u2019s nine siblings, told the Guardian. \u201cThere are now these two crimes and it has spread fear. You find yourself thinking \u2018What if this is a group that is coming to try and take the sanctuary away from us?\u201d Investigations into the two deaths are ongoing. But some conservationists fret they are a byproduct of the violence that has long troubled the state of Michoac\u00e1n, which stretches from the mountains of central Mexico to the west coast. As they have done across the country, organized crime groups linked to the drug trade have diversified into many other activities, including kidnapping, avocado cultivation, land theft \u2013 and the lucrative market in pine, fir and cedar wood. Logging is supposedly under tight controls, but high prices mean lumber mafias often stray into protected areas \u2013 and are prepared to use violence. \u201cIn Michoac\u00e1n, a tree is worth more than a human life,\u201d said one former state official. \u201cHomero G\u00f3mez was in conflict with these loggers,\u201d said Homero Aridjis, an environmentalist and poet, who is a longtime defender of the monarch butterfly sanctuaries. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been a very dangerous group because there are always politicians, businessmen involved in deforestation.\u201d Aridjis said his own activism against illegal logging, the planting of avocado orchards and the proposed construction of a mine near the sanctuaries has brought threats. He largely stays away from the butterfly sanctuaries due to security concerns. But others suggest G\u00f3mez may have fallen foul of a backlash to his buccaneering self-promotion and questions over his role as the former leader of the El Rosario community, which is run as an ejido \u2013 a traditional Mexican collectivist arrangement where residents share ownership of the land and its bounty. \u201cIn this system, it\u2019s easy for a leader to become abusive with the community\u2019s income,\u201d said a Michoac\u00e1n conservationist who was familiar with G\u00f3mez and the sanctuary but did not want to be named. The conservationist insisted it was still safe for butterfly guardians to do their work. \u201cHe was an outspoken person, he drew a lot of attention to himself. I don\u2019t know why he was killed, but because of the non-transparent management of the ejido he had a lot of enemies. It\u2019s difficult to say this in Mexico because the press has portrayed him nearly as a saint.\u201d Regardless, Amado G\u00f3mez\u2019s fears that \u201clarge groups\u201d might seize the sanctuary are not without foundation. Criminal groups have already moved in on resources such as water, forests and minerals \u2013 most famously in the indigenous Pur\u00e9pecha community of Cher\u00e1n, where locals rose up in 2011 to halt illegal loggers, backed by a drug cartel, from clearcutting their forests. The demise of G\u00f3mez also highlights the misery suffered by Mexico\u2019s beleaguered environmental defenders, who have been murdered with impunity in shocking numbers. Fourteen defenders were murdered in Mexico in 2018, according to Global Witness. Security concerns are rife in the region, and many prefer silence. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult [to speak out], and even more so for those who live here,\u201d said a local researcher, who preferred to remain anonymous. While the reasons for the deaths of the two men have yet to fully emerge, concerns are already swelling that the incidents will hurt tourism. The fragile security situation across Mexico has been blamed for a quiet winter for visitors in one of the major sanctuaries, Sierra Chincua, even before the deaths. The monarch butterflies themselves are also coming under growing pressures. A historic low in overwintering populations was recorded in 2013-14, amid a longer-term slump that has prompted mayors in cities across North America to promise remedial action. It\u2019s suspected that butterfly numbers have been winnowed away by the use of toxic pesticides and razing of critical monarch habitat in the US and Canada. The decline was reversed somewhat last year but scientists warn the annual monarch migration faces an existential threat due to the climate crisis. The oyamel firs preferred by monarchs in Mexico are being stressed by rising temperatures and drought, with predictions the trees will be virtually wiped out by the end of the century. Global heating is also reducing the viability of milkweed, the sole plant where the monarch reproduces, in US and Canada. This trend is set to restrict the butterflies to isolated pockets and end their epic migration to Mexico, a journey that can stretch for 3,000 miles. A separate monarch migration, which brings butterflies to the warmth of coastal California, has shrunk from millions of insects in the 1980s to fewer than 30,000 individuals now. \u201cIt\u2019s so obvious that it\u2019s painful,\u201d said Orley Taylor, a biologist and co-founder of Monarch Watch, a group of US volunteers focused on studying and conserving the species. \u201cWithin 30 years or so we probably won\u2019t be talking about the monarch migration. We risk losing something very special indeed.\u201d The demise of the overwintering monarchs would send an economic and cultural shock through central Mexico, although there are currently more pressing concerns in a region beset by crime and few economic opportunities. \u201cPeople are all for protecting the butterflies, but people have to have the necessities to survive,\u201d said Father Mart\u00edn Cruz Morales, a local priest, on a break from a community lunch of tacos and aguas frescas to celebrate the anniversary of a colleague\u2019s ordination. In El Rosario this week, G\u00f3mez\u2019s friends and family packed a billiards hall \u2013 emblazoned with the image of Homer Simpson \u2013 to pray the novena, or nine days of prayer. Over pastries and hot cups of fruit punch, Amado G\u00f3mez remembered his brother, a former logger, as an ambitious but often altruistic man, who graduated from Mexico\u2019s premier agricultural university and mostly worked in government until launching his activism in favour of the monarch butterflies.

      "body": "<p>In a quintessentially English cliche that a cosmopolitan intellectual might not appreciate, he had a good innings. George Steiner, the most distinctive literary and cultural critic of his time, died at his home in Cambridge last 3 February at the age of 90. He had what was, by any standards, a glittering career \u2013 as a writer, academic and public intellectual. Starting as the Gauss lecturer at Princeton in 1959, he was professor of English and comparative literature at the University of Geneva between 1974 and 1994. He also held visiting professorships at Yale and New York University and was Charles Eliot Norton professor of poetry at Harvard for 2001-2002.</p> <p>He was an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, was awarded the <em>Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur</em> by the French government and the King Albert medal by Belgium.</p> <p>In 1998 he received the Truman Capote Lifetime Achievement award in literary criticism, and in the same year was elected fellow of the British Academy. He wound up as the first Weidenfeld professor of comparative European literature at Oxford and extraordinary fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge.</p> <p>Stellar stuff. And yet the strange thing was that George always saw himself as an outsider. This was partly a legacy of his family background as a secular Jew. He was born in 1929 into a wealthy family in Paris, where his father, Frederick, was an investment banker who had moved to France from Vienna a few years earlier, having accurately read the runes of antisemitism. In 1940, Frederick moved the family to New York as the Nazis tightened their grip on France, and George was educated at a French lyc\u00e9e there, and afterwards at the University of Chicago, which he rightly perceived as being less hostile to Jews than the more traditional Ivy League institutions.</p> <p>After graduation, he did an MA at Harvard and then won a Rhodes scholarship to Balliol, where he did a DPhil, following which he went to work for the <em>Economist</em> in London. From there, he returned to academia \u2013 first to Princeton, then to Churchill College, where he was one of the founding fellows of that new institution, established as the national memorial to the wartime prime minister.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It didn\u2019t help that whenever he gave a public lecture in Cambridge, it was to packed audiences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the ordinary course of events, George would have been appointed to a teaching post in the Cambridge English faculty. But he never was, and therein lies the other part of his story: he remained for the rest of his life \u201cmerely\u201d a college fellow rather than a university teaching officer. There was something in his polymathic erudition and his flamboyant, multilingual literary style that seems to have got up the noses of his faculty peers. He was, perhaps, too much of an old-style central European intellectual, spoke too many languages, ranged too widely over too much literary and philosophical terrain. George was not the kind of scholar who crawls along the frontiers of knowledge with a magnifying glass. At any rate, he was often disparaged in academia as much as he was admired outside it.</p> <p>\u201cThe trouble with Steiner,\u201d one bitchy Oxford don is said to have remarked, \u201cis that he\u2019s clever enough not to have to be a charlatan.\u201d Or, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/books/review/Siegel-t.html\" title=\"\">as a reviewer of one of his books put it</a>: \u201cHis bracing virtue has been his ability to move from Pythagoras, through Aristotle and Dante, to Nietzsche and Tolstoy in a single paragraph. His irritating vice has been that he can move from Pythagoras, through Aristotle and Dante, to Nietzsche and Tolstoy in a single paragraph.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t help, either, that whenever he gave a public lecture in Cambridge, it was to packed audiences. And of course there was the small matter that for 30 years he was the chief book critic of the <em>New Yorker</em>, a post that carried with it remuneration far in excess of the stipend of a Cambridge professor. And, for a few years in the 1990s, he wrote book reviews for the <em>Observer</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"66a7da772a2e8be638dc3b2a2f52f61f3d9e4c7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66a7da772a2e8be638dc3b2a2f52f61f3d9e4c7c/166_109_4471_6755/662.jpg\" alt=\"Steiner in Oxford, 1994.\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018George always saw himself as an outsider\u2019: Steiner in Oxford, 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first met George in the 1980s, when I was a TV critic. At the time, Channel 4 was running a high-IQ chatshow called <em>Voices</em>, in which the host, the poet and critic Al Alvarez, batted around ideas with a panel of prominent public intellectuals. One evening, I watched, mesmerised, as <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/voices/on-demand/811-005\" title=\"\">George fluently extemporised for 10 whole minutes</a> \u2013 without notes, hesitation or much repetition \u2013 on the question of whether an authoritarian political system can produce more artistic creativity than the \u201cfree\u201d west.</p> <p>My review included a riff on a literary phenomenon \u2013 the Steiner sentence \u2013 a formidable expressive work that came, perfectly formed, with an ancillary apparatus of footnotes, subordinate clauses and scholarly asides, and went on long after the programme had come to an end, the lights had been switched off and the entire production crew had gone home to bed. And having dispatched the review, I too switched off and went to bed.</p> <p>A few days later, a postcard arrived from George inviting me to lunch at the Green Man in Grantchester, where we had an enjoyable, convivial conversation. Thereafter, we met occasionally for dinner in our respective homes in Cambridge.</p> <p>It was an unlikely friendship. As an engineer versed in \u201ccomputery\u201d, I was the embodiment of a modernity that he loathed and, to be honest, I was slightly in awe of his erudition. Yet we got on well and it was always a joy to run into him in town. My nicest memory is of meeting him one day in the street. He was beaming with excitement.</p> <p>\u201cSomething wonderful has happened,\u201d he announced.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve won the Nobel prize for literature?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, even better than that,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ve been invited to do <em>Desert Island Discs</em>.\u201d</p> <p>It was true, and thanks to BBC Sounds <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0093nsr\" title=\"\">it\u2019s available online</a>. If you to want to know what George was like, dig it out and have a listen.</p>",

And yet the strange thing was that George always saw himself as an outsider. This was partly a legacy of his family background as a secular Jew. He was born in 1929 into a wealthy family in Paris, where his father, Frederick, was an investment banker who had moved to France from Vienna a few years earlier, having accurately read the runes of antisemitism. In 1940, Frederick moved the family to New York as the Nazis tightened their grip on France, and George was educated at a French lyc\u00e9e there, and afterwards at the University of Chicago, which he rightly perceived as being less hostile to Jews than the more traditional Ivy League institutions. After graduation, he did an MA at Harvard and then won a Rhodes scholarship to Balliol, where he did a DPhil, following which he went to work for the Economist in London. From there, he returned to academia \u2013 first to Princeton, then to Churchill College, where he was one of the founding fellows of that new institution, established as the national memorial to the wartime prime minister. In the ordinary course of events, George would have been appointed to a teaching post in the Cambridge English faculty. But he never was, and therein lies the other part of his story: he remained for the rest of his life \u201cmerely\u201d a college fellow rather than a university teaching officer. There was something in his polymathic erudition and his flamboyant, multilingual literary style that seems to have got up the noses of his faculty peers. He was, perhaps, too much of an old-style central European intellectual, spoke too many languages, ranged too widely over too much literary and philosophical terrain. George was not the kind of scholar who crawls along the frontiers of knowledge with a magnifying glass. At any rate, he was often disparaged in academia as much as he was admired outside it. \u201cThe trouble with Steiner,\u201d one bitchy Oxford don is said to have remarked, \u201cis that he\u2019s clever enough not to have to be a charlatan.\u201d Or, as a reviewer of one of his books put it: \u201cHis bracing virtue has been his ability to move from Pythagoras, through Aristotle and Dante, to Nietzsche and Tolstoy in a single paragraph. His irritating vice has been that he can move from Pythagoras, through Aristotle and Dante, to Nietzsche and Tolstoy in a single paragraph.\u201d It didn\u2019t help, either, that whenever he gave a public lecture in Cambridge, it was to packed audiences. And of course there was the small matter that for 30 years he was the chief book critic of the New Yorker, a post that carried with it remuneration far in excess of the stipend of a Cambridge professor. And, for a few years in the 1990s, he wrote book reviews for the Observer. I first met George in the 1980s, when I was a TV critic. At the time, Channel 4 was running a high-IQ chatshow called Voices, in which the host, the poet and critic Al Alvarez, batted around ideas with a panel of prominent public intellectuals. One evening, I watched, mesmerised, as George fluently extemporised for 10 whole minutes \u2013 without notes, hesitation or much repetition \u2013 on the question of whether an authoritarian political system can produce more artistic creativity than the \u201cfree\u201d west. My review included a riff on a literary phenomenon \u2013 the Steiner sentence \u2013 a formidable expressive work that came, perfectly formed, with an ancillary apparatus of footnotes, subordinate clauses and scholarly asides, and went on long after the programme had come to an end, the lights had been switched off and the entire production crew had gone home to bed. And having dispatched the review, I too switched off and went to bed. A few days later, a postcard arrived from George inviting me to lunch at the Green Man in Grantchester, where we had an enjoyable, convivial conversation. Thereafter, we met occasionally for dinner in our respective homes in Cambridge. It was an unlikely friendship. As an engineer versed in \u201ccomputery\u201d, I was the embodiment of a modernity that he loathed and, to be honest, I was slightly in awe of his erudition. Yet we got on well and it was always a joy to run into him in town. My nicest memory is of meeting him one day in the street. He was beaming with excitement. \u201cSomething wonderful has happened,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou\u2019ve won the Nobel prize for literature?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, even better than that,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ve been invited to do Desert Island Discs.\u201d It was true, and thanks to BBC Sounds it\u2019s available online. If you to want to know what George was like, dig it out and have a listen.",

On 7 January, <em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80117542\" title=\"\">The Great Hack</a></em> \u2013 a Netflix film that shines a light on the murky world of Cambridge Analytica and its role in Trump and Brexit (and in which I play a small part) \u2013 is nominated for a Bafta for best documentary, and via a series of increasingly complicated emails cc-ed to a dozen or more people detailing car logistics and dietary requirements, it\u2019s revealed that I\u2019ve been invited to the ceremony. This is unfortunate as I have zero intention of going.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m out of the country,\u201d I email back. \u201cBut have a wonderful time!\u201d I\u2019m thrilled for Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer, the film-makers, but it\u2019s their work, not mine, and anyone who has ever been to a British journalism award ceremony bears the scars. There\u2019s only a certain number of times you can politely applaud a story about Barbara Windsor having Alzheimer\u2019s as \u201cscoop of the year\u201d while eating unidentifiable brown matter in a pair of Spanx. From everything I\u2019ve seen, the Baftas take the standard black tie nightmare to new levels: a 3pm start for a ceremony that begins at 7, with dinner not served until 10. And, anyway, I really am out of the country. \u201cYou have to come!\u201d Karim yells down the phone at me. \u201cWe\u2019re the underdogs. We\u2019re the nerds who\u2019ve got invited to the school prom.\u201d</p> <p>The upshot of this is that merely hours after stepping off an 18-hour flight, I find myself exiting a people carrier outside the Royal Albert Hall wearing that classic combination of a panic-bought dress that doesn\u2019t quite fit and shoes I can\u2019t walk in. There are 11 of us from the film, including producers, executive producers and editors, as well as Brittany Kaiser, the ex-Cambridge Analytica employee who is the film\u2019s complicated central character, and David Carroll, a New York professor who is its expert guide.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s two days after Brexit. Donald Trump is president. The world is burning.

She walks out ahead of us, like one of those flares the Taliban sends up to draw enemy fire, while David, next to me, laughs nervously. \u201cWow,\u201d he says surveying the limos, the security flunkies, the massed ranks of the international press, \u201cI really didn\u2019t ever imagine I\u2019d end up here!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I reassure him. \u201cNobody gives a shit about us.\u201d</p> <p>I feel the need to share my insights from a career spent on the fringes of the celebrity industrial complex, though I\u2019m not entirely sure David welcomes these dispatches. You could be nominated for a Bafta and fall over on the red carpet, I tell him, and nobody would care as long as it\u2019s a documentary. It\u2019s unfortunate if slightly inevitable that I prove this point by tripping over a step and landing flat on my face, before being delicately hauled up like a heifer stumbling en route to the abattoir. But then the whole spectacle has more than a touch of the factory farm to it, though you wouldn\u2019t treat a battery hen the way they do Taron Egerton: for a full 10 minutes before they announce best actor, a camera is trained on him, five inches from his face, waiting for the flinch, the twitch, the emotion as \u201cJoaquin Phoenix\u201d is announced the winner.</p> <p>After the camera crews, we face a wall of paparazzi, who couldn\u2019t have less interest in us but who take our photo in case one of us accidentally sleeps with someone from <em>Game of Thrones</em> or is at some point in the future interestingly murdered.

Given a platform to say anything, the most gorgeous, beautiful, creative, well-paid people in the world say nothing at all.</p> <p>It becomes increasingly unignorable that there is not a single fiction film nominated that has anything to do with anything; that engages in any way at all with the time that we\u2019re living in. Pretty much everyone involved with <em>The Great Hack</em> has slogged their guts out because they believe in the urgency of telling this story, now. And we\u2019re up against <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/15/for-sama-review-documentary-aleppo-syria\" title=\"\">For Sama</a></em>, the incredible story of the horrors of the Syrian war by Waad al-Kateab, a Syrian journalist who was trapped inside Aleppo. But the feature films feel like they could have been made at any time in the last 30 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f47652d14f1dcd2722e3bd57bbe3a67f0fafaa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f47652d14f1dcd2722e3bd57bbe3a67f0fafaa6/89_260_1202_1502/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brittany Kaiser on the Bafta red carpet.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brittany Kaiser on the Bafta red carpet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carole Cadwalladr/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It doesn\u2019t help that the Baftas reflect an industry that is almost overwhelmingly white and male, that the svengali who presided over that industry for at least two decades is currently on trial in New York for rape, and that the only category women can be sure to be nominated for are the ones for best actress. There\u2019s a reason perhaps why the range of stories up for these awards is so narrow, so insular, so unengaged, though it takes Phoenix to finally burst the bubble of overwrought politeness and humble gratitude. He steps on to the stage and talks about feeling \u201cshame\u201d in accepting an award from an organisation that sends \u201ca very clear message to people of colour that \u2018you\u2019re not welcome here\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>It matters because on the one hand the Baftas couldn\u2019t feel more shallow, more superficial. But on the other, it couldn\u2019t be more important. This is where commissions are secured, reputations are burnished, careers are made. And I have followed from a distance the obstacles that faced a film like <em>The Great Hack</em>. It was too \u201cpolitical\u201d, the film-makers kept being told. In an industry where, in the US, Academy voters are overwhelmingly white, Republican and male, that was a problem. In November, we did an event in New York with Hillary Clinton where she talked movingly about how it was such \u201ca difficult film for me to watch\u201d. But Netflix, twitchy, banned press and film crews from the event. This was a country, Hillary said, which was still in denial, in a \u201cstate of disbelief\u201d about what had happened. How Facebook had facilitated an attack on American democracy by a hostile foreign power. How it was at risk of exactly the same thing happening again in 2020. She was right: denial and ignorance. Even in the heart of America\u2019s myth machine, Hollywood itself.</p> <p>When, finally, the moment comes, best documentary goes to <em>For Sama</em>. Waad is sitting five rows in front of us and she takes her young daughter up on stage and makes a heartfelt speech about Syria and it\u2019s impossible to feel anything but solidarity. Not least because Syria is the extreme outcome of the world <em>The Great Hack</em> depicts: a terrible, awful, ongoing hell marked not just by bombs and death but propaganda, manipulation, foreign interference and apathy.</p> <p>These are stories that we have to tell better. This is what I learn at the Brexit-Baftas. It\u2019s only when the creative genius of something like first world war drama <em>1917,</em> winner of seven Baftas, is brought to bear on this dark world of online manipulation, populist politicians and platform surveillance that change will come. I\u2019ve spent almost every day of the last three years thinking how to explain the complex story of what happened with data, with Facebook, with Brexit, with Trump, but it needs more than news. It needs stars and a soundtrack and a storyteller who can distil what happened into human terms. The story isn\u2019t \u201cpolitical\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s epoch-threatening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5d37d738eeedae297f0c42d47e63837441ae56f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5d37d738eeedae297f0c42d47e63837441ae56f/0_131_2048_1405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Hack entourage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Great Hack entourage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Carroll/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Afterwards, at the dinner, where I discover even celebs get served unidentifiable brown matter, Karim grabs me and introduces me first to Hugh Grant and then Ren\u00e9e Zellweger who are both, he claims, fans of the film. On stage, Zellweger smiled sweetly and thanked a long list of people. Off stage, she drops the smile and talks urgently about Trump, America, 2020 and what can be done. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d she keeps asking. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p> <p>The celebs care \u2013 they\u2019re just trapped inside a system that precludes these subjects being covered, it seems. Those who do put their heads above the parapet such as Hugh Grant, who for years has engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the tabloid press and Brexit and Boris Johnson, pay the price. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do any more,\u201d he says. \u201cI fear I\u2019ve reached the end of the road.\u201d</p> <p>At the Chiltern Firehouse, the scene of Netflix\u2019s Bafta after-party, I find another casualty: Damian Collins, the Tory MP who oversaw parliament\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news as chair of the DCMS committee. A week ago, he got the boot. Collins doesn\u2019t directly blame Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, but of course it was him. Collins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/commons-report-rules-dominic-cummings-in-contempt-of-parliament\" title=\"\">held Cummings in contempt of parliament</a> and this was the latter\u2019s revenge. Collins\u2019s successor is Julian Knight. \u201cHe\u2019s basically been given the job of smashing the BBC, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d I say. Collins doesn\u2019t disagree.</p> <p>There\u2019s some greater point to be made about how we\u2019re discussing the breakup of the BBC at a party paid for by Netflix, one of the platforms whose business model has threatened its existence. But there\u2019s another point that could be made too, that Netflix backed the story told in <em>The Great Hack</em> \u2013 even if it got nervous \u2013 and the BBC didn\u2019t. It failed to understand and cover events \u2013 including the role of Dominic Cummings \u2013 that now threaten to tear it apart.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iX8GxLP1FHo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo\">Watch a trailer for The Great Hack.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s two days since Brexit and the world is on fire and at the Chiltern Firehouse we dance until dawn, breaking off only so that I can humiliate myself in front of Rihanna. She appears in front of us, an emissary from a world of power and influence whose Instagram page probably <em>could</em> change the world. \u201cYOU HAVE TO TALK TO HER,\u201d one of <em>The Great Hack</em>\u2019s crew tells me. \u201cShe\u2019s from Trinidad! You need to talk to her about what Cambridge Analytica did there!\u201d For some unaccountable reason I listen to him and bound over. She looks at me and curls her lip. \u201cI\u2019m from BARBADOS,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Oh well, you lose some and you lose some. Look at Brexit. But I\u2019m convinced that we\u2019re only at the start of telling the story of what happened. That <em>The Great Hack</em> was a first attempt, but it requires others. We are looking down the barrel of another compromised US election, Facebook still out of control, Russia on the ascendant, Europe weakened, Syria still in flames, Mark Zuckerberg a danger to democracies everywhere. If that\u2019s not a story, you have to wonder what is. And why it\u2019s not being told.</p>",

It doesn\u2019t help that the Baftas reflect an industry that is almost overwhelmingly white and male, that the svengali who presided over that industry for at least two decades is currently on trial in New York for rape, and that the only category women can be sure to be nominated for are the ones for best actress. There\u2019s a reason perhaps why the range of stories up for these awards is so narrow, so insular, so unengaged, though it takes Phoenix to finally burst the bubble of overwrought politeness and humble gratitude. He steps on to the stage and talks about feeling \u201cshame\u201d in accepting an award from an organisation that sends \u201ca very clear message to people of colour that \u2018you\u2019re not welcome here\u2019\u201d. It matters because on the one hand the Baftas couldn\u2019t feel more shallow, more superficial. But on the other, it couldn\u2019t be more important. This is where commissions are secured, reputations are burnished, careers are made. And I have followed from a distance the obstacles that faced a film like The Great Hack. It was too \u201cpolitical\u201d, the film-makers kept being told. In an industry where, in the US, Academy voters are overwhelmingly white, Republican and male, that was a problem. In November, we did an event in New York with Hillary Clinton where she talked movingly about how it was such \u201ca difficult film for me to watch\u201d. But Netflix, twitchy, banned press and film crews from the event. This was a country, Hillary said, which was still in denial, in a \u201cstate of disbelief\u201d about what had happened. How Facebook had facilitated an attack on American democracy by a hostile foreign power. How it was at risk of exactly the same thing happening again in 2020. She was right: denial and ignorance. Even in the heart of America\u2019s myth machine, Hollywood itself. When, finally, the moment comes, best documentary goes to For Sama. Waad is sitting five rows in front of us and she takes her young daughter up on stage and makes a heartfelt speech about Syria and it\u2019s impossible to feel anything but solidarity. Not least because Syria is the extreme outcome of the world The Great Hack depicts: a terrible, awful, ongoing hell marked not just by bombs and death but propaganda, manipulation, foreign interference and apathy. These are stories that we have to tell better. This is what I learn at the Brexit-Baftas. It\u2019s only when the creative genius of something like first world war drama 1917, winner of seven Baftas, is brought to bear on this dark world of online manipulation, populist politicians and platform surveillance that change will come. I\u2019ve spent almost every day of the last three years thinking how to explain the complex story of what happened with data, with Facebook, with Brexit, with Trump, but it needs more than news. It needs stars and a soundtrack and a storyteller who can distil what happened into human terms. The story isn\u2019t \u201cpolitical\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s epoch-threatening. Afterwards, at the dinner, where I discover even celebs get served unidentifiable brown matter, Karim grabs me and introduces me first to Hugh Grant and then Ren\u00e9e Zellweger who are both, he claims, fans of the film. On stage, Zellweger smiled sweetly and thanked a long list of people. Off stage, she drops the smile and talks urgently about Trump, America, 2020 and what can be done. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d she keeps asking. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d The celebs care \u2013 they\u2019re just trapped inside a system that precludes these subjects being covered, it seems. Those who do put their heads above the parapet such as Hugh Grant, who for years has engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the tabloid press and Brexit and Boris Johnson, pay the price. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do any more,\u201d he says. \u201cI fear I\u2019ve reached the end of the road.\u201d At the Chiltern Firehouse, the scene of Netflix\u2019s Bafta after-party, I find another casualty: Damian Collins, the Tory MP who oversaw parliament\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news as chair of the DCMS committee. A week ago, he got the boot. Collins doesn\u2019t directly blame Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, but of course it was him. Collins held Cummings in contempt of parliament and this was the latter\u2019s revenge. Collins\u2019s successor is Julian Knight. \u201cHe\u2019s basically been given the job of smashing the BBC, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d I say. Collins doesn\u2019t disagree. There\u2019s some greater point to be made about how we\u2019re discussing the breakup of the BBC at a party paid for by Netflix, one of the platforms whose business model has threatened its existence. But there\u2019s another point that could be made too, that Netflix backed the story told in The Great Hack \u2013 even if it got nervous \u2013 and the BBC didn\u2019t. It failed to understand and cover events \u2013 including the role of Dominic Cummings \u2013 that now threaten to tear it apart. It\u2019s two days since Brexit and the world is on fire and at the Chiltern Firehouse we dance until dawn, breaking off only so that I can humiliate myself in front of Rihanna. She appears in front of us, an emissary from a world of power and influence whose Instagram page probably could change the world. \u201cYOU HAVE TO TALK TO HER,\u201d one of The Great Hack\u2019s crew tells me. \u201cShe\u2019s from Trinidad! You need to talk to her about what Cambridge Analytica did there!\u201d For some unaccountable reason I listen to him and bound over. She looks at me and curls her lip. \u201cI\u2019m from BARBADOS,\u201d she says. Oh well, you lose some and you lose some. Look at Brexit. But I\u2019m convinced that we\u2019re only at the start of telling the story of what happened. That The Great Hack was a first attempt, but it requires others. We are looking down the barrel of another compromised US election, Facebook still out of control, Russia on the ascendant, Europe weakened, Syria still in flames, Mark Zuckerberg a danger to democracies everywhere. If that\u2019s not a story, you have to wonder what is. And why it\u2019s not being told.",

      "bodyText": "Andy Hunter was at Goodison Park for the Guardian and this is how he saw the home side\u2019s victory unfold. Roy Hodgson speaks: It should go without saying that the Crystal Palace manager is as downbeat as you might expect. \u201cIt was a cruel defeat in many ways,\u201d he tells BT Sport\u2019s Des Kelly. \u201cThe first 25 minutes was tame from both teams, but towards the end of the half we showed more confidence and got on the ball better. \u201cThe way we started the second was half really good and the equaliser was a result of the control we had,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe second goal came when we were pushing and all of a sudden the [Calvert-Lewin] flick puts Richarlison through on a 40 or 50-yard run and we found ourselves fighting to get back another equaliser - we hit the crossbar, the keeper made a fantastic save. \u201cThe third killed it off. I can\u2019t fault the players\u2019 effort, but it\u2019s another defeat and we get what we get for it: nothing.\u201d Carlo Ancelotti speaks to BT Sport: \u201cThe best thing today is the result because the performance was not so good,\u201d says Everton\u2019s manager. \u201cIt was a difficult game, a lot of interruptions with throw-ins and we were not able to keep the intensity. Richarlison did a fantastic counter attack and we won for this reason.\u201d On the subject of Everton substitute delaying his entrance to the arena because he had forgotten to put on one of his socks, he raises that famous eyebrow. \u201cIt is certainly a new experience for me,\u201d he says with a smile. The Premier League table Everton move up to their rightful place of seventh in the table and are knocking on the door of Europa League qualification. Palace, meanwhile, stay in 14th place, marooned on 30 points. They are six points clear of the relegation zone but look anything but safe. They\u2019re struggling at both ends of the pitch, looking porous at the back and fairly toothless up front. Dominic Calvert Lewin speaks: \u201cWe knew how important it was today,\u201d he tells BT Sport, shortly after giving his shirt to a young pitch invader and donning a training top for his appearance in front of the camera. \u201cBack-to-back wins puts us in good sshape going into the break. It\u2019s good we won, it wasn\u2019t the prettiest game but we dug in.\u201d \u201cI am enjoying playing with Richi [Richarlison],\u201d he adds. \u201cSince Dunc [Ferguson] came in we have been a partnership - we work together, complement each other. It wasn\u2019t the best performance from me but I got the goal and should have had another one.\u201d In summary: As a spectacle it wasn\u2019t up to much, but Everton have run out worthy winners after a much improved second half performance from both sets of players. Bernard gave Everton the lead on 18 minutes, but Everton looked to be on the ropes after Christian Benteke took advantage of a Jordan Pickford mistake to end his goal drought. Richarlison steadied the ship for Everton with a fine solo goal, before Dominic Calvert-Lewin made sure of the points with a late tap-in after Richarlison had hit the bar at a corner. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over at Goodison Park, where Everton have emerged victorious. Their recovery under Carlo Ancelotti continues, but Palace\u2019s woes continue. They\u2019ve lost three in a row and are without a win in seven Premier League games. 90+3 min: Schneiderlin tries a shot from the edge of the penalty area, but fires weakly at Milivojevic. 90+1 min: A Richarlison shot from distance is parried into the path of Calvert-Lewin by Guaita, but this time the Everton striker lacks the composure to finish. He blasts the ball high and wide when scoring looked easier. 89 min: Calvert-Lewin has a shot from distance, which Guaita tips over the bar for another corner. This one is sent towards the far post, where Yerry Mina\u2019s header is deflected out for another corner by Gary Cahill. Calvert-Lewin scores!! Digne sends the ball to the middle of the penalty area and Richarlison\u2019s header looks to be heading for the top corner. It hits the cross-bar but the ball drops for Calvert-Lewin, who has a simple tap-in from a couple of yards out. 87 min: Scott Dann slides in to dispossess Lucas Digne and concedes a corner in the process. 85 min: Everton substitution: Mason Holgate on for Gylfi Sigurdsson, with a view to shoring up the defence in these late stages. 84 min: With his back to goal, Benteke turns, swivels and fires a Scott Dann knock-down that bounced his way the wrong side of the upright. 83 min: Palace win a free-kick over by the lefttouchline. Van Aanholt\u2019s delivery into the wind is weak and is cleared on the edge of the penalty area before it can reach any of Palace\u2019s big men. 81 min: Kouyate wins a corner, but Milivojevic\u2019s delivery is cleared by Yerry Mina. The ball\u2019s sent back into the mixer and goes out for a goal-kick. Wilfried Zaha seems to think it should have been another corner. 79 min: We approach the final 10 minutes with Everton leading by the odd goal of the three scored. A crunching tackle by Schneiderlin on Milivojevic prompts raucous cheers from the stands. Palace substitution: Joel Ward makes way for Cheikhou Kouyate. James McArthur moves to right-back and Kouyate slots into midfield. 78 min: How bereft of ideas? Well, they\u2019ve just won a free-kick in the middle of the park and used it to play the ball backwards to their goalkeeper. 75 min: Having looked seriously shaky in the minutes before and after Christian Benteke\u2019s equaliser, Everton have reasserted their dominance since Gylfi Sigurdsson put them back in front. Crystal Palace have looked fairly bereft of ideas throughout the game and the one goal they did score was extremely fortuitous. 72 min: Sigurdsson releases Sidibe down the right with a cross-field pass and the substitute sprints down the touchline with Coleman up in support. Luka Milivojevic gets across to put a stop to their collective gallop. 71 min: Gary Cahill wins a free-kick after being bundled over in his own penalty area by Dominic Calvert-Lewin, as the Everton striker attempted to get on the end of a route one ball into the box from Djibril Sidibe. 69 min: From the left side of the penalty area, Milivojevic tries to pick out Zaha at the far post, but his pass drifts high and wide of the Everton goal. 68 min: Crystal Palace substitution: James McCarthy off, Max Meyer on. McCarthy, a former Evertonian, gets a warm reception from the home crowd. 66 min: James Tomkins was forced off in the immediate aftermath of Richarlison\u2019s goal and has been replaced by Scott Dann. For Everton, Bernard has just made way for Tom Davies. 64 min: Now it\u2019s Vicente Guaita\u2019s turn to impress, stretching out his left arm to prevent the ball from going past him after Sigurdsson had wriggled past three players and tried to lift it over him and into the top corner. Sensational goalkeeping at both ends of the pitch. 62 min: Jordan Pickford goes some way towards redeeming himself with a fantastic save from Benteke. The Palace striker looked to have the goal at his mercy from five or six yards out, but Pickford flung himself to his left to save the header from point-blank range with his chest. 60 min: Richarlison wheels away in celebration after a fine goal. He was sent galloping down the pitch in the aftermath of a corner at the other end. Everton hoofed clear, Dominic Calvert-Lewin put it into Richarlison\u2019s path with a nice little touch and the Brazilian outran Gary Cahill, before cutting between him and James Tomkins defenders and curling a wonderful shot past Guaita into the bottom corner. Everton re-take the lead. With Palace finally dominant, their hosts go ahead again with a scything counter-attack. 57 min: Palace have a corner and the ball is sent towards the near post by Van Aanholt. Richarlison and Coleman make a mess of their attempts to clear it and Pickford is all over the place, through no fault of his own, as the ball ricochets off Benteke and then the post. 55 min: Nobody was a bigger fan of Jordan Pickford than me when he made his name as a young goalkeeper in a struggling Sunderland team, but after yet another error, you\u2019d have to question his credentials as England\u2019s No1. He\u2019ll probably keep his place in Gareth Southgate\u2019s team, but at what cost to their England\u2019s fortunes during the European Championships. 53 min: Jordan Pickford is standing with his hands on his hips, shaking his head and well he might. He\u2019s had a nightmare on this occasion. Having had to ball played to him on the right side of the penalty area by Wilf Zaha, Benteke shot towards the near post. Pickford looked to have it covered, but somehow let the ball squirm through his legs. It should have been a straightforward save, but Benteke won\u2019t care. The much-documented drought is finally over. It\u2019s all square! And Christian Benteke has scored after 34 games without a goal. 50 min: Palace work their way down the left touchline, with Van Aanholt, McArthur and Benteke linking up. The move breaks down when McArthur is flagged for offside. 48 min: Pickford is forced off his line to punch a bouncing ball clear under pressure from McArthur, after Yerry Mina had completely missed a Zaha cross into the box with his acrobatic effort to clear it. 47 min: Jordan Pickford sends a clearance out of play and into the stand. It\u2019s a rare kicking aberration from the England goalkeeper. 46 min: Seamus Coleman concedes an early free-kick after clattering into the back of Wilf Zaha. They\u2019re having quite the duel this afternoon, but the Irishman is keeping the Palace winger on a very tight rein. 46 min: Play resumes, on the first of two weekends in English football featuring the Heads Together Heads Up campaign to raise awareness of mental health. Click on the link to find out more about this decidedly worthy venture. Peep! A fairly forgettable half is put out of its misery, the only moments of quality having been Bernard\u2019s sweet volley on 18 minutes and Everton substitute Djibril Sidibe having to return to the dressing room because he had forgotten to put on one of his socks. 45+3 min: Everton teammates Morgan Schneiderlin and Yerry Mina have a frank exchange of views over something or other, with the former poking the latter vigorously in the chest with his finger. 45+2 min: Patrick van Aanholt shoots high and wide after receiving a cushioned pass from Christian Benteke on the edge of the Everton penalty area. 45 min: A half very low on quality nears its close, as the fourth official signals three minutes of added time to make up for the break in play when Theo Walcott required treatment before going off. 43 min: Pickford comes for the ball, claims it and then loses it in a penalty area challenge with Wilf Zaha. The Palace winger scrambles to his feet in a bid to chase the loose ball and promptly goes to ground as he tussles for it with Seamus Coleman. He appeals for a penalty, but none is forthcoming. That seems fair enough to me, having seen a replay. 42 min: A Patrick van Aanholt back-pass to his own goalkeeper comes up short, due to the wind, forcing Guaita to hare out of his penalty area and hack it clear under extreme pressure from Richarlison. 41 min: Crystal Palace have improved a bit in recent minutes, but still don\u2019t look like scoring. 40 min: Having stood in opposing dug-outs for the first time in Italy back 1996, Carlo Ancelotti and Roy Hodgson are enjoying a nice chat on the touchline. 39 min: Jordan Ayew sends a cross in from the left after good work by Sidibe to win the ball. He aims for Christian Benteke, but Michael Keane heads clear. 37 min: Joel Ward is penalised for hand ball in a tussle with Richarlison. Free-kick for Everton, about 40 yards from the Everton goal. Lucas Digne sends the ball into the mixer, where Ward clears. 35 min: Palace get the ball out of their own half for what seems like the first time in their age, but Ayew is dispossessed by a crunching tackle from Coleman. 34 min: The pressure from Everton is practically relentless at this stage, with their visitors severely under the cosh. Palace are not playing with any kind of urgency and are doing little more than hanging, trying to weather the storm at the moment. 33 min: Seamus Coleman curls the ball towards the far post from deep, trying to pick out Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Palace clear. 31 min: Lucas Digne dribbles along the front of the Palace penalty area, only to be dispossessed by Joel Ward before he can take a shot. 29 min: According to BT Sport\u2019s Des Kelly, Djibril Sidibe went back to the dressing room because he had forgotten one of his socks. How on earth do you forget to put on a sock? 27 min: Moments after that Calvert-Lewin chance, Djibril emerged from the tunnel and has now dignified his fellow combatants with his presence. He\u2019s on for Theo Walcott, who has pulled up lame. 26 min: Having knocked a Seamus Coleman delivery to Bernard, Dominic Calvert-Lewin lifts himself off the ground and flings himself goalwards, trying to convert the return pass. He can\u2019t reach it. 25 min: Or is he? Sidibe either needs to visit the toilet or has forgotten something. He heads for the tunnel, leaving Carlo Ancelotti and Duncan Ferguson looking furious. 23 min: Having provided the assist for Everton\u2019s opener, Theo Walcott appears to be struggling with injury. He\u2019s going to come off and be replaced by Djibril Sidibe. 22 min: Calvert-Lewini tries to play the ball past Joel Ward into the path of Richarlison, but the Crystal Palace defender stretches to intercept. 19 min: Everton get their noses in front, capitalising on an error by Wilfried Zaha. He lost possession not too far outside his own penalty area, Walcott took the ball wide of Van Aanholt and then curled in a wonderful cross. It dropped beautifully for Bernard, whose side-footed finish from eight yards could not have been any sweeter. Everton take the lead! Theo Walcott curls a wonderful cross in from the left after a mistake in possession by Wilf Zaha and Bernard clips a wonderful half-volley past Guaita to put his side a goal up. 16 min: Palace win a free-kick wide on the right and Milivojevic curls the ball towards the far post, aiming for Christian Benteke., Jordan Pickford comes off his line to claim confidently. 15 min: Palace hoof it long and a back-pedalling Michael Keane does well to head the bouncing ball clear under extreme pressure from Jordan Ayew. 13 min: Patrick van Aanholt cuts into the Everton penalty area from the right and unleashes a low shot. It takes a wicked deflection off Theo Walcott before hitting the post and going out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. 12 min: Crystal Palace win a corner, Michael Keane doing well to tackle Christian Benteke as he cantered into the Everton penalty area. Gary Cahill gets a near post flick-on, but Dominic Calvert-Lewin intercepts. Everton clear the danger. 11 min: Having won the free-kick, Lucas Digne floats the ball in to the penalty from deep, trying to pick out Yerry Mina at the far post. The big Colombian wins the header, but is unable to direct it goalwards. 9 min: James McCarthy is booked for a decidedly robust challenge on Lucas Digne. He slid in and got the ball, but took out the Everton defender in the process. There\u2019s a VAR check to see if the challenge is more deserving of a red, but it remains a booking. 9 min: Good work from Seamus Coleman, who gets tight on Zaha and puts the ball out of play for a throw-in as Palace\u2019s star man was threatening. 8 min: Patrick van Aanholt tries to play Wilfried Zaha in behind Seamus Coleman and into the penalty area, but his pass is wayward and Jordan Pickford is first to the ball. 6 min: Jordan Ayew picks up the ball on the edge of the final third, but is tackled by Lucas Digne, who incurs a minor injury in the process. He picks himself off the ground and carries on. 5 min: Everton advance up the pitch with Gylfi Sigurdsson on the ball. The atmosphere at Goodison Park seems remarkably subdued in these early stages, meaning the shouts of the players on the field clearly audible. 3 min: Lucas Digne shoots for goal from the free-kick, his drive bouncing in front of Guaita as the goalkeeper dives to his right to save. 2 min: Gary Cahill is caught in possession at the back by Dominic Calvert-Lewin and fouls the Everton striker as he tries to retrieve it. Free-kick for Everton about 30 years from the Palace goal, where Vicente Guaita\u2019s vision is being impaired by the sun in his eyes. 1 min: It\u2019s a windy day on Merseyside as play gets under way, with Palace getting the ball rolling. Everton\u2019s players wear their customary home kit of blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. Their visitors wear navy shirts, shorts and socks. Not long now: The teams make their way out on to the Goodison Park pitch for one of just four top flight games being played this weekend, what with the other 12 top flight teams currently enjoying their winter break. The players go through the last of the pre-match formalities and kick-off is just a couple of minutes away. Carlo Ancelotti speaks: \u201cWe need more of everything,\u201d said Everton\u2019s manager on the subject of his four changes. \u201cMore quality, more intensity, more pressure, more concentration. It\u2019s not easy to pick the line-up but I want everyone to be involved and the players accept my decisions. Crystal Palace are a good team with lots of different qualities but we want to focus on our game today. We hope to take the initiative and play a fantastic match.\u201d Roy Hodgson speaks: Asked if he would pick Vicente Guaita following the goalkeeping error that cost Crystal Palace three points against Sheffield United last week, Roy Hodgson was adamant the Spaniard would start today. \u201cYou don\u2019t drop first-choice goalkeepers because they\u2019ve made one mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone. We\u2019re very happy with him and very happy he\u2019s playing today.\u201d Four changes for Everton ... While Roy Hodgson names an identical side to the one that lost against Sheffield United last weekend, Carlo Ancelotti has made four changes following his team\u2019s come-from-behind win against Watford. As previously mentioned, Fabian Delph is suspended and replaced by Morgan Schneiderlin, while Seamus Coleman and Michael Keane come into defence for Djibril Sidibe and Mason Holgate. Alex Iwobi also drops to the bench to make way for Bernard. Everton: Pickford, Coleman, Keane, Mina, Digne, Walcott, Sigurdsson, Schneiderlin, Bernard, Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison. Subs: Holgate, Baines, Iwobi, Sidibe, Stekelenburg, Davies, Kean. Crystal Palace: Guaita, Ward, Tomkins, Cahill, van Aanholt, Ayew, McCarthy, Milivojevic, McArthur, Zaha, Benteke. Subs: Dann, Meyer, Kouyate, Townsend, Hennessey, Mitchell, Riedewald. Referee: David Coote (Nottinghamshire) Early team news ... Everton will be without Fabian Delph, who is serving a one-match suspension and will sit this game out on the Naughty Step following his red card against Watford last weekend. Andre Gomes and Jan-Philippe Gbamin are long term absentees, although Carlo Ancelotti has revealed that Gomes is nearing a surprisingly early return from the horrific ankle injury he suffered during Everton\u2019s draw with Spurs in November. The midfielder might be fit enough to make Everton\u2019s squad for their match against Arsenal on 23 February. On loan at Palace from Everton, the Turkish striker Cenk Tosun is ineligible for this game against his parent club, but would have missed out anyway due to a hamstring problem. Centre-back Mamadou Sakho remains sidelined with a hip injury, while left-back Jeffrey Schlupp has a hip injury and has not played since early December. Match preview ... Had it not been for the stoppage-time implosion against Newcastle Carlo Ancelotti would be seeking his fourth win in four home matches as Everton manager. Having overseen the club\u2019s first comeback victory in the Premier League for over two years last weekend, however, and with 10 men at Watford, he had no complaints over the response. Palace lack that momentum, with no wins in 2020, only three victories in the last 17 league games and an underwhelming transfer window fuelling frustration around Selhurst Park, yet only three points separate these sides. The first of today\u2019s two Premier League matches kick off at Goodison Park, where Everton host Crystal Palace in today\u2019s lunchtime fixture. Just three points separate the sides, but Palace will draw level with Everton on 30 points if they can beat them today. Kick-off on Merseyside is at 12.30pm (GMT), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

Mac Maharaj, 84, was a close associate in the increasingly radical anti-apartheid struggle of the 1950s and early 1960s and joined Mandela in the armed wing of the African National Congress. Both were sent to Robben Island prison, where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-15422179\" title=\"\">Maharaj secretly helped Mandela</a> compile his bestselling autobiography.</p> <p>From the start, Mandela\u2019s noble origins as the son of a chief, relative pragmatism and commitment to constitutional democracy caused friction, Maharaj said. \u201cMandela was saying that South Africa belongs to all, and that even in the [armed wing] we wanted to avoid bloodshed if we could. In prison, Mandela kept saying we have to put pressure on the government to talk, and people got very angry with him and accused him of selling out. They said he wasn\u2019t a scientific socialist but a conservative aristocrat.\u201d</p> <p>Anthony Butler, professor of politics at the University of Cape Town, said much of the acrimony was rooted in an ideological split within the ANC, between Mandela\u2019s supporters and others more deeply committed to revolutionary Marxist-Leninist principles. \u201cThe conflict was very deep, very intense and had all sorts of repercussions. Mandela was not a commanding figure in prison and not prominent in the 1970s and 1980s. So when the ANC leadership-in-exile decided to make him an icon, it was far from universally popular,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Criticism mounted as a negotiated peaceful transition appeared to take shape. \u201cA lot of people in the movement saw the talks as a trap, to disarm the revolutionary movement. They accused Mandela of being a traitor. The ANC was involved in an enormous struggle itself,\u201d said Maharaj.</p> <p>The euphoria of freedom in 1994, and polls that brought the ANC to power, pushed such sentiments to the margins. \u201cInstantly, he was the saviour. He did make mistakes but he was shrewd, understood what the country needed and how to deliver it. He could bring people with him. For white South Africans there was nothing inevitable at that time about South Africa becoming a democracy,\u201d said Judith February, a political analyst. \u201cThe myth remained alive through his presidency but after he left office [in 1999] we began to see cracks emerging.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48e623a298fe42ac20e28d39d0c84ba00a60ad83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48e623a298fe42ac20e28d39d0c84ba00a60ad83/0_192_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An owner of a convenience store, or \u2018spaza shop\u2019, picks an item for a customer as he holds a candle after a power cut in Soweto, South Africa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An owner of a convenience store, or \u2018spaza shop\u2019, picks an item for a customer as he holds a candle after a power cut in Soweto, South Africa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then, the cracks have indeed been exposed, and the ANC has struggled to match expectations.

As soon as people hear you\u2019re a musician they\u2019ll ask you to play it, and I\u2019m always the muppet using one finger going \u2018ner-ner-ner\u2019\u2026 \u2018You had seven years of classical training and this is what we get?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Four years on, as a truly hellish version of Happy Birthday (in honour of guitarist Jack Ross) reverberates around this dark basement room, <a href=\"http://www.annameredith.com/\" title=\"\">Meredith</a> \u2013 composer, producer, all-purpose noisemaker \u2013 seems long past caring about anyone\u2019s expectations. \u201cDon\u2019t sing a note that sounds like anyone else\u2019s,\u201d she urges the audience. \u201cMake it sound as horrible as possible.\u201d Being invited to deform this most basic of melodies is, like the rest of tonight\u2019s show, weirdly exhilarating. Meredith and her four-piece band (tuba, guitar, drums and cello, plus Meredith on electronics, clarinet, extra drums and whatever else), clad in a uniform of warped and broken prison stripes, are a careering getaway ride from musical convention, veering through club synths, grungy guitar, sweet pop singing and giant blasts of orchestral brass.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a night of irresistible builds and delicious wrong-footing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s been a long, strange road to get here. Made a junior fellow of the Royal College of Music at 24, Meredith spent more than a decade as a classical composer, writing left-field pieces including music for Hong Kong park benches, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4k5tAVK1Ugg\" title=\"\">Manchester shopping centre lifts</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/anna-meredith-sarabande-zamboni\" title=\"\">a sarabande</a> for the resurfacing machine at the Somerset House ice rink. Despite the variety of her work, a hunger for more creative control \u2013 the composing life is dependent first on commissions, then on performers\u2019 interpretations \u2013 she signed to indie label Moshi Moshi and on two EPS, birthed a new voice, brassy, dynamic, and staccato, typified by the romping, mutating <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vajhs2wBeCU\" title=\"\">Nautilus</a>, with its sudden eruption of <a href=\"https://www.psneurope.com/studio/reverb-sound-discovery-hugh-padgham\" title=\"\">80s gated-reverb rock drums</a>. Before too long, Meredith became probably the only musician to have played both the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RsWMKO_IpKo\" title=\"\">first</a> and last night of the Proms and Austin\u2019s South by Southwest festival.</p> <p>For Meredith, this is matter-of-fact stuff. \u201cIs it classical, is it pop? I don\u2019t really think about it that way,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/08/anna-meredith-is-it-classical-is-it-pop-proms\" title=\"\">she\u2019s said</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s a beat, there\u2019s a rhythm. Who cares about those distinctions any more?\u201d And she\u2019s right: it\u2019s tempting to affect astonishment at her crossing of the streams, but the conversation between pop and classical worlds has been lively for as long as they\u2019ve both existed, from Shostakovich\u2019s jazz suites via prog rock symphonies to the shared territory between post-rock and contemporary classical. What distinguishes Meredith, and fellow travellers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nico-muhly\" title=\"\">Nico Muhly</a>, Mica Levi or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/15/meet-mira-calix-who-puts-wasps-on-stage-and-her-audience-in-a-maze\" title=\"\">Mira Calix</a>, is the fearless gameness with which she throws herself fully into both establishments, highlighting the artificiality of musical boundaries irrelevant to how we now listen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63596a7eaf7ed4aec54931729a58bb400aa7ae5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63596a7eaf7ed4aec54931729a58bb400aa7ae5f/0_1869_4912_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018At one point the crowd breaks out in a chant of \u201cTuba!

      "bodyText": "In 2016, shortly after the release of her celebrated debut, Varmints, Anna Meredith revealed her top tip for composers. \u201cLearn to play Happy Birthday. As soon as people hear you\u2019re a musician they\u2019ll ask you to play it, and I\u2019m always the muppet using one finger going \u2018ner-ner-ner\u2019\u2026 \u2018You had seven years of classical training and this is what we get?\u2019\u201d Four years on, as a truly hellish version of Happy Birthday (in honour of guitarist Jack Ross) reverberates around this dark basement room, Meredith \u2013 composer, producer, all-purpose noisemaker \u2013 seems long past caring about anyone\u2019s expectations. \u201cDon\u2019t sing a note that sounds like anyone else\u2019s,\u201d she urges the audience. \u201cMake it sound as horrible as possible.\u201d Being invited to deform this most basic of melodies is, like the rest of tonight\u2019s show, weirdly exhilarating. Meredith and her four-piece band (tuba, guitar, drums and cello, plus Meredith on electronics, clarinet, extra drums and whatever else), clad in a uniform of warped and broken prison stripes, are a careering getaway ride from musical convention, veering through club synths, grungy guitar, sweet pop singing and giant blasts of orchestral brass. It\u2019s been a long, strange road to get here. Made a junior fellow of the Royal College of Music at 24, Meredith spent more than a decade as a classical composer, writing left-field pieces including music for Hong Kong park benches, Manchester shopping centre lifts, and a sarabande for the resurfacing machine at the Somerset House ice rink. Despite the variety of her work, a hunger for more creative control \u2013 the composing life is dependent first on commissions, then on performers\u2019 interpretations \u2013 she signed to indie label Moshi Moshi and on two EPS, birthed a new voice, brassy, dynamic, and staccato, typified by the romping, mutating Nautilus, with its sudden eruption of 80s gated-reverb rock drums. Before too long, Meredith became probably the only musician to have played both the first and last night of the Proms and Austin\u2019s South by Southwest festival. For Meredith, this is matter-of-fact stuff. \u201cIs it classical, is it pop? I don\u2019t really think about it that way,\u201d she\u2019s said. \u201cThere\u2019s a beat, there\u2019s a rhythm. Who cares about those distinctions any more?\u201d And she\u2019s right: it\u2019s tempting to affect astonishment at her crossing of the streams, but the conversation between pop and classical worlds has been lively for as long as they\u2019ve both existed, from Shostakovich\u2019s jazz suites via prog rock symphonies to the shared territory between post-rock and contemporary classical. What distinguishes Meredith, and fellow travellers such as Nico Muhly, Mica Levi or Mira Calix, is the fearless gameness with which she throws herself fully into both establishments, highlighting the artificiality of musical boundaries irrelevant to how we now listen. Her first two EPs, 2012\u2019s Black Prince Fury and 2013\u2019s Jet Black Raider, were named after imaginary horses from her mother\u2019s childhood; her songs gallop just as free and fantastic through sonic possibilities. Tonight, as she lets loose the mighty Bump, from her last album, Fibs \u2013 even bigger, even brassier \u2013 tuba player Tom Kelly parps out the giant footsteps of a marauding cartoon monster, and Meredith jabs the air jubilantly with her finger before hammering wildly at the drums by her side. It feels like freedom, but also, in 2020, totally natural. It\u2019s a night of irresistible builds and delicious wrong-footing, flitting from style to style. Written first in classical notation software before being dressed in synths and beats, Meredith\u2019s songs rarely cleave to pop or dance structures, and she claims to barely listen to new music. If you pick up snatches of other artists in her restless rhythms \u2013 the nervy glam-techno assaults of Of Montreal here; the warped, rearing bangers of Battles there; a hint of Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Utopia in the wild, spacious beauty and creaturely calls of Moonmoons \u2013 it\u2019s more likely to be your brain desperately searching for patterns than her intention. One constant, though, is momentum, a dynamic rush: Inhale Exhale, pairing Meredith\u2019s clear, bright vocal with hammering pads and scintillating trancey synths, is hugely uplifting. Her earliest musical memory is working out the melody of a Satie Gymnop\u00e9die and leaping around on her bed in joy, and these songs retain that combination of airy and lairy. The only appropriate dance is a happy lurch; at one point the crowd breaks out in a chant of \u201cTuba! Tuba! Tuba!\u201d Killjoy, sung by drummer Sam Wilson, makes complicated fun its manifesto, its final line, \u201cI don\u2019t buy it,\u201d serving as a kiss-off to po-faced sneering. And if you weren\u2019t clear yet that Meredith has no truck with the self-consciously serious\u2026 she usually closes with a cover, and tonight there\u2019s a medley: Daniel Bedingfield\u2019s Gotta Get Thru This, Abba\u2019s Lay All Your Love on Me \u2013 complete with voguing choreography from Meredith and cellist Maddie Cutter \u2013 Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s Call Me Maybe, O-Zone\u2019s Moldovan pop \u201cclassic\u201d Dragostea Din Te\u00ef, and, in a lovely little detail, the tiniest snatch of the lock-in countdown music from The Crystal Maze to finish.

      "body": "<p>Who\u2019s afraid of the big bad drag queen? Missouri, apparently. A Republican lawmaker in the conservative state has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/legislation/481036-bill-banning-certain-inappropriate-content-draws-backlash-in-missouri\">introduced a bill</a> that could jail librarians who host a Drag Queen Story Hour (DQSH) or let kids check out \u201cinappropriate\u201d books.</p> <p>Ben Baker\u2019s <a href=\"https://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills201/hlrbillspdf/4634H.01I.pdf\">Parental Oversight of Public Libraries Act</a>, filed last month, would establish a panel of parents that would determine whether or not a book is \u201cappropriate for children\u201d. Books deemed to contain \u201cage-inappropriate sexual material\u201d would be moved to a restricted part of the library. Any librarian who allowed kids access to these books could get up to a year in jail; the library would also lose funding.</p> <p>What might be considered \u201cage-inappropriate sexual material\u201d isn\u2019t really spelled out in the legislation and it\u2019s not quite clear what it would encompass. Sleeping Beauty features a non-consensual kiss; Beauty and the Beast is a paean to bestiality; the Frog Prince contains a slimy interspecies embrace. Would those fairytales be stuck in the restricted session?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter\u200b on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4170\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for \u200bthe week in patriarchy newsletter\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email on feminism and sexism\" data-form-campaign-code=\"twip_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlikely. It seems what Baker is really concerned about is books with LGBTQ+ content. \u201cWhat inspired this bill is \u2026 events like Drag Queen Story Hour, and materials that have a clear agenda of grooming our children for the LGBTQ community with adult themes and content that fit the description of a objectionable sexual nature,\u201d Baker <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/us/missouri-libraries-sexual-books.html\">said on Monday</a>.</p> <p>If you\u2019re unaware of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/drag-queen-story-hour-library-books-children-gender\">Drag Queen Story Hour</a> it\u2019s basically exactly what it sounds like; drag queens reading books to kids. It was launched in 2015 <a href=\"https://www.dragqueenstoryhour.org/\">with the aim</a> of showing kids \u201cpeople who defy rigid gender restrictions\u201d and letting them \u201cimagine a world where people can present as they wish, where dress-up is real\u201d.</p> <p>Baker is not exactly the first critic of DQSH; numerous conservatives have railed against the program, accusing it of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/01/27/how-drag-queen-story-hour-expanded-across-america/\">indoctrinating</a>\u201d children. In actual fact, of course, the opposite is true. DQSH is an anti-indoctrination program; a much-needed corrective to the gender norms that are pushed on kids from the moment they\u2019re born. If you want to see what indoctrination looks like, then just walk around the kids section of a store and take a look at what\u2019s in the boys section and the girls section; according to a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/12/toys-are-more-divided-by-gender-now-than-they-were-50-years-ago/383556/\">study last year</a>, the marketing of toys is more gendered now than it was 50 years ago.</p> <p>Critics of DQSH accuse it of being \u201csexual\u201d which is a reflection of how anything outside rigid heterosexual norms is automatically considered hypersexual. Weirdly, however, it\u2019s not considered sexual for babies to wear onesies with things like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=chick+magnet+baby&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTlItGanvht7gIz-yXUvpKdpFvKrw:1581094353319&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjouKS687_nAhWBVt8KHXghBCsQ_AUoAXoECAsQAw&amp;biw=1275&amp;bih=666\">chick magnet</a>\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a boob guy\u201d on them. It\u2019s not considered sexual for parents to make jokes about their little kids having a girlfriend or boyfriend. But someone in fabulous makeup demonstrating the performative nature of gender and telling kids that it\u2019s OK for them to be whoever they want to be? Somehow that is considered sexual.</p> <p>Drag queens aren\u2019t exactly the most timid of creatures and I\u2019ve got a feeling Baker might regret picking a fight with them. A call has gone out for <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/01/drag-queens-planning-massive-protest-missouri-state-capitol-youre-invited/\">\u201cQueens, Kings &amp; everything in between!\u201d</a> to protest at the Missouri state capitol on 7 March. I\u2019ve got a feeling it\u2019s going to be fabulous.</p> <h2>Mike Bloomberg has a history of anti-trans comments</h2> <p>I\u2019m not sure how he feels about drag queens, but the billionaire presidential candidate doesn\u2019t seem to think much of trans people. Bloomberg is <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/bloomberg-draws-criticism-2016-remarks-about-trans-rights-midwest-n1132081\">currently facing a backlash</a> over a 2016 video in which he described a (hypothetical) transgender woman as \u201csome man wearing a dress\u201d.</p> <h2>The \u201cmanosphere\u201d is growing more violent</h2> <p>There\u2019s been a spike in men joining violent online incel groups, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615155/the-manosphere-is-getting-more-toxic-as-angry-men-join-the-incels/\">according to a new study</a> out of Binghamton University.

      "bodyText": "Who\u2019s afraid of the big bad drag queen? Missouri, apparently. A Republican lawmaker in the conservative state has introduced a bill that could jail librarians who host a Drag Queen Story Hour (DQSH) or let kids check out \u201cinappropriate\u201d books. Ben Baker\u2019s Parental Oversight of Public Libraries Act, filed last month, would establish a panel of parents that would determine whether or not a book is \u201cappropriate for children\u201d. Books deemed to contain \u201cage-inappropriate sexual material\u201d would be moved to a restricted part of the library. Any librarian who allowed kids access to these books could get up to a year in jail; the library would also lose funding. What might be considered \u201cage-inappropriate sexual material\u201d isn\u2019t really spelled out in the legislation and it\u2019s not quite clear what it would encompass. Sleeping Beauty features a non-consensual kiss; Beauty and the Beast is a paean to bestiality; the Frog Prince contains a slimy interspecies embrace. Would those fairytales be stuck in the restricted session? Unlikely. It seems what Baker is really concerned about is books with LGBTQ+ content. \u201cWhat inspired this bill is \u2026 events like Drag Queen Story Hour, and materials that have a clear agenda of grooming our children for the LGBTQ community with adult themes and content that fit the description of a objectionable sexual nature,\u201d Baker said on Monday. If you\u2019re unaware of Drag Queen Story Hour it\u2019s basically exactly what it sounds like; drag queens reading books to kids. It was launched in 2015 with the aim of showing kids \u201cpeople who defy rigid gender restrictions\u201d and letting them \u201cimagine a world where people can present as they wish, where dress-up is real\u201d. Baker is not exactly the first critic of DQSH; numerous conservatives have railed against the program, accusing it of \u201cindoctrinating\u201d children. In actual fact, of course, the opposite is true. DQSH is an anti-indoctrination program; a much-needed corrective to the gender norms that are pushed on kids from the moment they\u2019re born. If you want to see what indoctrination looks like, then just walk around the kids section of a store and take a look at what\u2019s in the boys section and the girls section; according to a study last year, the marketing of toys is more gendered now than it was 50 years ago. Critics of DQSH accuse it of being \u201csexual\u201d which is a reflection of how anything outside rigid heterosexual norms is automatically considered hypersexual. Weirdly, however, it\u2019s not considered sexual for babies to wear onesies with things like \u201cchick magnet\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a boob guy\u201d on them. It\u2019s not considered sexual for parents to make jokes about their little kids having a girlfriend or boyfriend. But someone in fabulous makeup demonstrating the performative nature of gender and telling kids that it\u2019s OK for them to be whoever they want to be? Somehow that is considered sexual. Drag queens aren\u2019t exactly the most timid of creatures and I\u2019ve got a feeling Baker might regret picking a fight with them. A call has gone out for \u201cQueens, Kings &amp; everything in between!\u201d to protest at the Missouri state capitol on 7 March. I\u2019ve got a feeling it\u2019s going to be fabulous. Mike Bloomberg has a history of anti-trans comments I\u2019m not sure how he feels about drag queens, but the billionaire presidential candidate doesn\u2019t seem to think much of trans people. Bloomberg is currently facing a backlash over a 2016 video in which he described a (hypothetical) transgender woman as \u201csome man wearing a dress\u201d. The \u201cmanosphere\u201d is growing more violent There\u2019s been a spike in men joining violent online incel groups, according to a new study out of Binghamton University. Researchers studied men\u2019s groups online (known as the \u201cmanosphere\u201d) and found that, over the past decade, the number of men identifying as \u201cmen\u2019s right\u2019s activists\u201d (MRAs) and \u201cmen going their own way\u201d (MGTOW) has fallen while membership of the more violent \u201cpick-up artists\u201d (PUAs) and incel communities has grown. An analysis of the language used in these groups found that it has grown more hate-filled over time.

UK names Karen Pierce first female ambassador to US Her appointment comes after the previous ambassador, Kim Darroch, was pushed to resign after the publication of a leaked memo in which he described Donald Trump\u2019s administration as \u201cclumsy and inept\u201d. Kirk Douglas died at 103 And Natalie Wood quickly started trending. Women are turning to Reddit for medical advice It\u2019s a sign that far too many doctors still don\u2019t take women\u2019s health issues seriously. Britain faces a contraceptives shortage Women in the UK have been struggling to access hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is used to treat menopausal symptoms, for over a year. Now it seems that there are also shortages of some contraceptives.

      "body": "<p>The quiet newsroom of the Sun-Bulletin in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is just a temporary holding pen for Chuck Tatum, the restless and unprincipled reporter played by Kirk Douglas in the 1951 Hollywood classic, <em>Ace in the Hole</em>. Sacked from bigger newspapers for being unreliable, drinking on the job and much worse, Tatum persuades the paper\u2019s worthy editor, who works under an embroidered sampler bearing the words \u201cTell the Truth\u201d, to give him a job despite his better judgment. \u201cI can handle big news and little news. And if there\u2019s no news, I\u2019ll go out and bite a dog,\u201d Tatum promises.</p> <p>This is the set-up for the best film made yet about the ethics of the press. And, although the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/06/kirk-douglas-hollywood-legend-and-star-of-spartacus-dies-aged-103\" title=\"\">death of Douglas</a> last Wednesday elicited deserved praise for his other famous roles, in <em>Spartacus</em>, <em>Paths of Glory</em> and <em>Lust for Life</em>, it is this film that really gave the actor\u2019s merciless screen presence full rein. Douglas himself recognised the strength he brought to the screen, whether cast as a hero or an antihero: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a nice guy or you\u2019re a bastard. What matters is, you won\u2019t bend!\u201d he told <em>Esquire</em> magazine in 1969.</p> <p><em>Ace in the Hole</em>, directed by the masterful Billy Wilder, creator of <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> and <em>Double Indemnity</em>, swiftly becomes a blistering portrayal of the dynamics of what we now call \u201ca media circus\u201d. Inspired by the real-life press feeding frenzy that sprang up in 1925 when a man called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/1999/jul/28/theatre.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Floyd Collins was trapped in a Kentucky cave</a>, the plot has Tatum taking control of the scene of a mining disaster and working it to his own ends. Quickly establishing himself inside the filling station run by a trapped man\u2019s wife, the newshound twists the facts to suit his tale and shows no visible pangs of guilt. \u201cI\u2019ve met a lotta hard-boiled eggs in my life, but you, you\u2019re 20 minutes,\u201d the wife tells Tatum in grudging awe.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/05/roger-ebert-stimulating-film-critic-dies\" title=\"\">late critic Roger Ebert</a> noted when Wilder\u2019s film was released on video in 2007, \u201cthere is not a wasted shot\u201d. But really it is the performance that Douglas gives that powers the action. His Tatum is a horribly convincing portrayal of an unsympathetic, tortured soul. The star \u201cis at his most uningratiatingly forceful in virtually every scene\u201d, judged Philip French in an appreciation of the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/08/ace-in-the-hole-dvd-philip-french-review\" title=\"\">he wrote for the <em>Observer</em> in 2014</a>. He makes you believe you are watching a human being capable of anything.</p> <p>The title of Wilder\u2019s film is taken from stud poker and refers to Tatum\u2019s search for the competitive edge in the ruthless game of selling news to the public. But the screenplay, co-written by the director with Walter Newman and Lesser Samuels, proved too gritty for general consumption, and the film failed on its first release during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/11/mccarthyism-us-second-world-war\" title=\"\">height of McCarthyism</a> in America. The movie studio tried again later, renaming it <em>The Big Carnival</em>, but still it upset audience assumptions about what a good film should offer.</p> <p>The press were not happy either. After all, what Douglas\u2019s reporter does is worse than even the lurid nightmares of a misused litigant in the British phone-hacking scandal. When Tatum discovers that the trapped man could be freed from the mineshaft in just two days, he finds an elaborate way to lengthen the process and so provide a better national spectacle.</p> <p>His behaviour is beyond the pale for even a hardened Fleet Street hack, although his efforts to persuade the man\u2019s disaffected wife to pretend to be loyal are closer to the mark. In disreputable newsrooms, stories are still adjusted to fit the template of readers\u2019 expectations.</p> <p>Wilder knew the newspaper business. He had worked on a series of popular titles in Vienna and Berlin in the 1920s. The only concession he made to the honour of his old trade is that <em>Ace in the Hole</em> is almost as hard on the public appetite for sensation and drama as it is on the workings of the press. The film is shot in black and white but its real triumph is its shades of grey.

      "bodyText": "The quiet newsroom of the Sun-Bulletin in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is just a temporary holding pen for Chuck Tatum, the restless and unprincipled reporter played by Kirk Douglas in the 1951 Hollywood classic, Ace in the Hole. Sacked from bigger newspapers for being unreliable, drinking on the job and much worse, Tatum persuades the paper\u2019s worthy editor, who works under an embroidered sampler bearing the words \u201cTell the Truth\u201d, to give him a job despite his better judgment. \u201cI can handle big news and little news. And if there\u2019s no news, I\u2019ll go out and bite a dog,\u201d Tatum promises. This is the set-up for the best film made yet about the ethics of the press. And, although the death of Douglas last Wednesday elicited deserved praise for his other famous roles, in Spartacus, Paths of Glory and Lust for Life, it is this film that really gave the actor\u2019s merciless screen presence full rein. Douglas himself recognised the strength he brought to the screen, whether cast as a hero or an antihero: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a nice guy or you\u2019re a bastard. What matters is, you won\u2019t bend!\u201d he told Esquire magazine in 1969. Ace in the Hole, directed by the masterful Billy Wilder, creator of Sunset Boulevard and Double Indemnity, swiftly becomes a blistering portrayal of the dynamics of what we now call \u201ca media circus\u201d. Inspired by the real-life press feeding frenzy that sprang up in 1925 when a man called Floyd Collins was trapped in a Kentucky cave, the plot has Tatum taking control of the scene of a mining disaster and working it to his own ends. Quickly establishing himself inside the filling station run by a trapped man\u2019s wife, the newshound twists the facts to suit his tale and shows no visible pangs of guilt. \u201cI\u2019ve met a lotta hard-boiled eggs in my life, but you, you\u2019re 20 minutes,\u201d the wife tells Tatum in grudging awe. As the late critic Roger Ebert noted when Wilder\u2019s film was released on video in 2007, \u201cthere is not a wasted shot\u201d. But really it is the performance that Douglas gives that powers the action. His Tatum is a horribly convincing portrayal of an unsympathetic, tortured soul. The star \u201cis at his most uningratiatingly forceful in virtually every scene\u201d, judged Philip French in an appreciation of the film he wrote for the Observer in 2014. He makes you believe you are watching a human being capable of anything. The title of Wilder\u2019s film is taken from stud poker and refers to Tatum\u2019s search for the competitive edge in the ruthless game of selling news to the public. But the screenplay, co-written by the director with Walter Newman and Lesser Samuels, proved too gritty for general consumption, and the film failed on its first release during the height of McCarthyism in America. The movie studio tried again later, renaming it The Big Carnival, but still it upset audience assumptions about what a good film should offer. The press were not happy either. After all, what Douglas\u2019s reporter does is worse than even the lurid nightmares of a misused litigant in the British phone-hacking scandal. When Tatum discovers that the trapped man could be freed from the mineshaft in just two days, he finds an elaborate way to lengthen the process and so provide a better national spectacle. His behaviour is beyond the pale for even a hardened Fleet Street hack, although his efforts to persuade the man\u2019s disaffected wife to pretend to be loyal are closer to the mark. In disreputable newsrooms, stories are still adjusted to fit the template of readers\u2019 expectations. Wilder knew the newspaper business. He had worked on a series of popular titles in Vienna and Berlin in the 1920s. The only concession he made to the honour of his old trade is that Ace in the Hole is almost as hard on the public appetite for sensation and drama as it is on the workings of the press. The film is shot in black and white but its real triumph is its shades of grey. There is humanity and morality in the story, but not quite enough. To watch Douglas here is to be reminded that just because a film was made 70 years ago it doesn\u2019t mean it was made in simpler times. And, on Oscar weekend, it is worth remembering that those films that endure are not always the ones to win early plaudits. The classics that go on to earn a place in people\u2019s hearts, or ultimately to be acclaimed by critics, often fall by the wayside in the initial awards goldrush.

Rain is also expected in Northern Ireland and Scotland from the late afternoon as conditions become increasingly cloudy. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the first part of Storm Ciara rising,\u201d said the Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge. For the rest of the UK, the weather will take a sharp turn from Saturday night into Sunday morning when Ciara arrives. \u201cIt will be a wet and windy day across the whole of the UK on Sunday,\u201d Partridge said. \u201cThe whole of the UK is covered with yellow wind warnings, which means gusts of 50-60mph regardless of where you are, and potentially up to 70mph in coastal areas.\u201d There is an amber wind warning across Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey, and Kent, where gusts could reach 70-80mph on the coast. The Met Office has already issued warnings for the whole of the UK on Monday and Tuesday, when it is expected to be windy with a mixture of sunshine and showers. Strong winds and heavy snow are expected to cause travel disruption in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where areas above 150 metres can expect to see 1-3cm of snow, while those above 300 metres could see 5-10cm. \u201cWith 60 hours of wind, there will be blizzard-like conditions in the new working week,\u201d Partridge said. \u201cAlthough Storm Ciara will clear the UK late on Sunday, the unsettled and disruptive weather will continue into the new working week.\u201d Ciara is the third named storm of the 2019-20 winter season after Atiyah, which hit on 8 December, and Brendan, on 13 and 14 January.",

Here, we talk to the Guardian\u2019s investigative reporter Juliette Garside about her role in exposing the truth about what happened.</strong></em></p> <h2>What was your first encounter with Daphne Caruana Galizia?</h2> <p>I had gone to Malta before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/malta-car-bomb-kills-panama-papers-journalist\">Daphne was killed</a>, to report on some of the political controversies she was exposing. She was Malta\u2019s most famous journalist, working on very important stories, and we were worried she was isolated. Her son got in touch asking us to provide some support, and I went out just before the general election. We only wish we could have done more. There are big social and governmental issues in Malta and its news outlets often require patronage from one party or another, but Daphne had alienated both through her work, leaving her exposed. She was hugely effective and she asked the big questions. She wanted to call out her country\u2019s dysfunctional electoral system, financial regulators and money laundering, and ask how a European nation like hers was able to operate like this without consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29477372e08835a48bc3c825c4bf18e7e75fa9ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29477372e08835a48bc3c825c4bf18e7e75fa9ff/0_109_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juliette Garside at her desk in the Guardian\u2019s London offices.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juliette Garside at her desk in the Guardian\u2019s London offices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How did the investigation unfold?</h2> <p>The first instalment of our Daphne Project was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/17/daphne-caruana-galizia-malta-has-made-me-a-scapegoat\">published in April 2018</a>, six months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/malta-car-bomb-kills-panama-papers-journalist\">she was killed in a car bomb</a>. We were a loose collective of journalists, from Reuters, the Times of Malta, Le Monde and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, who had agreed to work together. The idea for the collaboration came from Laurent Richard, the Paris documentary maker. He had just set up the <a href=\"https://forbiddenstories.org/\">Forbidden Stories</a> network, whose mission is to continue the work of reporters who have been silenced in some way, either through violence, incarceration, or in Daphne\u2019s case, murder. Our stories focused on the police investigation, but also on concerns about corruption in political and business circles. I had been given a copy of a big leak of data from a flagship power station project. Daphne had been receiving the data when she was killed. She hadn\u2019t had time to look at it. We found secret information showing this power station was a really bad deal for Malta, with taxpayers losing money <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/malta-azerbaijan-energy-deal-losing-money-claim-experts\">hand over fist</a>.</p> <p>In October 2018, a year after the killing, we published another round of articles. The most important of these was about 17 Black Limited, a mysterious shell company Daphne had been looking into just before her death. Emails showed other shell companies in Panama, belonging to the energy minister and a second key member of the government, were due to receive payments from 17 Black. But nobody knew who it belonged to. Reuters revealed that the owner was businessman Y<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/daphne-caruana-galizia-police-arrest-businessman-on-yacht\">orgen Fenech</a>, who also owned the power station.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8999e149c06b075d78667cd40db47f63f4a7eab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8999e149c06b075d78667cd40db47f63f4a7eab/0_173_4736_2841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Caruana Galizia (left) and Paul Caruana Galizia, the sons of the murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, attend a vigil outside the Maltese high commission in London, six months after she was assassinated.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Caruana Galizia (left) and Paul Caruana Galizia, the sons of the murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, attend a vigil outside the Maltese high commission in London, six months after she was assassinated.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The police had arrested the alleged bombers, who are awaiting trial. But the investigation into who had commissioned the killing had stalled. Two years later, the mastermind was still at large.</p> <p>Finally, in November 2019, a middleman was arrested, and he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/19/suspected-middleman-in-daphne-caruana-galizia-arrested-malta\">began to talk</a>. After receiving a presidential pardon in return for information, he named Fenech as the person who had paid for the assassination. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/daphne-caruana-galizia-police-arrest-businessman-on-yacht\">Fenech was arrested</a> while trying to flee Malta on board his yacht. He denies accusations of complicity in the killing. Soon after his arrest, we saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/26/malta-pm-chief-of-staff-schembri-daphne-caruana-galizia-fenech-muscat\">resignations of the two cabinet members </a>who had allegedly been due to receive payments from 17 Black: the former energy minister Konrad Mizzi and the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff Keith Schembri. They both deny wrongdoing. By this point, the world\u2019s media had turned to the story.</p> <h2>What was your main role in the coverage of this story?</h2> <p>Prior to joining the investigations team, I worked as a business reporter. My specialism is financial reporting, especially stories involving tax dodging and money laundering. I have a good knowledge of law and business, and am able to take a forensic look at financial accounts and money trails and help comb through big data sets. It\u2019s often rather exhausting and painstaking work, and the kind of stories we unearth are legally risky, but it\u2019s important in painting a clear picture of events.</p> <h2>Who else was involved in covering this?</h2> <p>Jacob Borg, from the Times of Malta, did <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/inside-the-plot-to-kill-daphne-caruana-galizia.755635\">some incredible on-the-ground reporting</a>. He got a tipoff and was down at the marina watching last November as Fenech tried to flee the country on his yacht \u2013 his boat was stopped and the police brought him back onshore. Stephen Grey at Reuters was key to the 17 Black investigation - a real \u201cshoe leather journalist\u201d, as they say - as were Daphne\u2019s sons Matthew (a computer programmer and investigative journalist) and Paul (also a journalist). Carlo Bonini from the Italian newspaper la Repubblica was also great in terms of police contacts. And of course my Guardian colleagues Hilary Osborne and David Pegg, my editor Nick Hopkins, and our Washington investigations correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner. It was Stephanie who arranged for us to get the data about the power station from Daphne\u2019s sons.</p> <h2>Why was the Guardian well placed to cover this story?</h2> <p>The Guardian is a platform with a big readership, which can provide the much-needed rocket fuel for a story like this, but it can\u2019t be emphasised enough how much of a collaborative effort was required to get it off the ground. One of the things that sets us apart from many other media groups, though, is the lack of a paywall, which means we are very widely read.

      "bodyText": "In December 2019, Malta\u2019s PM Joseph Muscat resigned, driven from office by the constitutional and political crisis triggered by the murder of the investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Here, we talk to the Guardian\u2019s investigative reporter Juliette Garside about her role in exposing the truth about what happened. What was your first encounter with Daphne Caruana Galizia? I had gone to Malta before Daphne was killed, to report on some of the political controversies she was exposing. She was Malta\u2019s most famous journalist, working on very important stories, and we were worried she was isolated. Her son got in touch asking us to provide some support, and I went out just before the general election. We only wish we could have done more. There are big social and governmental issues in Malta and its news outlets often require patronage from one party or another, but Daphne had alienated both through her work, leaving her exposed. She was hugely effective and she asked the big questions. She wanted to call out her country\u2019s dysfunctional electoral system, financial regulators and money laundering, and ask how a European nation like hers was able to operate like this without consequences. How did the investigation unfold? The first instalment of our Daphne Project was published in April 2018, six months after she was killed in a car bomb. We were a loose collective of journalists, from Reuters, the Times of Malta, Le Monde and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, who had agreed to work together. The idea for the collaboration came from Laurent Richard, the Paris documentary maker. He had just set up the Forbidden Stories network, whose mission is to continue the work of reporters who have been silenced in some way, either through violence, incarceration, or in Daphne\u2019s case, murder. Our stories focused on the police investigation, but also on concerns about corruption in political and business circles. I had been given a copy of a big leak of data from a flagship power station project. Daphne had been receiving the data when she was killed. She hadn\u2019t had time to look at it. We found secret information showing this power station was a really bad deal for Malta, with taxpayers losing money hand over fist. In October 2018, a year after the killing, we published another round of articles. The most important of these was about 17 Black Limited, a mysterious shell company Daphne had been looking into just before her death. Emails showed other shell companies in Panama, belonging to the energy minister and a second key member of the government, were due to receive payments from 17 Black. But nobody knew who it belonged to. Reuters revealed that the owner was businessman Yorgen Fenech, who also owned the power station. The police had arrested the alleged bombers, who are awaiting trial. But the investigation into who had commissioned the killing had stalled. Two years later, the mastermind was still at large. Finally, in November 2019, a middleman was arrested, and he began to talk. After receiving a presidential pardon in return for information, he named Fenech as the person who had paid for the assassination. Fenech was arrested while trying to flee Malta on board his yacht. He denies accusations of complicity in the killing. Soon after his arrest, we saw the resignations of the two cabinet members who had allegedly been due to receive payments from 17 Black: the former energy minister Konrad Mizzi and the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff Keith Schembri. They both deny wrongdoing. By this point, the world\u2019s media had turned to the story. What was your main role in the coverage of this story? Prior to joining the investigations team, I worked as a business reporter. My specialism is financial reporting, especially stories involving tax dodging and money laundering. I have a good knowledge of law and business, and am able to take a forensic look at financial accounts and money trails and help comb through big data sets. It\u2019s often rather exhausting and painstaking work, and the kind of stories we unearth are legally risky, but it\u2019s important in painting a clear picture of events. Who else was involved in covering this? Jacob Borg, from the Times of Malta, did some incredible on-the-ground reporting. He got a tipoff and was down at the marina watching last November as Fenech tried to flee the country on his yacht \u2013 his boat was stopped and the police brought him back onshore. Stephen Grey at Reuters was key to the 17 Black investigation - a real \u201cshoe leather journalist\u201d, as they say - as were Daphne\u2019s sons Matthew (a computer programmer and investigative journalist) and Paul (also a journalist). Carlo Bonini from the Italian newspaper la Repubblica was also great in terms of police contacts. And of course my Guardian colleagues Hilary Osborne and David Pegg, my editor Nick Hopkins, and our Washington investigations correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner. It was Stephanie who arranged for us to get the data about the power station from Daphne\u2019s sons. Why was the Guardian well placed to cover this story? The Guardian is a platform with a big readership, which can provide the much-needed rocket fuel for a story like this, but it can\u2019t be emphasised enough how much of a collaborative effort was required to get it off the ground. One of the things that sets us apart from many other media groups, though, is the lack of a paywall, which means we are very widely read. And we publish in English, which gives us a huge potential readership. Our readers care about these sorts of stories. We have a long history of covering tax dodgers, corruption and kleptocrats with murky pasts. There\u2019s our investigative work into HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank, Apple, the Chinese retail industry, and of course the Panama and Paradise Papers, which had huge ripple effects. It\u2019s an area we want to keep well-resourced. Has Daphne\u2019s death triggered change in Malta? One impact was the resignation of Joseph Muscat as prime minister. His Labour party are still in power, and he has been replaced by Robert Abela, who was very much seen as the continuity candidate. People don\u2019t think he will prosecute the alleged corruption cases uncovered during this affair. With Fenech due to stand trial, it\u2019s possible that individuals closer to Muscat could be implicated, so who knows what that will bring. Perhaps more importantly, Europe has woken up to the dangers that corruption in Malta represents for rule of law in the EU. And we are seeing the beginnings of a civil society in Malta; citizens are feeling more empowered. It\u2019s so important for the family that this story continues to be covered. Nobody has been convicted of the murder yet, and the political corruption has not been dealt with. There is still a sense of impunity. Daphne\u2019s story is far from over.",

      "bodyText": "Anyone who views opera as a rarefied pastime should gatecrash a schools matinee. On Monday lunchtime at the Royal Opera House, the roar in the auditorium, pre-curtain-up for Gerald Barry\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground, was as raucous as any playground. The collective \u201cooh\u201d as the lights went down, and \u201caah\u201d as the red velvet curtain came up made you wish all ROH audiences were as excitedly engaged, but on the whole they\u2019re not year 4s (eight- and nine-year-olds). Schools, or parents, paid \u00a37.50 per ticket, thanks to support from the Taylor Family Foundation and the Gerald and Gail Ronson Family Foundation, who surely deserve mention for their low-profile but vital philanthropy. I was seated next to 90 children from Grays, Essex, who immediately, together with the rest of the auditorium, fell quiet at the sight of Alice (soprano Jennifer France) tumbling down, down, within a Pollock-style Victorian theatre, only to be confronted by giant-sized Drink Me bottles and Eat Me cakes. As the music raced and screeched in crazed scales and arpeggios, so Alice fought back with a mayhem of stratospherically high, ridiculous, show-off top Cs \u2013 apparently 30 of them \u2013 in the first minutes of music. Who knows what trouble Barry (b1952) got up to at his County Clare primary school. This was the world\u2019s first encounter with his version of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass in a full staging, before its opening night last Tuesday. Given a memorable concert premiere at the Barbican in 2016, it was conducted then, as now, by Thomas Ad\u00e8s, Barry\u2019s friend and advocate. The composer has compressed Carroll\u2019s best episodes, languid in comparison, into condensed matter of the most ear-popping, eye-popping variety. The director-designer Antony McDonald, whose previous work includes the Royal Opera\u2019s Hansel and Gretel and The Importance of Being Earnest (also by Barry and arguably even madder), might be the only person undaunted by the challenges of this nonstop, whirlwind fantasy. Mad Hatter, Mock Turtle, Red Knight, White Knight, Red Queen, White Queen, Tweedles -dum and -dee: all whistle by, each a glimpse, gone for ever. One fabulous costume is shed, another worn, with speed and finesse. The whole event lasts barely an hour. Barry\u2019s Alice is a true comedy, rare in opera \u2013 once you name Rossini, Donizetti, the Puccini of Gianni Schicchi, you have to stop and think \u2013 but its humour, for adults, is based on brilliant subversion of the familiar: of Carroll, of musical styles (Wagner, Verdi, Beethoven, music hall are wittily present), of language, of foolish human behaviour. Translating Jabberwocky into doggerel Russian, French and German is sillier and funnier if you know how silly and funny the original is. To say the young audience maintained a quizzical silence \u2013 except when Robert Murray as the eloquent Messenger, among his nine other roles, engaged in some high-speed bum waggling \u2013 isn\u2019t to suggest they weren\u2019t attentive. They were, impressively. But as Ad\u00e8s has said, Barry is \u201cin the innovative line of the great Irish artists, Joyce, Beckett, Flann O\u2019Brien\u201d \u2013 writers who may not have made it on to the year 4 syllabus. However innocent their eye, they surely appreciated the magic and theatricality of this staging, and certainly roared approval when the end arrived. France\u2019s Alice, Nicky Spence\u2019s captivating White Rabbit, Alan Ewing\u2019s melancholic Humpty Dumpty, with Allison Cook, Carole Wilson and Stephen Richardson, were nimble and heroic in the first of two casts. The Royal Opera orchestra, brass especially, entered Barry\u2019s zany musical world with wildness and velocity. Ad\u00e8s kept all, including the important silences, under military control, right until the melancholy end. The following night, the other cast, led by Claudia Boyle as Alice, and pulling with equal weight, stirred plenty of chuckles from the adult audience, but this time the children present, prompted by the grownups\u2019 example, realised they were allowed to laugh, and did. Humpty Dumpty\u2019s forlorn intoning of the Ode to Joy, sung to Carroll\u2019s words \u201cIn winter when the fields are white, I sing this song for your delight\u201d, is one of Barry\u2019s many and loving tributes to Beethoven.

Yet Symphony No 2 bursts with optimism and radiance, as the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, under their music director Mirga Gra\u017einyt\u0117-Tyla, demonstrated so vigorously at the Barbican\u2019s Beethoven Weekender. This coming together of the UK\u2019s regional orchestras \u2013 never before under one roof, as far as anyone could recall \u2013 was an inspired celebration of Beethoven in his 250th birthday year.

On Friday Rebecca Long-Bailey defended Brabin and criticised the levels of scrutiny faced by women politicians over their appearance. The Labour leadership contender told BBC Breakfast: \u201cWomen tend to get that scrutiny far more than men. It is routine for women in politics and in public life, unfortunately.\u201d The dress listing on eBay reads: \u201cBlack dress worn by Tracy Brabin MP in \u2018shouldergate\u2019 as widely covered across the media. \u201cThis is an Asos dress, which has been flying off the shelves as a result of the coverage \u2013 and is now sold out!

FFA officials met with the referees and other stakeholders including the host broadcaster Fox Sports as well as the venue groundstaff to inspect the playing surface this morning.

      "bodyText": "They\u2019ve made the final four teams on eight out of nine occasions across the Big Bash era, the Stars, but for the second year in a row, they\u2019ve made the big dance, but had their toes trodden on. Josh Philippe and Steve Smith, with some late hitting from Jordan Silk put the Sixers in a pretty strong position, before excellent captaincy from Moises Henriques and brilliantly-executed bowling knocked over the Stars\u2019 danger men early on. With Glen Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis back in the sheds it was always an uphill battle for the Stars. Josh Philippe picks up the man of the match gong. The Sydney Sixers: BBL champions for the second time. \u201cThis is up there with anything I\u2019ve done in cricket\u201d - Steve O\u2019Keefe says post-match. He reckons his feet hurt from having performed a rain dance for the past three days, but having had to take to the field, he got it done with the ball anyway. \u201cThat\u2019s something pretty special, that\u201d says fellow spinner Nathan Lyon. What a battle he had with Marcus Stoinis in the opening over, and how decisive that proved for the shape of the evening. Lots of smiles, Gatorade flying everywhere, and pats on backs. They\u2019re buzzing the Sixers, and who would blame them. Coulter-Nile winds up against Dwarshuis but he only gets two off the first delivery. One off a full toss before a dot ball. Larkin smashes a huge six over square, before playing and missing. Some close ups of the long faces on the Stars bench - Glen Maxwell looks gutted. And that\u2019s that! Sydney Sixers have won BBL09 - a terrific batting performance backed up by an even better bowling display. Worthy winners. Big Bash - Stars 6/88 (11), Larkin 32*, Coulter-Niles 16* Larkin slashes at one and it goes into the offside for two. Next delivery Hazlewood tries the yorker, but he digs it out for four! A slower ball deceives Larkin third up; dot. Next one goes to the boundary as well. 10 off 4! A six and a four and we could be in for a big last over. But another terrific slower ball from JH deceives him for a dot - before excellent fielding on the rope from Silk saves four. 12 off it, but 29 to get on the final over. Big Bash - Stars 6/72 (10), Larkin 20*, Coulter-Niles 16* The big tailender comes in and throws the bat at everything and he gets them! Two off the first down the ground, a French cut for another two, a whack to the deep for two more, before a massive six followed by a top-edge that flew for four! 16 off the over. It\u2019s almost good enough? 41 needed off 12, and it\u2019s Josh Hazlewood with the ball. Big Bash - Stars 6/60 (9), Larkin 20*, Coulter-Niles 0* Larkin smashes O\u2019Keefe over the rope from the final ball, but the spinner had already had the last laugh, picking up Seb Gotch trying the same thing a few balls earlier. 57 off 18 is the equation. Three very big overs. Big Bash - Stars 5/49 (8), Gotch 5*, Larkin 12* Five off that Dwarshuis over as Larkin swings wildly at a wide one and gets nothing on it. The stump mic picks up some colourful language from the batsman - and that\u2019s how the evening has gone for the Stars. Big Bash - Wicket! Stars 5/40 (6.2), Dunk out It\u2019s Nathan Lyons who picks up Dunk - who throws the cross-bat at it, but is deceived by the off-spinner! He departs lbw, and that, surely, is the end of that. The Sixers can do this nicely from here, you\u2019d imagine. To the delight of those that braved the heavy rains in Sydney. Big Bash - Stars 4/39 (6), Larkin 7*, Dunk 11* Finally a decent over for the Stars, as Dunk takes on O\u2019Keefe and puts him over the boundary on the off-side. They\u2019ll need six more like that and then some. Otherwise curtains. At the halfway point though the bowling from the Sixers has been absolutely superb. What an attack, mind. Hazlewood. Lyon. O\u2019Keefe. Abbott. Great list. Big Bash - Stars 4/27 (5), Larkin 5*, Dunk 1* Brilliant first over from Abbott - a wicket and two runs from it. They\u2019re going at modern-day Test rate; you have to think the early loss of Stoinis plus scoreboard pressure has done them here, the Stars. How crucial were those consistent overs from Philippe and Smith? Really got inside the heads of the Stars\u2019 batsmen. Big Bash - Wicket! Stars 4/25 (4.1), Handscomb 6 out Ach, that\u2019s awful. First ball, and they\u2019ve done each other. They try for the second and Larkin slips - and then sends his partner back! Handscomb done at the bowler\u2019s end - run out. This is crashing like a supernova. The Stars are exploding. Big Bash - Stars 3/24 (4), Handscomb 6*, Larkin 4* Another good over from Hazlewood, just five off it. That\u2019s a third of the deliveries eaten up, and they\u2019re 93 runs short, with just 48 balls to get them in. You can understand the settling over, but these two need to go, and go big from here. Big Bash - Wicket! Stars 3/18 (2.4) - O\u2019Keefe gets Maxwell!! He glowers up at the replay screen as he trudges off. The Stars fans came to see this man - one of the game\u2019s most destructive batsmen - work his magic. But O\u2019Keefe deceives him with a slower spinning delivery, that goes on straight and catches the back pad. Was it bouncing too high? Possibly not. He took an age to make the decision, but the finger went up and Glen Maxwell is gone. Sixers in the ascendancy - they\u2019re looking pretty in pink now. 98 off 54 is the equation. Big Bask - Wicket! Stars 2/14 (1.4), Maddison goes for a duck He\u2019s had a scratchy old tournament, Maddinson but after a few dot balls he goes after one and like Stoinis holes out in the deep. Vince with the catch - that will lift his mood after missing out with the bat. Larkin comes in. Can he see off Josh Hazlewood and build the innings with Maxwell? A wicket and one off the over from the big quick - that\u2019s a phenomenal over in the short form of the game; let alone a reduced 12-over match. Big Bash - Wicket! Stars 1/10 (0.4), Stoinis out It was the big-hitting Marcus Stoinis v the wily Nathan Lyon, and they both find a bit of joy. A boundary off the first - a six that just clipped the rope third ball, but then fourth ball he\u2019s gone again and been caught on the boundary by Abbott! Stoinis goes - that\u2019s a huge wicket, just four balls in. It brings Maxwell to the crease. If he goes cheaply you would have to say it would definitely then be Sixers on top; no? Okay - to my knowledge, I think that\u2019s everything else in bed. Let\u2019s get back to the Big Bash final and follow the whole of the Stars innings until it\u2019s conclusion. Don\u2019t go anywhere - this could be an epic finish. Okay, I\u2019ve gone back to take a look at those A-League goals. Oh my. The great JP Howcroft wrote an entire column earlier this season as an Ode to the Goalmouth Scramble but Perth\u2019s effort against Newcastle had nothing on that equaliser from Brisbane Roar. McDonald thought he\u2019d scored, then Muratovic\u2019s follow-up effort was cleared off the line, then another a follow-up shot (from Inman?) was blocked - and then finally, the youngster volleyed home through a crowd of bodies! A bit more straight forward with the second goal, although it was a short-corner routine that eventually ended up with Tom Aldred nodding home at the far post. They cop stick, the elaborate training ground routines, but when they come off, well. Fair play. A huge three points for the home side - that makes four wins in their past six, and finally: they\u2019re back in the six! Big Bash: End of Innings - 5/116 (20), Philippe 52 out, last ball Wowee. Who needs the extra eight overs, that was some high-octane stuff. Zampa gets belted for six but on the last ball he gets his man on the last delivery. Philippe gives himself room out leg for a sweep, but misses and gets rattled. They\u2019ll need 117 at 9.75. Not quite the 10+ but that\u2019s still pretty intimidating - especially with a damp ball and a bit of moisture flying round. Plenty of hope for both sets of fans - this one is very nicely poised. A-League - Goal! Brisbane 2-1 Adelaide (Aldred) 74 min: Hello! It\u2019s the skipper, Aldred, and he nods home for Brisbane to come from behind! He\u2019s a very popular figure in the dressing room, and that\u2019s a very popular goal in the picture of the Roar\u2019s season. Can they hold on now for the three points? Big Bash - Sixers 4/106 (11), Philippe 43*, Silk 26* Big over off Haris Rauf - who goes for 13! Silk goes after him, and smashes it just shy of the rope - millimetres from a six, that. And on the final ball Silk goes again but it flies high into the night\u2019s sky. Maddinson\u2019s under it - it\u2019s a tricky, swirling catch - and he puts it down! Silk survives, and they grab two. Could that prove costly?! Big Bash - Sixers 4/93 (10), Philippe 38*, Silk 18* Jordan Silk opens the shoulders and lofts Coulter-Nile over cow corner for six! It\u2019s the second time they\u2019ve got him on the final ball; and another good over turns into a bad one, instantly. 100 was looking a decent psychologically barrier, not too many boundaries were coming - if they can push past that by some distance though the Sixers could have a good enough score. A-League - Goal! Brisbane 1-1 Adelaide (Muratovic) It took just ten minutes to hit back, and it\u2019s the youngster Mirza Muratovic who hands the home side a share of the spoils. I\u2019d love to tell you more, but I\u2019ll confess I\u2019ve got about three screens on and I\u2019m not catching it all. Great to see the young strikers coming through under the tutelage of the great Robbie Fowler. Big Bash - Sixers 4/82 (9), Philippe 36*, Silk 10* Rauf doesn\u2019t do a lot wrong (apart from one booming above-the-shoulders delivery that he has to bowl again) but he still goes for nine. They nudge him for a few twos off the end to make it a decent over. It\u2019s still really in the balance. 18 big deliveries - 25-30 could be enough for the Sixers. They need to get Philippe back on strike. Eek. That\u2019s got ugly near the end. The Waratahs had pulled back to 12-20 and made it a little nervy for their front-leading visitors, but two tries late on for Telea really rubbed their noses in it. \u201cCredit to the Blues, they\u2019re one of those teams that never give up - the try on the buzzer shows that\u201d - that\u2019s the word from a deflated Karmichael Hunt post-match. \u201cWe need to keep perspective - it\u2019s still round two.\u201d Big Bash - Sixers 4-68 (7.2), Philippe 33*, Silk 0* Zampa picks up the skipper Henriques - gone for 7 off 6, and they\u2019ve pinched two in as many overs, as Maxi traps the new man Hughes lbw! They\u2019re still scoring at a decent clip, but they need to find somebody to go with Philippe, the Sixers. Stars suddenly on top - can they add a good over or two here to push the run rate down? A-League - Goal! Brisbane 0-1 Adelaide (Halloran) 57 min: It\u2019s the home side looking to lift the tempo, but with Brisbane edging proceedings, against the run of play a belter from Halloran! He follows in Opseth\u2019s blocked effort, and blasts a half-volleyed effort from 25-30m out. Great control with the first touch, at pace, and the second - even better! Whack. His sixth goal of the season. Big Bash - Wicket! Sixers 1/49 (5.1), Smith 21 out! Here\u2019s a big moment! They were looking very comfortable, Philippe and Smith - the former seeing off the first dangerous Zampa over, with some smart singles and then a lovely final-ball boundary. The skipper Maxwell decides something has to change - and he grabs the ball himself. Smith takes him on - and first ball, he\u2019s holed out in the deep! A terrific catch from Handscomb who holds onto a swirling, difficult effort. Smith goes - is that a match changing moment?! Henriques comes out, but it\u2019s Philippe who takes on Maxi. A massive pre-meditated slog down the ground - a massive six! Big Bash - Sixers 1/40 (4), Philippe 17*, Smith 18* It\u2019s Smith v Rauf, as the Pakistani quick takes on perhaps the world\u2019s best batsmen. First blood - Smith: a four, a massive six and then some smart singles. Both these batsmen looking very comfortable out there. They\u2019ve seen off the first of the Stars\u2019 danger men with the ball - here comes the other; it\u2019s Zampa to bowl the fifth over. Big Bash - Sixers 0/15 (2), Philippe 11*, Vince 2* He\u2019s undone that good Worrall over, Nathan Coulter-Niles as with Vince pinned after a series of play and misses, he trundles down a wide one that Philippe lashes square, before clipping him off the toes for six off the final ball of the over! Can they settle now, the Sixers? No! First ball of the next Worrall over, he\u2019s picked up Vince! 2 off 9. That\u2019s a really bad innings in a 72 ball game. He was going after every delivery, and he connected with very few. In comes Steve Smith. Can he be the man for the Sixers? Big Bash - Sixers 0/3 (1), Philippe 1*, Vince 1* We\u2019re away! And it\u2019s a terrific first over for the Stars - especially in a rain-reduced 3-over powerplay, where they\u2019ve gone for just three! Worrall finding great lateral movement in the damp conditions and Vince wafts at a few to no effect. The pressure is already straight on the Sixers; they\u2019ve lost the toss, been sent in, and with just 66 balls left will already feel they need to get moving. A-League: Brisbane Roar 0-0 Adelaide United - half-time No goals, but plenty of intrigue in Brisbane. That near-howler from Izzo the closest we got to an opener, while at the other end the Reds had a few chances, but nothing too clear cut - at least to worry the league\u2019s in-form \u2018keeper, Young. More to come in this one, you\u2019d imagine, as legs and minds tire, and the match opens up. A-League - 43 min: It\u2019s the unlikely figure of Roar\u2019s centre back Macauley Gillesphey firing a shot from distance - and it\u2019s squirmed through \u2018keeper Paul Izzo\u2019s hands, but rolls agonisingly wide of the posts! Blushes spared - that was shades of Tom Glover\u2019s howler in the Melbourne derby. Crucially though, the final result was different - with it coming at the cost of just a corner, not a goal. Super Rugby - Tries! So much for the late half revival - the \u2018Tahs have come out for the second half as cold as week-old sick. The Blues with back-to-back tries within the first five minutes, the latter seeing a No 8 putting it on the toe for a winger in acres of space. What happened there?! The Waratahs defence caught badly short out wide, and they trail now 7-20. We have a bat toss! It\u2019s looking like a 12-over game, and it\u2019s Glen Maxwell\u2019s Stars that have won the bat-flip and elected to bowl first. Ben Dunk the only change to Melbourne\u2019s line up, the Sixers will be as they were last time out. Move over The Hundred - welcome to the 72! That\u2019s the figure if we do get the 12 overs in a piece. Game on. A-League - 30 min: Still scoreless in grizzly, drizzly conditions in Brisbane. A fair bit of niggle in this one - Adelaide\u2019s Gertjan Verbeek no shrinking violet on the touchline, and there\u2019s a fair bit of steel to Robbie Fowler\u2019s Roar these days. Mauk fires a shot for Adelaide - but it only catches the back of his own player, Kristian Opseth! Ach. Friendly fire, that was probably goal-bound. Super Rugby: Waratahs 7-8 Blues - half-time: A try just in the shadow of half-time has the home fans feeling a little more optimistic. Lalakai Foketi grabbing the five-pointer after a good sustained period of possession for the \u2018Tahs. That will make Rob Penney\u2019s half-time chat a little more optimistic. It\u2019s nicely poised this one; the home side very much fought their way back into the contest after looking on the back foot early on. We could be looking at 12-14 overs each in the Big Bash final - which poses all sorts of conundrums for coaches and performance staff. Does Maxi open?? Imagine. It\u2019s reportedly reasonably dry underfoot - I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve had a toss yet though; will keep my eyes and ears peeled (sure) on that front. A-League - 10 min: No score from Brisbane in the inaugural \u201cStefan Mauk derby\u201d. The man named Ingo (middle name) was of course until last month a Brisbane Roar player. He found his opportunities limited, or at least, not to his liking - and lines up this weekend for his new side, Adelaide United, against - you guessed it: Brisbane Roar. It\u2019s the Reds (playing in white) on the attack early on - they look to work something from a corner, but Jamie Young comes and claims comfortably. Super Rugby - 25 min: So, not the ideal start for the Tahs, who go behind after ten minutes to a Blake Gibson try. It\u2019s the Blues who have been probing and very much setting the pace, although there\u2019s still been plenty of ball in hand for the home side. A penalty while on attack is also gratefully accepted: Waratahs 0-8 Blues. The latest from the SCG and the Big Bash final: the super soppa is out working over-time, and a decent breeze is coming across the oval which is helping dry out the pitch. No official word on a starting time, or how many overs we\u2019ll lose, but we are edging inexorably closer to a start. I believe. Some bad news from the A-League and for Melbourne Victory fans (it\u2019s really not been their week, let\u2019s face it) - Socceroos star Robbie Kruse is set for a lengthy stint on the sideline: Anna Harrington with the words out of Melbourne: Melbourne Victory winger Robbie Kruse has suffered a fresh hamstring injury and will miss at least six weeks of the A-League season. Kruse limped down the tunnel in the 84th minute of Victory\u2019s 2-1 loss on Friday night, just 29 minutes after entering the fray, having missed the previous week\u2019s draw with Perth Glory with hamstring tightness. Victory confirmed Kruse had suffered a right hamstring injury - his other hamstring caused the Socceroo to miss the opening five rounds. \u201cBarring any setbacks during his recovery, it\u2019s expected Kruse will be available for selection in the next 6-8 weeks,\u201d the Victory said in a statement issued on Saturday. Kruse\u2019s setback means Victory will also have to reshuffle ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Asian Champions League clash with Chiangrai United. Another significant spanner in Victory\u2019s stop-start season. Their traditional rivals Adelaide won\u2019t mind though - we are just a few minutes away from kickoff in Brisbane, where it is the Reds in action. Not sure the backstory behind it, but they\u2019ve elected to open their season a few hundred kilometres up the road in Newcastle, the Waratahs. Not a bad call given if they were playing in Sydney tonight the game would have no doubt been cancelled. Here\u2019s the respective XVs for Tahs v Blues - we\u2019re actually up and underway, no score as yet: We do of course have Super Rugby still ahead, where the Waratahs will be looking to bounce back from their opening round loss to the Crusaders - they\u2019re at home to the Blues. An intriguing result a bit earlier coming out of the Waikato - where the Chiefs have beaten Razer Robinson\u2019s South Islanders. Hello. And here\u2019s the official word on the BBL final - the final can be delayed for up to two hours before it will be officially cancelled; in which case the home side, the Sixers, would be declared champions. Summary courtesy AAP: Play would need to start by about 9:20pm for a completed game to be possible. There is no reserve day in the BBL schedule. The Sixers will be crowned champions if the clash is abandoned because they are hosting the final. \u201cThey (umpires) are certainly hopeful of getting some sort of game in,\u201d Stars skipper Glenn Maxwell said during Fox Sports\u2019 pre-match program. \u201cThey have to make sure it\u2019s a safe environment for the game to go ahead. \u201cThe last thing you want is a Josh Hazlewood or someone like that going down with an injury because of wet weather. \u201cI know everyone is desperate to get out there and have a game ... hopefully, we can get a bit of a break between the showers.\u201d Every eight minutes of play lost to wet weather will result in the match being reduced by one over per team. Now the big remaining question mark over Sportswatch tonight is the will-it, won\u2019t-it dilemma surrounding the Big Bash final, where the latest is that the torrential rains currently lashing Sydney have delayed the bat toss. So \u201cyes, hopefully, but not straight away\u201d remains the verdict there. Thousands have braved the rains and made their way out to the SCG. Let\u2019s hope for their sakes we can at least get a reduced game in. As the Thunder will remind you from earlier in the season - 5 overs is the minimum required for a formal contest. They started the quarter in flying fashion, Adelaide, and for a moment you wondered, maybe, just maybe - with a goal inside the opening minute of the final stanza. But some old heads in the Brisbane defensive line stood tall, marshalled excellently by Sharni Webb, and any final term turnaround was slowly strangled out. No Erin Phillips and plenty of other outs for Adelaide, but it was the eight debutants of Brisbane that stood tall - what a win for the home side! And the somewhat incongruous sounds of La Marseillaise resound around Hickey Park. Incroyable. And a story looming from the late A-League fixture, which will be going ahead. It\u2019s been one of the stories of the season - the emergence of FA Cup Final hero, Al Hassan Toure - but Adelaide United could be about to give a debut to his younger brother Mohamed - aged just 15. Here\u2019s the line ups for that one - Adelaide: And Brisbane: And, in news that won\u2019t surprise too many - the USWNT has qualified for the Toyko Olympics courtesy an emphatic 4-0 win over Mexico. It\u2019s shaping as some tournament, with Brazil, UK, Netherlands and Japan all qualifying (the latest, more easily as hosts). Can Australia join them? After their 7-0 win over Taiwan you\u2019d say it\u2019s looking positive, but still very early days in Australia\u2019s qualifying campaign through Asia. AFLW: three-quarter-time: Brisbane leads Adelaide 5.3 (33) to 1.2 (8) Brisbane kept them scoreless in the first quarter, and now they\u2019ve done it again, as the home side stretch their lead and start to threaten an opening-round boilover against the reigning premiers! 25 points the margin, surely the Crows can\u2019t turn this around, even with the breeze behind their backs? They did dominate the inside 50s, so they are making chances, but perhaps not finding those clear-cut opportunities? Golf: There was a fair bit of hoo-ha flying round with the news earlier in the week that ABC would be showing the Vic Open on its primarily TV channel, relegating the Sydney derby to the minor channels, but with news the latter has been washed out; who\u2019s laughing now? Here\u2019s Australian Associated Press\u2019s report from the day\u2019s action, where its wind, not rain, reportedly wreaking havoc: Marcus Fraser has overcome \u201cborderline unplayable\u201d conditions to rocket into title contention in the third round of the $1.5 million Vic Open at 13th Beach. With strong winds gusting over 60km/h late on Saturday afternoon at the links layout, Fraser hung tough to shoot a three-under-par 69, lifting him to 12 under. He was a shot off the lead held by fellow Australian Min Woo Lee, who still had four holes of his round to play. Fraser, 41, has won three times on the European Tour during his long professional career. Kia ora! A great hello to you and yours, on what remains, as Megan rightly pointed out, a full basket of sports entertainment. A very magnanimous welcome too - much obliged. Sensational! I guess toothache is a sensation though.. As we\u2019ve mentioned - if you\u2019re just joining us there will be no A-League Sydney derby tonight due to the inclement rains across Sydney. Still, you\u2019d take it over bushfires - let\u2019s hope the rains do some good somewhere across the region. We\u2019ll take you back to the AFLW shortly, but in the interim let\u2019s see what else is happening out there. It\u2019s been a very exciting afternoon so far, with some nail-biters in the cricket and AFLW. There\u2019s more sport coming your way this afternoon, with the second half of this fascinating contest from Brisbane coming up very soon, as well as the Waratahs taking on the Blues in the Super Rugby and another Brisbane v Adelaide match up - this time in the A-League. There is also the increasingly unlikely chance that we might get a BBL final tonight, though my very scientific predictions that consist of \u201clooking out my window\u201d suggest that you might be watching a replay of the Stars and Sixers qualifying final on your TV instead. To take you through tonight\u2019s line up, I\u2019m handing over now to the sensational Richard Parkin, who will guide you through the evening\u2019s events, both rain-affected and dry. Until next time, so long and thanks for all the fish! AFLW: Half-time - Brisbane leads Adelaide 3.3 (21) to 1.2 (8) The weather has settled down in Brisbane, but the Lions are still raining on the Crows\u2019 parade, adding another goal this quarter off the boot of Lauren Arnell. Courtney Gum added one for the Crows, but they weren\u2019t able to close the gap, as the Lions continued their strong defensive efforts. Jessy Keeffe has been all over the park with four tackles and nine hitouts to her name this half. A riveting second half awaits - the Lions are determined, but will the Crows bounce back and let their experience shine? BMX: Worrying news out of Bathurst today with Olympic hopeful Kai Sakakibara airlifted to hospital during a race. From AAP: Australian Olympic BMX cycling hopeful Kai Sakakibara has been airlifted to hospital with head injuries after crashing out of a World Cup event. The 23-year-old was racing on day one of the Supercross in Bathurst in central western NSW on Saturday when he was injured. He was taken by helicopter to Canberra hospital in a critical but stable condition, according to a statement on the BMX Australia website. Sakakibara fell on the second corner during his opening-round heat and was treated on site by paramedics and a doctor before being taken to hospital. The event was called off for the day after the men\u2019s first round because of wind and rain. Sakakibara and his younger sister Saya aim to make their Olympic debuts in Tokyo.\u201d BBL: While the view from my window tells me it\u2019s not currently raining in Sydney, it seems wildly optimistic to expect the BBL final to take place tonight. However it seems that there are a not-insignificant number of people who embrace wild optimism and have arrived at the SCG hoping to see some cricket. I mean, I assume that\u2019s what they\u2019re hoping and they haven\u2019t just turned up for the $9 meat pies. AFLW: Quarter-time Brisbane 2.2 (14) leads Adelaide 0.0 (0) It\u2019s a very strong start from the home team who did a brilliant job to slot two goals before the weather decided it would be fun to recreate the game from Blacktown earlier this afternoon. It\u2019s looking decidedly miserable out there, but the Lions are doing their best to make it worthwhile for the fans who braved the weather. Both goals were scored by debutantes in a brilliant sign for the Lions\u2019 recruitment team, with Orla O\u2019Dwyer and Greta Bodey doing the damage. The Crows look shell shocked and will need to fight the rain as well as their determined opponents to work their way back into this contest. Rugby: Things aren\u2019t getting easier for Australian rugby and the hunt for a new broadcast deal highlights some of the struggles they\u2019re facing. Bret Harris illustrates the woes here, with Fox Sports offering a much smaller deal than they previously had and Optus the only other bidder offering not much more. Whether RA receives $20m a year or $30m, it still will not be sufficient to stop the exodus of Australian players to Europe and Japan, which will further dilute the quality of Australia\u2019s four Super Rugby franchises. New Zealand and South Africa, too, are starting to lose players in significant numbers to overseas clubs, but they have more depth than Australia, which remains in a comparatively weaker position.\u201d AFLW: Another big match coming up, with Brisbane taking on Adelaide in just a couple of minutes. It will be a tough ask for Brisbane coming up against the defending premiers and the Lions\u2019 preseason form hasn\u2019t asked many questions of the opposition. But a home crowd might just spur them on as they look for a winning start to the season. AFLW: Another favourite from during the week, this great season preview from Kasey Symons. She makes some really interesting points about women\u2019s coaching roles and what is being done to address the lack of top level female coaches. Advocates for women in sport had hoped the expanded competition would establish more coaching opportunities for women. Yet of the 14 teams, only one boasts a woman as head coach \u2013 St Kilda, with Peta Searle, who made history as the first woman to be part of an AFL men\u2019s coaching program. Former AFLW head coaches Bec Goddard and Cowan have returned to the game in some way \u2013 Cowan as a forward line coach with the Eagles and Goddard with Hawthorn\u2019s VFLW program \u2013 but progress remains slow in this space. The AFL established an AFLW coaching academy in 2019 (also headed up by Cowan) to address the issue, but the fruits of that are yet to truly be seen \u2013 either in the women\u2019s or men\u2019s competitions. Another momentum swing saw the Dees steal the game and the spotlight from competition favourites North at Casey Field. Eden Zanker struck with an all-important goal for the Dees five minutes into the final quarter, and despite Shelley Scott only managing a behind in the 13th minute, the defence was strong enough to hold the lead, with North not able to add to their score for the quarter. It puts a target on the backs of the Dees who will look to continue this form into their match against the Bulldogs next Friday night. Returning star Daisy Pearce was delighted with the win - her return to the field coming 694 days after she last played an AFLW match. \u201cGreat to get the season off to a good start with a positive win against quality opposition,\u201d she said. \u201cTough conditions - we love Casey but it always throws out some challenges. Great to be back out here and so proud of our team for what we put out today in tough conditions.\u201d Olympics: One of my favourite pieces of this week was this fantastic reminiscence from Geoff Lemon on the surprise star of the Sydney Olympics - The Dream with Roy and HG. This was the joy of The Dream. It was a cleansing draught of bicarb soda to offset the saccharine stodge of the Olympic diet; the daily dose that made enjoying the rest possible. It came out of nowhere, but from a couple of practitioners who were in prime condition for the gig. It was bold and interesting programming from a network that usually shirks that. It made dagginess a centrepiece.\u201d Football: It was a dominant win for the Matildas last night without Sam Kerr and Samantha Lewis captured it wonderfully. Friday\u2019s 7-0 demolition of Taiwan showed just what a Kerr-less Matildas can look like. Ironically, the striker\u2019s niggle appeared to be a confidence-booster for the side, allowing other players to step out from beneath her ever-lengthening shadow and claim the spotlight for themselves.\u201d AFLW: Three-quarter-time - North Melbourne leads Melbourne 3.2 (20) to 2.3 (15) What a nailbiter this game is turning out to be! Momentum continues to swing back and forth and some nerves striking Melbourne, which allows the Kangaroos to take advantage. Tegan Cunningham had the perfect opportunity in front of the sticks, set up by a needle-threading kick by Kate Hore, but she sprayed it wide and came away with only one point for the quarter. Emma Kearney has been a powerhouse in defence for North, with seven tackles and 16 disposals for the match so far. What will the last quarter bring? Is there a scoring end or has North finally stamped their dominance on this game once and for all? Cricket: Due to that delightful NSW weather, the Bushfire Bash will be played in Melbourne tomorrow, which is quite possibly what Cricket Australia wanted all along. The squads are looking pretty impressive with some very big names in there, even after Shane Warne pulled out. What match up are you most looking forward to in this one? For me it\u2019s Brett Lee v Alex Blackwell - I\u2019m predicting Blackwell smashes some sixes off Tony Abbott\u2019s best mate. AFLW: A brilliant article today from the always brilliant Kirby Fenwick. She has beautifully captured the atmosphere and energy surrounding AFLW at Princes Park. For fans of the women\u2019s game, returning to Princes Park on a Friday night in February has become a tradition. It\u2019s a night we start pining for as soon as the shine of the grand final wears off. One that fills our bellies with nerves, and our hearts with joy. The old ground has a distinctive kind of magic, infused as it is with so many special AFLW memories \u2013 so many footy firsts, historic moments and iconic images.\u201d Cricket: The match report from Australia\u2019s loss earlier this afternoon is now live. The loss makes tomorrow\u2019s match against England a must-win encounter for Australia to qualify for the final of the tri-series. AFLW: Half-time - Melbourne leads North Melbourne 2.2 (14) to 2.1 (13) A much improved quarter from the Dees sees them hit the lead with a late goal right on half-time. Kate Hore has been a standout, with two goals and a behind, as well as 10 disposals and two marks. Melbourne\u2019s fitness is starting to come to the fore as they power through this match. A fascinating second half awaits us. Hockey: With wild weather forcing cancellations across NSW this weekend, the coronavirus is also playing havoc with scheduling. The Hockeyroos will be unable to travel to China for Hockey Pro League games in March. Here\u2019s the latest from AAP: Hockeyroos\u2019 games in China postponed The Hockeyroos have become the latest sporting team forced to alter their schedule because of the outbreak of the coronavirus. Australia\u2019s women\u2019s hockey team, who later this year will seek to win their first Olympic medal since triumphing at home in 2000, were slated to travel to Changzhou and face China in Pro League matches on March 14 and 15. Those games have now been scrapped, with the International Hockey Federation (FIH) scrambling to find new dates and another venue. \u201cThis is the right thing to do under the circumstances and Hockey Australia fully supports the FIH\u2019s stance,\u201d said Hockey Australia chief executive Matt Favier said. The FIH confirmed the latest change to its schedule, which comes after this weekend\u2019s games between Belgium and China in Changzhou were also postponed. \u201cHockey Australia\u2019s number one priority is always the health, well-being and safety of our athletes and staff,\u201d Hockey Australia high-performance director Toni Cumpston said. \u201cWe raised our concerns with FIH and initiated discussions as soon as the threat of the coronavirus was first publicised. We are happy that FIH have made this decision and we look forward to working with them and the Chinese Hockey Association to organise another suitable time to play the matches.\u201d The Pro League, a home-and-away competition involving the world\u2019s best teams, is a key part of the Hockeyroos\u2019 preparation for Tokyo 2020. Australia lost to the Netherlands in last year\u2019s Pro League final in a penalty shootout. The Hockeyroos\u2019 2020 Pro League campaign continues on March 6 against Argentina in Perth. AFLW: Quarter-time - North Melbourne leads Melbourne 2.1 (13) to 0.0 (0) It\u2019s been a dominant start from the competition favourites, who seem to be relishing the favourites tag. Despite windy conditions in Melbourne, the weather is positively balmy compared to the last game. The Dees are playing with heart, but the Kangaroos look too big and too strong for them at this stage of the game. Kaitlyn Ashmore and Daisy Bateman have the goals for the Kangaroos, while Tahni Nestor has been dominant in defence. Despite Ash Gardener\u2019s sensational 93 off 57 balls at Junction Oval today, Australia couldn\u2019t come away with the win and seal their place in the final, going down to India with two balls to spare. A lack of wickets hurt the Australians, something they will be looking to address with their World Cup campaign due to begin in less than two weeks. India will be pleased with the seven-wicket win, but will be aware that the hosts aren\u2019t giving away everything they\u2019ve got so close to the World Cup. Craig on Twitter is also keeping a close eye on the cricket, but is looking forward to the upcoming AFLW game also. That match is kicking off very soon and there will be plenty of eyes on Pearce as she makes her return to the field after the birth of her twins last year. The game has been billed as the match of the round and North Melbourne are favourites for this year\u2019s premiership, so the Dees will be extra motivated to start the season with a win over their rivals. Don\u2019t forget you can tweet or email me or leave a comment down below if you want to get involved in the chat around today\u2019s great day of sport. Maddy on Twitter is enjoying the T20 at the moment, but shares my concerns about Australia\u2019s lack of wickets going into the final three overs of the match. Delissa Kimmince with the ball for the 17th over, let\u2019s hope she has a couple of wickets in her. A League: News just in that tomorrow\u2019s F3 derby is now in doubt due to ongoing rain on the NSW coast. The latest from AAP: \u201cThe F3 derby between Newcastle and Central Coast is in doubt due to wet weather, with a decision expected to be made early on Sunday morning. Just hours after the Sydney derby was postponed due to torrential rain, the Jets on Saturday announced McDonald Jones Stadium will also be inspected at 10.30am on Sunday. \u201cThe inspection will assess the impact of the weather on the surface, and any decision regarding the #F3Derby fixture will be communicated following the inspection,\u201d the Jets said in a statement.\u201d Cricket: India 129-2 after 14 overs A big wicket from Megan Schutt gives some hope back to the Australians, with Jemimah Rodrigues departing for 30. Though it does bring the dangerous Harmanpreet Kaur to the crease, so still plenty of work for the bowlers to do in these last six overs. No more points were added in the end and GWS snuck away with the win, which they will hope will put their season on a better track than 2019. GWS captain Alicia Eva was happy with the win, although a little surprised when the siren sounded. \u201cI thought we were a point down!\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a tough game. Credit to Gold Coast, they went hard and made us work hard. The ground is really hard under foot, but credit to our strength and conditioning coach who trained us hard over the preseason.\u201d Cricket: India 120-1 after 12 overs A career best score from Ash Gardener put the Australians on track to win at Junction Oval where they finished 173-5 in their innings, but India have not let up in reply. Of course it was El-Pez with the big wicket, but India have not slowed, needing just 54 runs off 48 balls for victory with nine wickets in hand. AFLW: 4th quarter - GWS leads Gold Coast 1.3 (9) to 1.2 (8) While the W-League wasn\u2019t able to go ahead, the AFLW pushes on in a very wet and wild Blacktown. With visibility poor and the ball basically a bar of soap, it\u2019s not the entry to the competition the Suns would have dreamed of. Aimee Schmidt got the goal for GWS, while Brittany Perry found the big sticks for the Suns. With less than five minutes to go, it\u2019s still anyone\u2019s game if they can hold the ball. Guess what\u2019s back? Back again. Footy\u2019s back. Tell a friend. That\u2019s right, despite still being in the throes of cricket season, we are blessed with the AFLW, giving us more women\u2019s sport than you can poke a stick at, which makes me very happy indeed. More on the very soggy game from Blacktown in just a minute though, the big news is that the Sydney Derby in the A-League has been postponed due to heavy rain in Sydney. Football Federation Australia have released the following statement: \u201cThe Sydney Derby that was scheduled to be played at Netstrata Jubilee Stadium today has been postponed due to torrential rain in the Sydney basin over the past 48 hours. FFA officials met with the referees and other stakeholders including the host broadcaster Fox Sports as well as the venue groundstaff to inspect the playing surface this morning. Having assessed the condition of the field, and considering the forecast for rain for the remainder of the day, all stakeholders agreed that the pitch was not safe to play on today. FFA Head of Leagues, Greg O\u2019Rourke, was personally on hand to inspect the field of play this morning and ultimately made the decision to postpone the match. \u201cWith over 100mm of rain falling in the Sydney area over the past two days, and in the interest of player welfare, all parties agreed that it was not possible to play the match as scheduled today,\u201d said O\u2019Rourke. \u201cWhilst it is disappointing that a nearly sold-out crowd is unable to see another iconic Sydney Derby today, this was the right decision to give fans as much notice as possible under the circumstances,\u201d concluded O\u2019Rourke The match will be rescheduled for another date to be decided following discussions between FFA, both Clubs and Fox Sports.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>\u2018<strong>After Lyra\u2019s death, I decided to do something worthwhile with my anger\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sara Canning, nurse and partner of </strong><strong>journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/lyra-mckee\" title=\"\">Lyra McKee</a>, Derry</strong></p> <p>Lyra and I knew early on that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. We met on Plenty Of Fish in March 2018 \u2013 super millennial. She messaged me first, with a Harry Potter chat-up line, which worked. Lyra loved happy endings. She was heartbroken when her friend\u2019s relationship broke up. So she said she didn\u2019t care that we\u2019d only been going out one year, we should get married. We had that discussion on a Tuesday; by Thursday she\u2019d bought the ring.</p> <p>She was going to propose on holiday in New York, but she showed me a picture of the ring on her phone. Lyra couldn\u2019t hold her water like that. She knew the answer was always going to be yes. She planned to propose in Central Park. That was about a fortnight before she was killed.</p> <p>Lyra made my politics less black and white. She was unique in Northern Ireland, in a way, because she took people as they came. She was friends with people who said awful, misguided or purposely inflammatory things. It boggled my mind. She loved to have \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/lyra_mckee_in_memory_of/transcript?language=en\" title=\"\">as she said in her TED Talk</a> \u2013 a difficult conversation with a person. She changed a lot of people\u2019s opinions towards LGBTQ people.</p> <p>After Lyra was murdered, I had a lot of anger; it was just eating me. I thought, I can spend all this time crying about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/22/lyra-mckee-friends-stage-protest-derry-offices-saoradh\" title=\"\">her murderers, the New IRA</a>, but it\u2019s screaming into a void. Nothing I say would change those people. I have to live in Derry, the same town as them. I\u2019m not harping on about them constantly. I could either become that girl on TV, crying about the IRA, crying about her girlfriend. Or I could channel it and do something worthwhile with my anger. I could use my voice, as one of many. I added my voice to marriage equality and a woman\u2019s right to choose; both issues that Lyra and I believed in. </p> <p>Northern Ireland is like the poor relation. We\u2019re volatile, so everything\u2019s a devolved issue and nobody can legislate. That\u2019s why, when I had that opportunity to speak to Theresa May at Lyra\u2019s funeral, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/08/lyra-mckees-partner-pleads-for-same-sex-marriage-in-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">I pleaded with her to legislate for marriage equality</a> on our behalf. She said nothing solid in response, but at least I was talking about something that was changeable.</p> <p>After Lyra\u2019s death, people wanted to tell me their stories. I hope she\u2019s changed hearts and minds. If anything good can come out of the hell of the past year, I hope that there was a push for marriage equality because of Lyra. It should never have taken her being murdered, but here we are.</p> <p>I wear the engagement ring all the time. Lyra\u2019s family presented it to me on Easter Sunday, during her wake. It came in an egg with a scroll, both references to the Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts. On the scroll, Lyra wrote: \u201cHearts are fantastic beasts and you have captured mine.\u201d It\u2019s perfect, beautiful. She did a great job.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>In the early days,</strong><strong> gay activists didn\u2019t get any support from nationalist or unionist parties\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jeffrey Dudgeon, former councillor</strong><strong> and writer, Belfast</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"569244cf630537c7dd14b98d4692a7a46e726ab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/569244cf630537c7dd14b98d4692a7a46e726ab9/54_284_6473_8091/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Dudgeon, former councillor and writer in Belfast\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeffrey Dudgeon: \u2018I experienced a lot of violence.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Voronov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been playing catchup all my life. If I\u2019d been living in Birmingham, I\u2019d have been decriminalised in 1967. I brought a legal case that led to the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland 15 years later, in 1982. We\u2019d been denied a personal life, and we were that first generation that had enough anger to do something about it. That led us to be revolutionary.</p> <p>We were considered a threat because we were gay and campaigning. In 1976, the RUC came to my house with search warrants for drugs. But that was secondary; at the police station, I was interrogated on matters entirely gay. By then I\u2019d taken my case to the European commission of human rights.</p> <p>We tried to get the law reformed through Stormont, which didn\u2019t work. So we tried Westminster, but that was shelved in 1978. In Strasbourg, I argued for my right to a private life and against discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. It was a prolonged process; it took six years. We won in the European court of human rights in 1981. It was historic, but there was no sense of triumph. We were just relieved we\u2019d won what was our due despite [DUP leader] Ian Paisley\u2019s Save Ulster from Sodomy campaign.</p> <p>I experienced a lot of violence; my house came under prolonged attack and I wasn\u2019t protected. For the next 20 years I worked on getting the age of consent down from 21 to 16, and getting civil partnerships for gay people. It all had to be done through Westminster.</p> <p>The DUP are characterised as the problem in preventing equal marriage, but in the early days, gay activists didn\u2019t get any support from nationalist or unionist parties. The nationalist parties gradually became enthusiastic; the DUP maintained its absolute opposition; and the [unionist] UUP, which I became a member of, left it up to individual MPs.</p> <p>Northern Ireland has always been unfairly characterised as ultra-religious and backward. But the DUP don\u2019t represent the Protestant population, let alone the unionist population.

We had our ceremony \u2013 I call it our wedding \u2013 in a hotel in Belfast and my son, Ryan, who is 26, walked me up the aisle. We have ageing and sick family members, so we couldn\u2019t wait any longer. My mummy is in her 70s, Amanda has a disabled sister. My best friend died two years ago, so he wasn\u2019t there for the wedding. As LGBTQ people, how much longer should we have to wait?</p> <p><strong>Amanda McGurk</strong> We both work in the charity sector, so we joined the marriage equality campaign because we were in a position to. We took the decision for those who cannot stand up for themselves. We went to London with the campaign, where Cara and I took a petition to Downing Street.</p> <p><strong>CM</strong> The new legislation does not make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/14/same-sex-marriage-delays-in-northern-ireland-legal-action\" title=\"\">provision for civil partnership conversions and religious ceremonies</a>. So we\u2019re locked into a civil partnership as marriage comes in. The church is a huge part of my life. I am a practising Catholic and I lead a church choir. Our ceremony was religious, led by a non-subscribing Presbyterian minister. It wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted, because we\u2019re Catholics, but it was the nearest thing I was going to get.</p> <p><strong>AM</strong> People say, just go across the border and get married \u2013 but why should I leave my home, to come back here and have it downgraded? We\u2019ve had some negativity. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019ll burn in hell. I told them, \u201cIt\u2019s a good job I like heat.\u201d We\u2019ve always had to have a resilience, like everyone in our community, because homophobia exists. Elected representatives set the example. When your government discriminates against you, what\u2019s to stop the average person in the street doing the same? We just had to be that bit stronger whenever we became public faces in the campaign. Keyboard warriors say whatever they want, but they should remember that there\u2019s a human reading their comments.</p> <p><strong>CM</strong> And a son reading those comments, too. Before we went to London we knew there was going to be enormous media coverage. I told Ryan not to bite if he saw anything negative online. But there was one man he just couldn\u2019t refrain from tackling. He gave the most eloquent response. He wrote, \u201cThe person you\u2019re calling these names is my mummy. That\u2019s the woman who has loved me. She has brought me up to be tolerant of everyone.\u201d My son said to me: I\u2019ll talk to these people.

      "bodyText": "\u2018After Lyra\u2019s death, I decided to do something worthwhile with my anger\u2019 Sara Canning, nurse and partner of journalist Lyra McKee, Derry Lyra and I knew early on that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. We met on Plenty Of Fish in March 2018 \u2013 super millennial. She messaged me first, with a Harry Potter chat-up line, which worked. Lyra loved happy endings. She was heartbroken when her friend\u2019s relationship broke up. So she said she didn\u2019t care that we\u2019d only been going out one year, we should get married. We had that discussion on a Tuesday; by Thursday she\u2019d bought the ring. She was going to propose on holiday in New York, but she showed me a picture of the ring on her phone. Lyra couldn\u2019t hold her water like that. She knew the answer was always going to be yes. She planned to propose in Central Park. That was about a fortnight before she was killed. Lyra made my politics less black and white. She was unique in Northern Ireland, in a way, because she took people as they came. She was friends with people who said awful, misguided or purposely inflammatory things. It boggled my mind. She loved to have \u2013 as she said in her TED Talk \u2013 a difficult conversation with a person. She changed a lot of people\u2019s opinions towards LGBTQ people. After Lyra was murdered, I had a lot of anger; it was just eating me. I thought, I can spend all this time crying about her murderers, the New IRA, but it\u2019s screaming into a void. Nothing I say would change those people. I have to live in Derry, the same town as them. I\u2019m not harping on about them constantly. I could either become that girl on TV, crying about the IRA, crying about her girlfriend. Or I could channel it and do something worthwhile with my anger. I could use my voice, as one of many. I added my voice to marriage equality and a woman\u2019s right to choose; both issues that Lyra and I believed in. Northern Ireland is like the poor relation. We\u2019re volatile, so everything\u2019s a devolved issue and nobody can legislate. That\u2019s why, when I had that opportunity to speak to Theresa May at Lyra\u2019s funeral, I pleaded with her to legislate for marriage equality on our behalf. She said nothing solid in response, but at least I was talking about something that was changeable. After Lyra\u2019s death, people wanted to tell me their stories. I hope she\u2019s changed hearts and minds. If anything good can come out of the hell of the past year, I hope that there was a push for marriage equality because of Lyra. It should never have taken her being murdered, but here we are. I wear the engagement ring all the time. Lyra\u2019s family presented it to me on Easter Sunday, during her wake. It came in an egg with a scroll, both references to the Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts. On the scroll, Lyra wrote: \u201cHearts are fantastic beasts and you have captured mine.\u201d It\u2019s perfect, beautiful. She did a great job. \u2018In the early days, gay activists didn\u2019t get any support from nationalist or unionist parties\u2019 Jeffrey Dudgeon, former councillor and writer, Belfast I\u2019ve been playing catchup all my life. If I\u2019d been living in Birmingham, I\u2019d have been decriminalised in 1967. I brought a legal case that led to the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland 15 years later, in 1982. We\u2019d been denied a personal life, and we were that first generation that had enough anger to do something about it. That led us to be revolutionary. We were considered a threat because we were gay and campaigning. In 1976, the RUC came to my house with search warrants for drugs. But that was secondary; at the police station, I was interrogated on matters entirely gay. By then I\u2019d taken my case to the European commission of human rights. We tried to get the law reformed through Stormont, which didn\u2019t work. So we tried Westminster, but that was shelved in 1978. In Strasbourg, I argued for my right to a private life and against discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. It was a prolonged process; it took six years. We won in the European court of human rights in 1981. It was historic, but there was no sense of triumph. We were just relieved we\u2019d won what was our due despite [DUP leader] Ian Paisley\u2019s Save Ulster from Sodomy campaign. I experienced a lot of violence; my house came under prolonged attack and I wasn\u2019t protected. For the next 20 years I worked on getting the age of consent down from 21 to 16, and getting civil partnerships for gay people. It all had to be done through Westminster. The DUP are characterised as the problem in preventing equal marriage, but in the early days, gay activists didn\u2019t get any support from nationalist or unionist parties. The nationalist parties gradually became enthusiastic; the DUP maintained its absolute opposition; and the [unionist] UUP, which I became a member of, left it up to individual MPs. Northern Ireland has always been unfairly characterised as ultra-religious and backward. But the DUP don\u2019t represent the Protestant population, let alone the unionist population. A very small percentage of Protestants are Free Presbyterians, but a large percentage of DUP legislators are, so the church\u2019s influence is completely disproportionate. I\u2019ve been with my partner for 20 years. We don\u2019t have a civil partnership. The time will come, I\u2019m sure, as I\u2019m 73 \u2013 I\u2019m getting on. Would I go for marriage? We\u2019ll have to see. I have a sense of satisfaction that marriage is legalised, but I don\u2019t want too much triumphalism; we\u2019ve had enough of that in Northern Ireland. I\u2019ve put thousands of hours into campaigning, which I could have spent doing something else. Playing catchup has prevented me from having another life. \u2018The legislation is about protection, it\u2019s about life and death\u2019 Shannon Sickels, playwright, Belfast It takes fewer days to process paperwork in Northern Ireland than in England, so my partner, Gr\u00e1inne, and I had the first public civil partnership in the UK in 2005. Two men in England had the first partnership privately, because one of them was dying. Gr\u00e1inne and I were willing to go public because it was never about us. We felt very strongly that this was an acknowledgment of the activists behind the scenes, people we lost along the way, and to recognise the role of women in queer history.

She was given her rightful place, through my three brain surgeries and nine weeks in hospital. The legislation is about protection; it\u2019s about life and death. We were in Dublin Castle for the results of the marriage referendum in Ireland. The next morning, in Dublin city centre, we held hands. We both thought, can we do this? Back home in Belfast, we immediately went back to being hyper\u2011vigilant. Something lifted in the south, and it came back down on us when we went north. It was a wonderful time because of the support from the south. Then with Brexit, we had people in England ask, \u201cWho are the DUP?\u201d I thought, fantastic: would you look at them? It\u2019s shone this light on the DUP\u2019s appalling abuse of power. We, and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane, the first two men to have a civil partnership in Northern Ireland, sought a judicial review of the ban on same-sex marriage in 2015. We are waiting on a judgment on that. If the high court rules in our favour, it will ensure that this new Westminster legislation allowing it cannot later be overturned by a future Northern Ireland assembly. When we were approached to seek the review, we thought, oh God, do we have to go back into the spotlight? We didn\u2019t seek it out. The public nature of it has taken its toll. Your photo gets dragged up all the time. When we moved from an apartment to a house, we felt vulnerable; suddenly people know which front door is yours. You\u2019re very exposed. We will get married, but no one will know about it. We\u2019ve earned it. All the queers who have been in a long-term relationship have. It\u2019ll be great when Gr\u00e1inne and I can just drift into the background. I\u2019m looking forward to that.

The DUP claim to speak for Northern Ireland, when they don\u2019t. On social issues like marriage equality and abortion, we can seem like a backwater. That\u2019s not the case. I was driving to council last summer and I came around the square in the town. When I saw the pride flag outside the local coffee shop, I nearly crashed. The owner gave me a thumbs up. I welled up. That\u2019s the very first time a pride flag has been flown in Crossmaglen. It was just acceptance. It\u2019s one of the best things I\u2019ve seen in this town. \u2018When your government discriminates against you, what\u2019s to stop the average person doing the same?\u2019 Cara McCann, charity director, and Amanda McGurk, women\u2019s support officer, Belfast Cara McCann We got civil partnered on Valentine\u2019s Day last year. We had our ceremony \u2013 I call it our wedding \u2013 in a hotel in Belfast and my son, Ryan, who is 26, walked me up the aisle. We have ageing and sick family members, so we couldn\u2019t wait any longer. My mummy is in her 70s, Amanda has a disabled sister. My best friend died two years ago, so he wasn\u2019t there for the wedding. As LGBTQ people, how much longer should we have to wait? Amanda McGurk We both work in the charity sector, so we joined the marriage equality campaign because we were in a position to. We took the decision for those who cannot stand up for themselves. We went to London with the campaign, where Cara and I took a petition to Downing Street. CM The new legislation does not make provision for civil partnership conversions and religious ceremonies. So we\u2019re locked into a civil partnership as marriage comes in. The church is a huge part of my life. I am a practising Catholic and I lead a church choir. Our ceremony was religious, led by a non-subscribing Presbyterian minister. It wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted, because we\u2019re Catholics, but it was the nearest thing I was going to get. AM People say, just go across the border and get married \u2013 but why should I leave my home, to come back here and have it downgraded? We\u2019ve had some negativity. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019ll burn in hell. I told them, \u201cIt\u2019s a good job I like heat.\u201d We\u2019ve always had to have a resilience, like everyone in our community, because homophobia exists. Elected representatives set the example. When your government discriminates against you, what\u2019s to stop the average person in the street doing the same? We just had to be that bit stronger whenever we became public faces in the campaign. Keyboard warriors say whatever they want, but they should remember that there\u2019s a human reading their comments. CM And a son reading those comments, too. Before we went to London we knew there was going to be enormous media coverage. I told Ryan not to bite if he saw anything negative online. But there was one man he just couldn\u2019t refrain from tackling. He gave the most eloquent response. He wrote, \u201cThe person you\u2019re calling these names is my mummy. That\u2019s the woman who has loved me. She has brought me up to be tolerant of everyone.\u201d My son said to me: I\u2019ll talk to these people. I\u2019m part of this. Equal measures: a history of LGBTQ+ rights in Northern Ireland December 2005 The first same-sex civil partnerships took place in the UK, including Northern Ireland. However, Northern Ireland was the only country in the union not to allow a ceremony conducted by a religious organisation. July 2010 Same-sex civil partnerships were legalised in the Irish Republic. May 2015 The Irish Republic became the first country to legalise gay marriage by popular vote, with a 62% majority. January 2017 Ongoing disputes between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in collapsed the assembly, leaving Northern Ireland without a government. April 2019 The murder of journalist and LGBTQ+ activist Lyra McKee galvanised campaigners pushing for marriage reform. July 2019 Westminster MPs passed an amendment by backbench Labour MP Conor McGinn, extending marriage equality to Northern Ireland. February 2020 Northern Ireland\u2019s first gay marriages are expected to take place. Couples remain unable to convert civil partnerships to marriage. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>\u201cIt is quite hard to sum up,\u201d Aaron Ramsdale says, scrambling to find the words to describe his metamorphosis from misfit to mainstay at Bournemouth and being mooted as a future England goalkeeper. \u201cEighteen months ago I was nowhere near the team here. I was probably annoying a lot of people, especially the manager and the goalie coaches because I wasn\u2019t fulfilling my potential. I\u2019d come in one day and I\u2019d be good and the next day I\u2019d come in and look like I\u2019d been dragged through a bush.\u201d</p> <p>The trigger for Ramsdale\u2019s rise rests on a clanger 14 months ago, when he was due to be among the substitutes for a Carabao Cup quarter-final at Stamford Bridge, in a matchday squad for the first time since returning from a loan spell at Chesterfield. \u201cI missed the bus. Slept in,\u201d he says, sheepishly. \u201cWe had to be in at 9.30am for the pre-match walkthrough because it was an evening game and the bus was leaving at 10.30am. Zeina [the club\u2019s player liaison officer] came and woke me up at the house. I was about an hour late for being on time to training and about 20 minutes after the bus as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/watford-adam-masina-interview\">Watford\u2019s Adam Masina: \u2018What I went through was different from normal life\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat was the penny-dropping moment, because I was at home while they were playing and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I was distraught. My dad drove down from Stoke to be with me that night and the night after to check I was all right. That was definitely the turning point where [I realised] it wasn\u2019t all rosy, it wasn\u2019t academy football any more and I\u2019m very grateful the manager gave me a second chance. I think I\u2019ve taken it.\u201d</p> <p>Ramsdale was fined and sent on loan to AFC Wimbledon, then bottom of League One, for the rest of the season. \u201cIt was good for me to go and play the games but I think they probably didn\u2019t want to see me for a few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Thrown in at the deep end of a relegation scrap, Ramsdale regards those months as a priceless experience and a blessing in disguise. He made a big impression and Gareth Southgate invited him to train with England in March. \u201cEven if it was just carrying the balls, that would have been fine,\u201d he says. \u201cI went back to Wimbledon, we got beat 4-0 by Gillingham and I dropped one in the goal. All of the lads were giving me stick.</p> <p>\u201cI got hammered, but I\u2019d do the same in the same situation. I did a lot of growing up on loan, personally and mentally, which has helped me adapt to life in the Premier League.</p> <p>\u201cMy advice to any young player is to try and go to these places because they make you a better person and not just a better footballer. What those six months have done for me, it was a major part in my career.\u201d</p> <p>The 21-year-old, the youngest first-choice goalkeeper in the Premier League, is an endearing and jovial character. It is a marker of his personality that last month, when forced to miss his first league game of the season through injury, he joined fans in the Steve Fletcher Stand to cheer on his teammates against Watford.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a030c98c291710d4512fef87a9ea3bd36265e60b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a030c98c291710d4512fef87a9ea3bd36265e60b/0_99_3359_2015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Ramsdale became Bournemouth\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper at the start of this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Ramsdale became Bournemouth\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper at the start of this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go and give it massive, stand up, be really confident and sing the wrong lyrics. If I\u2019m starting a chant, I need to be nailing it.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt is quite hard to sum up,\u201d Aaron Ramsdale says, scrambling to find the words to describe his metamorphosis from misfit to mainstay at Bournemouth and being mooted as a future England goalkeeper. \u201cEighteen months ago I was nowhere near the team here. I was probably annoying a lot of people, especially the manager and the goalie coaches because I wasn\u2019t fulfilling my potential. I\u2019d come in one day and I\u2019d be good and the next day I\u2019d come in and look like I\u2019d been dragged through a bush.\u201d The trigger for Ramsdale\u2019s rise rests on a clanger 14 months ago, when he was due to be among the substitutes for a Carabao Cup quarter-final at Stamford Bridge, in a matchday squad for the first time since returning from a loan spell at Chesterfield. \u201cI missed the bus. Slept in,\u201d he says, sheepishly. \u201cWe had to be in at 9.30am for the pre-match walkthrough because it was an evening game and the bus was leaving at 10.30am. Zeina [the club\u2019s player liaison officer] came and woke me up at the house. I was about an hour late for being on time to training and about 20 minutes after the bus as well. \u201cThat was the penny-dropping moment, because I was at home while they were playing and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I was distraught. My dad drove down from Stoke to be with me that night and the night after to check I was all right. That was definitely the turning point where [I realised] it wasn\u2019t all rosy, it wasn\u2019t academy football any more and I\u2019m very grateful the manager gave me a second chance. I think I\u2019ve taken it.\u201d Ramsdale was fined and sent on loan to AFC Wimbledon, then bottom of League One, for the rest of the season. \u201cIt was good for me to go and play the games but I think they probably didn\u2019t want to see me for a few weeks.\u201d Thrown in at the deep end of a relegation scrap, Ramsdale regards those months as a priceless experience and a blessing in disguise. He made a big impression and Gareth Southgate invited him to train with England in March. \u201cEven if it was just carrying the balls, that would have been fine,\u201d he says. \u201cI went back to Wimbledon, we got beat 4-0 by Gillingham and I dropped one in the goal. All of the lads were giving me stick. \u201cI got hammered, but I\u2019d do the same in the same situation. I did a lot of growing up on loan, personally and mentally, which has helped me adapt to life in the Premier League. \u201cMy advice to any young player is to try and go to these places because they make you a better person and not just a better footballer. What those six months have done for me, it was a major part in my career.\u201d The 21-year-old, the youngest first-choice goalkeeper in the Premier League, is an endearing and jovial character. It is a marker of his personality that last month, when forced to miss his first league game of the season through injury, he joined fans in the Steve Fletcher Stand to cheer on his teammates against Watford. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go and give it massive, stand up, be really confident and sing the wrong lyrics. If I\u2019m starting a chant, I need to be nailing it. It was just a shame we couldn\u2019t put a performance on because I would have liked to celebrate with the fans.\u201d Ramsdale acknowledges his mistakes, choosing the wrong time to play the class clown and allowing confidence to spill into arrogance, which he believes stems from when he was released by Bolton at 15, but feels he has matured immeasurably. \u201cNow I\u2019ll go home and cook myself some food or get a snack rather than either not eating or getting chocolate.

      "bodyText": "Like so many other wine country towns dependent on tourism and out-of-town visitors, the California resort community of Guerneville typically experiences a winter downturn. Business owners know to prepare for it. Restaurant owners scale back seasonal staff. Hotels offer discounted rates. But this winter, no one was prepared for the aftershocks of the second major wildfire to hit Sonoma county in three seasons \u2013 one that prompted widespread mandatory evacuations and panic. No one was prepared for the after-effects of weeks of power shutoffs, a preventative measure during high fire weather. Business owners still reeling from the cancelled bookings and loss of business during peak tourism season in the fall are now struggling more than ever to get through the winter. \u201cThere just are not enough people coming into town,\u201d said Larry Boeger, the owner of the Timberline at the River restaurant. \u201cWe\u2019re closed during the week.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s early January and freezing cold in New York when I meet Jenny Offill to talk about her new novel, <em>Weather </em>\u2013 an innocuous title for something that feels less innocuous every day. A couple of weeks earlier, the temperature was warm and spring-like. These fluctuations in the weather, and the warming trends they reveal, are increasingly unsettling reminders of the climate crisis, and they form the backbone of Offill\u2019s latest novel, the follow-up to 2014\u2019s bestselling <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/01/jenny-offill-dept-of-speculation-review-beautifully-devastating-portrait-of-a-failing-marriage\" title=\"\">Dept. of Speculation</a></em>.</p> <p><em>Weather</em> follows Lizzie, a university librarian, who responds to the emails sent in to \u201cHell or High Water\u201d, a climate-focused podcast hosted by her former academic mentor. The job opens Lizzie\u2019s eyes to the crisis and the myriad ways different people respond to it, from \u201cdreary\u201d environmentalists obsessed with composting toilets to \u201cend-timers\u201d eager to embrace the Rapture. Amid a growing sense of her own responsibility to the planet and fear for the future, Lizzie struggles to balance her responsibilities as a wife, mother, sister, daughter and friend.</p> <p>\u201cI became interested in why I wasn\u2019t more interested,\u201d Offill says, considering the question of why she chose to focus a novel around a subject many people find too vast and frightening to contemplate. In other words, she was curious how it was possible to be intellectually aware of an unfolding disaster without feeling emotionally connected or moved to action. The novel follows Lizzie as she moves from \u201ca state of twilight knowing\u201d to a more conscious awareness of the crisis. At its core, the story asks: what happens after we start to pay attention?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People feel undone by the sense that you have to have your own house together before you can join a bigger movement</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When writers and artists have tackled the climate crisis, they\u2019ve tended to come at it obliquely, through imagined dystopias. Even the \u201czombie apocalypse\u201d that Offill says crops up on doomsday-prepper websites is somehow more comprehensible than the ravages of climate breakdown. \u201c\u2018Apocalypse\u2019 is one of those words, like \u2018fascism\u2019, that immediately feels like an overstatement,\u201d Offill says. \u201cBut it was hard to see those pictures coming out of Australia in the last few weeks, or hear that a billion animals may have died, and not feel like that is what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Offill\u2019s novel might best be called \u201cpre-apocalyptic\u201d. There are no large-scale emergencies, no heroic survivors; there is no overt horror. Instead, the novel belongs to the everyday world of contemporary gentrifying Brooklyn. As with <em>Dept. of Speculation</em>, the narrative is crafted from short, resonant passages, rarely longer than three or four sentences, that read like diary jottings, conversation fragments, jokes, quotations, trivia or poetry. Their lightness is deceptive. In the gaps between, there\u2019s \u201cthe ambient dread of feeling something is coming or happening, but that you can\u2019t understand its dimensions,\u201d she says. That dread is increased in the wake of the 2016 election, which features, indirectly, in the novel\u2019s plot. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re unrelated,\u201d Offill says, of climate anxieties and Trumpian politics. \u201cI think the spectre of climate change is leading to some of this tightening of us-against-them, lifeboat-ethics feelings.\u201d Strikingly, it\u2019s the election that elicits a grim, panicked response from Lizzie\u2019s husband, Ben, who has been unmoved by her climate worries; he wonders, fleetingly, if they ought to get a gun.</p> <p>Offill is fascinated by the way that these distances can open up, suddenly or slowly, between people within the intimate confines of a family. In <em>Dept. of Speculation</em>, the protagonist finds herself isolated by the intense experience of early motherhood, depression, and the struggle to complete her second novel. The contours of her life reflect Offill\u2019s own, also a married writer with one daughter who has supported herself by teaching and ghostwriting, and who took 15 years to publish the follow-up to her 1999 debut novel, <em>Last Things</em>. But she has resisted the \u201cautofiction\u201d label, which she thinks is applied too readily to women writers, minimising the craft that goes into their fiction. In the course of writing <em>Dept. of Speculation</em>, Offill jettisoned another, more conventionally structured novel, experimented with writing poetry, taught fiction, and eventually hit on the style, stripped to the bone, that would make the novel so powerful \u2013 so \u201cjoyously demanding\u201d, as Roxane Gay put it in her review for the New York Times. Despite Offill\u2019s belief that the book\u2019s fragmented form would mainly excite other writers \u2013 Ocean Vuong, Sheila Heti and Jia Tolentino are among her fans \u2013 it found an unexpectedly wide audience, drawn to its offbeat yet honest depiction of the clash between motherhood and creativity.</p> <p><em>Dept. of Speculation</em>\u2019s unnamed protagonist was a writer who declared her intention to become an \u201cart monster\u201d, the kind of artist who makes a ruthless priority of her creative life. Yet she finds it impossible. The domestic and emotional worlds of motherhood and marriage \u2013 not to mention the pressure to make a living \u2013 exert a far stronger pull than she anticipated. That character and Lizzie are not the same person, Offill stresses, but she sees a continuity between them in the struggle to balance their domestic roles with their larger ambitions. \u201cTo me, the through-line is caretaking,\u201d she says \u2013 the work women do to care for children and other family members, often without pay or even the recognition that it is work at all, leading to a kind of burnout that makes it difficult to pay attention to the wider world. \u201cThat exhaustion was something I wanted to channel through Lizzie.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s no accident that Sylvia, the host of the podcast that draws Lizzie towards an awareness of the climate emergency, is a superstar academic with no children. Her approach to the crisis is shaped by her social class and the freedom of movement it brings. When Lizzie accompanies Sylvia to a conference in Silicon Valley, the well-heeled attendees want to know where the safest place will be to escape the apocalypse \u2013 not for themselves, they insist, but for their children. Of course, as Lizzie is well aware, most people don\u2019t have the freedom to choose where to go if their family is in danger. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people in the world right now who have terrifyingly little control over how to keep their children safe,\u201d Offill observes. When Lizzie worries about the future of her young son, Sylvia\u2019s only advice is to become really rich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ede29eaafeae49c2576e614e5778eadf913257a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ede29eaafeae49c2576e614e5778eadf913257a0/0_167_6692_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beyond the book \u2026 Offill\u2019s website highlights the work of climate activists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyond the book \u2026 Offill\u2019s website highlights the work of climate activists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lizzie herself is neither a climate refugee nor a tech titan, but rather \u201csmack in the middle\u201d, Offill says. She has enough support and security to be able to think about the world beyond her immediate situation, but not enough to protect everyone she loves. And like many women entering middle age, her responsibilities keep extending beyond her husband and son to her brother, a recovering addict, her religious mother, and her brother\u2019s wife and baby. She gives too much of herself to them, she chides herself, listening to their problems and offering her advice for hours on end (her husband drily, or sourly, points out that if only she were a real shrink, they\u2019d be rich). Her impoverished mother drives around town giving socks to the homeless, which gives Offill the opportunity to show us a different kind of caring and social responsibility at work. \u201cThey\u2019ve done all these studies to show that, proportionally, the people who make the least money give the most to charity,\u201d she points out. \u201cI think what Bezos just gave to charity\u201d \u2013 he announced that Amazon would donate $690,000 (\u00a3527,000) to the Australian wildfire relief fund \u2013 \u201cwas something like the equivalent of if I gave one 18th of a penny in terms of proportion of my income.\u201d</p> <p>These bits of information pepper Offill\u2019s conversation as they do the book, connecting ideas and hinting at the research underpinning its allusive style. But while the studies she consulted provided useful reference material, Offill says that her reading began as a way to understand her own reaction to the climate crisis, or lack of it. One book that she cites as formative is criminologist Stanley Cohen\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/apr/07/society.politics\" title=\"\">States of Denial</a>: Knowing About Atrocities and Suffering</em> (\u201cso, big sell at a party\u201d). It was in Cohen\u2019s work that she found the idea of \u201ctwilight knowing\u201d, a state hovering between denial and knowledge, as a name for where Lizzie finds herself at the beginning of the book. Her reading widened to climate science, mythology, psychology and sociology, in an effort to understand how people have responded to disasters at different points in history. To confront a looming apocalypse through reading, she admits, was \u201cdeeply silly, and also the only thing I knew to do\u201d.</p> <p>By making her protagonist a university librarian, Offill was able to create a character who shared her own instinct to look for answers in books, and to indulge in imagining \u201ca little bit of an unlived life\u201d, she says.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s early January and freezing cold in New York when I meet Jenny Offill to talk about her new novel, Weather \u2013 an innocuous title for something that feels less innocuous every day. A couple of weeks earlier, the temperature was warm and spring-like. These fluctuations in the weather, and the warming trends they reveal, are increasingly unsettling reminders of the climate crisis, and they form the backbone of Offill\u2019s latest novel, the follow-up to 2014\u2019s bestselling Dept. of Speculation. Weather follows Lizzie, a university librarian, who responds to the emails sent in to \u201cHell or High Water\u201d, a climate-focused podcast hosted by her former academic mentor. The job opens Lizzie\u2019s eyes to the crisis and the myriad ways different people respond to it, from \u201cdreary\u201d environmentalists obsessed with composting toilets to \u201cend-timers\u201d eager to embrace the Rapture. Amid a growing sense of her own responsibility to the planet and fear for the future, Lizzie struggles to balance her responsibilities as a wife, mother, sister, daughter and friend. \u201cI became interested in why I wasn\u2019t more interested,\u201d Offill says, considering the question of why she chose to focus a novel around a subject many people find too vast and frightening to contemplate. In other words, she was curious how it was possible to be intellectually aware of an unfolding disaster without feeling emotionally connected or moved to action. The novel follows Lizzie as she moves from \u201ca state of twilight knowing\u201d to a more conscious awareness of the crisis. At its core, the story asks: what happens after we start to pay attention? When writers and artists have tackled the climate crisis, they\u2019ve tended to come at it obliquely, through imagined dystopias. Even the \u201czombie apocalypse\u201d that Offill says crops up on doomsday-prepper websites is somehow more comprehensible than the ravages of climate breakdown. \u201c\u2018Apocalypse\u2019 is one of those words, like \u2018fascism\u2019, that immediately feels like an overstatement,\u201d Offill says. \u201cBut it was hard to see those pictures coming out of Australia in the last few weeks, or hear that a billion animals may have died, and not feel like that is what\u2019s happening.\u201d Offill\u2019s novel might best be called \u201cpre-apocalyptic\u201d. There are no large-scale emergencies, no heroic survivors; there is no overt horror. Instead, the novel belongs to the everyday world of contemporary gentrifying Brooklyn. As with Dept. of Speculation, the narrative is crafted from short, resonant passages, rarely longer than three or four sentences, that read like diary jottings, conversation fragments, jokes, quotations, trivia or poetry. Their lightness is deceptive. In the gaps between, there\u2019s \u201cthe ambient dread of feeling something is coming or happening, but that you can\u2019t understand its dimensions,\u201d she says. That dread is increased in the wake of the 2016 election, which features, indirectly, in the novel\u2019s plot. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re unrelated,\u201d Offill says, of climate anxieties and Trumpian politics. \u201cI think the spectre of climate change is leading to some of this tightening of us-against-them, lifeboat-ethics feelings.\u201d Strikingly, it\u2019s the election that elicits a grim, panicked response from Lizzie\u2019s husband, Ben, who has been unmoved by her climate worries; he wonders, fleetingly, if they ought to get a gun. Offill is fascinated by the way that these distances can open up, suddenly or slowly, between people within the intimate confines of a family. In Dept. of Speculation, the protagonist finds herself isolated by the intense experience of early motherhood, depression, and the struggle to complete her second novel. The contours of her life reflect Offill\u2019s own, also a married writer with one daughter who has supported herself by teaching and ghostwriting, and who took 15 years to publish the follow-up to her 1999 debut novel, Last Things. But she has resisted the \u201cautofiction\u201d label, which she thinks is applied too readily to women writers, minimising the craft that goes into their fiction. In the course of writing Dept. of Speculation, Offill jettisoned another, more conventionally structured novel, experimented with writing poetry, taught fiction, and eventually hit on the style, stripped to the bone, that would make the novel so powerful \u2013 so \u201cjoyously demanding\u201d, as Roxane Gay put it in her review for the New York Times. Despite Offill\u2019s belief that the book\u2019s fragmented form would mainly excite other writers \u2013 Ocean Vuong, Sheila Heti and Jia Tolentino are among her fans \u2013 it found an unexpectedly wide audience, drawn to its offbeat yet honest depiction of the clash between motherhood and creativity. Dept. of Speculation\u2019s unnamed protagonist was a writer who declared her intention to become an \u201cart monster\u201d, the kind of artist who makes a ruthless priority of her creative life. Yet she finds it impossible. The domestic and emotional worlds of motherhood and marriage \u2013 not to mention the pressure to make a living \u2013 exert a far stronger pull than she anticipated. That character and Lizzie are not the same person, Offill stresses, but she sees a continuity between them in the struggle to balance their domestic roles with their larger ambitions. \u201cTo me, the through-line is caretaking,\u201d she says \u2013 the work women do to care for children and other family members, often without pay or even the recognition that it is work at all, leading to a kind of burnout that makes it difficult to pay attention to the wider world. \u201cThat exhaustion was something I wanted to channel through Lizzie.\u201d It\u2019s no accident that Sylvia, the host of the podcast that draws Lizzie towards an awareness of the climate emergency, is a superstar academic with no children. Her approach to the crisis is shaped by her social class and the freedom of movement it brings. When Lizzie accompanies Sylvia to a conference in Silicon Valley, the well-heeled attendees want to know where the safest place will be to escape the apocalypse \u2013 not for themselves, they insist, but for their children. Of course, as Lizzie is well aware, most people don\u2019t have the freedom to choose where to go if their family is in danger. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people in the world right now who have terrifyingly little control over how to keep their children safe,\u201d Offill observes. When Lizzie worries about the future of her young son, Sylvia\u2019s only advice is to become really rich. Lizzie herself is neither a climate refugee nor a tech titan, but rather \u201csmack in the middle\u201d, Offill says. She has enough support and security to be able to think about the world beyond her immediate situation, but not enough to protect everyone she loves. And like many women entering middle age, her responsibilities keep extending beyond her husband and son to her brother, a recovering addict, her religious mother, and her brother\u2019s wife and baby. She gives too much of herself to them, she chides herself, listening to their problems and offering her advice for hours on end (her husband drily, or sourly, points out that if only she were a real shrink, they\u2019d be rich). Her impoverished mother drives around town giving socks to the homeless, which gives Offill the opportunity to show us a different kind of caring and social responsibility at work. \u201cThey\u2019ve done all these studies to show that, proportionally, the people who make the least money give the most to charity,\u201d she points out. \u201cI think what Bezos just gave to charity\u201d \u2013 he announced that Amazon would donate $690,000 (\u00a3527,000) to the Australian wildfire relief fund \u2013 \u201cwas something like the equivalent of if I gave one 18th of a penny in terms of proportion of my income.\u201d These bits of information pepper Offill\u2019s conversation as they do the book, connecting ideas and hinting at the research underpinning its allusive style. But while the studies she consulted provided useful reference material, Offill says that her reading began as a way to understand her own reaction to the climate crisis, or lack of it. One book that she cites as formative is criminologist Stanley Cohen\u2019s States of Denial: Knowing About Atrocities and Suffering (\u201cso, big sell at a party\u201d). It was in Cohen\u2019s work that she found the idea of \u201ctwilight knowing\u201d, a state hovering between denial and knowledge, as a name for where Lizzie finds herself at the beginning of the book. Her reading widened to climate science, mythology, psychology and sociology, in an effort to understand how people have responded to disasters at different points in history. To confront a looming apocalypse through reading, she admits, was \u201cdeeply silly, and also the only thing I knew to do\u201d. By making her protagonist a university librarian, Offill was able to create a character who shared her own instinct to look for answers in books, and to indulge in imagining \u201ca little bit of an unlived life\u201d, she says. Yet Lizzie\u2019s job involves far more human than literary interaction, with an array of lost souls including a pale adjunct professor (\u201cI worry he is selling his plasma again,\u201d Lizzie says) and an eternal graduate student. Offill, who has taught at several different colleges, is familiar with this highly educated but precarious class, who have \u201csocial capital and not so much other capital\u201d. It certainly doesn\u2019t escape Lizzie\u2019s notice that her skills and knowledge would be of vanishingly little practical use in a doomsday scenario. Yet libraries also represent, for Offill, a bastion of hope. \u201cAs the social fabric of our society has continued to unravel, libraries have become one of the last places where you don\u2019t have to buy anything and yet you are welcome,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a tiny little vision of utopia.\u201d She mentions the current interest in experimenting with libraries of tools and household appliances as evidence of this utopian instinct at work. It\u2019s surprising, given the subject matter, how much fun Weather is, both to read and discuss, and also how darkly funny. \u201cI\u2019m always trying to figure out when you can puncture some of the self-righteousness,\u201d Offill says. Even where it seems warranted, relentless seriousness about serious subjects can keep people from facing and fighting them. \u201cThey feel undone by the earnestness, by the sense that you have to have your own house completely together before you\u2019re able to join a bigger movement.\u201d Lizzie\u2019s tone is often earnest, sometimes self-righteous, but usually a blend of deadpan and terrified. One joke is something called the \u201cobligatory note of hope\u201d. In the story, it\u2019s a sardonic label for what Sylvia feels she has to include in every article and speech about the climate crisis, if she wants to keep her audience. After the end of the book, the phrase reappears as a URL, which Offill is excited to explain will direct readers to a website that reaches beyond the novel to offer some pathways to activism (right now, it leads to a landing page with a picture of a goat in an abandoned library).

Rough Guide to the Future is one of those corporate-sponsorship-in-the-shape-of-harmless-evening-TV mash-up events, where normal programming keeps looping back to mention the same brand name that lights up the advert pre-rolls. So 5G, we are told, will soon power driverless cars, allow workers to control robots from home, and offer various other advances that are not remotely related to \u201csaving the environment\u201d, and Vodafone is at the forefront of it. Essentially: Vodafone sent Phil Wang to China to eat a battered spider, and now we all have to get phone upgrades. Here, enjoy your TV show about the future. We\u2019ll either marry robots or be dead.",

The \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 are all against it. \u201cThe truth is security and the protection of the UK is the absolute number one priority for any government.\u201d The intervention comes as the US vice-president, Mike Pence, indicated the decision by Boris Johnson to allow Huawei a limited role in 5G rollout could jeopardise a post-Brexit trade deal between Britain and the US. Pence told the US broadcaster CNBC: \u201cThe United States is very disappointed that the United Kingdom has decided to go forward with Huawei. When I went at the president\u2019s direction in September I met with prime minister Johnson and I told him the moment the UK was out of Brexit we were willing to begin to negotiate a free-trade arrangement with the UK.\u201d Asked whether the decision could prove a deal-breaker, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see. But we just don\u2019t believe that utilising the assets, the technology of Huawei is consistent with the security or privacy interests of the UK, of the United States, and it remains a real issue between our two countries.\u201d The remarks came after it was reported that Donald Trump blasted Johnson with \u201capoplectic\u201d rage during a phone call regarding the 5G move.",

It is a monumental match between the two biggest rivals in Portugal, and even at this stage, probably represents Porto\u2019s last chance to deny Benfica a sixth title in seven seasons. Taarabt\u2019s contribution will likely be crucial to Benfica\u2019s chances. He scored and was man-of-the-match in their last league game against Belenenses, a narrow 3-2 win, and has formed an excellent understanding alongside Julian Weigl, the \u00a318m January recruit from Borussia Dortmund. Just as Warnock nurtured at QPR, and Clarence Seedorf supported Taarabt during his successful loan spell at Milan in 2014, the encouragement from Bruno Lage at Benfica has been pivotal to Taarabt re-establishing himself. \u201cWe tried to place him as second striker, but we felt that we could take more advantage of him in the double pivot,\u201d the head coach said recently. \u201cHe gives us defensive balance and also quality in attack.\u201d Few have known the ups and downs that Taarabt has experienced: lurching from cult hero to Karl Henry\u2019s back-up at QPR, keeping Robinho out of the side at Milan before weight gain, obscurity and now redemption at Benfica. There will always be the nagging feeling that Taarabt could have achieved more, but with the arrival of Saturday night\u2019s O Cl\u00e1ssico, we should just enjoy him for what he is: a street footballer trying to fit in on the big stage.",

      "body": "<p>London in the 1950s and 60s was an ebullient, technicolour time. But it was also an era during which most of monochrome Britain regarded \u201cthe Continent\u201d as a place of \u201crabies and intellectuals\u201d \u2013 as New York Times journalist Roger Cohen, raised in north London, put it in a book about his mother.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t care about rabies, and wanted to meet and emulate the intellectuals. When I was in my mid-teens, fuelled by the uprisings of 1968 in Paris and Prague, the world \u2013 my life \u2013 began when the ferry pulled out of Dover. Clutching my blue SNCF rail ticket, watching the cliffs recede with a sense of liberation, across the choppy Channel to dock in Calais, transferring to the Paris train, traversing the capital to Gare de Lyon and boarding an overnight iron horse to points south. Destinations: Provence, or Italy, or Austria, or the then-turbulent Basque Country and Spain.</p> <p>I was in a dotty band then, and wrote a silly rocker entitled Down to \u2019Spa\u00f1a which opened: \u201cWere you ever on that night train/Leaving Paris in the pouring rain?/To greet the light of Dordogne dawn-break/C\u2019mon move now, huh/Down to \u2019Spa\u00f1a.\u201d</p> <p>I relished those journeys, staring out at sulphur-yellow lamps illuminating stations and goods yards. As a (much better) John Cale song puts it: \u201cLooking out from here/At half past France.\u201d You\u2019d hand your passport to Italian customs at Chiasso on the Swiss border \u2013 this no longer happens, of course \u2013 then head across the Po valley, through cypress-strewn hills in Tuscany and Lazio and on to Rome, exhausted, happy, blinded by the light.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bd39f0205ac7f4b1cedcbe58865ee872bcb3cf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bd39f0205ac7f4b1cedcbe58865ee872bcb3cf0/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strikers at Gda\u0144sk shipyard in 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strikers at Gda\u0144sk shipyard in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lehtikuva/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Come the 1970s, most of my generation saw Europe on an Interrail pass, which afforded unlimited travel for a month. But I travelled \u00e0 la carte, loth to hurry around. I didn\u2019t want to leave a place until I\u2019d come to know it a bit, established myself with the clientele of a bar on some cobbled square, fully explored the museums and backstreets, perhaps even caught a football match.</p> <p>Apart from one summer in Chicago, this was how I spent every Easter and summer holiday, and every penny earned \u2013 to change into lire, francs, schillings or pesetas. Then came the moment to cast my first vote in 1975: over whether Britain should remain a member of the then European Economic Community. I had finally come \u201chome\u201d \u2013 and a decade or so later, I would have the words \u201cEuropean Community\u201d on my passport.</p> <p>I had worked hard on French at school, and took Italian lessons in the evenings, aware that I needed a toolkit of vocabulary and grammar. It\u2019s one thing to take a taxi from Seville\u2019s Santa Justa station and rely on the driver\u2019s pidgin English; it\u2019s quite another \u2013 and works out cheaper \u2013 to ask whether he is a <em>palangana</em> (supporter of Sevilla FC) or a <em>b\u00e9tico</em> (fan of rivals Real Betis, after the Roman name for the city\u2019s Guadalquivir river) and why.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"990fa2e2ee3d96d757d49b3ae231fdb08ef1545d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/990fa2e2ee3d96d757d49b3ae231fdb08ef1545d/236_76_978_587/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Vulliamy with Europe T-shirt\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Vulliamy \u2026 \u2018I travelled not to peep, browse or \u201choliday\u201d, but to conjoin European life\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Doak/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wore Kickers shoes, even though I disliked them, because they were originally made in France and looked \u2018\u201ccontinental\u201d. In the mid-70s I bought my first car \u2013 a Citr\u00f6en 2CV \u2013 in Brussels, so that the steering wheel would be on the \u201cwrong\u201d side in Britain. Two Renault 5s followed in the same vein \u2013 it was 20 years before I bought a car with a steering wheel on the British \u201cright\u201d side (a sturdy Volvo, still on the road, from the then editor of this newspaper).</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want to be a tourist; I wanted to be a European. A true \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d, as envisaged by Diogenes, who coined the term. For me, to be European is existential. It\u2019s about who and what we are. It defines a way of being, <em>sans fronti\u00e8res</em>, a state of curiosity about the way other people live and a burning need to partake in it, speak their tongues and understand not just their cultures but their quotidian modus vivendi: beliefs, music, football, food, firewater and wine.</p> <p>Of course, I arrived in the Americas and elsewhere, but that belonging was never on offer. Being European was, and I duly took my citizenship not from Britannia, but from the Phoenician princess, mother of King Minos of Crete \u2013 Europa \u2013 and the words \u201cEuropean Union\u201d on my passport.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2215aa2bc4a5040ff8bbc633593d74f56bdec0c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2215aa2bc4a5040ff8bbc633593d74f56bdec0c8/0_0_4724_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ikaria in Greece\u2019s North Aegean islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ikaria in Greece\u2019s North Aegean islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eirini Vourloumis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve travelled the far corners of Europe, and occasionally lived between them: from County Mayo\u2019s wild seaboard, to fishing villages along the Black Sea shore and Danube delta, and the rocks of Ikaria island in the south-east (though I don\u2019t claim to speak Romanian or Greek). From midnight sun and midday darkness in the Nordic north to the <em>passeggiata</em> beneath Mount Etna in Catania, Sicily, and the docks of Tarifa in Andalucia, from which a good outfielder could attempt a throw into Africa.</p> <p>We had wonderful but purposeful, busy and focused family holidays across Italy and France, scouring minor museums in small towns. In between were picnics with wine \u2013 my mother sketching people in cafes, my father etching church architecture. I got my first-ever job at the Vienna Staatsoper in January 1973 and enrolled at the University of Florence later that year. When friends hit the hippie trail east, I stayed in Italy, preferring to investigate Bologna and Milan. Except for exploring the Americas, I returned scores of times, mainly to Italy, France and Belgium and the Netherlands. I had a Swedish life for a while, for failed romantic reasons.</p> <p>I travelled not to \u201choliday\u201d, but to conjoin European life; I read newspapers, not guide books.

      "bodyText": "London in the 1950s and 60s was an ebullient, technicolour time. But it was also an era during which most of monochrome Britain regarded \u201cthe Continent\u201d as a place of \u201crabies and intellectuals\u201d \u2013 as New York Times journalist Roger Cohen, raised in north London, put it in a book about his mother. I didn\u2019t care about rabies, and wanted to meet and emulate the intellectuals. When I was in my mid-teens, fuelled by the uprisings of 1968 in Paris and Prague, the world \u2013 my life \u2013 began when the ferry pulled out of Dover. Clutching my blue SNCF rail ticket, watching the cliffs recede with a sense of liberation, across the choppy Channel to dock in Calais, transferring to the Paris train, traversing the capital to Gare de Lyon and boarding an overnight iron horse to points south. Destinations: Provence, or Italy, or Austria, or the then-turbulent Basque Country and Spain. I was in a dotty band then, and wrote a silly rocker entitled Down to \u2019Spa\u00f1a which opened: \u201cWere you ever on that night train/Leaving Paris in the pouring rain?/To greet the light of Dordogne dawn-break/C\u2019mon move now, huh/Down to \u2019Spa\u00f1a.\u201d I relished those journeys, staring out at sulphur-yellow lamps illuminating stations and goods yards. As a (much better) John Cale song puts it: \u201cLooking out from here/At half past France.\u201d You\u2019d hand your passport to Italian customs at Chiasso on the Swiss border \u2013 this no longer happens, of course \u2013 then head across the Po valley, through cypress-strewn hills in Tuscany and Lazio and on to Rome, exhausted, happy, blinded by the light. Come the 1970s, most of my generation saw Europe on an Interrail pass, which afforded unlimited travel for a month. But I travelled \u00e0 la carte, loth to hurry around. I didn\u2019t want to leave a place until I\u2019d come to know it a bit, established myself with the clientele of a bar on some cobbled square, fully explored the museums and backstreets, perhaps even caught a football match. Apart from one summer in Chicago, this was how I spent every Easter and summer holiday, and every penny earned \u2013 to change into lire, francs, schillings or pesetas. Then came the moment to cast my first vote in 1975: over whether Britain should remain a member of the then European Economic Community. I had finally come \u201chome\u201d \u2013 and a decade or so later, I would have the words \u201cEuropean Community\u201d on my passport. I had worked hard on French at school, and took Italian lessons in the evenings, aware that I needed a toolkit of vocabulary and grammar. It\u2019s one thing to take a taxi from Seville\u2019s Santa Justa station and rely on the driver\u2019s pidgin English; it\u2019s quite another \u2013 and works out cheaper \u2013 to ask whether he is a palangana (supporter of Sevilla FC) or a b\u00e9tico (fan of rivals Real Betis, after the Roman name for the city\u2019s Guadalquivir river) and why. I wore Kickers shoes, even though I disliked them, because they were originally made in France and looked \u2018\u201ccontinental\u201d. In the mid-70s I bought my first car \u2013 a Citr\u00f6en 2CV \u2013 in Brussels, so that the steering wheel would be on the \u201cwrong\u201d side in Britain. Two Renault 5s followed in the same vein \u2013 it was 20 years before I bought a car with a steering wheel on the British \u201cright\u201d side (a sturdy Volvo, still on the road, from the then editor of this newspaper). I didn\u2019t want to be a tourist; I wanted to be a European. A true \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d, as envisaged by Diogenes, who coined the term. For me, to be European is existential. It\u2019s about who and what we are. It defines a way of being, sans fronti\u00e8res, a state of curiosity about the way other people live and a burning need to partake in it, speak their tongues and understand not just their cultures but their quotidian modus vivendi: beliefs, music, football, food, firewater and wine. Of course, I arrived in the Americas and elsewhere, but that belonging was never on offer. Being European was, and I duly took my citizenship not from Britannia, but from the Phoenician princess, mother of King Minos of Crete \u2013 Europa \u2013 and the words \u201cEuropean Union\u201d on my passport. I\u2019ve travelled the far corners of Europe, and occasionally lived between them: from County Mayo\u2019s wild seaboard, to fishing villages along the Black Sea shore and Danube delta, and the rocks of Ikaria island in the south-east (though I don\u2019t claim to speak Romanian or Greek). From midnight sun and midday darkness in the Nordic north to the passeggiata beneath Mount Etna in Catania, Sicily, and the docks of Tarifa in Andalucia, from which a good outfielder could attempt a throw into Africa. We had wonderful but purposeful, busy and focused family holidays across Italy and France, scouring minor museums in small towns. In between were picnics with wine \u2013 my mother sketching people in cafes, my father etching church architecture. I got my first-ever job at the Vienna Staatsoper in January 1973 and enrolled at the University of Florence later that year. When friends hit the hippie trail east, I stayed in Italy, preferring to investigate Bologna and Milan. Except for exploring the Americas, I returned scores of times, mainly to Italy, France and Belgium and the Netherlands. I had a Swedish life for a while, for failed romantic reasons. I travelled not to \u201choliday\u201d, but to conjoin European life; I read newspapers, not guide books. I wanted no part in the fantasies of Brits in Tuscany or Provence; I travelled for work, for pleasure, for language, art and football, for the musky scent of old stone, light and landscape, love and love\u2019s wreckage \u2013 out of deferential but insatiable curiosity, to listen and learn. If a holiday, or money, ran out halfway along a valley, I\u2019d endeavour to return to the same place, and carry on up or downriver. In 1990, my dream came true, and I was posted to Rome by this newspaper. I didn\u2019t deliberately shun expats and the international press; I just preferred to hang out with Italian colleagues, friends, rogues and neighbours, watching AS Roma, Juventus and SSC Napoli, where I had a season ticket. By then something remarkable had happened to Europe. Back in 1981, my work had taken me to Poland, and early cracks in the communist edifice, following the 1980 strike at the Gdansk shipyard. Then, in 1989, I had found myself reporting from Berlin and Bucharest as Stalin\u2019s walls crumbled. The dream that Europe\u2019s reunification could be peaceful twisted into nightmare across former Yugoslavia, but there was this: how would one have replied to a whisper on the wind through the Croatian town of Vukovar, as I reported it being levelled into the dust of its own stone by Serbian artillery in 1991, predicting that within 30 years, this place would be in the EU, and London out? On Mayday 2004, I was in Warsaw with friends from Gdansk days celebrating Poland\u2019s accession to the EU \u2013 an affirmation as important to them as being part of the union was to me. Later that night, I was with a \u201cPolish noise\u201d band shattering rusty ironwork in a disused factory \u2013 and so began a relationship with that country too. The closest rapport, though, is genetic, and part of my life since I wrote a university thesis on the Irish Troubles in 1974, more interested in Belfast and Derry than any dreaming spires of Oxford. My bond to Ireland was bequeathed by two Irish grandmothers. Ireland is now Europe\u2019s most interestingly changed country \u2013 in large part because of the EU \u2013 and one of its youngest, demographically.

      "body": "<p>Despite being a sex blogger with more than 86,000 Instagram followers, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/oloni/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Oloni</a> isn\u2019t getting any. \u201cI have to be careful about who I\u2019m sleeping with,\u201d the 29-year-old influencer says with a laugh. \u201cIt has to be with someone really low-key. The last person I was having sex with, it went pear-shaped. So I\u2019m avoiding that right now.\u201d But the impact of celebrity status on her sex life doesn\u2019t seem to bother Oloni \u2013 real name Dami Olonisakin \u2013 too much. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like having sex with anyone at the moment.\u201d She cracks a wide smile. \u201cThere\u2019s no one worthy of me sleeping with them!\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re sitting in the plant-filled Ilford recording studio in which Olonisakin, Shakira Scott, 31, and Shani Jamilah, 23, record their no-holds-barred sex and relationships podcast, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/tt/podcast/laid-bare/id1443209267\" title=\"\">Laid Bare</a>. They eat sweets and catch up about their week \u2013 Olonisakin has been unwell, after partying too hard \u2013 as they prepare to record. \u201cI definitely want to do the TI thing,\u201d Olonisakin says. (In the week that I visit, US rapper TI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/07/ti-rapper-daughter-hymen-check-outrage\" title=\"\">made international headlines</a> after revealing that he takes his 18-year-old daughter to doctors for hymen checks, to ensure she is a virgin.) Scott squeals in agreement. She has views on TI.</p> <p>When the recording starts, it\u2019s outre fare. They talk about Scott\u2019s recent sexual encounter. \u201cI was in slut mode,\u201d she says. \u201cI put his balls in my face.\u201d But salaciousness aside, there\u2019s a serious purpose to their sex chat. When they get to talking about TI, the women speak passionately about how the concept of virginity is inherently misogynistic. \u201cIf you\u2019re with someone who thinks your value is based on your virginity, it\u2019s not,\u201d Olonisakin says. With customary bluntness, Scott agrees: \u201cFuck a hymen!\u201d</p> <p>If Laid Bare had a message, it would be this: respect yourself, be safe, and make sure you\u2019re enjoying sex at least as much as the person you\u2019re having sex with. It\u2019s a winning formula that has gone down well with their listeners, who are mostly women of colour. (Last year, a live recording in London was attended by 400 people.) It has also put the young women at the forefront of the UK\u2019s growing sex-positive movement.</p> <p>For the uninitiated, sex-positivity is characterised by a general spirit of openness towards sexuality in all its forms, along with an emphasis on sexual pleasure. Advocates encourage sex to be seen as something to be celebrated, rather than a source of shame, and provide practical, sometimes explicit guidance on how to experiment safely in the bedroom. Someone who is sex-positive would be equally accepting of a four-way polyamorous relationship, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM\" title=\"\">BDSM</a> casual sex, and garden-variety heterosexual monogamy: as long as everything happens between consenting adults, all expressions of human sexuality are permissible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sex-positivity prioritises consent and advocates against slut-shaming and sexist double standards</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the most part, sex-positive advocates congregate online: you\u2019ll find them documenting their sexcapades on blogs such as <a href=\"http://kayleighdanielsdated.com/\" title=\"\">Kayleigh Daniels Dated</a>, written from the perspective of a fictional woman who \u201cowns her sexuality\u201d; and <a href=\"https://bpb.opendns.com/a/casualsexproject.com/\" title=\"\">The Casual Sex Project</a>, which invites real people to share their one-night stands. The movement has spawned a number of influencers: not just Olonisakin, but also feminist pornographer Erika Lust; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thongria?lang=en\" title=\"\">Zo\u00eb Ligon</a>, owner of a Detroit sex shop and self-styled \u201cDuchess of Dildos\u201d; and Vogue columnist Karley Sciortino, author of sex blog <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slutever\" title=\"\">Slutever</a>. Together, these young women have an enormous reach: Ligon has 277,000 Instagram followers, while a video Sciortino made for the website Vice has had more than 50m YouTube views.</p> <p>It\u2019s not surprising that, frustrated by the dearth of high-quality sex education in British schools (it will become a compulsory part of the curriculum only from this September), young people are looking online for answers. This, after all, is a generation that grew up watching porn on their smartphones on the bus to school, before sliding into sexting in their teens. A predominantly female-led movement (although there are high-profile male LGBTQ+ YouTubers, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTfkJcsP0M-3Q788U5sZKw\" title=\"\">Riyadh Khalaf</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/eatgaylove/about\" title=\"\">Calum McSwiggan</a>), sex-positivity also intersects with contemporary feminism by prioritising consent, and educating people about healthy, non-coercive relationships, as well as advocating against slut-shaming and sexist double standards.</p> <p>As with any emerging youth movement, though, there\u2019s been a pushback. Sex-positive influencers have found themselves on the frontline of a vicious globalised culture war with religious and conservative groups, which favour an abstinence-based, non-LGBTQ+-inclusive approach that has less in common with Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80197526\" title=\"\">Sex Education</a> and more with the hapless gym teacher satirised in Tina Fey\u2019s 2004 film Mean Girls: \u201cDon\u2019t have sex, because you will get pregnant and die!\u201d exhorts Coach Carr. \u201cDon\u2019t have sex in the missionary position, don\u2019t have sex standing up, just don\u2019t do it!\u201d</p> <p>In the US, rightwing Christian bloggers burned copies of Teen Vogue after the magazine published an anal sex guide by sex educator Gigi Engle in 2017. (\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d Engle remembers of the furore. \u201cTo have so many people coming after me over a piece of educational material.\u201d) Often, so-called family values groups are the hammer used to crack the sex-positive walnut. One Million Moms is the best-known: in December 2019 it called for a boycott of the Hallmark Channel over an ad depicting a same-sex couple. Such groups often wage ferocious state-level campaigns to block sex-positive sex education in classrooms.</p> <p>These attitudes are not unique to the US. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/04/birmingham-school-stops-lgbt-lessons-after-parent-protests\" title=\"\">parents at one Birmingham primary school</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/04/birmingham-school-stops-lgbt-lessons-after-parent-protests\" title=\"\"> reacted with fury</a> in May 2019 after its headteacher decided to teach about LGBT relationships to its pupils, the majority of whom were from Muslim families. The programme was amended, but tensions between teachers and parents are ongoing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76caec9656a50dc422af721c7d5173839267570c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76caec9656a50dc422af721c7d5173839267570c/0_382_5725_3435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sex blogger Dami Olonisakin of no-holds-barred podcast Laid Bare, and BBC Three dating show My Mate\u2019s A Bad Date\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you\u2019re with someone who thinks your value is based on your virginity, it\u2019s not\u2019: sex blogger Dami Olonisakin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sex-positive influencers are also facing a crackdown from legislators and internet platforms. In the UK, the digital economy bill \u2013 bitterly opposed by independent porn creators for its age-verification requirements, which they view as draconian \u2013 passed into law in 2017. Platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, more usually under fire for failing to police extreme content, have been accused of censoring sex-positive influencers, demonetising their channels, or limiting their visibility. Sex educators on Instagram have found their accounts suspended, or even deleted, for violating the US\u2019s controversial Sesta-Fosta legislation (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act/Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act).</p> <p>There are legitimate questions to be asked of the sex-positive movement. Should its influencers be giving public health advice without being qualified to do so? Is there a danger that they\u2019re encouraging curious-minded young people to experiment sexually before they\u2019re ready? In other words, is it possible to be <em>too</em> positive about sex?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"horizontal rule\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">horizontal rule</a> </figure>  <p><strong>\u201cDo you want your tea in a penis mug or a boob mug?\u201d</strong> Reed Amber asks, after answering the door to her London home in fluffy slippers and leather trousers. (I opt for boobs.) I\u2019ve come to sit in with Amber, 29, and Florence Barkway, 28, as they record the latest video for their sex-positive YouTube channel Come Curious. The topic of the week? Fingering.</p> <p>We decamp to Amber\u2019s bedroom, where lights have been set up on either side of the bed. On the bedside table is a bottle of lubricant and a large vibrator. Both women arrange themselves under the duvet, occasionally pausing to stretch. \u201cSitting like this really hurts your legs,\u201d explains Barkway, who is wearing a T-shirt that reads \u201cLove is Strange\u201d.</p> <p>After checking that the camera facing the bed is working, the women begin filming. \u201cHi guys! Today we\u2019re going to be talking about fingering.\u201d They wave their fingers in the air. What follows is a mixture of explicit sex advice (the women mime different fingering techniques) told in a big-sisterly, accessible way. I feel as if I\u2019m eavesdropping on a chat between two women in neighbouring nightclub toilet cubicles. It\u2019s not for everyone: the women channel the peppy optimism and over-the-top, campy tone that has become de rigueur for teen-focused YouTube channels, and can be jarring for older viewers. But their message is resonating with an audience of 112,000 YouTube subscribers, who turn to them for advice on blowjobs (at 2.4m views, their most-watched video), nipple play (1.5m views), and to find out what it\u2019s really like on a porn set (2.1m views).</p> <p>\u201cBreaking stigma is a big part of what we do,\u201d Barkway says. \u201cMaking people feel less abnormal for having fetishes or desires.\u201d After she and Amber posted a video titled \u201cWe BOTH have HERPES\u201d, they were inundated with responses from viewers thanking them for tackling the taboo around the sexually transmitted infection. Of course, they aren\u2019t motivated solely by altruism: as the movement has grown, being a sex-positive influencer has become a viable career \u2013 Olonisakin was recently tapped to front the BBC Three dating show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p07t7yz2/my-mates-a-bad-date\" title=\"\">My Mate\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p07t7yz2/my-mates-a-bad-date\" title=\"\">a Bad Date</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are the last resort for\u00a0young people, when their parents and teachers don\u2019t fill the\u00a0gaps</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Are they qualified to give sex advice to impressionable teens? Amber and Barkway admit they aren\u2019t trained public health experts, but they are diligent in their preparation: before uploading their herpes video, they spent hours pulling together the latest research, which they put online in their video notes. Most experts agree that, on balance, it\u2019s better that young people learn about sex from well-meaning influencers rather than porn. \u201cI welcome this community,\u201d says Amanda Mason-Jones, a senior lecturer in global public health at the University of York. \u201cThey promote sex and intimacy as something positive, and not something to be ashamed of.\u201d</p> <p>And besides, if sex-positive influencers simply wanted to be famous, there are easier routes. Come Curious has received some sponsorship from Durex, but brings in a fraction of the remuneration YouTubers with comparable followings making nonexplicit content would expect; most brands don\u2019t like to have their ads placed alongside sex content. Both women have full-time jobs (Amber as a webcam sex worker, Barkway as a video director) although they hope eventually to make Come Curious their main source of income.</p> <p>Of course, it would be ideal if young people learned about sex from their families, rather than the pseudo big sisters represented by Amber and Barkway. But that\u2019s not possible for the great majority of their audience. Many of their fans come from conservative or religious households where heterosexual sex, let alone being LGBTQ+, is taboo. They tell me that every week they receive emails and Instagram DMs from vulnerable young people, including sexual abuse survivors, and do their best to respond. The Laid Bare podcasters also have an email address for listeners to send their queries. Providing nonjudgmental sex education is particularly important to them, because evidence shows that STI rates are higher, and go undiagnosed for longer, in black-African communities. \u201cLaid Bare is about having a forum where you can feel free,\u201d Jamilah says. \u201cBecause normally, in black communities, it\u2019s taboo to talk about sex. You keep it private.\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to hear from some of the educators\u2019 fans, so Come Curious put a call out over Instagram. I talk to Grace Halksworth, a 19-year-old student from Surrey, who discovered the channel in 2018, and talks about its presenters reverentially. \u201cI like how raw and open they are,\u201d says Halksworth, who credits online vloggers with changing her attitude to sex. \u201cAll the sex education I\u2019ve had, I felt as if they were stumbling around the real words,\u201d she adds, characterising her Catholic secondary school as \u201cshockingly bad\u201d. She goes on: \u201cThey told you the gist of what sex is, but not how to stay safe. They just said, don\u2019t do it, basically.\u201d Three students in her year got pregnant between the ages of 15 and 16. \u201cMost people were doing it,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe if they\u2019d taught us to be safe, the pregnancies wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70b91a2919b71db9e9348d0bcbe91475ed711b0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70b91a2919b71db9e9348d0bcbe91475ed711b0b/0_1096_3815_2289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sex educators Sophie Whitehead (on left, in green top) and Amelia Jenkinson of Sexplain, in January 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Who can give me an example of verbal consent?\u2019: school sex educators Sophie Whitehead (left) and Amelia Jenkinson of Sexplain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Halksworth tells me that she felt shamed by her peers for expressing sexual desire at school, and experienced bullying after her classmates found out she watched porn. Frustrated with these attitudes, she found solace in the sex-positive community. \u201cI went down a black hole and ended up watching all the Come Curious videos in one go,\u201d Halksworth laughs. Her experience isn\u2019t uncommon, says Amber: \u201cWe are the last resort for young people, when their parents and teachers don\u2019t fill the gaps.\u201d</p> <p>Halksworth credits sex-positivity with helping her discover sexual pleasure. \u201cI love watching videos about the female orgasm, and how you shouldn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s only the man who can finish.\u201d She says she internalised so much shame around female sexual pleasure that she found herself in a 10-month relationship during which she never orgasmed: \u201cFor that whole time, he never pleasured me \u2013 and I thought that was normal.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Halksworth whether she thinks young people are mostly learning about sex from porn. \u201cYes, 100%,\u201d she responds quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve had people say, \u2018You weren\u2019t moaning much, was it OK?\u2019 I told them that just because that\u2019s how people act in porn doesn\u2019t mean it has to be like that. They were stunned.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"horizontal rule\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">horizontal rule</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Educators from <a href=\"https://sexplain.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Sexplain</a>,</strong> an organisation running sex-positive workshops at schools and universities, are working to ensure that children in British classrooms aren\u2019t reduced to learning about sex from porn. I\u2019m tagging along for the day as they teach a sex-positive approach (no condoms on bananas here) at Sir Robert Woodard academy, a mixed secondary school in Lancing, West Sussex.</p> <p>\u201cWho can give me an example of verbal consent?\u201d Sexplain educator Sophie Whitehead asks of the classroom. Tumbleweed. A table of three girls sitting near me shift in their seats. Eventually, one girl breaks the silence. \u201cYeah... baby?\u201d she volunteers. Whitehead beams. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d She explains how to spot signs of nonverbal nonconsent, such as someone\u2019s body stiffening, or them pulling away from you. \u201cThe most important thing to remember is that consent is ongoing,\u201d Whitehead says, drawing out the word for emphasis. \u201cThe person you\u2019re with has the right to change their mind.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At a year 10 assembly, we cover healthy relationships, coercive control and how to break up respectfully</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the most part, it\u2019s sedate stuff. But when the teens split into groups to write down examples of verbal consent, things turn explicit. \u201cI\u2019m going to put my dick in you,\u201d notes one table of boys, carefully. \u201cFuck me, daddy.\u201d Whitehead is nonplussed, and asks: \u201cWhere do you hear people say these things?\u201d The teens bow their heads. \u201cPorn isn\u2019t bad,\u201d Whitehead says, \u201cbut it can make us think that sex should be different from how it is in real life.\u201d</p> <p>We head into a year 10 assembly, led by Sexplain co-founder Amelia Jenkinson. In the front row, a group of boys competitively manspread and occasionally burst into overloud laughter at obscure jokes. There is a fug of hormones and teenage bravado. Still, we cover important ground: coercive control, healthy relationships, and how to break up with someone in a respectful way.</p> <p>After the assembly, Jenkinson and I catch up. \u201cThat was a fairly typical session,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard in a big setting like this.\u201d I don\u2019t envy the Sexplain educators, who sometimes find school staff will undermine the message they\u2019re trying to get across. \u201cTeachers say: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t ever send a naked photograph in the first place,\u2019\u201d Jenkinson sighs. These attitudes aren\u2019t helpful, she thinks, because they\u2019re not realistic: teens will send nude photographs regardless of whether adults tell them not to, and shaming them for doing so might discourage victims of revenge pornography from coming forward. (She emphasises that this wasn\u2019t an issue at Sir Robert Woodard.)</p> <p>The sex education I\u2019ve seen today hasn\u2019t been perfect. Some of the more rambunctious boys in the year 10 assembly had to be taken out by teachers, and the educational video Sexplain used was outdated \u2013 the acting was stilted, and the performers were clearly adults in their mid-20s dressed in school uniforms, rather than teens. But in attempting to correct the false expectations about sex and relationships that young people have picked up from porn, educators are doing a valiant job. Attempting to stop young people from watching porn is like patching a gunshot wound with a plaster: it won\u2019t work. And the same could be said of abstinence-based approaches to sex education. \u201cThey are known to be ineffective,\u201d says public health lecturer Mason-Jones. \u201cThey essentially withhold information, are often heteronormative, and can be stigmatising for young people.\u201d</p> <p>There are already indications that a greater openness about sex is having a positive effect: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/18/how-uk-halved-teenage-pregnancy-rate-public-health-strategy\" title=\"\">teen pregnancy rates plummeted in the UK</a> and the US in the noughties. And reactionaries who are worried that sex education leads to promiscuity might be chastened to know that young people seem to be having <em>less</em> sex than before. As parents tie themselves in knots about what their children may or may not be doing, their progeny are getting on with things \u2013 or not getting on with things, depending on how you look at it.</p> <p>Leaving Sir Robert Woodard, as we thread through bustling corridors full of students eating pizza and talking in that indecipherable slang known only to teenagers, Jenkinson makes the stakes clear. \u201cIf one person is able to identify that they\u2019re in an unhealthy relationship, and seek help because of it, that\u2019s success for us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"horizontal rule\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">horizontal rule</a> </figure>  <h2>How to talk to young people about sex, by YouTubers Come Curious</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eaae8f825e22806a81d9c7f60902a706c9268a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eaae8f825e22806a81d9c7f60902a706c9268a3/1041_580_3449_2070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>When should I have the birds and the bees chat with my kids?<br></strong>\u201cDon\u2019t wait,\u201d Florence Barkway says. \u201cIf you suddenly have the chat one day, it\u2019s going to be awkward.

The last person I was having sex with, it went pear-shaped. So I\u2019m avoiding that right now.\u201d But the impact of celebrity status on her sex life doesn\u2019t seem to bother Oloni \u2013 real name Dami Olonisakin \u2013 too much. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like having sex with anyone at the moment.\u201d She cracks a wide smile. \u201cThere\u2019s no one worthy of me sleeping with them!\u201d We\u2019re sitting in the plant-filled Ilford recording studio in which Olonisakin, Shakira Scott, 31, and Shani Jamilah, 23, record their no-holds-barred sex and relationships podcast, Laid Bare. They eat sweets and catch up about their week \u2013 Olonisakin has been unwell, after partying too hard \u2013 as they prepare to record. \u201cI definitely want to do the TI thing,\u201d Olonisakin says. (In the week that I visit, US rapper TI made international headlines after revealing that he takes his 18-year-old daughter to doctors for hymen checks, to ensure she is a virgin.) Scott squeals in agreement. She has views on TI. When the recording starts, it\u2019s outre fare. They talk about Scott\u2019s recent sexual encounter. \u201cI was in slut mode,\u201d she says. \u201cI put his balls in my face.\u201d But salaciousness aside, there\u2019s a serious purpose to their sex chat. When they get to talking about TI, the women speak passionately about how the concept of virginity is inherently misogynistic. \u201cIf you\u2019re with someone who thinks your value is based on your virginity, it\u2019s not,\u201d Olonisakin says. With customary bluntness, Scott agrees: \u201cFuck a hymen!\u201d If Laid Bare had a message, it would be this: respect yourself, be safe, and make sure you\u2019re enjoying sex at least as much as the person you\u2019re having sex with. It\u2019s a winning formula that has gone down well with their listeners, who are mostly women of colour. (Last year, a live recording in London was attended by 400 people.) It has also put the young women at the forefront of the UK\u2019s growing sex-positive movement. For the uninitiated, sex-positivity is characterised by a general spirit of openness towards sexuality in all its forms, along with an emphasis on sexual pleasure. Advocates encourage sex to be seen as something to be celebrated, rather than a source of shame, and provide practical, sometimes explicit guidance on how to experiment safely in the bedroom. Someone who is sex-positive would be equally accepting of a four-way polyamorous relationship, BDSM casual sex, and garden-variety heterosexual monogamy: as long as everything happens between consenting adults, all expressions of human sexuality are permissible. For the most part, sex-positive advocates congregate online: you\u2019ll find them documenting their sexcapades on blogs such as Kayleigh Daniels Dated, written from the perspective of a fictional woman who \u201cowns her sexuality\u201d; and The Casual Sex Project, which invites real people to share their one-night stands. The movement has spawned a number of influencers: not just Olonisakin, but also feminist pornographer Erika Lust; Zo\u00eb Ligon, owner of a Detroit sex shop and self-styled \u201cDuchess of Dildos\u201d; and Vogue columnist Karley Sciortino, author of sex blog Slutever. Together, these young women have an enormous reach: Ligon has 277,000 Instagram followers, while a video Sciortino made for the website Vice has had more than 50m YouTube views. It\u2019s not surprising that, frustrated by the dearth of high-quality sex education in British schools (it will become a compulsory part of the curriculum only from this September), young people are looking online for answers. This, after all, is a generation that grew up watching porn on their smartphones on the bus to school, before sliding into sexting in their teens. A predominantly female-led movement (although there are high-profile male LGBTQ+ YouTubers, such as Riyadh Khalaf and Calum McSwiggan), sex-positivity also intersects with contemporary feminism by prioritising consent, and educating people about healthy, non-coercive relationships, as well as advocating against slut-shaming and sexist double standards. As with any emerging youth movement, though, there\u2019s been a pushback. Sex-positive influencers have found themselves on the frontline of a vicious globalised culture war with religious and conservative groups, which favour an abstinence-based, non-LGBTQ+-inclusive approach that has less in common with Netflix\u2019s Sex Education and more with the hapless gym teacher satirised in Tina Fey\u2019s 2004 film Mean Girls: \u201cDon\u2019t have sex, because you will get pregnant and die!\u201d exhorts Coach Carr. \u201cDon\u2019t have sex in the missionary position, don\u2019t have sex standing up, just don\u2019t do it!\u201d In the US, rightwing Christian bloggers burned copies of Teen Vogue after the magazine published an anal sex guide by sex educator Gigi Engle in 2017. (\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d Engle remembers of the furore. \u201cTo have so many people coming after me over a piece of educational material.\u201d) Often, so-called family values groups are the hammer used to crack the sex-positive walnut. One Million Moms is the best-known: in December 2019 it called for a boycott of the Hallmark Channel over an ad depicting a same-sex couple. Such groups often wage ferocious state-level campaigns to block sex-positive sex education in classrooms. These attitudes are not unique to the US. In the UK, parents at one Birmingham primary school reacted with fury in May 2019 after its headteacher decided to teach about LGBT relationships to its pupils, the majority of whom were from Muslim families. The programme was amended, but tensions between teachers and parents are ongoing. Sex-positive influencers are also facing a crackdown from legislators and internet platforms. In the UK, the digital economy bill \u2013 bitterly opposed by independent porn creators for its age-verification requirements, which they view as draconian \u2013 passed into law in 2017. Platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, more usually under fire for failing to police extreme content, have been accused of censoring sex-positive influencers, demonetising their channels, or limiting their visibility. Sex educators on Instagram have found their accounts suspended, or even deleted, for violating the US\u2019s controversial Sesta-Fosta legislation (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act/Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act). There are legitimate questions to be asked of the sex-positive movement. Should its influencers be giving public health advice without being qualified to do so? Is there a danger that they\u2019re encouraging curious-minded young people to experiment sexually before they\u2019re ready? In other words, is it possible to be too positive about sex? \u201cDo you want your tea in a penis mug or a boob mug?\u201d Reed Amber asks, after answering the door to her London home in fluffy slippers and leather trousers. (I opt for boobs.) I\u2019ve come to sit in with Amber, 29, and Florence Barkway, 28, as they record the latest video for their sex-positive YouTube channel Come Curious. The topic of the week? Fingering. We decamp to Amber\u2019s bedroom, where lights have been set up on either side of the bed. On the bedside table is a bottle of lubricant and a large vibrator. Both women arrange themselves under the duvet, occasionally pausing to stretch. \u201cSitting like this really hurts your legs,\u201d explains Barkway, who is wearing a T-shirt that reads \u201cLove is Strange\u201d. After checking that the camera facing the bed is working, the women begin filming. \u201cHi guys! Today we\u2019re going to be talking about fingering.\u201d They wave their fingers in the air. What follows is a mixture of explicit sex advice (the women mime different fingering techniques) told in a big-sisterly, accessible way. I feel as if I\u2019m eavesdropping on a chat between two women in neighbouring nightclub toilet cubicles. It\u2019s not for everyone: the women channel the peppy optimism and over-the-top, campy tone that has become de rigueur for teen-focused YouTube channels, and can be jarring for older viewers. But their message is resonating with an audience of 112,000 YouTube subscribers, who turn to them for advice on blowjobs (at 2.4m views, their most-watched video), nipple play (1.5m views), and to find out what it\u2019s really like on a porn set (2.1m views). \u201cBreaking stigma is a big part of what we do,\u201d Barkway says. \u201cMaking people feel less abnormal for having fetishes or desires.\u201d After she and Amber posted a video titled \u201cWe BOTH have HERPES\u201d, they were inundated with responses from viewers thanking them for tackling the taboo around the sexually transmitted infection. Of course, they aren\u2019t motivated solely by altruism: as the movement has grown, being a sex-positive influencer has become a viable career \u2013 Olonisakin was recently tapped to front the BBC Three dating show My Mate\u2019s a Bad Date. Are they qualified to give sex advice to impressionable teens? Amber and Barkway admit they aren\u2019t trained public health experts, but they are diligent in their preparation: before uploading their herpes video, they spent hours pulling together the latest research, which they put online in their video notes. Most experts agree that, on balance, it\u2019s better that young people learn about sex from well-meaning influencers rather than porn. \u201cI welcome this community,\u201d says Amanda Mason-Jones, a senior lecturer in global public health at the University of York. \u201cThey promote sex and intimacy as something positive, and not something to be ashamed of.\u201d And besides, if sex-positive influencers simply wanted to be famous, there are easier routes. Come Curious has received some sponsorship from Durex, but brings in a fraction of the remuneration YouTubers with comparable followings making nonexplicit content would expect; most brands don\u2019t like to have their ads placed alongside sex content. Both women have full-time jobs (Amber as a webcam sex worker, Barkway as a video director) although they hope eventually to make Come Curious their main source of income. Of course, it would be ideal if young people learned about sex from their families, rather than the pseudo big sisters represented by Amber and Barkway. But that\u2019s not possible for the great majority of their audience. Many of their fans come from conservative or religious households where heterosexual sex, let alone being LGBTQ+, is taboo. They tell me that every week they receive emails and Instagram DMs from vulnerable young people, including sexual abuse survivors, and do their best to respond. The Laid Bare podcasters also have an email address for listeners to send their queries. Providing nonjudgmental sex education is particularly important to them, because evidence shows that STI rates are higher, and go undiagnosed for longer, in black-African communities. \u201cLaid Bare is about having a forum where you can feel free,\u201d Jamilah says. \u201cBecause normally, in black communities, it\u2019s taboo to talk about sex. You keep it private.\u201d I wanted to hear from some of the educators\u2019 fans, so Come Curious put a call out over Instagram. I talk to Grace Halksworth, a 19-year-old student from Surrey, who discovered the channel in 2018, and talks about its presenters reverentially. \u201cI like how raw and open they are,\u201d says Halksworth, who credits online vloggers with changing her attitude to sex. \u201cAll the sex education I\u2019ve had, I felt as if they were stumbling around the real words,\u201d she adds, characterising her Catholic secondary school as \u201cshockingly bad\u201d. She goes on: \u201cThey told you the gist of what sex is, but not how to stay safe. They just said, don\u2019t do it, basically.\u201d Three students in her year got pregnant between the ages of 15 and 16. \u201cMost people were doing it,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe if they\u2019d taught us to be safe, the pregnancies wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Halksworth tells me that she felt shamed by her peers for expressing sexual desire at school, and experienced bullying after her classmates found out she watched porn. Frustrated with these attitudes, she found solace in the sex-positive community. \u201cI went down a black hole and ended up watching all the Come Curious videos in one go,\u201d Halksworth laughs. Her experience isn\u2019t uncommon, says Amber: \u201cWe are the last resort for young people, when their parents and teachers don\u2019t fill the gaps.\u201d Halksworth credits sex-positivity with helping her discover sexual pleasure. \u201cI love watching videos about the female orgasm, and how you shouldn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s only the man who can finish.\u201d She says she internalised so much shame around female sexual pleasure that she found herself in a 10-month relationship during which she never orgasmed: \u201cFor that whole time, he never pleasured me \u2013 and I thought that was normal.\u201d I ask Halksworth whether she thinks young people are mostly learning about sex from porn. \u201cYes, 100%,\u201d she responds quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve had people say, \u2018You weren\u2019t moaning much, was it OK?\u2019 I told them that just because that\u2019s how people act in porn doesn\u2019t mean it has to be like that. They were stunned.\u201d Educators from Sexplain, an organisation running sex-positive workshops at schools and universities, are working to ensure that children in British classrooms aren\u2019t reduced to learning about sex from porn. I\u2019m tagging along for the day as they teach a sex-positive approach (no condoms on bananas here) at Sir Robert Woodard academy, a mixed secondary school in Lancing, West Sussex. \u201cWho can give me an example of verbal consent?\u201d Sexplain educator Sophie Whitehead asks of the classroom. Tumbleweed. A table of three girls sitting near me shift in their seats. Eventually, one girl breaks the silence. \u201cYeah... baby?\u201d she volunteers. Whitehead beams. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d She explains how to spot signs of nonverbal nonconsent, such as someone\u2019s body stiffening, or them pulling away from you. \u201cThe most important thing to remember is that consent is ongoing,\u201d Whitehead says, drawing out the word for emphasis. \u201cThe person you\u2019re with has the right to change their mind.\u201d For the most part, it\u2019s sedate stuff. But when the teens split into groups to write down examples of verbal consent, things turn explicit. \u201cI\u2019m going to put my dick in you,\u201d notes one table of boys, carefully. \u201cFuck me, daddy.\u201d Whitehead is nonplussed, and asks: \u201cWhere do you hear people say these things?\u201d The teens bow their heads. \u201cPorn isn\u2019t bad,\u201d Whitehead says, \u201cbut it can make us think that sex should be different from how it is in real life.\u201d We head into a year 10 assembly, led by Sexplain co-founder Amelia Jenkinson. In the front row, a group of boys competitively manspread and occasionally burst into overloud laughter at obscure jokes. There is a fug of hormones and teenage bravado. Still, we cover important ground: coercive control, healthy relationships, and how to break up with someone in a respectful way. After the assembly, Jenkinson and I catch up. \u201cThat was a fairly typical session,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard in a big setting like this.\u201d I don\u2019t envy the Sexplain educators, who sometimes find school staff will undermine the message they\u2019re trying to get across. \u201cTeachers say: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t ever send a naked photograph in the first place,\u2019\u201d Jenkinson sighs. These attitudes aren\u2019t helpful, she thinks, because they\u2019re not realistic: teens will send nude photographs regardless of whether adults tell them not to, and shaming them for doing so might discourage victims of revenge pornography from coming forward. (She emphasises that this wasn\u2019t an issue at Sir Robert Woodard.) The sex education I\u2019ve seen today hasn\u2019t been perfect. Some of the more rambunctious boys in the year 10 assembly had to be taken out by teachers, and the educational video Sexplain used was outdated \u2013 the acting was stilted, and the performers were clearly adults in their mid-20s dressed in school uniforms, rather than teens. But in attempting to correct the false expectations about sex and relationships that young people have picked up from porn, educators are doing a valiant job. Attempting to stop young people from watching porn is like patching a gunshot wound with a plaster: it won\u2019t work. And the same could be said of abstinence-based approaches to sex education. \u201cThey are known to be ineffective,\u201d says public health lecturer Mason-Jones. \u201cThey essentially withhold information, are often heteronormative, and can be stigmatising for young people.\u201d There are already indications that a greater openness about sex is having a positive effect: teen pregnancy rates plummeted in the UK and the US in the noughties. And reactionaries who are worried that sex education leads to promiscuity might be chastened to know that young people seem to be having less sex than before. As parents tie themselves in knots about what their children may or may not be doing, their progeny are getting on with things \u2013 or not getting on with things, depending on how you look at it. Leaving Sir Robert Woodard, as we thread through bustling corridors full of students eating pizza and talking in that indecipherable slang known only to teenagers, Jenkinson makes the stakes clear. \u201cIf one person is able to identify that they\u2019re in an unhealthy relationship, and seek help because of it, that\u2019s success for us.\u201d How to talk to young people about sex, by YouTubers Come Curious When should I have the birds and the bees chat with my kids? \u201cDon\u2019t wait,\u201d Florence Barkway says. \u201cIf you suddenly have the chat one day, it\u2019s going to be awkward. Have conversations about sex, genitals, and bodily functions from an early age. The worst thing you can do is wait until they bring home a partner and say, \u2018Don\u2019t forget to use a condom!\u2019\u201d How should I talk about sex with my children? \u201cNever say anything that would cause them to feel shame or guilt around sex,\u201d Barkway says. \u201cYou can give children hang-ups that will follow them into their adult lives. So instead of saying, \u2018Watching porn is dirty,\u2019 say, \u2018If you watch porn, understand it isn\u2019t real.\u2019\u201d What if they ask me something I don\u2019t know how to answer? \u201cBe honest,\u201d Reed Amber says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know the answer to something, say, \u2018I\u2019m not sure \u2013 why don\u2019t we find out together?\u2019\u201d Amber suggests seeking out sex-positive educators online: \u201cErika Lust has a great website for parents looking to talk to their children about porn, while the Family Planning Association\u2019s SexWise is also a good online resource.\u201d What should I teach my kids about sex? \u201cAlways talk about consent,\u201d Amber says. \u201cIf they have an aunt who always kisses them on the cheek, for example, and that makes them uncomfortable, say: \u2018It\u2019s OK to tell them you don\u2019t like that.\u2019 In future, they\u2019ll have the confidence to say no in situations where they feel uncomfortable.\u201d What should I never do? \u201cDon\u2019t snoop in a teenager\u2019s diary or bedroom,\u201d Amber says. \u201cIf they know they can tell you anything about their sex life without shame or judgment, they\u2019re more likely to confide in you when they become sexually active.\u201d \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication). \u2022 This article was amended on 10 February 2020.

Already the team have had two games postponed, one at their home ground in Southport. There have been seven WSL games pushed back so far. Everton are waiting to move to Walton Hall Park. \u201cAt the start of the season we thought we\u2019d be in there by now. It\u2019s been delayed for a number of reasons,\u201d says Kirk. \u201cA lot of them out of our control, but that\u2019s very close now.\u201d But this period of turf trouble has put the quick professionalisation of the league in context. \u201cI think this has been the worst season since they changed it back to a winter league; it\u2019s not ideal,\u201d says Kirk. \u201cBut it\u2019s a nice little reality check for us, of where the women\u2019s game is and where we still need to improve. We\u2019re talking about VAR and goalline technology but let\u2019s get the pitches up to spec first.\u201d",

As we now know, I was not the first woman to have to hide from Harvey in a bathroom. A few years later, Weinstein marked Oscars day by writing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/02/bafta-afterparty-hadley-freeman-films-end\" title=\"\">article about me</a> for this paper, complaining that I didn\u2019t appreciate his Baftas party enough: \u201cNext time Hadley Freeman comes to one of our parties she should relax, loosen up, have a glass of champagne and be sure to stay the whole night and really, truly\u2026 enjoy herself.\u201d Not creepy at all, Harv!

The journey is a search for an ancestral home, something forsaken \u2013 the \u201clacustrine realm\u201d her grandmother Anastasia left as a young woman and felt agonisingly, debilitatingly drawn back to. In that sense, <em>To the Lake</em> is a classic account of the exile (albeit at a remove) seeking completion through return. \u201cGeography shapes history \u2013 we generally accept this as a fact,\u201d Kassabova writes in her introduction. \u201cBut we don\u2019t often explore how families digest big historio-geographies, how these sculpt our inner landscape.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kassabova has never been interested in derring-do; the perils are of the psychic variety, and they are genuine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The lakes lie less than six miles apart, separated by the limestone Gali\u010dica mountains, with Ohrid split between the territories of Albania and North Macedonia, while the borders of those two countries meet that of Greece in the middle of Lake Prespa (another pinpoint). Patrimonies and sovereignties continue to shift. Towards the end of the book\u2019s writing, in early 2019, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was renamed the Republic of North Macedonia by an agreement signed beside \u2013 and named after \u2013 Lake Prespa. On a map, the national boundaries that lattice the region appear no more considerate of topography than the cracks in a plate are of the underlying pattern. Borders and their intrinsic, deforming violence remain Kassabova\u2019s subject. But in this book she goes further, tracing the intrusion of those cracks deeper into the souls and psyches of successive generations, herself included.</p> <p>Chronic wanderlust predates her birth, she tells us (\u201cin the womb I revolved ceaselessly\u201d); it is a syndrome she associates with a history of emigration on her mother\u2019s side of the family, culminating in her own migrations from Bulgaria to New Zealand to the Scottish Highlands. Of her late grandmother in Bulgaria she remembers wondering: \u201cHow did she come to be here (urban and incomplete), yet often talked of there (watery and complete)\u201d? Connected to this incompleteness is a matrilineal history of illness \u2013 \u201cThe Pain\u201d \u2013 that rises in each generation \u201clike a dark wave\u201d. \u201cSomething pulled us down,\u201d she writes, \u201cand compelled us to be unwell.\u201d As a search for a kind of water cure, the book might find a place alongside others about recovery through journey-making \u2013 Jenny Diski\u2019s <em>Skating to Antarctica</em>, for instance, or Guy Stagg\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/07/crossway-guy-stagg-review-walk-jerusalem\" title=\"\"><em>The Crossway</em></a>. And yet while <em>To the Lake</em> may be a quest narrative, the book\u2019s subject is not the author, nor is its objective personal transformation: \u201cUnless we become aware of how we carry our own legacies,\u201d she explains, \u201cwe too may become unwitting agents of destruction.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69a1661404c92896b9001fde93dcc9deb6c7db38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69a1661404c92896b9001fde93dcc9deb6c7db38/0_338_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The church of St John of Kaneo on Lake Ohrid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The lakes maintain their vigil.\u2019 Church of St John of Kaneo near Ohrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arriving in the Macedonian resort of Ohrid, on the lake of the same name, Kassabova circles the city and the water less like a surveyor than someone scanning the ground for something she dropped on an earlier visit. \u201cLake Ohrid is one of those places on the earth that make you feel as if something fateful awaits you. As if you were always meant to come and you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken you so long.\u201d In Ohrid itself, her grandmother\u2019s home city, \u201call the men looked like my cousins\u201d. \u201cWhose are you?\u201d is the recurring, vital question \u2013 to which family do you belong? Almost everyone she meets is related to her or remembers some close relative.</p> <p>Lake Ohrid, we learn, is Europe\u2019s largest natural reservoir, and one of the world\u2019s oldest lakes. \u201cEvery time I went into the water,\u201d she writes, \u201cI felt instantly happy.\u201d It is a kind of homecoming; but not every home is happy. If the lake represents liberty, it has also been a barrier, preventing the people of its shores from leaving. As she learns more about the region and her ancestors, the author recognises a pattern: \u201cof absent men and women left behind, unbending women who dislocated themselves and their loved ones out of shape trying to right what had gone wrong with the family\u201d. One woman she meets has a \u201cface so stricken that you couldn\u2019t look at it for more than a second\u201d.</p> <p>Kassabova has never been interested in derring\u2011do; the perils she encounters are of the psychic variety, and they are genuine. \u201cTo journey to the place of your ancestors, you must be prepared to see what it is easier to deny.\u201d Sight and sightlessness, blindings and blindness literal and wilful, are recurring themes. \u201cThe dead open the eyes of the living,\u201d reads the book\u2019s epigraph. The saints painted on the walls of the rock churches lining the lakes\u2019 shores have had their eyes chiselled out by iconoclasts of one faith or another. According to legend, after the Battle of Kleidion in 1014, the Byzantine emperor Basil II had 15,000 of the Bulgarian Tsar Samuil\u2019s defeated soldiers blinded \u2013 sparing only a handful to lead their comrades home to Samuil\u2019s seat on Lake Prespa. (There is a village on the lake whose name translates as \u201cThe Gouged Ones\u201d.) Kassabova is hypervigilant of such horrors and their echoes. Seen from the air, the two lakes themselves \u201clook like eyes in an ancient face\u201d \u2013 and we are continuously aware of their steadfastness, their unruffled witness to the turmoil unfolding around them century after century: pogroms, lynchings, vendettas, battles, more blindings, mass drownings, national boundaries drawn and redrawn like razorblades across skin. The lakes maintain their vigil.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/feb/01/best-travel-writing-kapka-kassabova-border-stanfords-book-of-the-year\">Best travel book of the year: Kapka Kassabova\u2019s Border wins Stanford Dolman award</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book\u2019s second, shorter, part concerns a second trip made in the autumn to the Albanian portion of Ohrid, and finally to the smaller Lake Prespa. The tone darkens. Albania is a country \u201ckinder to the dead than to the living\u201d. Prespa, she is told, is a \u201ccrazy lake \u2026 unstable, with a mind of its own\u201d, a place of mysterious vortexes and monster carp. When she swims in its waters there is \u201can unsettling feeling of something lurking beneath\u201d. What does trauma do to a place, Kassabova seems always to be asking. What persists in the soil \u2013 or the water \u2013 once spilled blood has been leached away? \u201cThis landscape is <em>i thyerene moshe</em>,\u201d she is told, \u201cbroken by age\u201d.</p> <p><em>To the Lake</em>\u2019s objective is not healing so much as reconciliation, a quest for spiritual wholeness. \u201cOur tragedy,\u201d she writes in the closing paragraphs, \u201cis fragmentation.\u201d The narrative performs another kind of reconciliation, too. A characteristic of modern travel writing is a patchwork, broken-mirror approach to form: short, lapidary encounters; the micro-patterning of images and tales and meditations \u2013 a tendency attributable to modernism as much as to the impressionistic, stop-start nature of any journey. It was partly the compound facets of <em>Border</em> that accounted for its miraculous glimmer. <em>To the Lake</em> is more languid and more patient, as fluid and inexorable as the underground watercourses that connect the two lakes. The book\u2019s achievement, likewise, is to reconcile, thrillingly, what those twin bodies of water represent to Kassabova: the unconscious and the conscious; the darkness of history and the radiance of life and love.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>William Atkins\u2019s The Immeasurable World: A Desert Journey is published by Faber.</em><em> To the Lake by Kapka Kassabova is published by Granta (RRP \u00a314.99).

Chronic wanderlust predates her birth, she tells us (\u201cin the womb I revolved ceaselessly\u201d); it is a syndrome she associates with a history of emigration on her mother\u2019s side of the family, culminating in her own migrations from Bulgaria to New Zealand to the Scottish Highlands. Of her late grandmother in Bulgaria she remembers wondering: \u201cHow did she come to be here (urban and incomplete), yet often talked of there (watery and complete)\u201d? Connected to this incompleteness is a matrilineal history of illness \u2013 \u201cThe Pain\u201d \u2013 that rises in each generation \u201clike a dark wave\u201d. \u201cSomething pulled us down,\u201d she writes, \u201cand compelled us to be unwell.\u201d As a search for a kind of water cure, the book might find a place alongside others about recovery through journey-making \u2013 Jenny Diski\u2019s Skating to Antarctica, for instance, or Guy Stagg\u2019s recent The Crossway. And yet while To the Lake may be a quest narrative, the book\u2019s subject is not the author, nor is its objective personal transformation: \u201cUnless we become aware of how we carry our own legacies,\u201d she explains, \u201cwe too may become unwitting agents of destruction.\u201d Arriving in the Macedonian resort of Ohrid, on the lake of the same name, Kassabova circles the city and the water less like a surveyor than someone scanning the ground for something she dropped on an earlier visit. \u201cLake Ohrid is one of those places on the earth that make you feel as if something fateful awaits you. As if you were always meant to come and you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken you so long.\u201d In Ohrid itself, her grandmother\u2019s home city, \u201call the men looked like my cousins\u201d. \u201cWhose are you?\u201d is the recurring, vital question \u2013 to which family do you belong? Almost everyone she meets is related to her or remembers some close relative. Lake Ohrid, we learn, is Europe\u2019s largest natural reservoir, and one of the world\u2019s oldest lakes. \u201cEvery time I went into the water,\u201d she writes, \u201cI felt instantly happy.\u201d It is a kind of homecoming; but not every home is happy. If the lake represents liberty, it has also been a barrier, preventing the people of its shores from leaving. As she learns more about the region and her ancestors, the author recognises a pattern: \u201cof absent men and women left behind, unbending women who dislocated themselves and their loved ones out of shape trying to right what had gone wrong with the family\u201d. One woman she meets has a \u201cface so stricken that you couldn\u2019t look at it for more than a second\u201d. Kassabova has never been interested in derring\u2011do; the perils she encounters are of the psychic variety, and they are genuine. \u201cTo journey to the place of your ancestors, you must be prepared to see what it is easier to deny.\u201d Sight and sightlessness, blindings and blindness literal and wilful, are recurring themes. \u201cThe dead open the eyes of the living,\u201d reads the book\u2019s epigraph. The saints painted on the walls of the rock churches lining the lakes\u2019 shores have had their eyes chiselled out by iconoclasts of one faith or another. According to legend, after the Battle of Kleidion in 1014, the Byzantine emperor Basil II had 15,000 of the Bulgarian Tsar Samuil\u2019s defeated soldiers blinded \u2013 sparing only a handful to lead their comrades home to Samuil\u2019s seat on Lake Prespa. (There is a village on the lake whose name translates as \u201cThe Gouged Ones\u201d.) Kassabova is hypervigilant of such horrors and their echoes. Seen from the air, the two lakes themselves \u201clook like eyes in an ancient face\u201d \u2013 and we are continuously aware of their steadfastness, their unruffled witness to the turmoil unfolding around them century after century: pogroms, lynchings, vendettas, battles, more blindings, mass drownings, national boundaries drawn and redrawn like razorblades across skin. The lakes maintain their vigil. The book\u2019s second, shorter, part concerns a second trip made in the autumn to the Albanian portion of Ohrid, and finally to the smaller Lake Prespa. The tone darkens. Albania is a country \u201ckinder to the dead than to the living\u201d. Prespa, she is told, is a \u201ccrazy lake \u2026 unstable, with a mind of its own\u201d, a place of mysterious vortexes and monster carp. When she swims in its waters there is \u201can unsettling feeling of something lurking beneath\u201d. What does trauma do to a place, Kassabova seems always to be asking. What persists in the soil \u2013 or the water \u2013 once spilled blood has been leached away? \u201cThis landscape is i thyerene moshe,\u201d she is told, \u201cbroken by age\u201d. To the Lake\u2019s objective is not healing so much as reconciliation, a quest for spiritual wholeness. \u201cOur tragedy,\u201d she writes in the closing paragraphs, \u201cis fragmentation.\u201d The narrative performs another kind of reconciliation, too. A characteristic of modern travel writing is a patchwork, broken-mirror approach to form: short, lapidary encounters; the micro-patterning of images and tales and meditations \u2013 a tendency attributable to modernism as much as to the impressionistic, stop-start nature of any journey. It was partly the compound facets of Border that accounted for its miraculous glimmer. To the Lake is more languid and more patient, as fluid and inexorable as the underground watercourses that connect the two lakes. The book\u2019s achievement, likewise, is to reconcile, thrillingly, what those twin bodies of water represent to Kassabova: the unconscious and the conscious; the darkness of history and the radiance of life and love. \u2022 William Atkins\u2019s The Immeasurable World: A Desert Journey is published by Faber.

Since 2017-18, they have accelerated, making it almost certain that more and more landlords have withdrawn from the market.</p> <p>The tax attack on buy-to-let has been quite remarkable, all the more so considering it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/osborne-buy-to-let-tax-relief-limit-budget\" title=\"\">initiated by a Tory chancellor, George Osborne</a>.</p> <p>Take the example of a landlord with a buy-to-let who is picking up \u00a3950 a month in rent, but paying a mortgage of \u00a3600 a month.</p> <p>Prior to April 2017, 100% of the mortgage interest was tax deductible. It\u2019s why buy-to-let landlords always took out interest-only mortgages, while first-time buyers were forced to take out more expensive repayment mortgages. The same first-time buyers could, of course, not deduct any interest against tax. It meant that, at the point of purchase, the buy-to-let merchants had a ludicrous tax advantage over people buying a home to live in themselves.</p> <p>Since April 2017 the ability to deduct interest against tax has been cut every year, and from April 2020 it finally disappears. For our landlord with the \u00a3950 a month rental income, his after-tax profit in 2017 would have been \u00a32,520. From this April it will be \u00a31,080.</p> <p>That leaves very little for repairs and maintenance and, if the tenant leaves and there is just one month\u2019s \u201cvoid\u201d in rental income, then the profit disappears altogether.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just interest deductibility that has changed. Landlords have, since 2016, been required to pay 3% additional stamp duty on purchases. On a \u00a3300,000 buy, the landlord now pays \u00a314,000 stamp duty, the normal buyer \u00a35,000.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s wear-and-tear allowances. Until 2016 landlords could routinely deduct 10% of net rent from their profits to cover wear and tear, whether they did anything on not. Now they can only claim tax relief when they actually purchase something for their rental property.</p> <p>Charging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/01/housing-campaigners-celebrate-banning-of-letting-fees-for-tenants\" title=\"\">letting fees</a> to tenants has also been banned, plus there\u2019s a new <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/tenancy_deposits/what_is_a_tenancy_deposit\" title=\"\">cap on deposits</a>.

The minority who are \u201crogue\u201d landlords are more than matched by the minority of rogue tenants. But the landlords who wail \u201cIt\u2019s my pension\u201d should show humility; their pension is just a transfer from young adults, many of whom are having to give across half their income to the landlord. What about their pension? What about their chances of ever getting on the property ladder?</p> <p>Landlords who bought during the boom years are sitting on large capital gains, the product of monetary policy, land scarcity and population growth, and virtually nothing to do with their own endeavours. The \u201cproblem\u201d I hear from some landlords is that they want to sell up, but will be hit with a large CGT bill. What a distressing situation to be in. Large unearned profits, on which they may have to pay some tax.</p> <p>What the buy-to-let episode shows is that policy matters. The explosion in buy-to-let was not a \u201cnatural\u201d phenomenon \u2013 it was a product of legal changes in the 1990s (the assured shorthold tenancy) married to a tax regime that favoured landlords. The result was entirely predictable; home ownership began to fall, not just among the young but increasingly among middle-aged people as well. Property wealth shifted into fewer and fewer hands.</p> <p>Since the change in buy-to-let taxation, the result has also been entirely predictable; the fall in home ownership has stabilised, and may be on the turn. There is a tendency to view the property market in fatalistic terms; there\u2019s nothing we can do about prices, building, demand and so on. But we can.</p> <p><em><a href=\"mailto:p.collinson@theguardian.com\">p.collinson@theguardian.com</a></em></p>",

For our landlord with the \u00a3950 a month rental income, his after-tax profit in 2017 would have been \u00a32,520. From this April it will be \u00a31,080. That leaves very little for repairs and maintenance and, if the tenant leaves and there is just one month\u2019s \u201cvoid\u201d in rental income, then the profit disappears altogether. But it\u2019s not just interest deductibility that has changed. Landlords have, since 2016, been required to pay 3% additional stamp duty on purchases. On a \u00a3300,000 buy, the landlord now pays \u00a314,000 stamp duty, the normal buyer \u00a35,000. Then there\u2019s wear-and-tear allowances. Until 2016 landlords could routinely deduct 10% of net rent from their profits to cover wear and tear, whether they did anything on not. Now they can only claim tax relief when they actually purchase something for their rental property. Charging letting fees to tenants has also been banned, plus there\u2019s a new cap on deposits. No-fault evictions are also on the way out. You could almost shed a tear for landlords, the vast majority of whom are perfectly decent property managers and owners. The minority who are \u201crogue\u201d landlords are more than matched by the minority of rogue tenants. But the landlords who wail \u201cIt\u2019s my pension\u201d should show humility; their pension is just a transfer from young adults, many of whom are having to give across half their income to the landlord. What about their pension? What about their chances of ever getting on the property ladder? Landlords who bought during the boom years are sitting on large capital gains, the product of monetary policy, land scarcity and population growth, and virtually nothing to do with their own endeavours. The \u201cproblem\u201d I hear from some landlords is that they want to sell up, but will be hit with a large CGT bill. What a distressing situation to be in. Large unearned profits, on which they may have to pay some tax. What the buy-to-let episode shows is that policy matters. The explosion in buy-to-let was not a \u201cnatural\u201d phenomenon \u2013 it was a product of legal changes in the 1990s (the assured shorthold tenancy) married to a tax regime that favoured landlords. The result was entirely predictable; home ownership began to fall, not just among the young but increasingly among middle-aged people as well. Property wealth shifted into fewer and fewer hands. Since the change in buy-to-let taxation, the result has also been entirely predictable; the fall in home ownership has stabilised, and may be on the turn. There is a tendency to view the property market in fatalistic terms; there\u2019s nothing we can do about prices, building, demand and so on. But we can. p.collinson@theguardian.com",

But their new book <em>Homie</em> is different. \u201cThis book does not care about white people,\u201d Smith says bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s about saying \u2018hello\u2019 to the people of colour in the room, \u2018let\u2019s talk\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In person Smith is softly spoken and polite, carefully crafting each response, though still standing out in the hotel where we meet, with their basketball shoes, nose rings and Whitney Houston T-shirt a hint of the performer that lies beneath.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe that was the thing with <em>Don\u2019t Call Us Dead</em>, it was a lot angrier with white people,\u201d Smith says. \u201cWith <em>Homie</em> I stopped asking myself: \u2018What should I do with the white gaze?\u2019 Because I realised I wasn\u2019t interested in it. I asked myself: \u2018Why am I spending so much time worried about this gaze?\u2019 I think white people can learn a lot from the poems, but that\u2019s not who I\u2019m writing for.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn\u2019t want trauma porn. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I ever created but it was being used as that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That imagined reader is a specific group Smith calls \u201cBeloveds\u201d: the largely black and queer friends and acquaintances <em>Homie</em> addresses. Originally, the book was going to have poems named after black people killed by \u201cstate-sanctioned violence\u201d, with a section about a friend\u2019s suicide. The latter part stayed but Smith decided to make the titles and themes more personal. \u201cI was writing to friends, to family, to people I wanted to speak to. I had to shut off the idea that my poems are now being read by this wider audience. I\u2019m still invested in this intimate and small table: I can name the people that my poems are for.\u201d</p> <p>Another reason for this more inward-looking perspective comes from Smith\u2019s struggle with writer\u2019s block in the lead-up to the deadline for <em>Homie</em>. They\u2019d had bouts of it before but this was different \u2013 the usual stimulants of exercise, sex or weed (Smith says they have \u201ca long-term relationship with marijuana\u201d) were useless. \u201cI was writing, but it was just all shit,\u201d says Smith, who put it down to the strain of living up to their newfound reputation. \u201cI felt a lot of pressure after <em>Don\u2019t Call Us Dead</em> was a \u2018thing\u2019. It meant a lot to people and it won awards, and as much as I like to say that stuff doesn\u2019t affect you, it does. It\u2019s great, it\u2019s a confidence booster, but it also fucked with me for a while.</p> <p>\u201cI was in my own head for a little bit, asking myself: \u2018What does it mean if my next book doesn\u2019t win the National book award or some big thing?\u2019 I don\u2019t like that side of myself. I felt like I had been to the top of something. I had to come back and say: \u2018That is not at all why I started writing poems. That\u2019s not why I still write poems.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The New Yorker said of <em>Don\u2019t Call Us Dead</em> that Smith\u2019s poems \u201ccan\u2019t make history vanish, but they can contend against it with the force of a restorative imagination\u201d. That imagination was honed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where Smith studied before going on to form the Dark Noise Collective with other artists including Franny Choi, with whom Smith co-hosts the poetry podcast VS.</p> <p>Today, Smith makes a living from book sales, touring and teaching in Minnesota, where they still live, but has struggled with the idea of making money from a book so expressly about black suffering. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the work because you want real change for your folks, but that also means capital gains for yourself. I felt I was profiting.\u201d</p> <p><em>Don\u2019t Call Us Dead</em> pigeonholed Smith as the person the media went to for angry black poems; an easy fix for white editors and publishers looking to tap into the zeitgeist. \u201cI want my work to be useful,\u201d says Smith. \u201cSo it felt good to know a poem was good for healing and rage or whatever for my people. But it also felt really gross.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a0afe490744e9455912c835f2cde4f1fa1140f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a0afe490744e9455912c835f2cde4f1fa1140f9/0_570_5064_3038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smith\u2019s 2017 collection, Don\u2019t Call Us Dead, confronted issues that were raging in the US as the Black Lives Matter gained momentum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smith\u2019s 2017 collection, Don\u2019t Call Us Dead, confronted issues that were raging in the US as the Black Lives Matter gained momentum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t write <em>Don\u2019t Call Us Dead</em> again,\u201d they add. \u201cThere will always be America in the news and real black people will always be in my poems, but maybe that\u2019s why the focus of <em>Homie</em> is a lot more personal. I didn\u2019t want trauma porn and I worried about that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I ever created but it was being used as that.\u201d</p> <p><em>Homie</em> is deeply moving and funny, with poems such as \u201call the good dick lives in Brooklyn Park\u201d combining a story about a booty call with the tragic decline of a lover dying from an unnamed illness. But it is a step change from Smith\u2019s earlier work. With <em>Homie</em>, Smith decided to focus on the theme of friendship and what they refer to as a \u201cdeep investigation of the n-word\u201d. That process starts from the very first page. A note says: \u201cThis book was titled <em>Homie</em> because I don\u2019t want non-black people to say \u2018My Nig\u2019 out loud. This book is really titled \u2018My Nig\u2019.\u201d If that doesn\u2019t hit home, the contents page will. Poems titled \u201cniggas!\u201d, \u201cshout out to my niggas in Mexico\u201d, \u201cwhite niggas\u201d, and an explicit quote from a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lil-wayne\" title=\"\"> Lil Wayne</a> song make the point again. It\u2019s playful, provocative and serves as a kind of warning to those unprepared for what is about to come.</p> <p>For Smith, it is important that Europeans include themselves in those conversations about race and language: not being a white American does not absolve European readers from the burden of racism. At readings in the UK and Europe, Smith often addresses the elephant in the room directly. \u201cI think that sometimes folks forget that, just because America seems to be the most proud of what it does to its black, brown and indigenous folks, Europe invented that shit and spread it,\u201d says Smith.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was always this idea that Britain was done with racism \u2013 but Meghan Markle left because you guys were racist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The poet has been coming to the UK for a decade, since being invited by Manchester\u2019s Contact theatre, which has always been on the cutting edge of queer culture. Over that time Smith has observed the hypocritical standards of the race debate in Britain. \u201cThere was always this idea that racism was a thing that Britain was done with and had been for a long time,\u201d they say. \u201cBut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex\" title=\"\">Meghan Markle</a> is Canadian now. She convinced a whole prince to leave because you guys were racist. They tried to send all the Jamaicans back too. Look. You are still up to it. So it\u2019s just to pull back from that moment and say: \u2018Hey, I might not be talking about your particular situation but you can find yourself a seat at the table.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Many of the column inches dedicated to Smith have concerned performance and identity: either their own or their work\u2019s exploration of it. But Smith says they are fundamentally a \u201cformalist\u201d, who loves to \u201cgeek out\u201d over sonnet crowns and voltas. In her New York Times review of <em>Homie</em>, critic Parul Sehgal identified a new form invented by Smith in the poem \u201chow many of us have them\u201d, called the \u201cdozen\u201d, whereby each stanza grows by one line until the final one, comprising 12 lines. \u201cI\u2019d like to invent or order up new adjectives to describe the startling originality and ambition of Smith\u2019s work,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>Does the general focus on Smith\u2019s identity rather than the work grate? \u201cThat is the story of the black writer throughout time,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI think that is true but it\u2019s not particular to me.\u201d Some reviewers, Smith argues, are \u201cso blinded by identity\u201d that they don\u2019t realise they are being \u201cmarvelled by craft\u201d. They are connecting to the work, but \u201cthey are having a different journey to someone who can understand the author\u2019s point of view\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWith a more forgiving eye, there are ways in which all of us come at the work with whatever references we have \u2013 because that is just what we know,\u201d Smith says. \u201cSo there are people I have been compared to \u2013 more canonical folks \u2013 who I don\u2019t even know. I might have read a poem or two in school but I don\u2019t really bang heavies with whoever that might be. But there are ways in which other influences come to you. You might be a student of Whitman because one of your favourites really liked Whitman.\u201d</p> <p>For Smith, the bigger crime is that too few reviewers are aware of many of the established poets who have been influences \u2013 people such as Patricia Smith, Lucille Clifton and Amaud Jamaul Johnson. \u201cIf your understanding of black radical art starts and ends with Amiri Baraka and Sonia Sanchez, then you don\u2019t really know a lot of the archive. I think a lot of folks only know the \u2018canon\u2019, but there are so many canons to pull from,\u201d Smith says. \u201cAll writers deserve that type of deep reading and seeing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>what was said at the bus stop</strong></h2> <p><em>Danez Smith</em></p> <p><em>lately has been a long time<br></em>says the girl from Pakistan, Lahore to be specific<br>at the bus stop when the white man<br>ask her where she\u2019s from &amp; then<br>says <em>oh, you from Lahore?<br>it\u2019s pretty bad over there lately.</em></p> <p><em>lately has been a long time<br></em>she says &amp; we look at each other &amp; the look says<br><em>yes, i too wish dude would stop<br>asking us about where we from<br></em>but on the other side of our side eyes<br>is maybe a hand where hands do no good<br>a look to say, <em>yes, i know lately has been<br>a long time for your people too<br>&amp; i\u2019m sorry the world is so good at making<br>us feel like we have to fight for space<br>to fight for our lives</em></p> <p>\u201csolidarity\u201d is a word, a lot of people say it<br>i\u2019m not sure what it means in the flesh<br>i know i love &amp; have cried for my friends<br>their browns a different brown than mine<br>i\u2019ve danced their dances when taught<br>&amp; tasted how their mothers miracle the rice<br>different than mine. i know sometimes<br>i can\u2019t see beyond my own pain, past black<br>&amp; white, how bullets love any flesh.<br>i know it\u2019s foolish to compare.<br>what advice do the drowned have for the burned?<br>what gossip is there between the hanged &amp; the buried?</p> <p><br>&amp; i want to reach across our great distance<br>that is sometimes an ocean &amp; sometimes centimeters<br>&amp; say, <em>look. your people, my people, all that has happened<br>to us &amp; still make love under rusted moons, still pull<br>children from the mothers &amp; name them<br>still teach them to dance &amp; your pain is not mine<br>&amp; is no less &amp; is mine &amp; i pray to my god your god<br>blesses you with mercy &amp; i have tasted your food &amp; understand<br>how it is a good home &amp; i don\u2019t know your language<br>but i understand your songs &amp; i cried when they came<br>for your uncles &amp; when you buried your niece<br>i wanted the world to burn in the child\u2019s brief memory<br>&amp; still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still<br>&amp; i have stood by you in the soft shawl of morning<br>waiting &amp; breathing &amp; waiting</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 From Homie, published by Chatto on 20 February.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Danez Smith was born into a devout Baptist household in St Paul, Minnesota. Smith\u2019s grandmother still lives there, in one of only two black households on a street that was mixed but is becoming increasingly white. Smith grew up, on this border between the blacker areas and the white middle-class enclaves of the city, as a black, queer, God-fearing child. The future poet and spoken-word artist would listen to family members and friends telling stories on the porch, impressed by their way with words. The friends came and went but there was always one constant: church. Smith may have struggled to fit in among the congregation but Sunday morning meant worship, and more importantly a sermon. It was that rousing religious oration that opened up the world of writing and performance. \u201cThe first writing I ever loved was the Sunday sermon,\u201d Smith says when we meet in Manchester, ahead of a live performance. \u201cThere are moments in a Baptist church when the pastor gets caught in the spirit \u2026 I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. I just have to get it out. Just let me get it out.\u201d For the last decade Smith \u2013 who is non-binary and uses the pronouns them/they \u2013 has been letting the spirit take over. Three books of searing, brazenly queer and political poetry have made them one of the most discussed poets of their generation, and placed them at the vanguard of an African American movement that has seen spoken-word artists move from stages and backrooms to book deals and awards success. Smith\u2019s 2014 debut, [insert] boy, marked the arrival of a new voice; their 2017 collection Don\u2019t Call Us Dead confronted issues that were raging in the US as the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum, holding a mirror up to America\u2019s racism and advocating urgently for change, while touching on Smith\u2019s own HIV diagnosis. It was a finalist for the National book award in the US, and at 29, Smith became the youngest ever winner of the Forward best collection prize, beating US poet laureate Tracy K Smith to take the top honour. The poem \u201cdear white America\u201d became a viral sensation, with Smith\u2019s intense performance of it earning comparisons to \u201cHowl\u201d \u2013 Allen Ginsberg\u2019s exasperated condemnation of the US in the 1950s. i tried, white people. i tried to love you, but you spent my brother\u2019s funeral making plans for brunch, talking too loud next to his bones. you took one look at the river, plump with the body of boy after girl after sweet boi &amp; ask why does it always have to be about race? \u2026 because Jordan boomed. because Emmett whistled. because Huey P. spoke. because Martin preached. because black boys can always be too loud to live. Don\u2019t Call Us Dead was a collection that spoke truth to white power and made Smith a literary star. But their new book Homie is different. \u201cThis book does not care about white people,\u201d Smith says bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s about saying \u2018hello\u2019 to the people of colour in the room, \u2018let\u2019s talk\u2019.\u201d In person Smith is softly spoken and polite, carefully crafting each response, though still standing out in the hotel where we meet, with their basketball shoes, nose rings and Whitney Houston T-shirt a hint of the performer that lies beneath. \u201cMaybe that was the thing with Don\u2019t Call Us Dead, it was a lot angrier with white people,\u201d Smith says. \u201cWith Homie I stopped asking myself: \u2018What should I do with the white gaze?\u2019 Because I realised I wasn\u2019t interested in it. I asked myself: \u2018Why am I spending so much time worried about this gaze?\u2019 I think white people can learn a lot from the poems, but that\u2019s not who I\u2019m writing for.\u201d That imagined reader is a specific group Smith calls \u201cBeloveds\u201d: the largely black and queer friends and acquaintances Homie addresses. Originally, the book was going to have poems named after black people killed by \u201cstate-sanctioned violence\u201d, with a section about a friend\u2019s suicide. The latter part stayed but Smith decided to make the titles and themes more personal. \u201cI was writing to friends, to family, to people I wanted to speak to. I had to shut off the idea that my poems are now being read by this wider audience. I\u2019m still invested in this intimate and small table: I can name the people that my poems are for.\u201d Another reason for this more inward-looking perspective comes from Smith\u2019s struggle with writer\u2019s block in the lead-up to the deadline for Homie. They\u2019d had bouts of it before but this was different \u2013 the usual stimulants of exercise, sex or weed (Smith says they have \u201ca long-term relationship with marijuana\u201d) were useless. \u201cI was writing, but it was just all shit,\u201d says Smith, who put it down to the strain of living up to their newfound reputation. \u201cI felt a lot of pressure after Don\u2019t Call Us Dead was a \u2018thing\u2019. It meant a lot to people and it won awards, and as much as I like to say that stuff doesn\u2019t affect you, it does. It\u2019s great, it\u2019s a confidence booster, but it also fucked with me for a while. \u201cI was in my own head for a little bit, asking myself: \u2018What does it mean if my next book doesn\u2019t win the National book award or some big thing?\u2019 I don\u2019t like that side of myself. I felt like I had been to the top of something. I had to come back and say: \u2018That is not at all why I started writing poems. That\u2019s not why I still write poems.\u2019\u201d The New Yorker said of Don\u2019t Call Us Dead that Smith\u2019s poems \u201ccan\u2019t make history vanish, but they can contend against it with the force of a restorative imagination\u201d. That imagination was honed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where Smith studied before going on to form the Dark Noise Collective with other artists including Franny Choi, with whom Smith co-hosts the poetry podcast VS. Today, Smith makes a living from book sales, touring and teaching in Minnesota, where they still live, but has struggled with the idea of making money from a book so expressly about black suffering. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the work because you want real change for your folks, but that also means capital gains for yourself. I felt I was profiting.\u201d Don\u2019t Call Us Dead pigeonholed Smith as the person the media went to for angry black poems; an easy fix for white editors and publishers looking to tap into the zeitgeist. \u201cI want my work to be useful,\u201d says Smith. \u201cSo it felt good to know a poem was good for healing and rage or whatever for my people. But it also felt really gross.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t write Don\u2019t Call Us Dead again,\u201d they add. \u201cThere will always be America in the news and real black people will always be in my poems, but maybe that\u2019s why the focus of Homie is a lot more personal. I didn\u2019t want trauma porn and I worried about that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I ever created but it was being used as that.\u201d Homie is deeply moving and funny, with poems such as \u201call the good dick lives in Brooklyn Park\u201d combining a story about a booty call with the tragic decline of a lover dying from an unnamed illness. But it is a step change from Smith\u2019s earlier work. With Homie, Smith decided to focus on the theme of friendship and what they refer to as a \u201cdeep investigation of the n-word\u201d. That process starts from the very first page. A note says: \u201cThis book was titled Homie because I don\u2019t want non-black people to say \u2018My Nig\u2019 out loud. This book is really titled \u2018My Nig\u2019.\u201d If that doesn\u2019t hit home, the contents page will. Poems titled \u201cniggas!\u201d, \u201cshout out to my niggas in Mexico\u201d, \u201cwhite niggas\u201d, and an explicit quote from a Lil Wayne song make the point again. It\u2019s playful, provocative and serves as a kind of warning to those unprepared for what is about to come. For Smith, it is important that Europeans include themselves in those conversations about race and language: not being a white American does not absolve European readers from the burden of racism. At readings in the UK and Europe, Smith often addresses the elephant in the room directly. \u201cI think that sometimes folks forget that, just because America seems to be the most proud of what it does to its black, brown and indigenous folks, Europe invented that shit and spread it,\u201d says Smith. The poet has been coming to the UK for a decade, since being invited by Manchester\u2019s Contact theatre, which has always been on the cutting edge of queer culture. Over that time Smith has observed the hypocritical standards of the race debate in Britain. \u201cThere was always this idea that racism was a thing that Britain was done with and had been for a long time,\u201d they say. \u201cBut Meghan Markle is Canadian now. She convinced a whole prince to leave because you guys were racist. They tried to send all the Jamaicans back too. Look. You are still up to it. So it\u2019s just to pull back from that moment and say: \u2018Hey, I might not be talking about your particular situation but you can find yourself a seat at the table.\u2019\u201d Many of the column inches dedicated to Smith have concerned performance and identity: either their own or their work\u2019s exploration of it. But Smith says they are fundamentally a \u201cformalist\u201d, who loves to \u201cgeek out\u201d over sonnet crowns and voltas. In her New York Times review of Homie, critic Parul Sehgal identified a new form invented by Smith in the poem \u201chow many of us have them\u201d, called the \u201cdozen\u201d, whereby each stanza grows by one line until the final one, comprising 12 lines. \u201cI\u2019d like to invent or order up new adjectives to describe the startling originality and ambition of Smith\u2019s work,\u201d she wrote. Does the general focus on Smith\u2019s identity rather than the work grate? \u201cThat is the story of the black writer throughout time,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI think that is true but it\u2019s not particular to me.\u201d Some reviewers, Smith argues, are \u201cso blinded by identity\u201d that they don\u2019t realise they are being \u201cmarvelled by craft\u201d. They are connecting to the work, but \u201cthey are having a different journey to someone who can understand the author\u2019s point of view\u201d. \u201cWith a more forgiving eye, there are ways in which all of us come at the work with whatever references we have \u2013 because that is just what we know,\u201d Smith says. \u201cSo there are people I have been compared to \u2013 more canonical folks \u2013 who I don\u2019t even know. I might have read a poem or two in school but I don\u2019t really bang heavies with whoever that might be. But there are ways in which other influences come to you. You might be a student of Whitman because one of your favourites really liked Whitman.\u201d For Smith, the bigger crime is that too few reviewers are aware of many of the established poets who have been influences \u2013 people such as Patricia Smith, Lucille Clifton and Amaud Jamaul Johnson. \u201cIf your understanding of black radical art starts and ends with Amiri Baraka and Sonia Sanchez, then you don\u2019t really know a lot of the archive. I think a lot of folks only know the \u2018canon\u2019, but there are so many canons to pull from,\u201d Smith says. \u201cAll writers deserve that type of deep reading and seeing.\u201d what was said at the bus stop Danez Smith lately has been a long time says the girl from Pakistan, Lahore to be specific at the bus stop when the white man ask her where she\u2019s from &amp; then says oh, you from Lahore? it\u2019s pretty bad over there lately. lately has been a long time she says &amp; we look at each other &amp; the look says yes, i too wish dude would stop asking us about where we from but on the other side of our side eyes is maybe a hand where hands do no good a look to say, yes, i know lately has been a long time for your people too &amp; i\u2019m sorry the world is so good at making us feel like we have to fight for space to fight for our lives \u201csolidarity\u201d is a word, a lot of people say it i\u2019m not sure what it means in the flesh i know i love &amp; have cried for my friends their browns a different brown than mine i\u2019ve danced their dances when taught &amp; tasted how their mothers miracle the rice different than mine. i know sometimes i can\u2019t see beyond my own pain, past black &amp; white, how bullets love any flesh. i know it\u2019s foolish to compare. what advice do the drowned have for the burned? what gossip is there between the hanged &amp; the buried? &amp; i want to reach across our great distance that is sometimes an ocean &amp; sometimes centimeters &amp; say, look. your people, my people, all that has happened to us &amp; still make love under rusted moons, still pull children from the mothers &amp; name them still teach them to dance &amp; your pain is not mine &amp; is no less &amp; is mine &amp; i pray to my god your god blesses you with mercy &amp; i have tasted your food &amp; understand how it is a good home &amp; i don\u2019t know your language but i understand your songs &amp; i cried when they came for your uncles &amp; when you buried your niece i wanted the world to burn in the child\u2019s brief memory &amp; still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still &amp; i have stood by you in the soft shawl of morning waiting &amp; breathing &amp; waiting \u2022 From Homie, published by Chatto on 20 February.",

      "body": "<p>Sheila Atim would not call it a shrine, exactly, but in her London flat, there is a mantelpiece on which she has placed a few commemorative bits and bobs. There\u2019s an Olivier award here, an MBE there. \u201cMy friend <em>did</em> say it looked like a shrine,\u201d she admits, laughing. \u201cBut it\u2019s not because I want people to walk into the flat and be blinded by the lights of Sheila\u2019s achievements. These things are just nice! They\u2019re little milestones. I look at them and go, whoa. What?!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a lovely, knockabout energy to Atim, balanced by a deeply serious side. More than almost anyone I\u2019ve interviewed, she really, properly, thoroughly considers every angle of every question she is asked, as if she\u2019s been set a puzzle to solve. Perhaps that\u2019s why casting agents spot a kind of otherworldliness in her. \u201cA little bit, not bang in the middle of the mainstream, just slightly to the left,\u201d as she puts it. Atim has been a powerful presence in the theatre world: she won the Olivier in 2018 for her role in the Bob Dylan-inspired musical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jul/27/girl-from-the-north-country-review-bob-dylan-conor-mcpherson\" title=\"\">Girl From </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jul/27/girl-from-the-north-country-review-bob-dylan-conor-mcpherson\" title=\"\">The North Country</a>, and has done almost every interesting, just-slightly-to-the-left production of Shakespeare going. Then, in December, she was awarded the MBE \u2013 at the age of 29. Now she\u2019s moving on to the small screen with a BBC primetime debut in which she\u2019ll be playing a witch. In <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0819xlg\" title=\"\">The Pale Horse</a>, a list of names is found on the body of a woman who has been murdered; a man who finds his own name there becomes obsessed with a trio of spooky women in a leafy suburban village. It\u2019s an Agatha Christie adaptation, which means Atim can\u2019t tell me anything else about it. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard, isn\u2019t it, with a whodunnit? But I am playing a witch. That much I can tell you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc7865df3a313049afe942604d1bd95b1ec7953c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc7865df3a313049afe942604d1bd95b1ec7953c/119_565_5142_5225/984.jpg\" alt=\"Shelia Atim photographed in London January 2020.

Every now and then a train rumbles overhead, adding a touch of the theatrical whenever the conversation turns introspective.</p> <p>\u201cI tend to be quite a pensive person, I guess,\u201d Atim says. \u201cI ruminate a lot and can be quite quiet when you first meet me, so I think that makes people think, ooh, something\u2019s going on there. Ooh, mysterious.\u201d While there are plenty of actors who tend towards the insular, most are show\u2011offs; it\u2019s the nature of the job. Does she not jazz hands it up a bit at auditions? \u201cOh no,\u201d she says, mock appalled. \u201cI just can\u2019t. I\u2019ve always been very bad at networky events, at press nights and things. Everyone is buzzing with this meerkat energy\u201d \u2013 she does a convincing impression of a meerkat, head bobbing up and down, left to right \u2013 \u201clooking to see if there\u2019s someone more famous over there.\u201d As an only child, she\u2019s happy being on her own, whether that\u2019s at home under a blanket, or wandering through a party. Is she a shy person? \u201cI definitely have a shy streak. I\u2019m a very cautious person. I\u2019ve realised that, as I\u2019ve got older.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac01471db845821f2681aaf2653c47125907e712\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac01471db845821f2681aaf2653c47125907e712/57_160_4070_2734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheila Atim (Marianne Laine) and Arinze Kene (Joe Scott), centre, in Girl From The North Country, 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Arinze Kene in Girl From The North Country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This caution has served her well at times. At the start of 2019, Atim was announced as one of the stars of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/30/naomi-watts-game-of-thrones-prequel-series\" title=\"\">Bloodmoon, the Game </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/30/naomi-watts-game-of-thrones-prequel-series\" title=\"\">Of Thrones prequel</a> written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jane-goldman\" title=\"\">Jane Goldman</a> and starring Naomi Watts. That could have been life-changing, and she had to prepare herself accordingly. They shot a pilot, but it was revealed later in the year that it hadn\u2019t gone ahead (another prequel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/30/game-of-thrones-prequel-hbo-ditches-series-starring-naomi-watts-report\" title=\"\">House </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/30/game-of-thrones-prequel-hbo-ditches-series-starring-naomi-watts-report\" title=\"\">Of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/30/game-of-thrones-prequel-hbo-ditches-series-starring-naomi-watts-report\" title=\"\">The Dragon</a>, written by Rampage writer Ryan Condal, was picked up instead). She seems sanguine about it. \u201cWhen I found out, I had work coming up, so that helped soften the blow. As much as I wanted it to happen, I was also prepared for it not to; it didn\u2019t completely devastate me.

She plays Mabel, mother of the protagonist, Cora, a slave who escapes from a Georgian plantation and heads north. \u201cIt was genuinely the best thing ever,\u201d she says. She was a fan of Jenkins\u2019 work, and he\u2019d seen her in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/02/othello-review-mark-rylance-andre-holland-shakespeares-globe-london\" title=\"\">Othello at the Globe</a> in 2018, playing Emilia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mark-rylance\" title=\"\">Mark Rylance</a>\u2019s Iago (more than one critic observed that she was more than a match for him). \u201cObviously Underground Railroad is set in slavery times, and you need somebody at the helm who is on top of their game when it comes to that subject matter. [Jenkins] just looked after everyone, and everyone felt safe and happy and excited to be there, despite the kind of story we were telling.\u201d</p> <p>Does this mean she\u2019s making the big move to the US? Sort of, she says. She got a load of emails just today about various projects. \u201cSome are in America and some are here, some are theatre, some are film, some are TV. I\u2019ve always wanted to keep all those options open.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Atim was born in Uganda and grew up in Rainham, east London. She moved to the UK as a baby with her mother, who is a managing commissioner for the NHS. She was going to be called Vivienne, she says, but her mum changed her mind and went for Sheila. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. But I do know [about] my surname. I\u2019m from the Acholi tribe, in northern Uganda, and you don\u2019t necessarily get given a family surname. Your surname has a meaning, and it\u2019s often related to the circumstances of your birth. My mum went with a literal one. I was born in Kampala, but our family\u2019s from the north, so Atim means \u2018born away from home\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24eeecdd1051a1c3e02bd0215f33d79421f12a1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24eeecdd1051a1c3e02bd0215f33d79421f12a1a/279_115_5452_3271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bella (RITA TUSHINGHAM), Thyrza Grey (SHEILA ATIM), Sybil Stamfordis (KATHY KIERA CLARKE) in the Pale Horse, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Rita Tushingham (left) and Kathy Keira Clarke in The Pale Horse.

She applied to medical school, but when she didn\u2019t get a place, one of her teachers told her he thought it was a sign. \u201cIt was like a bubble popped over my head. I thought, ahh, I\u2019m gonna be a performer.\u201d She decided to be a singer, but still did a degree in biomedical sciences, because she loved the subject so much. \u201cI\u2019ve always written soul music, but I didn\u2019t really know what my plan was. I liked to sing and accompany myself on the piano, and I\u2019d loved Alicia Keys since I was a kid. Later on, I discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nina-simone\" title=\"\">Nina Simone</a>.\u201d While she was studying, she went to open-mic nights and tried to learn about the music industry. \u201cI had this perception that I needed to write an EP, get four tracks down, work with a producer, get a rapper to do 16 bars,\u201d she laughs. \u201cNow I look back, I always felt like something wasn\u2019t quite whole about that approach. People would say, \u2018When\u2019s your music coming out?\u2019 And I\u2019d be like, \u2018Ah.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She took a few music classes at WAC performing arts school in London, and ended up doing some drama there, too. Her path was set, though she didn\u2019t yet know it. \u201cWhen the acting took off, I was very resistant to the idea,\u201d she says, smiling. Her drama teacher kept asking if she was going to drama school. \u201cI said, \u2018What are you talking about? No, come on. I\u2019m gonna sing a couple of songs, get the rapper to do the 16 bars.\u2019 But then everything started to expand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f82ba85912fd72e408df8b3e790450651728a8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f82ba85912fd72e408df8b3e790450651728a8f/980_649_3996_5789/690.jpg\" alt=\"Shelia Atim photographed in London January 2020.

Just knowing that exists, irrespective of what the nominations list is for some awards ceremony, fills me with great hope.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Atim wrote her first play, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/06/anguis-review-what-if-cleopatra-went-on-desert-island-discs\" title=\"\">Anguis</a>, which debuted at the Edinburgh festival. \u201cIt was a massive, massive punt,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever write a play, ever.\u201d She doubted that she could pull something out of her own imagination. \u201cI thought, if a script exists, I can help as an actor \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t just create something out of thin air: that\u2019s insane. And then I had all these ideas I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have.\u201d She was interested in the myths around Cleopatra, whose achievements in science are rarely remembered, and made her into a character. Another character is a doctor, as Atim might have been. Once she got going, she found it hard to stop. \u201cThe director said, this is really interesting, but there\u2019s so much of it.

      "bodyText": "Sheila Atim would not call it a shrine, exactly, but in her London flat, there is a mantelpiece on which she has placed a few commemorative bits and bobs. There\u2019s an Olivier award here, an MBE there. \u201cMy friend did say it looked like a shrine,\u201d she admits, laughing. \u201cBut it\u2019s not because I want people to walk into the flat and be blinded by the lights of Sheila\u2019s achievements. These things are just nice! They\u2019re little milestones. I look at them and go, whoa. What?!\u201d There\u2019s a lovely, knockabout energy to Atim, balanced by a deeply serious side. More than almost anyone I\u2019ve interviewed, she really, properly, thoroughly considers every angle of every question she is asked, as if she\u2019s been set a puzzle to solve. Perhaps that\u2019s why casting agents spot a kind of otherworldliness in her. \u201cA little bit, not bang in the middle of the mainstream, just slightly to the left,\u201d as she puts it. Atim has been a powerful presence in the theatre world: she won the Olivier in 2018 for her role in the Bob Dylan-inspired musical Girl From The North Country, and has done almost every interesting, just-slightly-to-the-left production of Shakespeare going. Then, in December, she was awarded the MBE \u2013 at the age of 29. Now she\u2019s moving on to the small screen with a BBC primetime debut in which she\u2019ll be playing a witch. In The Pale Horse, a list of names is found on the body of a woman who has been murdered; a man who finds his own name there becomes obsessed with a trio of spooky women in a leafy suburban village. It\u2019s an Agatha Christie adaptation, which means Atim can\u2019t tell me anything else about it. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard, isn\u2019t it, with a whodunnit? But I am playing a witch. That much I can tell you.\u201d It will be her first time as a witch, other than a stab at Macbeth in drama classes. \u201cBut I\u2019ve played lots of ethereal characters. Or characters who have a supernatural element, or are ambiguous as to whether they\u2019re real or incorporeal.\u201d Why does she think she gets those parts? In person, Atim is wiry, eager and sharp, and lacks the wafty vagueness that \u201cethereal\u201d conjures. We meet on a freezing cold night and sit in a photographic studio in an old railway arch, huddled around a radiator, wrapped in coats and scarves. Every now and then a train rumbles overhead, adding a touch of the theatrical whenever the conversation turns introspective. \u201cI tend to be quite a pensive person, I guess,\u201d Atim says. \u201cI ruminate a lot and can be quite quiet when you first meet me, so I think that makes people think, ooh, something\u2019s going on there. Ooh, mysterious.\u201d While there are plenty of actors who tend towards the insular, most are show\u2011offs; it\u2019s the nature of the job. Does she not jazz hands it up a bit at auditions? \u201cOh no,\u201d she says, mock appalled. \u201cI just can\u2019t. I\u2019ve always been very bad at networky events, at press nights and things. Everyone is buzzing with this meerkat energy\u201d \u2013 she does a convincing impression of a meerkat, head bobbing up and down, left to right \u2013 \u201clooking to see if there\u2019s someone more famous over there.\u201d As an only child, she\u2019s happy being on her own, whether that\u2019s at home under a blanket, or wandering through a party. Is she a shy person? \u201cI definitely have a shy streak. I\u2019m a very cautious person. I\u2019ve realised that, as I\u2019ve got older.\u201d This caution has served her well at times. At the start of 2019, Atim was announced as one of the stars of Bloodmoon, the Game Of Thrones prequel written by Jane Goldman and starring Naomi Watts. That could have been life-changing, and she had to prepare herself accordingly. They shot a pilot, but it was revealed later in the year that it hadn\u2019t gone ahead (another prequel, House Of The Dragon, written by Rampage writer Ryan Condal, was picked up instead). She seems sanguine about it. \u201cWhen I found out, I had work coming up, so that helped soften the blow. As much as I wanted it to happen, I was also prepared for it not to; it didn\u2019t completely devastate me. You have to be ready for that kind of stuff.\u201d Even without Game Of Thrones, Atim is about to become infinitely more recognisable. After The Pale Horse, she\u2019ll be seen in the Amazon adaptation of Colson Whitehead\u2019s bestseller The Underground Railroad, directed by Moonlight\u2019s Barry Jenkins. She plays Mabel, mother of the protagonist, Cora, a slave who escapes from a Georgian plantation and heads north. \u201cIt was genuinely the best thing ever,\u201d she says. She was a fan of Jenkins\u2019 work, and he\u2019d seen her in Othello at the Globe in 2018, playing Emilia to Mark Rylance\u2019s Iago (more than one critic observed that she was more than a match for him). \u201cObviously Underground Railroad is set in slavery times, and you need somebody at the helm who is on top of their game when it comes to that subject matter. [Jenkins] just looked after everyone, and everyone felt safe and happy and excited to be there, despite the kind of story we were telling.\u201d Does this mean she\u2019s making the big move to the US? Sort of, she says. She got a load of emails just today about various projects. \u201cSome are in America and some are here, some are theatre, some are film, some are TV. I\u2019ve always wanted to keep all those options open.\u201d *** Atim was born in Uganda and grew up in Rainham, east London. She moved to the UK as a baby with her mother, who is a managing commissioner for the NHS. She was going to be called Vivienne, she says, but her mum changed her mind and went for Sheila. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. But I do know [about] my surname. I\u2019m from the Acholi tribe, in northern Uganda, and you don\u2019t necessarily get given a family surname. Your surname has a meaning, and it\u2019s often related to the circumstances of your birth. My mum went with a literal one. I was born in Kampala, but our family\u2019s from the north, so Atim means \u2018born away from home\u2019.\u201d At school, she acted, sang and learned multiple musical instruments, but planned to be a doctor. She applied to medical school, but when she didn\u2019t get a place, one of her teachers told her he thought it was a sign. \u201cIt was like a bubble popped over my head. I thought, ahh, I\u2019m gonna be a performer.\u201d She decided to be a singer, but still did a degree in biomedical sciences, because she loved the subject so much. \u201cI\u2019ve always written soul music, but I didn\u2019t really know what my plan was. I liked to sing and accompany myself on the piano, and I\u2019d loved Alicia Keys since I was a kid. Later on, I discovered Nina Simone.\u201d While she was studying, she went to open-mic nights and tried to learn about the music industry. \u201cI had this perception that I needed to write an EP, get four tracks down, work with a producer, get a rapper to do 16 bars,\u201d she laughs. \u201cNow I look back, I always felt like something wasn\u2019t quite whole about that approach. People would say, \u2018When\u2019s your music coming out?\u2019 And I\u2019d be like, \u2018Ah.\u2019\u201d She took a few music classes at WAC performing arts school in London, and ended up doing some drama there, too. Her path was set, though she didn\u2019t yet know it. \u201cWhen the acting took off, I was very resistant to the idea,\u201d she says, smiling. Her drama teacher kept asking if she was going to drama school. \u201cI said, \u2018What are you talking about? No, come on. I\u2019m gonna sing a couple of songs, get the rapper to do the 16 bars.\u2019 But then everything started to expand.\u201d Her first big stage role was in 2016, in Les Blancs at the National, though it was nonspeaking. \u201cI just walked in slow motion! That got people\u2019s attention, but, because I didn\u2019t speak, I think I remained this, \u2018Is she even real? Does she even exist?\u2019 figure.\u201d Later that year, she appeared in Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s groundbreaking all-female Shakespeare Trilogy \u2013 Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest \u2013 set in a women\u2019s prison. Then came Girl From The North Country and her first proper TV role, playing a Georgian prostitute called Limehouse Nell in the brilliantly scabrous Harlots. \u201cIt was cool, because it was a period drama. I thought, that\u2019s probably the last genre I\u2019m going to get into any time soon, and then here I was. But also I was performing Girl From The North Country at the same time, so that was a super-intense week.\u201d Swinging between the two can\u2019t have been easy. \u201cThat week was pretty dark, she laughs. \u201cI was in Watford at 5am every day, filming, and then doing the show in the evening. Saturday came and I was just backstage, flat on my back, and somebody had to prod me with a stick to go on and say my lines.\u201d Girl From The North Country was a gamechanger. Atim played the pregnant, unmarried teenager Marianne, and her haunting rendition of Dylan\u2019s Tight Connection To My Heart (you can find it on YouTube) regularly moved audiences to tears. In fact, she had to watch herself singing recently because her agent wanted to put a clip of it in her showreel. \u201cAnd I was really moved,\u201d she says. You made yourself cry? She cracks up. \u201cYeah, I cried at myself and sat in front of my shrine. Popped a little screenshot of it on the shrine and poured some libations.\u201d Seriously, she says, it\u2019s more that people keep telling her how much it\u2019s meant to them. \u201cWhen I was shooting the Game of Thrones prequel in Belfast, one of the bar staff at the hotel said, \u2018I never saw the show, but me and my mum love Bob Dylan and we put you on YouTube.\u2019\u201d When Atim picked up the Olivier for best supporting actress, she looked genuinely surprised. In her speech, she said: \u201cI really hope there will be more women who look like me accepting awards.\u201d Does she feel optimistic? \u201cDo you know what? I really do,\u201d she says. She deleted her social media at the start of this year, and has been enjoying a bit of a digital detox, so she hasn\u2019t tuned in to much of the recent #oscarssowhite or #baftassowhite controversy. \u201cIt makes people feel disappointed, and I get it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m hopeful because I\u2019m privy to the conversations: I\u2019m hearing people talk about their experiences, talking about what they want to change, what they want to make. There\u2019s a group called Blacktress run by [Harry Potter and The Cursed Child actor] Cherrelle Skeete, which brings [BME] women together. Just knowing that exists, irrespective of what the nominations list is for some awards ceremony, fills me with great hope.\u201d Last year, Atim wrote her first play, Anguis, which debuted at the Edinburgh festival. \u201cIt was a massive, massive punt,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever write a play, ever.\u201d She doubted that she could pull something out of her own imagination. \u201cI thought, if a script exists, I can help as an actor \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t just create something out of thin air: that\u2019s insane. And then I had all these ideas I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have.\u201d She was interested in the myths around Cleopatra, whose achievements in science are rarely remembered, and made her into a character. Another character is a doctor, as Atim might have been. Once she got going, she found it hard to stop. \u201cThe director said, this is really interesting, but there\u2019s so much of it. I was, like, I know. If you\u2019d read previous drafts, it was just my mind going a mile a minute.\u201d She\u2019s currently redrafting Anguis, in the hope of putting it on elsewhere, and has a couple of other projects on the go. She doesn\u2019t want to jinx them by talking about them, though she does say they bring music and theatre together in the way she\u2019d always hoped she might. Is it the four-track EP with a rapper, at last? \u201cOK, you got me. Finally! After six years, I\u2019ve got round to it. It\u2019ll be a fire EP and you\u2019ll find me outside Camden station.\u201d For a long time, Atim says, she felt as if she was getting away with something \u2013 as if, by being on stage at all, she\u2019d somehow slipped through the net. \u201cIt was only when I picked up my MBE in December that I really had a moment of, oh, you\u2019re probably meant to be here. For a long time, I had this rumbling imposter syndrome underneath.\u201d On cue, a train goes above us, and the whole room rumbles. \u201cOminous,\u201d she says, though it is anything but. \u2022 The Pale Horse begins on BBC One on 9 February.

Distinctive Assets founder Lash Fary, who has been putting the bags together for 18 years, said that eco-consciousness is \u201ccertainly\u201d on his mind and so a plant-based meal delivery service and a DIY candle kit that encourages re-use of holders have both been included. While the Academy has released a list of the ways in which they are working towards their goal of becoming carbon neutral, campaigners are still raising the alarm on one of the most damaging components of a season that brings together talent from across the globe: air travel. Anna Hughes, director of the Flight Free UK campaign, believes that more recognition is needed by the Academy and the entertainment industry in general, of the impact that such a \u201chighly polluting\u201d form of travel has on the environment. \u201cIn terms of emissions, the savings from providing plant-based food are likely to be overshadowed many times over by air travel to the ceremony,\u201d she said. While it\u2019s difficult to calculate exactly, Hughes estimates that if an attendee is flying to Los Angeles from New York or further in business class or on a private or chartered plane, they will be emitting more carbon than the average Brit does in a whole year. \u201cAt the very least, the Academy awards needs to acknowledge this, not ignore it,\u201d she said.",

The most recent are George and Pamela Ross (not their real names), who live near Cambridge.

The couple were told staff could only discuss the details with them if they called their bank\u2019s fraud team by phoning the number on the back of their bank cards.

      "body": "<p>In London, where I live, the idea of winter cycling generally involves little more than remembering some gloves and making sure your bike lights are charged. In Joensuu, the compact city in eastern Finland, where I am now, it\u2019s arguably a more serious business.</p> <p>When I got off the train from Helsinki the temperature was -16C (3F), and hasn\u2019t yet risen higher than -6C. Every roadway, pavement and cycle route is covered in a layer of compacted snow.</p> <p>Yet, one of the first things you see on the city\u2019s streets are bikes. About 20% of all trips in Joensuu are cycled. This drops by about half in the depths of winter but that\u2019s still far better than most Finnish cities, let alone almost anywhere in the UK.</p> <p>I\u2019m in Joensuu because I was invited to come and see the <a href=\"https://www.wintercyclingcongress2020.fi/\">Winter Cycling Congress</a>, an annual gathering of researchers, academics and city officials, which is hosted by a different chilly municipality every year.</p> <p>After a couple of days of speaking to people here, two main lessons have emerged. Firstly, while winter cycling does bring its challenges, these are not always the ones you might expect. Secondly, and this is perhaps more predictable, if you want more people on bikes in winter, it\u2019s less about individuals than infrastructure.</p> <p>In terms of the practicalities of riding on snow, Joensuu-like conditions of compacted snow are pretty easy. Almost everyone I\u2019ve seen pedalling around this week has been using everyday bikes with ordinary tyres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"721753d525a3e2cbb9e75a5667a097b014b251fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/721753d525a3e2cbb9e75a5667a097b014b251fc/0_0_4239_2660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cyclist travels through in Joensuu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cyclist travels through in Joensuu, where about 20% of all trips are cycled.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Hukkanen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ari Varonen, the city\u2019s chief roads engineer, told me that Joensuu\u2019s bike routes are ploughed with the same tractors used for roads. They have a blade to push away fresh snow and add grooves to the surface to make it less slippery. The lanes are then gritted, rather than using bike-corroding salt.</p> <p>If the weather stays below freezing, all is fine. But as Matti Koistinen, head of the Finnish Cyclists\u2019 Federation, explained to me, more varied temperatures are what cause the biggest problems.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s really packed snow, like it is now, it\u2019s comfortable to ride on. But when the temperature goes above 0C it becomes hell. It becomes very slushy, and then when it freezes again it\u2019s pure ice, and really bouncy.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, the consensus seems, it is best to only venture out on a bike with tyres fitted with metal studs, given you can never be sure if a newly refrozen track has been freshly gritted.</p> <p>Joensuu has several advantages as a cycling city. It is relatively small, almost entirely flat, and its wide streets were mainly built in recent decades \u2013 as recently as the 1950s it only had a population of about 7,000.</p> <p>But it also has a comprehensive system of separated cycle routes, some just for bikes, others as part of a wide footway. This is particularly crucial, Varonen told me: \u201cA bike lane just painted on the road wouldn\u2019t work here in winter time. If you have packed snow, you can\u2019t even see the marks. So no one would use it.\u201d</p> <p>Again, we come back to a perennial theme of the bike blog: if you want a lot of people to cycle, you need consistent political will to spend money on proper cycling facilities over the long term.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fea6bce750c7e02c4d2d0bb6ca3626c3daaaed8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fea6bce750c7e02c4d2d0bb6ca3626c3daaaed8d/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mayor, Kari Karjalainen, uses a static bike to power the PA system at the Winter Cycling Congress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mayor, Kari Karjalainen, uses a static bike to power the PA system at the Winter Cycling Congress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Walker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That politicians in Joensuu are committed to cycling, and active transport more generally, is clear from the Winter Cycling Congress. The city\u2019s mayor, Kari Karjalainen, not only greeted delegates at an opening reception but took his turn pedalling the static bike used to power the event\u2019s PA system.</p> <p>There are good reasons for this. Joensuu has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2025, a target it will not manage without significantly reducing transport emissions, which make up 70% of the total.</p> <p>The Finnish government appears equally committed, with a funding programme in place for active travel as part of a target to increase walking and cycling by 30% by 2030. The country as a whole has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2030, 20 years before the UK\u2019s deadline.</p> <p>While cycling groups in Britain are generally marginalised by the government, Koistinen sits as a representative of the cyclists\u2019 federation on the official committee tasked with coming up with ways to reduce emissions.</p> <p>A pitfall of endlessly detailing forward-thinking policies in places such as Joensuu is that people in other countries can be tempted to shrug their shoulders and just assume, well, the Finns do things differently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bd86d801befdc5201803c67b9d1a7af48416c21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bd86d801befdc5201803c67b9d1a7af48416c21/0_124_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a child on a bike in Joensuu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the city\u2019s main school, about half of pupils ride to school in winter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Walker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And to an extent they do: North Karelia, the Finnish region of which Joensuu is the capital was the base for one of the earliest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/befit/story/0,15652,1385645,00.html\">best-known public health experiments in history</a>, when 20 years of efforts led to a drop in historically high rates of heart disease, caused by rampant smoking and a diet largely based around animal fats, by about 80%.</p> <p>But you could take another lesson. The opening event of the Winter Cycling Congress took place at the city\u2019s main school where, the teachers say, about half of pupils still ride to school in winter. On the morning in question, it was -13C and snowing. But the school\u2019s bike racks were full.</p> <p>That\u2019s perhaps something to think about next time you wonder whether you can face a bike ride in winter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In London, where I live, the idea of winter cycling generally involves little more than remembering some gloves and making sure your bike lights are charged. In Joensuu, the compact city in eastern Finland, where I am now, it\u2019s arguably a more serious business. When I got off the train from Helsinki the temperature was -16C (3F), and hasn\u2019t yet risen higher than -6C. Every roadway, pavement and cycle route is covered in a layer of compacted snow. Yet, one of the first things you see on the city\u2019s streets are bikes. About 20% of all trips in Joensuu are cycled. This drops by about half in the depths of winter but that\u2019s still far better than most Finnish cities, let alone almost anywhere in the UK. I\u2019m in Joensuu because I was invited to come and see the Winter Cycling Congress, an annual gathering of researchers, academics and city officials, which is hosted by a different chilly municipality every year. After a couple of days of speaking to people here, two main lessons have emerged. Firstly, while winter cycling does bring its challenges, these are not always the ones you might expect. Secondly, and this is perhaps more predictable, if you want more people on bikes in winter, it\u2019s less about individuals than infrastructure. In terms of the practicalities of riding on snow, Joensuu-like conditions of compacted snow are pretty easy. Almost everyone I\u2019ve seen pedalling around this week has been using everyday bikes with ordinary tyres. Ari Varonen, the city\u2019s chief roads engineer, told me that Joensuu\u2019s bike routes are ploughed with the same tractors used for roads. They have a blade to push away fresh snow and add grooves to the surface to make it less slippery. The lanes are then gritted, rather than using bike-corroding salt. If the weather stays below freezing, all is fine. But as Matti Koistinen, head of the Finnish Cyclists\u2019 Federation, explained to me, more varied temperatures are what cause the biggest problems. \u201cIf it\u2019s really packed snow, like it is now, it\u2019s comfortable to ride on. But when the temperature goes above 0C it becomes hell. It becomes very slushy, and then when it freezes again it\u2019s pure ice, and really bouncy.\u201d At this point, the consensus seems, it is best to only venture out on a bike with tyres fitted with metal studs, given you can never be sure if a newly refrozen track has been freshly gritted. Joensuu has several advantages as a cycling city. It is relatively small, almost entirely flat, and its wide streets were mainly built in recent decades \u2013 as recently as the 1950s it only had a population of about 7,000. But it also has a comprehensive system of separated cycle routes, some just for bikes, others as part of a wide footway. This is particularly crucial, Varonen told me: \u201cA bike lane just painted on the road wouldn\u2019t work here in winter time. If you have packed snow, you can\u2019t even see the marks. So no one would use it.\u201d Again, we come back to a perennial theme of the bike blog: if you want a lot of people to cycle, you need consistent political will to spend money on proper cycling facilities over the long term. That politicians in Joensuu are committed to cycling, and active transport more generally, is clear from the Winter Cycling Congress. The city\u2019s mayor, Kari Karjalainen, not only greeted delegates at an opening reception but took his turn pedalling the static bike used to power the event\u2019s PA system. There are good reasons for this. Joensuu has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2025, a target it will not manage without significantly reducing transport emissions, which make up 70% of the total. The Finnish government appears equally committed, with a funding programme in place for active travel as part of a target to increase walking and cycling by 30% by 2030. The country as a whole has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2030, 20 years before the UK\u2019s deadline. While cycling groups in Britain are generally marginalised by the government, Koistinen sits as a representative of the cyclists\u2019 federation on the official committee tasked with coming up with ways to reduce emissions. A pitfall of endlessly detailing forward-thinking policies in places such as Joensuu is that people in other countries can be tempted to shrug their shoulders and just assume, well, the Finns do things differently. And to an extent they do: North Karelia, the Finnish region of which Joensuu is the capital was the base for one of the earliest and best-known public health experiments in history, when 20 years of efforts led to a drop in historically high rates of heart disease, caused by rampant smoking and a diet largely based around animal fats, by about 80%. But you could take another lesson. The opening event of the Winter Cycling Congress took place at the city\u2019s main school where, the teachers say, about half of pupils still ride to school in winter. On the morning in question, it was -13C and snowing. But the school\u2019s bike racks were full. That\u2019s perhaps something to think about next time you wonder whether you can face a bike ride in winter.",

      "body": "<p>Heading into Friday night\u2019s Democratic debate, the media had effectively declared that the Democratic primary was down to only two viable candidates: Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Indiana, and Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont. Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses had ended with the two candidates effectively tied after disastrous and seemingly systemic incompetence drew out the reporting process for days. The debate in New Hampshire was pitched as a contest between them, a bid to see which would prevail \u2013 the moderate, big money-backed Buttigieg, or the grassroots financing juggernaught of the progressive Sanders. Prognoses pitched the debate as a battle between the party\u2019s ideological factions, and speculated at how the two men would attack each other, and which would prevail.</p> <p>But the five other candidates onstage had other plans. Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, attacked Buttigieg fiercely and repeatedly. The moderate Senator is competing with the mayor for the Democratic party\u2019s right flank, and it made strategic sense for her to go after the man stealing away what she sees as her most likely voters. But there was also what seemed like a degree of sincere personal contempt in Klobuchar\u2019s remarks toward Buttigieg. She has remarked before that his youth and inexperience would not be overlooked so easily in a woman candidate, and her comments on his inconsistent positions and lack of national experience carried with them a sting of anger at his arrogance and easy rise to the top of the polls. The exchanges highlighted Klobuchar\u2019s refreshing authenticity, coming as they did on a stage full of people who are very practiced in saying things they do not mean. This combined with a ready sense of humor made Klobuchar a more charismatic figure on stage than many of her competitors, even as her policy positions continue to tend toward the unimaginative, uninspired, and unambitious, and threaten to reproduce ongoing cruelties.</p> <p>Klobuchar was not alone in attacking Buttigieg, as his competitors for the moderate wing of the party seemed to have determined that he poses the greatest risk to their own success. The billionaire Tom Steyer attacked his inexperience and said that he was afraid that the mayor couldn\u2019t beat Trump. And former Vice President Joe Biden, though often incomprehensible, seemed to make a similar case implying that the mayor would not be able to effectively reach across the aisle. Even Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out that only her campaign and Klobuchar\u2019s were being supported neither through their personal wealth nor through opaque 501(c) 4 organizations, a comment that named no names but implicitly cast aspersions on Buttegeig\u2019s robust fundraising operation, which relies heavily on wealthy individuals and organizations that are not required to disclose their donors.</p> <p>If attacking Buttigieg was popular, the mayor himself did little to convince viewers that he did not deserve it. He responded to questions and volleyed attacks with his accustomed air of rehearsed imprecision, never deviating from his robotic affect and never giving a straight answer. The only time he ever seemed to answer a direct \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d question was once, early in the evening, when he responded in the affirmative to confirm that he was indeed trying to attack Sanders.</p> <p>Buttigieg dodged questions on his healthcare plan and he dodged a question on a troubling history of police racism during his tenure as the Mayor of South Bend. He was heavy on niceties, light on specifics. He made lots of calls for unity, specifically in his attacks on the Senators to his left, but he did not have much to say about what Americans should unify around, or how to persuade them do so. His answers sounded more like marketing copy for a nefarious tech start up than like statements of political principle. He looked, more than anything, like a man who has not relaxed since he was a child.</p> <p>Through his cloud of consultant-speak and imprecision, it became clear that Buttigieg was trying to attack Sanders, and specifically, trying to emphasize that the Vermont Senator was divisive. He wasn\u2019t alone in this project. Biden in particular attacked Sanders, pointing out, correctly, that Sanders has not released a financing plan for his signature Medicare for All plan, and speculated, incorrectly, that the plan would double the federal budget and wildly increase, if not outright double, taxes for working people.</p> <p>For his part, Sanders parried most of these attacks with uncharacteristic patience, and he was at his best when he was making the plain moral case for his progressive positions, as when he called for diverting funds that have been spent on disastrous foreign wars to help fight climate change instead. Still, at times Sanders seemed a bit daunted by the attacks. At one point, he had to walk back and disavow comments made by his own campaign co-chair, Nina Turner. He did not give a concrete answer to a question about his past pro-gun stances. At another point, he answered a question on foreign policy, an area where his competence has improved tremendously since 2016, in a rambling and distracted manner, failing to make the plain humanitarian case for his own noninterventionist position.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that Sanders is not used to receiving these kinds of attacks from his competitors: this is the first time that they are attacking him in a sustained manner, and that is probably because this is the first time that they have taken his candidacy seriously. Withstanding these aggressions is a skill he will have to hone if he is to face Trump in a general election as the party\u2019s nominee.</p> <p>Unexpectedly little was heard from Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who has been largely absent from media narratives about the race in the days since the Iowa caucuses.

      "bodyText": "Heading into Friday night\u2019s Democratic debate, the media had effectively declared that the Democratic primary was down to only two viable candidates: Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Indiana, and Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont. Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses had ended with the two candidates effectively tied after disastrous and seemingly systemic incompetence drew out the reporting process for days. The debate in New Hampshire was pitched as a contest between them, a bid to see which would prevail \u2013 the moderate, big money-backed Buttigieg, or the grassroots financing juggernaught of the progressive Sanders. Prognoses pitched the debate as a battle between the party\u2019s ideological factions, and speculated at how the two men would attack each other, and which would prevail. But the five other candidates onstage had other plans. Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, attacked Buttigieg fiercely and repeatedly. The moderate Senator is competing with the mayor for the Democratic party\u2019s right flank, and it made strategic sense for her to go after the man stealing away what she sees as her most likely voters. But there was also what seemed like a degree of sincere personal contempt in Klobuchar\u2019s remarks toward Buttigieg. She has remarked before that his youth and inexperience would not be overlooked so easily in a woman candidate, and her comments on his inconsistent positions and lack of national experience carried with them a sting of anger at his arrogance and easy rise to the top of the polls. The exchanges highlighted Klobuchar\u2019s refreshing authenticity, coming as they did on a stage full of people who are very practiced in saying things they do not mean. This combined with a ready sense of humor made Klobuchar a more charismatic figure on stage than many of her competitors, even as her policy positions continue to tend toward the unimaginative, uninspired, and unambitious, and threaten to reproduce ongoing cruelties. Klobuchar was not alone in attacking Buttigieg, as his competitors for the moderate wing of the party seemed to have determined that he poses the greatest risk to their own success. The billionaire Tom Steyer attacked his inexperience and said that he was afraid that the mayor couldn\u2019t beat Trump. And former Vice President Joe Biden, though often incomprehensible, seemed to make a similar case implying that the mayor would not be able to effectively reach across the aisle. Even Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out that only her campaign and Klobuchar\u2019s were being supported neither through their personal wealth nor through opaque 501(c) 4 organizations, a comment that named no names but implicitly cast aspersions on Buttegeig\u2019s robust fundraising operation, which relies heavily on wealthy individuals and organizations that are not required to disclose their donors. If attacking Buttigieg was popular, the mayor himself did little to convince viewers that he did not deserve it. He responded to questions and volleyed attacks with his accustomed air of rehearsed imprecision, never deviating from his robotic affect and never giving a straight answer. The only time he ever seemed to answer a direct \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d question was once, early in the evening, when he responded in the affirmative to confirm that he was indeed trying to attack Sanders. Buttigieg dodged questions on his healthcare plan and he dodged a question on a troubling history of police racism during his tenure as the Mayor of South Bend. He was heavy on niceties, light on specifics. He made lots of calls for unity, specifically in his attacks on the Senators to his left, but he did not have much to say about what Americans should unify around, or how to persuade them do so. His answers sounded more like marketing copy for a nefarious tech start up than like statements of political principle. He looked, more than anything, like a man who has not relaxed since he was a child. Through his cloud of consultant-speak and imprecision, it became clear that Buttigieg was trying to attack Sanders, and specifically, trying to emphasize that the Vermont Senator was divisive. He wasn\u2019t alone in this project. Biden in particular attacked Sanders, pointing out, correctly, that Sanders has not released a financing plan for his signature Medicare for All plan, and speculated, incorrectly, that the plan would double the federal budget and wildly increase, if not outright double, taxes for working people. For his part, Sanders parried most of these attacks with uncharacteristic patience, and he was at his best when he was making the plain moral case for his progressive positions, as when he called for diverting funds that have been spent on disastrous foreign wars to help fight climate change instead. Still, at times Sanders seemed a bit daunted by the attacks. At one point, he had to walk back and disavow comments made by his own campaign co-chair, Nina Turner. He did not give a concrete answer to a question about his past pro-gun stances. At another point, he answered a question on foreign policy, an area where his competence has improved tremendously since 2016, in a rambling and distracted manner, failing to make the plain humanitarian case for his own noninterventionist position. It\u2019s clear that Sanders is not used to receiving these kinds of attacks from his competitors: this is the first time that they are attacking him in a sustained manner, and that is probably because this is the first time that they have taken his candidacy seriously. Withstanding these aggressions is a skill he will have to hone if he is to face Trump in a general election as the party\u2019s nominee. Unexpectedly little was heard from Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who has been largely absent from media narratives about the race in the days since the Iowa caucuses. Despite conventional wisdom that the primary grants \u201cthree tickets out of Iowa,\u201d her better-than-expected third place finish has been overlooked in favor of a myopic focus by the pundit class on the emerging rivalry between Buttigieg and Sanders. On the debate stage, Warren tried to use this to her advantage: while her rivals attacked one another and everyone else, she avoided making direct criticisms of other candidates and instead used every answer to make a broad moral case for her own position, tying everything back to her recurring anti-corruption message. At times, this involved some impressive verbal contortions: a question about gun control became an answer about gun control, gun suicides, domestic violence, and the political bribery power of the NRA. She stayed out of the sectarian fights that erupted around her, and depicted herself as a dedicated anticorruption advocate who could rise above the fray. The strategy seemed to be to show herself being the thing that the other candidates kept loudly declaring themselves to be: the unity candidate. Andrew Yang was also present. But a shadow hung over the debate: Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire who entered the presidential race in November. Bloomberg is effectively sitting out the first several contests of the primary cycle, and as a self-funded candidate, he does not qualify for the televised debates. But the super-billionaire is buying huge amounts of airtime in Super Tuesday states to run commercials for his bid; his stiffly smiling face appears whenever you flip on a television. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both went out of their way to say that it was not acceptable for someone so wealthy to try to effectively purchase themselves political office. \u201cA billionaire shouldn\u2019t be able to buy their way into this race,\u201d Warren said. He shouldn\u2019t be able to. But its very possible that he can. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",

At 62 rue des Hell\u00e8nes, surveyor Jean-Baptiste Jonn\u00e9 retrained as a chocolate maker to open his first shop, <strong><a href=\"https://www.alchimieduchocolat.be/\" title=\"\">L\u2019Alchimie du Chocolat</a></strong>, in 2001. Ariane No\u00ebl, the manager of independent clothing boutique <strong><a href=\"https://www.cheep.be/\" title=\"\">Cheep</a></strong> (110 Avenue des Saisons), says her clients range from young students to women in their 90s. Another female entrepreneur, Rachida Bouganzir, oversees the <strong><a href=\"http://www.haricotmagique.be/\" title=\"\">Haricot Magique cafe</a></strong> at See U, with a large indoor and outdoor site for parents and small children. After shopping and coffee, head to the <strong>Cimiti\u00e8re d\u2019Ixelles</strong> to admire art nouveau tombstones at a site calling itself the P\u00e8re Lachaise of Ixelles.</p> <p><strong>Eat and drink<br></strong>Place de la Petite Suisse is the place to go for quality Asian food, with Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai restaurants jostling for space. Bar <strong><a href=\"http://www.lemontmartre.be/\" title=\"\">Le Montmartre</a></strong> on the same square has been an institution for students, academics and couples looking for a quiet pastis or evening of live music since the 1960s, though beer fans also like <strong><a href=\"http://www.le-tavernier.be/\" title=\"\">Tavernier </a></strong>(445 Chauss\u00e9e de Boondael). The pricey <strong><a href=\"https://www.lescavesdalex.be/\" title=\"\">Caves d\u2019Alex</a></strong> restaurant (14 rue Eug\u00e8ne Cattoir) moved last year from near the European Parliament to a spectacular former wine cellar. <strong><a href=\"http://restolaverveine.com/\" title=\"\">La Verveine</a></strong> (375 Avenue de la Couronne) serves French-Moroccan fusion food in a relaxed setting.

It wanted to drive a swanky new avenue through the quaint streets, demolishing 1,600 houses, many of them decorated with original art nouveau tiles. It was classified a \u201clisted area of cultural importance\u201d, but the district was nonetheless threatened with compulsory purchase orders and destruction, until protests by local campaigners finally saw the scheme blocked by the courts. </p> <p>Over the past few years, El Cabanyal has been on the up, but this authentic slice of the city remains undiscovered by most tourists. While there\u2019s a newly cosmopolitan vibe, the quarter\u2019s traditional personality is being cherished by incomers, and the new shops and bars springing up everywhere tend to respect and adapt the vernacular architecture, rather than replace it. It\u2019s a doddle to get here on the metro and, because it\u2019s pancake-flat, it\u2019s enjoyable to explore by bike. Hire one at <strong><a href=\"http://santamarcelitabikes.com/en/landing/\" title=\"\">Santamarcelita</a></strong> (Calle de la Reina 11) for \u20ac10 a day, or join a guided cycle tour with <strong><a href=\"https://www.pobladosdelamar.com/en/home\" title=\"\">Poblados de la Mar </a></strong>(\u20ac25pp, in English on Mondays and Fridays at 10am), starting at bike shop <strong><a href=\"http://todobicivalencia.com/\" title=\"\">Todobici</a></strong> on Calle Serrer\u00eda.</p> <p><strong>See and do<br></strong>From Las Arenas beach turn up Calle Mediterraneo, following the tram tracks \u2013 but keep an ear open as they move silently. Because of El Cabanyal\u2019s grid layout, it\u2019s difficult to get lost. The area is home to two excellent and under-visited museums: <strong><a href=\"https://www.semanasantamarinera.org/\" title=\"\">Museo Semana Santa Marinera</a></strong> (Calle del Rosari 1, closed Mon, free Sun), explains the rituals of Easter week; and <strong>Museo del Arroz</strong> (Rosari 3, \u20ac2, closed Mon, free Sun), housed in an old rice mill, has the lowdown on the main ingredient of classic paella.</p> <p>Not all the <strong>tiled houses</strong> are in good repair \u2013 and all are private, so admire from the outside only. Examples to seek out are Calle Lluch 219 (the upper storey), Calle Progreso 262 and Calle Mediterraneo 37, which has a tiled mosaic showing oxen hauling a fishing boat out of the water at the top of its facade.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dracdelcabanyal/\" title=\"\">El Drac del Cabanyal</a></strong> (Calle de la Reina 191B) sells traditional tiles and other handicrafts and, on the next street, <strong><a href=\"http://www.hiloscuerdasyredes.es/\" title=\"\">Hilos, Cuerdas y Redes</a></strong> (Calle Lluch 159) is a traditional shop selling nautical rope and other boating accessories. Bookshop-cum-bar <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/laBatisfera.cafeterialibreria/\" title=\"\">La Batisfera</a></strong> (Calle de la Reina 167) is a beautiful place to browse Spanish and English books, and the bar has good vegetarian options.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.mercadocabanyal.es/\" title=\"\">Mercado del Cabanyal</a></strong> (every day except Sunday) is a mini-version of Valencia\u2019s central market, selling local specialities such as <em>horchata</em> (a milk drink made from tiger nuts), while the Thursday <strong>Mercadillo </strong>street market on Calle Vilar sells mainly clothes and homewares.</p> <p><strong>Eat and drink</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0871ebad0bcdebf38eca21eb7591ddbe44cb7342\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0871ebad0bcdebf38eca21eb7591ddbe44cb7342/0_104_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"La Fabrica de Hielo Valenica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">La Fabrica de Hielo</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are plenty of traditional spots in El Cabanyal: <strong><a href=\"https://www.emilianobodega.com/\" title=\"\">Casa Monta\u00f1a</a></strong> (C/Jose Benillure 69) is a classic bar that has been going since 1836, where specialities include anchovies and mussels in various ways, but do try the baby broad beans saut\u00e9ed with Iberian ham.

For snacks, <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bodegalapascuala/\" title=\"\">La Pascuala</a></strong> (C/Lluch 299) serves prodigiously large <em>bocadillos</em>.</p> <p>The hippest place for a drink is <strong><a href=\"https://www.lafabricadehielo.net/\" title=\"\">La Fabrica de Hielo</a></strong>, a huge bar in a former ice factory, one road back from the beach (C/Jose Ballaster Gonzalvo 37). It has a busy programme of live music and arts events and tapas supplied by a food caravan.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay<br></strong>On a palm-lined street in the middle of the district, <strong><a href=\"https://www.barracart.com/\" title=\"\">Apartamentos Barracart</a> </strong>(from \u20ac100 a night) has seven bright, large-windowed apartments. <strong><a href=\"https://www.hotelneptunovalencia.com/\" title=\"\">Hotel Neptuno</a></strong> (doubles from \u20ac75 B&amp;B) is a spacious option right on the beach.

For a classic neighbourhood dinner, try <strong><a href=\"https://www.madureiras.pt/list-menu/restaurante-madureira/\" title=\"\">Madureira\u2019s</a></strong> (Rodrigues de Freitas 1) for grilled tiger prawns or a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/08/francesinha-sandwich-porto-portugal\" title=\"\">francesinha</a> </em>(doorstep meaty sandwich). Local favourite <strong>Casa Aleixo </strong>(Esta\u00e7\u00e3o 216) does a mean octopus with rice. Pulled-pork sandwiches at <strong>Casa Guedes</strong> (Pra\u00e7a dos Poveiros 130) are another local staple.</p> <p>Alongside these is a string of exceptional new eateries. Top of the list is <strong><a href=\"https://www.pedrolimao.com/en\" title=\"\">Pedro Lim\u00e3o</a></strong>, on Bonfim\u2019s western side, run by an architect-turned-chef serving fine dining at fair prices (10 courses \u20ac49); it recently added studio rooms upstairs.

Its impressive resurgence over the past decade or so has been largely thanks to creative and commercial entrepreneurs taking advantage of low rents and empty spaces \u2013 apartment blocks, factories \u2013 to create a vibrant infrastructure of galleries, shops, cafes, clubs and bars. Although not as postcard-pretty as Stare Mesto (the old town) or Mala Strana over the river, Hole\u0161ovice\u2019s blend of industrial buildings, 19th- and early 20th-century tenements (with some lovely art nouveau blocks) and occasional communist behemoths makes for interesting meanders, and there are cultural treats aplenty too.</p> <p><strong>See and do<br></strong>Hole\u0161ovice is home to big hitters such as the sprawling, plane-train-and-automobile-filled <strong><a href=\"http://www.ntm.cz/en\" title=\"\">National Technical Museum</a></strong> (Kosteln\u00ed 42), and the <strong><a href=\"https://www.ngprague.cz/en/budova/veletrzni-palac/\" title=\"\">Veletrzni Palace</a> </strong>(Dukelsk\u00fdch hrdin\u016f 47), part of the city\u2019s National Gallery, but there\u2019s plenty of contemporary art on offer too. The <strong><a href=\"https://www.dox.cz/cs/\" title=\"\">Dox Centre for Contemporary Art</a></strong> (Poup\u011btova 1) helped put the district on the map when it opened in 2008, and runs consistently great exhibitions inside a former factory complex. At the revitalised <strong><a href=\"https://www.prazska-trznice.cz/\" title=\"\">Prague Market</a></strong> (on Bubensk\u00e9 embankment), a former slaughterhouse now houses international theatre and circus space <strong><a href=\"http://www.jatka78.cz/en\" title=\"\">Jatka 78</a></strong> and the <strong><a href=\"https://trafogallery.cz/en/\" title=\"\">Trafo Gallery</a></strong>.

It\u2019s named after Via Ostiensis, an arterial road that ran in ancient times from the city\u2019s cattle market to the port town of Ostia. Today, Ostiense has shaken off its industrial past to become a bastion of new restaurants, street art and bars. A scattering of campuses mean there\u2019s a big student population, but there\u2019s also an international crowd, drawn by reasonable rents and a metro link to the city centre. Come here to eat sumptuously and admire historic sites far from the masses.</p> <p><strong>See and do<br></strong>One of the city\u2019s four major basilicas, <a href=\"http://www.basilicasanpaolo.org/\" title=\"\">St Paul\u2019s Outside the Walls</a> on Piazzale San Paolo 1 enjoys a quiet stream of visitors, a far cry from its more famous counterpart, St Peter\u2019s. While it suffered a fire in the 19th century and underwent lengthy repairs, its ancient mosaics and 13th-century cloister were spared. The latter serves as a lovely spot to unwind after a day\u2019s sightseeing. Further down Via Ostiense lies <strong><a href=\"http://www.centralemontemartini.org/\" title=\"\">Centrale Montemartini</a></strong>, arguably Rome\u2019s most underrated museum. Originally an electricity plant, the space was abandoned until 2005 when it was chosen to house artwork from the overcrowded Capitoline Museums. Seek out its delightfully jarring juxtaposition of delicate classical statues and defunct diesel engines and turbines. Head north towards Trastevere and the city centre (keeping an eye out for vibrant street art) and have a look round the <strong>Non-Catholic Cemetery</strong>, the final resting place of Romantic poets and former Rome residents John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley (Via Caio Cestio 12). The ancient pyramid of <strong><a href=\"https://www.coopculture.it/en/heritage.cfm?id=59\" title=\"\">Caius Cestius</a></strong>, constructed in about 12BC, keeps a staid watch over the cemetery. Visitors are allowed inside the pyramid on a guided tour the third and fourth Saturday and Sunday of every month (entrance on Via Raffaele Persichetti).</p> <p>Shops aren\u2019t Ostiense\u2019s forte, but cheese, olive oil, pasta, wine and other edible souvenirs can be purchased from gastronomic megastore <strong><a href=\"https://www.eataly.net/it_it/negozi/roma/\" title=\"\">Eataly</a></strong>, on the south side of Ostiense train station.

      "bodyText": "J\u00e4rntorget/L\u00e5nggatorna, Gothenburg Gothenburg is a city that\u2019s easy to love. While Stockholm tries hard to impress, with polished, hyper-stylised spots, the second city is more naturally cool, and nowhere more so than J\u00e4rntorget and L\u00e5nggatorna, where locals go to let off steam. This spot on the south bank of the Gota was once where sailors and dockworkers with money in their pockets went looking for a good time, and a lively pub culture marks the neighbourhood to this day. It also had a seedier side that has long been replaced with restaurants, culture and even an annual street party, Hela Dagen L\u00e5ng, that is the closest thing Sweden has to Notting Hill Carnival. See and do Whether it\u2019s wafting from a bar or performed live at one of the many venues, music is a constant theme on L\u00e5nggatorna, and vinyl junkies will find two of Gothenburg\u2019s best record stores within a two-minute walk of each other. Dirty Records (Andra L\u00e5nggatan 4) boasts a carefully collated selection of LPs ranging from funk to 1960s psychedelia \u2013 take time to mull over your purchase in their inhouse cafe. A few minutes west is Gothenburg\u2019s biggest secondhand music shop, Andra L\u00e5nggatans Skivhandel (no 33), where it\u2019s worth setting aside some time to dig through endless shelves of records. There are rarities to be found, and patience will be rewarded. When it comes to entertainment, this part of Gothenburg brims with choice, boasting two of the city\u2019s most-esteemed cultural venues. Housed inside an old cinema, Pustervik (J\u00e4rntorgsgatan 12-14) has been entertaining locals since the early 1900s and is the place to go for live music plus a range of club nights. Folkteatern, on nearby Olof Palmes Plats, hosts high-quality theatre, film screenings, and other spoken-word and music performances. For something less highbrow but still highly satisfying, wander up J\u00e4rntorgsgatan to Zamenhof (Esperantoplatsen 5), a huge space open from breakfast until late where the jewel in the crown is a vintage games room. Relive your childhood on its arcade and pinball machines, tackle giant Jenga, or take on some locals at table tennis. Eat and drink For a reasonably priced meal in a striking venue, visit Kaf\u00e9 Magasinet (Tredje L\u00e5nggatan 9) in the neighbourhood\u2019s former auction house. Sourdough pizzas are the speciality and a cosy, plant-filled terrace with a glass roof means you can feel as though you\u2019re outdoors without being at the mercy of Gothenburg\u2019s changeable weather. Next door, Tacos &amp; Tequila (Tredje L\u00e5nggatan 9) is a hugely popular lunch and dinner spot, known particularly for its blackened salmon ceviche. Queuing for a table may be necessary but the no-reservations policy is a blessing: Swedes book tables weeks in advance if they\u2019re given the chance. The Gothenburg beer scene has exploded in the past decade, so find out what all the fuss is about by rounding off the day at Soho Beer House (Andra L\u00e5nggatan 5). This cosy but lively bar has a vast selection from the city\u2019s micro-breweries and knowledgeable staff will be happy to help you pick. Dugges, a brewery at the vanguard of Gothenburg\u2019s craft beer surge, is a must for beer fans. Where to stay You won\u2019t find a hotel in L\u00e5nggatorna and that\u2019s good: it keeps the authentic, local feeling alive, but a 20-minute walk or 10-minute tram journey links the neighbourhood with Gothenburg city centre. There, Avalon Hotel (doubles from \u00a386 B&amp;B) vaunts its feng shui certification, and has stylish rooms plus a rooftop pool with a great view. Lee Roden University Quarter, Brussels This part of Brussels, on the public transport network but pretty much off the tourist trail, has as many elderly residents as young professionals looking for bars and boutiques. You\u2019re as likely to find yourself talking to a new arrival from Africa, opening his dream restaurant, as to a septuagenarian Belgian bar owner. In recent years, the student population \u2013 the city\u2019s main French and Flemish universities are here \u2013 has attracted emerging talent and new investment. Until the end of 2020, the red-brick former army barracks immediately north of the Etterbeek train, tram and bus stops is home to the See U project full of sustainable small businesses, including Brussels\u2019 first pushchair-friendly cafe, a cinema, a velodrome and a weekly organic market. See and do The area is a paradise for entrepreneurs. Wine, spirits and cigar shop Boire et Fumer (Drink and Smoke) has been at 38 Avenue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 for 57 years. Since 2005, it has been run by local Philippe Degand. At 62 rue des Hell\u00e8nes, surveyor Jean-Baptiste Jonn\u00e9 retrained as a chocolate maker to open his first shop, L\u2019Alchimie du Chocolat, in 2001. Ariane No\u00ebl, the manager of independent clothing boutique Cheep (110 Avenue des Saisons), says her clients range from young students to women in their 90s. Another female entrepreneur, Rachida Bouganzir, oversees the Haricot Magique cafe at See U, with a large indoor and outdoor site for parents and small children. After shopping and coffee, head to the Cimiti\u00e8re d\u2019Ixelles to admire art nouveau tombstones at a site calling itself the P\u00e8re Lachaise of Ixelles. Eat and drink Place de la Petite Suisse is the place to go for quality Asian food, with Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai restaurants jostling for space. Bar Le Montmartre on the same square has been an institution for students, academics and couples looking for a quiet pastis or evening of live music since the 1960s, though beer fans also like Tavernier (445 Chauss\u00e9e de Boondael). The pricey Caves d\u2019Alex restaurant (14 rue Eug\u00e8ne Cattoir) moved last year from near the European Parliament to a spectacular former wine cellar. La Verveine (375 Avenue de la Couronne) serves French-Moroccan fusion food in a relaxed setting. Across the road at no 570 is Caf\u00e9 Ricardo\u2019s, serving excellent Portuguese food to a mostly Portuguese clientele. For sinfully good pastries, gluten-free bakery Chambelland opened its first branch outside Paris at 42 Avenue de l\u2019Universite in 2018, while artisanal boulangerie La Fleur du Pain has just opened a new branch at 449 Chauss\u00e9e de Boondael this year. Where to stay The lack of tourists means there are no hotels in the quarter, but a short ride away on the number 8 tram is Avenue Louise and the Pantone Hotel (doubles from \u20ac59 room-only) where rooms are allocated based on the guest\u2019s \u201cmood and preferred colour\u201d. Emily Waterfield El Cabanyal, Valencia While the rest of Valencia was being treated to a Bilbaoesque makeover in the early 2000s, the rightwing city council of the time had it in for the fishing quarter of El Cabanyal, 5km east of the centre. It wanted to drive a swanky new avenue through the quaint streets, demolishing 1,600 houses, many of them decorated with original art nouveau tiles. It was classified a \u201clisted area of cultural importance\u201d, but the district was nonetheless threatened with compulsory purchase orders and destruction, until protests by local campaigners finally saw the scheme blocked by the courts. Over the past few years, El Cabanyal has been on the up, but this authentic slice of the city remains undiscovered by most tourists. While there\u2019s a newly cosmopolitan vibe, the quarter\u2019s traditional personality is being cherished by incomers, and the new shops and bars springing up everywhere tend to respect and adapt the vernacular architecture, rather than replace it. It\u2019s a doddle to get here on the metro and, because it\u2019s pancake-flat, it\u2019s enjoyable to explore by bike. Hire one at Santamarcelita (Calle de la Reina 11) for \u20ac10 a day, or join a guided cycle tour with Poblados de la Mar (\u20ac25pp, in English on Mondays and Fridays at 10am), starting at bike shop Todobici on Calle Serrer\u00eda. See and do From Las Arenas beach turn up Calle Mediterraneo, following the tram tracks \u2013 but keep an ear open as they move silently. Because of El Cabanyal\u2019s grid layout, it\u2019s difficult to get lost. The area is home to two excellent and under-visited museums: Museo Semana Santa Marinera (Calle del Rosari 1, closed Mon, free Sun), explains the rituals of Easter week; and Museo del Arroz (Rosari 3, \u20ac2, closed Mon, free Sun), housed in an old rice mill, has the lowdown on the main ingredient of classic paella. Not all the tiled houses are in good repair \u2013 and all are private, so admire from the outside only. Examples to seek out are Calle Lluch 219 (the upper storey), Calle Progreso 262 and Calle Mediterraneo 37, which has a tiled mosaic showing oxen hauling a fishing boat out of the water at the top of its facade. El Drac del Cabanyal (Calle de la Reina 191B) sells traditional tiles and other handicrafts and, on the next street, Hilos, Cuerdas y Redes (Calle Lluch 159) is a traditional shop selling nautical rope and other boating accessories. Bookshop-cum-bar La Batisfera (Calle de la Reina 167) is a beautiful place to browse Spanish and English books, and the bar has good vegetarian options. Mercado del Cabanyal (every day except Sunday) is a mini-version of Valencia\u2019s central market, selling local specialities such as horchata (a milk drink made from tiger nuts), while the Thursday Mercadillo street market on Calle Vilar sells mainly clothes and homewares. Eat and drink There are plenty of traditional spots in El Cabanyal: Casa Monta\u00f1a (C/Jose Benillure 69) is a classic bar that has been going since 1836, where specialities include anchovies and mussels in various ways, but do try the baby broad beans saut\u00e9ed with Iberian ham. The wine selection covers pretty much all of Spain. For authentic fishy cuisine (such as savoury cake made with squid ink and locally cultivated oysters) head to Taska Lareina (C/Reina 173) in a basement behind one of the Cabanyal\u2019s best facades. For a straightforward, cheap meal try Bodega Bar Flor (C/Marti Grajales 21) next to the market, which has been serving the locals since 1893 (rice dishes predominate: you can\u2019t go wrong with paella but, for something different, try arr\u00f2s amb fesol i naps \u2013 rice with white beans and turnip). Ca Tere (C/Reina 61), in another modernist building, also specialises in rice, but without so much choice. The best place for breakfast is Horno San Vicente (Progreso 148) which sells fresh ensa\u00efmadas, soft coiled buns made with lard and dusted with sugar. The best horchata is from ice-cream specialist La Jijonenca (C/Padre Luis Navarro 307, and Paseo Neptuno 26). For snacks, La Pascuala (C/Lluch 299) serves prodigiously large bocadillos. The hippest place for a drink is La Fabrica de Hielo, a huge bar in a former ice factory, one road back from the beach (C/Jose Ballaster Gonzalvo 37). It has a busy programme of live music and arts events and tapas supplied by a food caravan. Where to stay On a palm-lined street in the middle of the district, Apartamentos Barracart (from \u20ac100 a night) has seven bright, large-windowed apartments. Hotel Neptuno (doubles from \u20ac75 B&amp;B) is a spacious option right on the beach. Further south, near the port, Balcon al Mar (doubles from \u20ac55 room-only) is a pleasant, inexpensive place, with bikes for guests to use. Nick Inman Bonfim, Porto With city-centre rents skyrocketing, this once-bourgeois enclave is fast finding favour with a young, creative crowd. It is only a 20-minute walk from downtown and handy for primary exit routes: Porto\u2019s main bus terminal and train station are on the doorstep and there\u2019s a metro line to the airport. See and do There are no malls in Bonfim, but plenty of cool independent stores, mostly on Rua de Santo Ildefonso. Keep an eye out for bookshop Inc. (no 25), a recent outpost of lifestyle outlet Patch (no 95), and the intimate emporium of cheeses and preserves that is Queijaria Amaral (no 190). Being home to Porto university\u2019s fine arts faculty means Bonfim has always had an active arts scene. For contemporary art, the Senhora Presidenta (Joaquim Ant\u00f3nio de Aguiar 65) and Lehmann + Silva (Duque da Terceira 179) galleries never disappoint. For fans of documentary photography, the recently launched Salut au Monde! (Santos Pousada, 620) is a must. For superb views over the Douro, stroll around the Parque de Nova Sintra (R. do Bar\u00e3o de Nova Sintra). Once private, this small leafy park is now owned by the water authority and has a wonderful collection of old fountains. Eat and drink One of the joys of Bonfim\u2019s relative seclusion from Porto\u2019s tourist boom is the plethora of old-school places to eat. For a classic neighbourhood dinner, try Madureira\u2019s (Rodrigues de Freitas 1) for grilled tiger prawns or a francesinha (doorstep meaty sandwich). Local favourite Casa Aleixo (Esta\u00e7\u00e3o 216) does a mean octopus with rice. Pulled-pork sandwiches at Casa Guedes (Pra\u00e7a dos Poveiros 130) are another local staple. Alongside these is a string of exceptional new eateries. Top of the list is Pedro Lim\u00e3o, on Bonfim\u2019s western side, run by an architect-turned-chef serving fine dining at fair prices (10 courses \u20ac49); it recently added studio rooms upstairs. If meat-free is your bag, back towards the centre \u00c1rvore do Mundo (Duque de Loul\u00e9 228) and Manna (R. da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o 60) serve splendid vegan/veggie fare (Manna also does yoga classes). As for caf\u00e9s and bars, there\u2019s one on nearly every corner. Hip hangouts include speciality coffeehouse Combi (Morgado de Mateus 29) and brunch-lunch-coffee bar Bird of Passage (Duque de Loul\u00e9 185). For great cocktails (and pizza), head to TerraPlana (Av. Rodrigues de Freitas 287). Where to stay Bonfim\u2019s charm owes much to its elegant, early-20th-century townhouses. None is classier than myhomeinporto (from \u20ac200 for 2 nights), a boutique guesthouse run by former interior designer Juan de Mayoralgo. Similarly stylish is the 10-room, French-inspired Cocorico guesthouse (doubles from \u20ac90 room-only). Oliver Balch Neuk\u00f6lln, Berlin Even a decade or so ago, Neuk\u00f6lln, in south-east Berlin, was something of a backwater \u2013 a no-man\u2019s-land beyond the trendy centre. Then the district\u2019s cheap rents and gritty vibe were discovered by the international creatives and students, who moved in among the Turks, Kurds and Arabs to create today\u2019s multikulti ambiance. Shack-like kebab shops and smart restaurants, shisha cafes and shabby-chic dive bars, underground art galleries and commercial casinos sit side by side, and there is always something new to discover. Head to the main drag, Sonnennallee, for tasty, cheap Palestinian and Lebanese food; stroll south-west to villagey Rixdorf, passing stone churches, cobbled streets and lovely Comenius botanical garden; for late-night drinks, try hip Weserstrasse; and for indulgent brunches and vintage browsing it\u2019s hard to beat the area that overlaps with Kreuzberg (Kreuzk\u00f6lln). The coolest area is probably dynamic, fast-changing Schillerkiez, next to Tempelhof park, site of the former city airport and Berlin airlift, which is now a vast recreation area where it\u2019s possible to land-surf, cycle and rollerblade down the former runway. See and do Given the creative influx and affordable rents, it\u2019s no surprise to find a wealth of galleries and cultural spaces in the neighbourhood. These tend to be small and experimental like Loophole (Boddinstrasse 60), a club and music venue in a former brothel that also does site-specific works. The larger Kindl Centre for Contemporary Art (\u20ac5, under-18s free, Am Sudhaus 3) is in a former brewery and has installations and live performances. The district is well known for its vintage shopping and for stores that double as cafes. Sing Blackbird (Sanderstrasse 11) has shoes, jewellery and secondhand clothes, as well as juices, vegan pancakes and bagels. Rag and Bone Man (Briesestrasse 9) focuses on home decor and flowers, tipping into therapeutic services such as counselling. Shio (Weichselstrasse 59) works with local designers and stocks pretty and ethically minded papercraft, jewellery, clothes and home design objects. For food, the Turkish market by the Landwehr canal on Maybachufer has a great range of fresh produce and textiles every Tuesday and Friday. Eat and drink For something cheap, cheerful and filling, hole-in-the-wall Berlin Burger International (Pannierstrasse 5) has specialities such as the Godmother, with mozzarella and serrano ham, plus killer sweet potato wedges. Vietnamese joint Hamy (Hasenheide 10) also offers delicious daily lunch specials for just \u20ac5, while vegans will enjoy Two Planets (Hermannstrasse 230), whose offerings include a famous sourdough bread with avocado, delicious cakes and great salads. Swisher options include Lavanderia Vecchia (Flughafenstrasse 46), which serves rustic trattoria food in a former launderette, and chic new dessert restaurant Coda (Friedelstrasse 47), which has won a Michelin star for its innovative menu of savoury, as well as sweet, concoctions. The full set menu costs \u20ac138 a head but come after dinner and sit at the bar for a cocktail and \u00e0 la carte option. For post-dinner drinks, there are a dozen great bars on Weserstrasse alone, from the grungy, arty \u00c4 (no 40), with its flea market furnishings and foamy draft beers, to swankier cocktail bar TiER (no 42) just up the street. In summer, head to Klunkerkranich (Karl-Marx-Strasse 66), hidden away on the rooftop of a shopping mall, with a laid-back DIY aesthetic, decent DJs and views over the city. If you want to take things up a notch, Sameheads will take you through to the next day, sometimes even longer. Where to stay There aren\u2019t many hotels here, but the H\u00fcttenpalast (from \u20ac70 a night) is quintessential Berlin with its self-built/decorated caravans and huts inside a former factory. Paul Sullivan Powi\u015ble, Warsaw The Powi\u015ble district\u2019s main boulevard on the left bank of the Vistula was once the preserve of dodgy bikers and lonely fishermen. Thanks to Poland\u2019s economic boom it now resembles a carnival every summer, when the temperature usually tops 30C. Time to abandon preconceptions that Warsaw is grey and cold because in the best part of the year it really is green and hot. Pubs and riverboats offer craft beers and cocktails, with street food ranging from pierogi dumplings to pho soup (Warsaw has a big Vietnamese community). Powi\u015ble was on the frontline in the Warsaw uprising against Nazi Germany and wears its shrapnel scars with pride. It\u2019s fitting that the district is now all about people having cycling, roller-blading, volleyball, trampolining, picnics, people deckchairs, ice-cream, live music, dancing and playing in the sand. See and do In the summer, the best way to approach Powi\u015ble is by the free, seasonal tramwaje wodne (water trams) that ferry people to and from the wild beaches on the opposite bank of the river, or with a Veturilo city bike (March-November only) \u2013 your first 20 minutes is free. The major Powi\u015ble landmark is Warsaw University Library (open to the public as well as students), which has an impressive facade of copper panels with texts in Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Old Russian and Old Polish. Its roof garden has a spectacular view. The adjacent Copernicus Science Centre is ideal for children, who can spend hours at the interactive displays. For shopping, Femi Stories (Browarna 4) has women\u2019s and girls\u2019 clothing from independent makers. Poland is one of the biggest producers of furniture in the world, and while buying chairs is rarely an option for holidaymakers, Moma Studio (Wybrze\u017ce Ko\u015bciuszkowskie 45) also has unusual home- and kitchenwares. Down towards the \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski bridge, Elektrownia (Zaj\u0119cza 2b), a former power station, is gradually filling with high-end shops and restaurants \u2013 worth a visit for the early 20th-century industrial architecture. Eat and drink Elektrownia\u2019s fine-dining restaurant is Niewinni Czarodzieje 2.0, where options include beef carpaccio with truffles. Warsaw is one of the world\u2019s top vegan-friendly cities, and Powi\u015ble\u2019s established contribution is Veg Deli (Radna 14), with pumpkin burgers and spinach and \u201cfeta\u201d ravioli. Also worth exploring are the seasonal barges and street food stalls by the river, which change every year. Where to stay At Powi\u015ble\u2019s southern edge, Inbed Hostel (dorm bed from \u00a39, en suite double \u00a326 B&amp;B) has bright, modern rooms close to the underground. By the riverside park is the mid-range Logos (doubles \u00a345 room-only). A luxury option is Robert De Niro\u2019s Nobu at the Rialto (prices tba), opening in the city centre this spring. Keith Lockram Hole\u0161ovice, Prague North of central Prague, on the Vltava\u2019s left bank beyond Letn\u00e1 park, Hole\u0161ovice was for a long time seen as a bleak district with little to offer locals, let alone visitors. Its impressive resurgence over the past decade or so has been largely thanks to creative and commercial entrepreneurs taking advantage of low rents and empty spaces \u2013 apartment blocks, factories \u2013 to create a vibrant infrastructure of galleries, shops, cafes, clubs and bars. Although not as postcard-pretty as Stare Mesto (the old town) or Mala Strana over the river, Hole\u0161ovice\u2019s blend of industrial buildings, 19th- and early 20th-century tenements (with some lovely art nouveau blocks) and occasional communist behemoths makes for interesting meanders, and there are cultural treats aplenty too. See and do Hole\u0161ovice is home to big hitters such as the sprawling, plane-train-and-automobile-filled National Technical Museum (Kosteln\u00ed 42), and the Veletrzni Palace (Dukelsk\u00fdch hrdin\u016f 47), part of the city\u2019s National Gallery, but there\u2019s plenty of contemporary art on offer too. The Dox Centre for Contemporary Art (Poup\u011btova 1) helped put the district on the map when it opened in 2008, and runs consistently great exhibitions inside a former factory complex. At the revitalised Prague Market (on Bubensk\u00e9 embankment), a former slaughterhouse now houses international theatre and circus space Jatka 78 and the Trafo Gallery. Other hotspots include the Chemistry Gallery near the Hl\u00e1vk\u016fv bridge, cultural centre La Fabrika (32 Komunard\u016f) for theatre and concerts, and the highly popular Bio Oko independent cinema on Franti\u0161ka K\u0159\u00ed\u017eka street, which hosts events and festivals. For a splash of green, Letn\u00e1 park\u2019s hilltop location offers fine views across the city as well as beer gardens and, a few minutes\u2019 walk north, Stromovka, the former royal game reserve, is the city\u2019s largest green space. Small but vibrant Veverkova street has become a mini-hub for shoppers, thanks to several retail hotspots in close proximity. Right by Bistro 8 (see below) is Garage Store (no 6), for sneakers and vinyl, and fashion store Jakoby (no 8), for unisex coats, dresses and jumpers, plus vintage outlet Recycle With Love. Right across the road (no 7) is the shop of designer Helena Darbujanova, who sells her own chairs, tables and lamps alongside work of other Czech designers, and Page Five (no 5) which stocks an international array of books, magazines, and posters, and also hosts launches and events. Another great event to look out for is the pop-up Mint Market, which brings together Czech interior, fashion and jewellery designers in Prague Market and other venues. Eat and drink The range of dining and drinking options here is healthy and growing all the time. There\u2019s a choice of hip breakfast and brunch hangouts, from Cafe Letka (Letohradsk\u00e1 44) with its rough walls and handsomely large windows, to the spacious industrial chic of Vnitroblock (Tusarova 31), which doubles as a gallery and concept store. For tasty Czech pastries and cakes, head to the simple Erhart patisserie (Milady Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 56). The stylish Bistro Jankovcova (Jankovcova 14a) has sweet or savoury breakfasts, soups and salads, and Bistro 8 (Veverkova 1410/8) serves Sunday brunches, brisket burgers and pulled pork tacos. For dinner, check out swanky SaSaZu in Prague Market, which matches Asian fusion cuisine to regular DJ sets, or Bar Cobra (M Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 8), whose menu spans mezze plates, wild boar with noodles, and a great selection of wines and cocktails. If you still have energy to hit the dancefloor, grungy Cross Club (Plyn\u00e1rn\u00ed 23) has live shows, DJ nights and themed parties pretty much every night, while the slicker Mecca (U Pr\u016fhonu 3) is the spot for house music all night long. Where to stay There are a few options for overnighting in Hole\u0161ovice. Budget travellers can bed down at the friendly and vibrant Sir Toby\u2019s hostel (private doubles from \u00a330 room-only). Slightly more upscale is Mama Shelter (doubles from \u00a350 room-only), in a former listed communist hotel. Paul Sullivan Ostiense, Rome The Ostiense neighbourhood, right on the Tiber river, was once the site of a power station, a restless river port and a gasometer, whose skeleton still looms. It\u2019s named after Via Ostiensis, an arterial road that ran in ancient times from the city\u2019s cattle market to the port town of Ostia. Today, Ostiense has shaken off its industrial past to become a bastion of new restaurants, street art and bars. A scattering of campuses mean there\u2019s a big student population, but there\u2019s also an international crowd, drawn by reasonable rents and a metro link to the city centre. Come here to eat sumptuously and admire historic sites far from the masses. See and do One of the city\u2019s four major basilicas, St Paul\u2019s Outside the Walls on Piazzale San Paolo 1 enjoys a quiet stream of visitors, a far cry from its more famous counterpart, St Peter\u2019s. While it suffered a fire in the 19th century and underwent lengthy repairs, its ancient mosaics and 13th-century cloister were spared. The latter serves as a lovely spot to unwind after a day\u2019s sightseeing. Further down Via Ostiense lies Centrale Montemartini, arguably Rome\u2019s most underrated museum. Originally an electricity plant, the space was abandoned until 2005 when it was chosen to house artwork from the overcrowded Capitoline Museums. Seek out its delightfully jarring juxtaposition of delicate classical statues and defunct diesel engines and turbines. Head north towards Trastevere and the city centre (keeping an eye out for vibrant street art) and have a look round the Non-Catholic Cemetery, the final resting place of Romantic poets and former Rome residents John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley (Via Caio Cestio 12). The ancient pyramid of Caius Cestius, constructed in about 12BC, keeps a staid watch over the cemetery. Visitors are allowed inside the pyramid on a guided tour the third and fourth Saturday and Sunday of every month (entrance on Via Raffaele Persichetti). Shops aren\u2019t Ostiense\u2019s forte, but cheese, olive oil, pasta, wine and other edible souvenirs can be purchased from gastronomic megastore Eataly, on the south side of Ostiense train station. Beyond the basilica, zero-waste shop Negozio Leggero sells anything from beauty products to chocolate to spices, all packaging-free (Via Chiabrera 80). Food and drink Locals and expats flock to restaurant and micro-bakery Marigold (Via Giovanni da Empoli 37), run by Sophie, who\u2019s from Denmark, and her Calabrese partner Domenico, for its cosy atmosphere and homely dishes. Instead of the traditional Italian breakfast of caff\u00e8 and cornetto (croissant), they serve dishes like eggs benedict, pancakes or fluffy cheese omelettes. At lunch and dinner there will be handmade pasta and plenty of vegetable-lush dishes too. Doted on by critics \u2013 it even made the Michelin Guide\u2019s coveted Bib Gourmand list this year \u2013 Trattoria Pennestri (Via Giovanni da Empoli 5) flirts with both traditional Roman and gourmet cuisine. Tuck into a glossy plate of carbonara, or mains such as roasted octopus with peppers, mint and yogurt; and suckling pig with porcini mushrooms and myrtle. There\u2019s no chance you\u2019ll wangle a table without booking. Staunch titans of cucina romana such as tripe, cacio e pepe, and salt cod anchor the kitchen of Osteria Fratelli Mori near the cemetery (Via dei Conciatori 10). It\u2019s also one of the rare Rome restaurants that can easily accommodate a large group. Once the sun goes down, head to Caff\u00e8 Letterario (Via Ostiense 95), a cafe, bookshop and cultural space that moonlights as a cocktail bar. In hot weather, sip a glass of red on the terrace at T-Bar (Via Ostiense 182) or in the Instagrammable courtyard of Porto Fluviale (Via del Porto Fluviale 22). For late-night munchies, chocolate-chip-studded sweet buns from Il Pangocciolaio (Via dei Magazzini Generali 15) hit the spot. Where to stay Gasometer Urban Suites (studio with kitchenette from \u20ac86) is a former wool processing plant turned hotel with a gym and roof terrace. Alexandra Bruzzese Dor\u0107ol, Belgrade In between the touristy Skadarlija quarter, the huge Kalemegdan fortress and banks of the Danube, Dor\u0107ol has a comfortable air about it that doesn\u2019t immediately scream cool. But it has always been the pace-setter for the city\u2019s bars and restaurants. The tree-lined streets of its southern part \u2013 Gornji (Upper) Dor\u0107ol \u2013 have the usual Belgrade hotchpotch of early 20th-century villas and Tito-era flats, with the occasional art nouveau beauty. This is classic bar territory, with new openings and old favourites alike squeezed into streets such as Strahinji\u0107a Bana, Kneginje Ljubice and Kralja Petra. But head into Dornji (Lower) Dor\u0107ol towards the Danube and things get grittier, with funky little cafes, craft breweries, arts centres and street art taking over rundown industrial buildings. It\u2019s not pretty, but it\u2019s where things are moving along briskly. See and do Dor\u0107ol Platz (Dobra\u010dina 59) in Dornji Dor\u0107ol is a collection of old industrial buildings that have been transformed into a nicely scruffy cultural centre with a cafe and garden. It hosts everything from gigs and vinyl markets to festivals, including the Mikser Festival of Design, held each May. From here it\u2019s a few minutes\u2019 walk to the Museum of Science and Technology (Skenderbegova 51), whose exhibits trace the story of technology in Serbia in an entertaining way. Fans of vintage gear should check out Jane Doe Vintage Shop (Kapetan Mi\u0161ina 17) and its larger concept store and bar (Gospodar Jevremova 25). Dor\u0107ol isn\u2019t particularly awash with green spaces, but it does have a lovely, wide cycle and footpath along the Danube, and past Novak Djokovic\u2019s Novak Tennis Centre. Eat and drink The choice of bars and restaurants in Dor\u0107ol is quite dizzying. There are traditional and long-established favourites on leafy Strahinji\u0107a Bana but a short walk to the south, Blaznavac (Kneginje Ljubice 18) serves \u00a34 cocktails and \u00a31.50 pints of beer in a fantastically bonkers garden and equally eccentric interior. It\u2019s just a few feet from Iris New Balkan Cuisine (Kneginje Ljubice 11), which does more elegant versions of hefty Serbian dishes, including pork neck (\u00a37). The craze for craft beer hasn\u2019t passed Belgrade by: there are several brewpubs around Dor\u0107ol. Gvint Brewery in Dor\u0107ol Platz is a genial place to try lagers and ales for about \u00a31.50 a pint. At Beogradski Market (\u017dor\u017ea Klemansoa 19), craft breweries such as Dogma and Tron share the vast hangar-like space with food stalls selling anything from tapas to sushi. In the midst of Dornji Dor\u0107ol\u2019s street art and ramshackle former workshops, fine-dining restaurant Homa (Senjanina Ive) stands out with its gleaming white minimalism. Plates of poached trout with trout roe (\u00a314) and steak tartare with bone marrow (\u00a312) are pricey by local standards, but worth it. Where to stay Fifties decor meets industrial chic in Smokvica B&amp;B (doubles from \u20ac65), with six airy rooms in a 1929 villa in Upper Dor\u0107ol. Its lively bar and restaurant spills into a courtyard garden. Mary Novakovich Quartier de la R\u00e9union, Paris The 20th arrondissement, in eastern Paris, is well-known for the place where Oscar Wilde and Edith Piaf are buried, but a short walk away, hidden from the crowds, is a genuine village, Charonne, little known to tourists. Circular Place de la R\u00e9union, laid out in 1850, is the heart of this friendly, bohemian quartier populaire, a multicultural area of working families, artists and musicians. The square comes alive on Thursday and Sunday mornings, when it teems with people browsing market stalls set up by butchers, cheese- and fishmongers, and fruit and vegetable sellers. But there is another hub here that is open every day, from 7am to 2am. Caf\u00e9 Sans Nom, on the corner of rue de la R\u00e9union, does not need a name (or a website) as it is more a community centre for everyone living in or passing by the square, from school-run mums or pensioners sipping a coffee while reading newspapers and books from the cafe\u2019s free library, to the crowd who arrive for drinks after midnight. See and do You won\u2019t find chic boutiques in this neighbourhood, but rather quirky, ethical shops such as L\u2019Escargot d\u2019Or (53 rue de Bagnolet) where Gilles Coolen roasts fairtrade coffee beans and makes delicious artisan chocolate. On the other side of the street (no 52), Agn\u00e8s Baracco stocks Au Bon Vingt, her pioneering natural wine cellar, with over 400 varieties, which she loves explaining to visitors. At no 69, La Botica (no 69) is a new shop and gallery showcasing young artists, designers and stylists, with changing themes that cover photography and illustration, jewellery and vintage clothes, prints and ceramics. Eat and drink Everyone\u2019s favourite Sunday begins at 6pm in the funky Quartier Rouge bistro (52 rue de Bagnolet), which hosts a weekly three-hour jazz jam session. Entry is free and a glass of wine is \u20ac3.50, but be sure to contribute when the musicians\u2019 hat is passed round. It also serves tasty no-frills French cuisine, but for a bit more choice, take a five-minute walk to romantic rue des Vignoles, which is lined with laid-back bars and restaurants. La Petite Fabrique (no 15) is a spacious bio-canteen offering a perfect combination of organic cuisine (maybe vegetarian paella, juicy beef tournedos or a vegan sweet potato gratin with seitan sausages) and natural wines, served at long communal tables. Almost next door, Les Mondes Boh\u00e8mes (no 31) is a popular hangout whose verdant covered terrace resembles a greenhouse; it\u2019s great for salads, burgers and ice-cream. Wander down some of the narrow plant-lined alleyways (impasses) off rue des Vignoles \u2013 perhaps the evocative Impasse Satan or bucolic Impasse Poule \u2013 and imagine the time when this was all vineyards, la campagne \u00e0 Paris. For a last drink, finish up at the arty Moki Bar (no 61), enjoying its kitsch 1970s decor and pinball machines, exhibitions, funky music and great mojitos. Where to stay Recently renovated H\u00f4tel Terre Neuve (doubles from \u20ac99 room-only) is five minutes\u2019 walk from Place de la R\u00e9union, but the fashion-minded may prefer the Philip Starck-designed Mama Shelter (doubles from \u20ac139 room only), the first of this now-global hip hotel chain.

It snuck into cinemas in the form of guy-centric grossouts from Judd Apatow, or indies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/22/the-big-sick-review-kumail-nanjiani-zoe-kazan-judd-apatow\">The Big Sick</a>, or even disguised as prestige musicals like La La Land. TV picked up the slack, with The Mindy Project, Lovesick and Jane the Virgin variously embracing, playing with or subverting the genre.</p> <p>Except it turns out that the big, traditional romcom was not quite as lifeless as we thought. In 2018, Netflix declared a \u201csummer of love\u201d and embarked on a campaign to woo us back to joyously escapist and predictable schmaltz. It appears to have succeeded: the streaming giant reported that 80 million people watched at least one of its original romcoms in the following three months. Now it is set to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day with a sequel to breakout hit To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before (now with the gooey addendum P.S. I Still Love You).</p> <p>And if McConaughey thought he\u2019d had a renaissance, 2020 is shaping up to give romcoms the same, with a wealth of new releases slated to make us go weak at the knees. Among others, there is Love. Wedding. Repeat, starring Sam Claflin and Olivia Munn (Netflix bought the rights at Cannes), Marry Me, with old hands Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson, and a double offering from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/issa-rae\">Issa Rae</a> \u2013 she stars in The Photograph with Lakeith Stanfield and The Lovebirds with Kumail Nanjiani.

Rubbished by critics as lightweight fluff, avoided by male audiences and mocked by wider pop culture, they went from bubbly box-office hits to guilty pleasures \u2013 something that their largely female fans were embarrassed to admit to liking. As Dr Deborah Jermyn, a reader in film and television at the University of Roehampton, says: \u201c[Romcoms have] always been held in low esteem. The association of romantic comedy for many years was that it\u2019s a \u2018women\u2019s genre\u2019 \u2013 that it\u2019s nothing to be taken seriously, it\u2019s trivial.\u201d Like \u201cchick-lit\u201d, romcoms have been afforded little cultural value because they not only played to women but put them front and centre. As Dr Jermyn says: \u201cYou get to hear women speak on screen for much longer than in other kinds of cinema.\u201d</p> <p>Martha Shearer, assistant professor in film studies at University College Dublin, says that the romcom\u2019s largely female audience is unfairly condescended to. \u201cThere are a lot of assumptions being made about the people who watch them \u2013 that they are dupes or can\u2019t see that genre films are conventional \u2013 in the way that the person making that criticism evidently can. It\u2019s a fundamentally elitist criticism,\u201d she says. \u201cMass female audiences are more than capable of responding to media texts critically at the same time as enjoying them.\u201d</p> <p>The best romcoms are similarly cognisant of the genre\u2019s conventions. For a romcom to succeed, it has to be unashamedly sincere. Characters are required to believe in love and although they might come up against obstacles, they will overcome them. We know \u2013 because we know romcoms \u2013 that they will have a happy ending (although it might not be the one you thought).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"273cf110a040823c05eba10e299253b3f0c75769\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/273cf110a040823c05eba10e299253b3f0c75769/0_46_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Love, Simon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Too cool for school\u2026 Love, Simon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rothstein/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new raft of romantic comedies are unashamedly in this tradition. They are overblown, standing-on-the-cafeteria-table, public declarations of love to the genre. Beyond To All the Boys \u2026 there\u2019s gay high-school romcom Love, Simon; Set It Up, a snappy Netflix story about two overworked assistants setting up their demanding bosses only to fall for each other; and Always Be My Maybe, a funny, charming love story about actual grownups, played by Ali Wong and Randall Park.</p> <p>Although some have played in cinemas \u2013 such as mega-hit Crazy Rich Asians and Long Shot, with Charlize Theron and Seth Rogan \u2013 it is streaming where new romcoms have really rediscovered their mojo. It makes sense. When female fans in particular have relentlessly had their taste questioned, why not retreat to the safety of their own homes to watch without fear of ridicule? Streaming plays to all the strengths of romcom success: word-of-mouth buzz, rewatches, movie marathons. They do not require Imax viewing (a laptop screen will do just fine), and if you fall asleep in the middle, you will probably be able to pick things up pretty quickly.</p> <p>What all these films share is real affection and respect for the genre, their characters and the people watching them. They understand the necessary components for giving us exactly what we want, right down to the corny titles. When romcoms were a dime-a-dodgy-dozen in the later 00s, there was a tendency for studios to think their audiences were hooked by silliness and contrivance (eg Ghosts of Girlfriends Past), instead of the real attraction: human connection (albeit between outrageously good-looking people with beautiful homes and enormous wardrobes).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9da237d30e92f9b738232f5ce90143c463ea7192\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9da237d30e92f9b738232f5ce90143c463ea7192/0_360_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sonoya Mizuno in Crazy Rich Asians.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild bride\u2026 Sonoya Mizuno in Crazy Rich Asians.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the feminist writer and self-proclaimed romcom fanatic Roxane Gay has said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I believe love actually happens the way Hollywood pretends it does \u2026 I do, however, enjoy a good lie.\u201d She even suggests that gaping plot holes are essential, in order to distract us from how absurdly straightforward they make out love to be.</p> <p>But even as the core elements remain, it is not all the same old same old. Along with the gendered snobbiness aimed at romcoms, there have also been plenty of fair critiques: it is true that they almost exclusively told white, wealthy, heterosexual stories. The considerable crop of successful black romcoms such as Love &amp; Basketball or The Best Man were consigned to their cultural niche rather than welcomed into the canon. The new class of romcoms is attempting to give us considerably more diverse casts (including leads) as well as more inclusive non-heterosexual love stories such as Happiest Season, a Clea Duvall-directed lesbian romcom starring Kristen Stewart, and a still-untitled gay romcom written by and starring Billy Eichner and produced by Judd Apatow. And because romcoms demand happy endings, they are a space where minority stories can be told with hope and joy, something not always afforded them in mainstream prestige storytelling.</p> <p>There are other changes, too, such as paying attention to power dynamics, body-shaming, sexual politics, toxic gender stereotyping and portrayals of consent (which the new To All the Boys sequel makes a clear point of addressing). In other words, we\u2019re unlikely to see remakes of Never Been Kissed, in which a high-school teacher cultivated a very problematic relationship with one of his students (crucially before he finds out she\u2019s actually a 25-year-old undercover journalist), and Shallow Hal, in which Jack Black can only be attracted to a fat woman if he\u2019s bewitched into thinking she looks like Gwyneth Paltrow (minus the fat suit). Of course not all the newcomers will be woke, or indeed even any good: Netflix\u2019s The Kissing Booth \u2013 a high-school love triangle in which possessive brothers both lay claim to a sweet, naive heroine \u2013 is a culprit of being both pretty rubbish and romanticising emotionally manipulative behaviour. Of course, it\u2019s getting a sequel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bf93671a8581360be1930f7651aac42d02f3a7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bf93671a8581360be1930f7651aac42d02f3a7a/0_177_3064_1839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker in Failure to Launch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damp squib\u2026 Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker in Failure to Launch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Films like this and To All the Boys sit at the teen end of the spectrum \u2013 all high-school drama and first loves \u2013 but they are playing to Netflix\u2019s legions of young viewers.

Dr Jermyn says there is a good reason romcoms have such longevity: \u201cWhatever\u2019s going on in the world, if we\u2019re in a peak or a trough in terms of global politics, you can\u2019t really get away from the charm and the belief in the fact that people will meet and fall in love, whatever the circumstances. That\u2019s always going to keep driving it.\u201d</p> <p>The world is a complicated place and a lot of people live under trying circumstances. It makes sense then that we would turn to the cynicism-free comfort of a romcom, a safe space for us to experience and express emotion, with limited peril. It is perhaps the one genre that truly understands the value of short-but-sweet, rarely coming in much over 100 minutes; in a market saturated by choice, this is not to be sniffed at. Good romcoms can see you through breakups, honeymoon periods, actual periods, hangovers, bad days and good days. They ring true to teenagers who have never even held hands, and to jaded romantics who think they have seen it all. What romcoms lacked in the Matthew McConaughey-leaning-against-a-succession-of-women era was an understanding that love \u2013 and all the meet-cutes, hijinks, misunderstandings, mistaken identities and heartache that come with it \u2013 doesn\u2019t only happen to straight, white people. Being formulaic isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing when the formula works; it\u2019s just some of the components that need an update.</p> <p>Everyone deserves to see themselves dating someone for a bet, having a snog in the rain and realising that maybe the right person was in front of them all along.

      "body": "<p>One thing is terrifyingly clear: if optimism is contagious, so is pessimism. The Labour party doesn\u2019t seem just miserable because it lost; it imparts despair and anxiety.</p> <p>These are not unfamiliar feelings to many. The last week of January is said to be depressing but it was also when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/jubilation-and-bereavement-11pm-finds-the-uk-no-less-divided-over-brexit\" title=\"\">Brexit happened</a> and change was in the air.

Instead of talking about infrastructure and immigration, we talked about something much more intangible. Happiness: Lessons from a New Science, the economist Richard Layard\u2019s book, published in 2005, had a massive impact on public discourse. It started asking government to be concerned with something even more vague than happiness: \u201cwellbeing\u201d.</p> <p>Wellbeing, like happiness, is self\u2013reported. You can ask me how I am. You don\u2019t really want to know, but we can all tick the boxes.

      "bodyText": "One thing is terrifyingly clear: if optimism is contagious, so is pessimism. The Labour party doesn\u2019t seem just miserable because it lost; it imparts despair and anxiety. These are not unfamiliar feelings to many. The last week of January is said to be depressing but it was also when Brexit happened and change was in the air. Mood matters. Those who fail to read the mood of the populace are destined never to govern it, but we have very few ways of talking about feelings in political terms. Do you remember the brief time when we did? Instead of talking about infrastructure and immigration, we talked about something much more intangible. Happiness: Lessons from a New Science, the economist Richard Layard\u2019s book, published in 2005, had a massive impact on public discourse. It started asking government to be concerned with something even more vague than happiness: \u201cwellbeing\u201d. Wellbeing, like happiness, is self\u2013reported. You can ask me how I am. You don\u2019t really want to know, but we can all tick the boxes. The statistics on mental health \u2013 about one in four Britons will experience a mental health problem each year \u2013 are really telling us that many of us are very far from any sense of wellbeing. Joining the dots between policy and individual happiness became mainstream. David Cameron tried to talk about \u201ca national happiness index\u201d as the post-crash economy was in turmoil.

In the event of a rout, he said he would fight to retain leadership of Fine Gael and lead the party in opposition. Fianna F\u00e1il, the main opposition party, is tipped to emerge as the biggest party, putting its leader, Miche\u00e1l Martin, in pole position to woo smaller parties to form a parliamentary majority and ruling alliance. Polling stations opened at 7am on Saturday and will close at 10pm, after which media outlets will report an exit poll.

Authorities have issued wind and rain warnings as Storm Ciara barrels in from the Atlantic, which could affect turnout. Ireland\u2019s Six Nations rugby showdown with Wales in Dublin could be another distraction. Varadkar, 41, Ireland\u2019s first gay taoiseach, hoped an economy humming at near full employment and his handling of Brexit would help deliver a third consecutive term for his centre-right party. However, voter anger at homelessness, soaring rents and disintegrating healthcare services has dominated the campaign and fuelled calls for change. Fianna F\u00e1il has also reaped some backlash because it supported Fine Gael\u2019s minority administration in a confidence-and-supply deal, prompting accusations that the two centrist rivals comprised a duopoly. Under its leader, Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn F\u00e9in, once shunned by voters as the IRA\u2019s political wing during the Troubles, has tapped desire for a leftwing alternative that will deliver better healthcare and more affordable housing. Smaller leftwing parties and independents fear being swamped in a Sinn F\u00e9in tide. The public\u2019s focus on bread-and-butter issues rather than the climate crisis frustrated the Greens but the party is still hoping to gain seats and a position in government. An opinion poll early this week gave Sinn F\u00e9in 25% support, nosing ahead of Fianna F\u00e1il and outpacing Fine Gael, which languished in third. During a final canvas in Cabra, her neighbourhood in Dublin, McDonald, 50, urged supporters to back Sinn F\u00e9in as a \u201cvehicle for change\u201d. The party traditionally underperforms in elections when compared with polling predictions. And it fielded just 42 candidates for the 160-seat D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament, so support will not fully translate into seats. Sinn F\u00e9in also may have shed support when a notorious 2007 murder blamed on the IRA returned to haunt it this week, forcing McDonald to revisit the party\u2019s links with the the terrorist group.

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person.

Today, fewer than 20% of its citizens are black. Then, it was narrowly majority black. White workers lived next to blacks and the black bourgeoisie was as proud and affluent as could be found anywhere in the US.</p> <p>On 10 November 1898, by train and streetcar, a lynch mob arrived.</p> <p>A black newspaper owner, Alexander L Manly, had written an editorial which dared debunk a cherished ideal, that of the inviolate purity of white women. Most black men charged with rape of white women, Manly wrote, had merely been discovered with willing lovers. But white men raped black women with impunity.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t think ever that your women will remain pure while you are debauching ours. You sow the seed \u2013 the harvest will come in due time.\u201d</p> <p>White papers knew just how to manipulate readers in return: to sound the clarion call, the old libel: that black men were out to take their jobs and women. Amid exhortations to restore decency and white government, white men stockpiled weapons.</p> <p>Torching the Daily Record and banishing its impudent owner were a priority. But the mob of 2,000 did more, killing between 60 and 300 black people, injuring hundreds and driving 2,000, including \u201crace traitors\u201d, into permanent exile.</p> <p>Forcing resignations at gunpoint, they overthrew a municipal government on which served two black aldermen and seven whites, elected by black and white workers alike.</p> <p>This brutal coup was carried out by the mob. But it was fueled by an embittered, vengeful elite. To them, in 1861, seceding from the union had made perfect sense. Alone, the value of the Confederate states\u2019 nearly 4 million slaves exceeded the amount invested in every bank, railroad and industry in the US combined. For more than a century, cotton was America\u2019s leading export.</p> <p>High hopes were dashed by defeat. Rebel leaders saw their property confiscated. But during Reconstruction, even under occupation by federal troops, even with white former combatants disenfranchised, the rights of blacks remained precarious. Once the troops withdrew, intimidation and terror, voter suppression and ballot stuffing, all arrived in earnest.</p> <p>Confederates regained vote and property by so small an expedient as pledging loyalty to a victor they thoroughly loathed. By 1898, North Carolina\u2019s unrepentant planter class had flipped the state legislature from a Republican-Populist alliance back to the Democrats of old.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/28/american-dialogue-review-history-founders-politics-trump-era\">American Dialogue review: elegant history meets the Trump era</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Wilmington, coup leader Col Alfred Waddell proclaimed a \u201cWhite Declaration of Independence\u201d and installed himself as mayor. And that was that. Locals came almost to believe the official version of events: it had been a \u201crace riot\u201d, started by blacks. Via poll taxes and grandfather clauses, seven decades of black disenfranchisement ensued.</p> <p>But were such tactics less deliberate and systematic than the gentrification of today, so different from the gerrymandering and voter ID efforts of modern Republicans? Was the evisceration of the Voting Rights Act led by the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, citing a \u201cchanged south\u201d, distinct from the evacuation of federal soldiers so long ago?</p> <p>Each action has left black self-governance further curtailed.</p> <p>Michael Jordan, the pioneering architect Robert Taylor, tennis great Althea Gibson: all were raised in Wilmington. Zucchino\u2019s book should make their seaside town known again for one of the darkest events in American history.</p> <p>The author quotes a pamphlet produced in 1898 by a black Wilmington exile, the Rev J Allen Kirk. Titled A Statement of Facts Concerning the Bloody Riot in Wilmington, North Carolina of Interest to Every Citizen of the United States, it is worth quoting at length:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was a great sight to see them marching from death, and colored men, colored women, colored children, colored enterprise and colored people all exposed to death. Firing began, and it seemed like a mighty battle in wartime. The shrieks and screams of children of mothers of wives were heard, such as cause the blood of the most inhuman person to creep. Thousands \u2026 rushed to the swamps, and lay upon the earth to freeze and starve. The woods were filled with colored people. The streets were dotted with their dead bodies \u2026</p> </blockquote>",

How else can so large a segment of Donald Trump\u2019s base persist in defending all he does while his policies hit them hard? How can farmers agree with tariffs that cripple them? How can laid-off auto workers go along with a tax plan that offers them little relief? Though the majority of welfare recipients are white, why is the caricature of a black woman loading a child-filled SUV with food stamp-obtained steaks and lobsters more visceral and despised than that of any recipient of corporate welfare? How do the 1% get away with scamming the system? Why is \u201clegal\u201d tax cheating, multibillion-dollar profits sheltered offshore, not condemned more? As Lyndon Johnson warned, it is because the strongest fear among white Americans is not that blacks with little will gain too much. It is that whites will lose everything that is central to their identity. White supremacy is about believing that the poorest, \u201cworst\u201d, least-educated white is superior to the \u201cbest\u201d black. It matters not how talented, intelligent or scrupulously trained that African American might be. Trump will be counted a far greater president than Barack Obama. Melania Trump will be seen to be more beautiful and accomplished than Michelle. In his riveting book, Zucchino retells one horrifying attempt to re-establish the \u201crightful place\u201d of former slaves: starkly isolated, with scant hope of parity. At the end of the 19th century, Wilmington, North Carolina, was a prosperous port. Today, fewer than 20% of its citizens are black. Then, it was narrowly majority black. White workers lived next to blacks and the black bourgeoisie was as proud and affluent as could be found anywhere in the US. On 10 November 1898, by train and streetcar, a lynch mob arrived. A black newspaper owner, Alexander L Manly, had written an editorial which dared debunk a cherished ideal, that of the inviolate purity of white women. Most black men charged with rape of white women, Manly wrote, had merely been discovered with willing lovers. But white men raped black women with impunity. \u201cDon\u2019t think ever that your women will remain pure while you are debauching ours. You sow the seed \u2013 the harvest will come in due time.\u201d White papers knew just how to manipulate readers in return: to sound the clarion call, the old libel: that black men were out to take their jobs and women. Amid exhortations to restore decency and white government, white men stockpiled weapons. Torching the Daily Record and banishing its impudent owner were a priority. But the mob of 2,000 did more, killing between 60 and 300 black people, injuring hundreds and driving 2,000, including \u201crace traitors\u201d, into permanent exile. Forcing resignations at gunpoint, they overthrew a municipal government on which served two black aldermen and seven whites, elected by black and white workers alike. This brutal coup was carried out by the mob. But it was fueled by an embittered, vengeful elite. To them, in 1861, seceding from the union had made perfect sense. Alone, the value of the Confederate states\u2019 nearly 4 million slaves exceeded the amount invested in every bank, railroad and industry in the US combined. For more than a century, cotton was America\u2019s leading export. High hopes were dashed by defeat. Rebel leaders saw their property confiscated. But during Reconstruction, even under occupation by federal troops, even with white former combatants disenfranchised, the rights of blacks remained precarious. Once the troops withdrew, intimidation and terror, voter suppression and ballot stuffing, all arrived in earnest. Confederates regained vote and property by so small an expedient as pledging loyalty to a victor they thoroughly loathed. By 1898, North Carolina\u2019s unrepentant planter class had flipped the state legislature from a Republican-Populist alliance back to the Democrats of old. In Wilmington, coup leader Col Alfred Waddell proclaimed a \u201cWhite Declaration of Independence\u201d and installed himself as mayor. And that was that. Locals came almost to believe the official version of events: it had been a \u201crace riot\u201d, started by blacks. Via poll taxes and grandfather clauses, seven decades of black disenfranchisement ensued. But were such tactics less deliberate and systematic than the gentrification of today, so different from the gerrymandering and voter ID efforts of modern Republicans? Was the evisceration of the Voting Rights Act led by the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, citing a \u201cchanged south\u201d, distinct from the evacuation of federal soldiers so long ago? Each action has left black self-governance further curtailed. Michael Jordan, the pioneering architect Robert Taylor, tennis great Althea Gibson: all were raised in Wilmington. Zucchino\u2019s book should make their seaside town known again for one of the darkest events in American history. The author quotes a pamphlet produced in 1898 by a black Wilmington exile, the Rev J Allen Kirk. Titled A Statement of Facts Concerning the Bloody Riot in Wilmington, North Carolina of Interest to Every Citizen of the United States, it is worth quoting at length: It was a great sight to see them marching from death, and colored men, colored women, colored children, colored enterprise and colored people all exposed to death. Firing began, and it seemed like a mighty battle in wartime. The shrieks and screams of children of mothers of wives were heard, such as cause the blood of the most inhuman person to creep. Thousands \u2026 rushed to the swamps, and lay upon the earth to freeze and starve. The woods were filled with colored people. The streets were dotted with their dead bodies \u2026",

If we are tempted to assign words spoken by Don\u00adald Trump to Machiavelli, it\u2019s not just because many western leaders have, and for a long time, bolstered their sense of their own power by affecting a cynical and crafty tone in the belief that it represents the last word in Machiavellian thought. It\u2019s because we literally don\u2019t know what to think of Machiavelli. Should we admire him or not, is he with us or against us, and is he still our con\u00adtemporary or is what he says ancient history?</p> <p>My little book doesn\u2019t pretend to resolve these questions; nor is it addressed to those who will read it to feel that they have right on their side \u2013 whether that side is answerable to justice or to power. On the contrary, this book tries to stay in that uncomfortable zone of thought that sees its own indeterminacy as the very locus of politics.</p> <p>I should, at this stage, give a few explanations \u2013 who is speaking, and to whom. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/28/france-in-the-world-history-books-america\">I don\u2019t con\u00adsider myself a historian of political ideas</a>, but I approached Machiavelli a decade ago, yoking him with Leonardo da Vinci in an essay on contemporaneousness.

This happened first as I researched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/04/trump-federal-buildings-beautiful-classical-order\">the political meaning of the architecture</a> of the quattrocento. Machia\u00advelli taught me to see it less as a representation of power than as a machine for producing political emotions: per\u00adsuasion, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/04/trump-federal-buildings-beautiful-classical-order\">public buildings</a> of the republican city-states; and intimidation, in the fortified strongholds that the princes built to keep those states in line.<strong> </strong>In every case, Machiavelli proved a worthy brother-in-arms who, because he had thrown light on his own times, threw light on ours \u2013 proving himself a contemporary in the very best sense.</p> <p>During the summer of 2016, I gave a series of daily talks on French public radio in which I tried to articu\u00adlate this capacity of Machiavellian thought to sharpen our understanding of the present. My little book col\u00adlects those texts, which in their biting brevity and direct address attempt to harmonize in style with Machiavelli \u2013 not simply his manner of writing but his art of thinking, which brings to flashpoint the fusion of poetry and politics.</p> <p>Only one of these talks was not broadcast on the France Inter network during the summer of 2016, the fifth, focused on Machiavelli\u2019s reading of Lucretius\u2019s De natura rerum, \u201ca dangerous and deviant book that makes the world jump its rails and come off its hinges\u201d. The plan was to air the episode on Friday 15 July, but it was swallowed up by the sorrow, anger and numbness that followed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bastille-day-truck-attack\">terrorist attack on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice</a> on 14 July, France\u2019s national holiday, when 86 peo\u00adple were killed and more than 400 wounded. Although this book restores the text to its original place, there is still a gap left by the lasting stamp of fear.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1975, JGA Pocock de\ufb01ned 'the Machiavellian moment', when there is daylight between a republic and its values</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is that why I have chosen to give prominence in the book\u2019s American edition to the politics of fear? Not solely. As I write this preface, I am remembering a dia\u00adlogue that I had with the political scientist Corey Robin, the author of a major book in 2004, <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2005-01-01/fear-history-political-idea\">Fear: The History of a Political Idea</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOne day,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe war on terror\u00adism will come to an end. All wars do. And when it does, we will find ourselves still living in fear: not of terrorism or radical Islam, but of the domestic rulers that fear has left behind.\u201d Our discussion, which led to the publica\u00adtion in 2015 of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Exercice-peur-Usages-politiques-%C3%A9motion/dp/2729708960\">L\u2019exercice de la peur: usages politiques d\u2019une \u00e9motion</a> (Spreading fear: the political uses of an emo\u00adtion), asked whether the American way of fear might be exported around the world.</p> <p>We touched on Hobbes, of course, De Tocqueville and Hannah Arendt, but also Machiavelli, who continually inquired about the fears of those who govern: what makes them truly afraid? When justice stops being effective (or when crimes of corruption stop being punished) and when political vio\u00adlence is no longer a threat, there is nothing left to cause fear in those who govern shamelessly, that is, buoyed by a mood they aren\u2019t in control of and that no one is on hand to countervail. What will then happen to the repub\u00adlic? This question inevitably arises when anxiety is felt about democracy, because the republic loses its stability when it no longer reflects a pacified equilibrium between the different fears that divide it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab3a1cfbd606d32266882525738d75dbfd24d946\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab3a1cfbd606d32266882525738d75dbfd24d946/0_418_4974_2983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Niccolo Machiavelli, by Santi di Tito.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, by Santi di Tito.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1975, JGA Pocock de\ufb01ned that loss of equilib\u00adrium as \u201c<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691172231/the-machiavellian-moment\">the Machiavellian moment</a>\u201d, when there is daylight between a republic and its values. American his\u00adtorians have since associated Machiavelli\u2019s name with that form of political crisis, a practice I have followed in this book. And today we are undeniably living through another Machiavellian moment, again bringing the Flor\u00adentine author close to the core of American reality. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/28/france-in-the-world-history-books-america\">'It's urgent': controversial history France in the World comes to America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Living in unstable times, Machiavelli was keenly aware that the old political lexicon, which the Mid\u00addle Ages had inherited from Aristotle, no longer served him adequately. He de\ufb01ned the intellectual\u2019s task as a kind of resoluteness toward truth \u2013 being unmoved by the dazzle of words to \u201cgo straight toward the actual truth of the matter\u201d.</p> <p>This experience, which is profoundly Machiavellian in nature, is one that recurs again and again in history, whenever the words for expressing the things of politics become obsolete. What do we do when confronting adversaries we can\u2019t put a name to? We call them \u201cfascists\u201d, for want of a better term \u2013 just as in Italy\u2019s medieval communes, the people called the lords \u201ctyrants\u201d. We intend to confound them, to abash and bring them down, when we should in fact be examining what they say closely for its fascist potential. One thing is certain: when we use words from the past, we are show\u00ading our inability to understand the present.</p> <p>Since the summer of 2016, in France but also in the United States and elsewhere, every political forecast has been systematically proven wrong. In the past few years it seems that the perverse pleasure that the pub\u00adlic takes in contradicting pollsters \u2013 who minimize the voters\u2019 ability to choose by presenting developments as foreordained \u2013 has turned to \ufb01erce vindictiveness. Looking only at electoral results, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">the United King\u00addom\u2019s Brexit vote</a> on 23 June 2016, on whether to remain in the European Union, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-wins-us-election-news\">Donald Trump\u2019s election to the US presidency</a> on 8 November of that same year, the <em>qualit\u00e0 dei tempi</em> has de\ufb01nitely turned to storms.</p> <p>The consequences for the French electoral cycle, starting in January 2017, were similarly astounding. Following a series of extraordinary circumstances that eliminated all the expected candidates one after another \u2013 those picked either as favorites or as dead certainties \u2013 the election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/07/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidency-marine-le-pen\">gave the presidency to Emmanuel Macron</a>, a man who happened in his philosophical youth to have written an essay on Machiavelli. When a journalist asked me about this electoral smash-and-grab, so characteristic of the boldness commended by the author of The Prince, I glibly described Macron as a \u201cMachiavelli in reverse\u201d, meaning that the French president had abandoned philosophy for politics, whereas Machiavelli chose to make his mark in philosophy when politics abandoned him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What do we do when confronting adversaries we can\u2019t put a name to? We call them 'fascists', for want of a better term</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What import does a virtuoso of political ruses like Machiavelli have for us? If he were nothing more than the wily and unscrupulous strategist that a hostile pos\u00adterity has portrayed him to be, then not much at all. In these troubled times, when the stutterers can\u2019t be told from those who are talking of the future, the last peo\u00adple anyone wants to hear from are the so-called experts at predicting trends, who reduce all the indeterminacy in political life to a few elementary rules of collective action. The simplicity of those rules has everything to do with the experts\u2019 lack of imagination.</p> <p>Machiavelli is that thinker of alternatives who dissects every situation into an \u201ceither/or\u201d, drawing a crossroads of meaning at every stage of historical development. But if he is captivating, it\u2019s because he lets us see how the social energy of political configurations always spills out of the neat constructs in which it\u2019s meant to stay put. His sentences invariably run away with him; he has no sooner declared that there are only two avenues than he proceeds down a third. When we try to work out whether a particular political situation is going to turn out one way or another, it\u2019s well to remember that it is carried along by a general movement that has already occurred. Perhaps this is what awaits many European and other world nations: they are so worried about a pending catastrophe that they won\u2019t understand when it has already happened.</p> <p>People who see history as primarily tragic have always felt that the scenes of our disarray might well have been penned by a ghostly Shakespeare.

      "bodyText": "\u201cReal power is \u2013 I don\u2019t even want to use the word \u2013 fear.\u201d This sentence could have been written by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. It was spoken by Donald Trump in March 2016 when Trump was still only a candidate for the US presidency, and these words now appear as the epigraph to Bob Woodward\u2019s book Fear: Trump in the White House. Is a more off-putting introduction to our subject imaginable? If we are tempted to assign words spoken by Donald Trump to Machiavelli, it\u2019s not just because many western leaders have, and for a long time, bolstered their sense of their own power by affecting a cynical and crafty tone in the belief that it represents the last word in Machiavellian thought. It\u2019s because we literally don\u2019t know what to think of Machiavelli. Should we admire him or not, is he with us or against us, and is he still our contemporary or is what he says ancient history? My little book doesn\u2019t pretend to resolve these questions; nor is it addressed to those who will read it to feel that they have right on their side \u2013 whether that side is answerable to justice or to power. On the contrary, this book tries to stay in that uncomfortable zone of thought that sees its own indeterminacy as the very locus of politics. I should, at this stage, give a few explanations \u2013 who is speaking, and to whom. I don\u2019t consider myself a historian of political ideas, but I approached Machiavelli a decade ago, yoking him with Leonardo da Vinci in an essay on contemporaneousness. Unexpectedly, I found Machiavelli a useful guide and support \u2013 I\u2019d almost say a faithful friend, one whose intelligence never failed me. My conversations with Machiavelli became more regular and fruitful as I approached topics of which the Florentine author was, in his day, the most clear-sighted analyst. This happened first as I researched the political meaning of the architecture of the quattrocento. Machiavelli taught me to see it less as a representation of power than as a machine for producing political emotions: persuasion, in the public buildings of the republican city-states; and intimidation, in the fortified strongholds that the princes built to keep those states in line. In every case, Machiavelli proved a worthy brother-in-arms who, because he had thrown light on his own times, threw light on ours \u2013 proving himself a contemporary in the very best sense. During the summer of 2016, I gave a series of daily talks on French public radio in which I tried to articulate this capacity of Machiavellian thought to sharpen our understanding of the present. My little book collects those texts, which in their biting brevity and direct address attempt to harmonize in style with Machiavelli \u2013 not simply his manner of writing but his art of thinking, which brings to flashpoint the fusion of poetry and politics. Only one of these talks was not broadcast on the France Inter network during the summer of 2016, the fifth, focused on Machiavelli\u2019s reading of Lucretius\u2019s De natura rerum, \u201ca dangerous and deviant book that makes the world jump its rails and come off its hinges\u201d. The plan was to air the episode on Friday 15 July, but it was swallowed up by the sorrow, anger and numbness that followed the terrorist attack on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice on 14 July, France\u2019s national holiday, when 86 people were killed and more than 400 wounded. Although this book restores the text to its original place, there is still a gap left by the lasting stamp of fear. Is that why I have chosen to give prominence in the book\u2019s American edition to the politics of fear? Not solely. As I write this preface, I am remembering a dialogue that I had with the political scientist Corey Robin, the author of a major book in 2004, Fear: The History of a Political Idea. \u201cOne day,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe war on terrorism will come to an end. All wars do. And when it does, we will find ourselves still living in fear: not of terrorism or radical Islam, but of the domestic rulers that fear has left behind.\u201d Our discussion, which led to the publication in 2015 of L\u2019exercice de la peur: usages politiques d\u2019une \u00e9motion (Spreading fear: the political uses of an emotion), asked whether the American way of fear might be exported around the world. We touched on Hobbes, of course, De Tocqueville and Hannah Arendt, but also Machiavelli, who continually inquired about the fears of those who govern: what makes them truly afraid? When justice stops being effective (or when crimes of corruption stop being punished) and when political violence is no longer a threat, there is nothing left to cause fear in those who govern shamelessly, that is, buoyed by a mood they aren\u2019t in control of and that no one is on hand to countervail. What will then happen to the republic? This question inevitably arises when anxiety is felt about democracy, because the republic loses its stability when it no longer reflects a pacified equilibrium between the different fears that divide it. In 1975, JGA Pocock de\ufb01ned that loss of equilibrium as \u201cthe Machiavellian moment\u201d, when there is daylight between a republic and its values. American historians have since associated Machiavelli\u2019s name with that form of political crisis, a practice I have followed in this book. And today we are undeniably living through another Machiavellian moment, again bringing the Florentine author close to the core of American reality. Living in unstable times, Machiavelli was keenly aware that the old political lexicon, which the Middle Ages had inherited from Aristotle, no longer served him adequately. He de\ufb01ned the intellectual\u2019s task as a kind of resoluteness toward truth \u2013 being unmoved by the dazzle of words to \u201cgo straight toward the actual truth of the matter\u201d. This experience, which is profoundly Machiavellian in nature, is one that recurs again and again in history, whenever the words for expressing the things of politics become obsolete. What do we do when confronting adversaries we can\u2019t put a name to? We call them \u201cfascists\u201d, for want of a better term \u2013 just as in Italy\u2019s medieval communes, the people called the lords \u201ctyrants\u201d. We intend to confound them, to abash and bring them down, when we should in fact be examining what they say closely for its fascist potential. One thing is certain: when we use words from the past, we are showing our inability to understand the present. Since the summer of 2016, in France but also in the United States and elsewhere, every political forecast has been systematically proven wrong. In the past few years it seems that the perverse pleasure that the public takes in contradicting pollsters \u2013 who minimize the voters\u2019 ability to choose by presenting developments as foreordained \u2013 has turned to \ufb01erce vindictiveness. Looking only at electoral results, from the United Kingdom\u2019s Brexit vote on 23 June 2016, on whether to remain in the European Union, to Donald Trump\u2019s election to the US presidency on 8 November of that same year, the qualit\u00e0 dei tempi has de\ufb01nitely turned to storms. The consequences for the French electoral cycle, starting in January 2017, were similarly astounding. Following a series of extraordinary circumstances that eliminated all the expected candidates one after another \u2013 those picked either as favorites or as dead certainties \u2013 the election gave the presidency to Emmanuel Macron, a man who happened in his philosophical youth to have written an essay on Machiavelli. When a journalist asked me about this electoral smash-and-grab, so characteristic of the boldness commended by the author of The Prince, I glibly described Macron as a \u201cMachiavelli in reverse\u201d, meaning that the French president had abandoned philosophy for politics, whereas Machiavelli chose to make his mark in philosophy when politics abandoned him. What import does a virtuoso of political ruses like Machiavelli have for us? If he were nothing more than the wily and unscrupulous strategist that a hostile posterity has portrayed him to be, then not much at all. In these troubled times, when the stutterers can\u2019t be told from those who are talking of the future, the last people anyone wants to hear from are the so-called experts at predicting trends, who reduce all the indeterminacy in political life to a few elementary rules of collective action. The simplicity of those rules has everything to do with the experts\u2019 lack of imagination. Machiavelli is that thinker of alternatives who dissects every situation into an \u201ceither/or\u201d, drawing a crossroads of meaning at every stage of historical development. But if he is captivating, it\u2019s because he lets us see how the social energy of political configurations always spills out of the neat constructs in which it\u2019s meant to stay put. His sentences invariably run away with him; he has no sooner declared that there are only two avenues than he proceeds down a third. When we try to work out whether a particular political situation is going to turn out one way or another, it\u2019s well to remember that it is carried along by a general movement that has already occurred. Perhaps this is what awaits many European and other world nations: they are so worried about a pending catastrophe that they won\u2019t understand when it has already happened. People who see history as primarily tragic have always felt that the scenes of our disarray might well have been penned by a ghostly Shakespeare. But as \u201cthe grotesque wheels of power\u201d (in Michel Foucault\u2019s phrase) grind into motion, it seems that the coarsening of public discourse we are now experiencing got its start on a less exalted stage \u2013 none other than that misleadingly named feature of Trumpian America known as \u201creality TV\u201d. It is there that a general disregard for the \u201cactual truth of the matter\u201d was patiently nurtured. Not for the first time have upcoming politics had their start in fiction. That\u2019s why, in 2017, there was such a surge of interest in the United States in George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Literature doesn\u2019t predict the future any more than it protects us from its threats. It warns, yes, in the sense that it sounds the alert about a catastrophe that generally doesn\u2019t happen, or not in the way it was imagined. Ever since 1984 came and went without bearing out Orwell\u2019s dystopian predictions, we no longer read his novel as a foreshadowing or preview of a totalitarian regime. At this stage, we know that totalitarianism is a category not so much meant to describe a political reality as to make that reality \ufb01t into a pre-established form \u2013 for instance, at the end of the second world war, when the liberal democracies were intent on demonstrating that communism would pursue nazism by other means.

      "body": "<p>The Democratic debate in New Hampshire topped off a turbulent week for Democrats, marked by chaos at the Iowa caucuses and continuing fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s Senate acquittal.</p> \n<p>For more than two and a half hours, seven candidates confronted each other and took full advantage of their final televised opportunity to pitch themselves as the top choice ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. Despite a few moments of levity and camaraderie, this debate was markedly tenser than some of its predecessors as the frontrunners sought to capitalize on their momentum, while those who lagged behind endeavored to stay in the game. Attacks were more direct, and ideological contrasts more clearly defined.</p> \n<p>Here are five of the night\u2019s key takeaways:</p> \n<h2>Moderates sought to dominate the center lane \u2013 and take down Sanders</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/07/bernie-sanders-pete-buttigieg-debate-new-hampshire-iowa-latest\">Democratic candidates zero in on Buttigieg and Sanders at tense debate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Amy Klobuchar made an especially strong showing. Americans are looking for a candidate who can attract a broad coalition of support, \u201cand I would submit that is me,\u201d the Minnesota senator said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI like Bernie just fine,\u201d she said of Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator. \u201cWe actually have worked together on a number of things\u201d. But she argued that Democrats were \u201cbetter off\u201d with someone who could win in red districts.</p> \n<p>Playing up her midwestern values, Klobuchar also appealed directly to voters. \u201cI know you. I will fight for you, \u201c she said. \u201cIf you have trouble deciding if you are going to pay for your childcare or your long-term care, I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble figuring out if you\u2019re going to fill your refrigerator or prescription, I know you and I will fight for you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Following the debate, her campaign saw a fundraising surge.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden made a case for himself as well, going after Sanders\u2019 record on gun control and his embrace of the \u201csocialist\u201d label, while promoting his own long legacy in government and his partnership with Barack Obama. \u201cI was there,\u201d the former vice-president said repeatedly as he listed diplomatic and legislative victories including the signing of the Paris climate agreement.</p> \n<p>Pete Buttigieg took a swipe at Sanders as well, saying that America needed a candidate who could unite them, rather than \u201cdividing people with the politics that says \u2018if you don\u2019t go all the way to the edge, it doesn\u2019t count;\u2019 a politics that says \u2018my way or the highway.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<h2>Biden and Sanders spoke the most</h2> \n<p>Both candidates spoke for about 20 minutes each, ahead of the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Buttigieg and Klobuchar. The most vocal candidates were also often the most willing to go on the offensive.</p> \n<p>Sanders and Buttigieg, who both declared victory after the Iowa caucuses, sparred over campaign finance, among other topics. \u201cUnlike some of the campaigns up here \u2013 Pete \u2013 I don\u2019t have 40 billionaires contributing to my campaign,\u201d Sanders said.</p> \n<p>Buttigieg, as he has in the past, responded that unlike other candidates \u2013 including Sanders \u2013 he wasn\u2019t a millionaire or a billionaire.

      "bodyText": "The Democratic debate in New Hampshire topped off a turbulent week for Democrats, marked by chaos at the Iowa caucuses and continuing fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s Senate acquittal. For more than two and a half hours, seven candidates confronted each other and took full advantage of their final televised opportunity to pitch themselves as the top choice ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. Despite a few moments of levity and camaraderie, this debate was markedly tenser than some of its predecessors as the frontrunners sought to capitalize on their momentum, while those who lagged behind endeavored to stay in the game. Attacks were more direct, and ideological contrasts more clearly defined. Here are five of the night\u2019s key takeaways: Moderates sought to dominate the center lane \u2013 and take down Sanders Amy Klobuchar made an especially strong showing. Americans are looking for a candidate who can attract a broad coalition of support, \u201cand I would submit that is me,\u201d the Minnesota senator said. \u201cI like Bernie just fine,\u201d she said of Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator. \u201cWe actually have worked together on a number of things\u201d. But she argued that Democrats were \u201cbetter off\u201d with someone who could win in red districts. Playing up her midwestern values, Klobuchar also appealed directly to voters. \u201cI know you. I will fight for you, \u201c she said. \u201cIf you have trouble deciding if you are going to pay for your childcare or your long-term care, I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble figuring out if you\u2019re going to fill your refrigerator or prescription, I know you and I will fight for you.\u201d Following the debate, her campaign saw a fundraising surge. Joe Biden made a case for himself as well, going after Sanders\u2019 record on gun control and his embrace of the \u201csocialist\u201d label, while promoting his own long legacy in government and his partnership with Barack Obama. \u201cI was there,\u201d the former vice-president said repeatedly as he listed diplomatic and legislative victories including the signing of the Paris climate agreement. Pete Buttigieg took a swipe at Sanders as well, saying that America needed a candidate who could unite them, rather than \u201cdividing people with the politics that says \u2018if you don\u2019t go all the way to the edge, it doesn\u2019t count;\u2019 a politics that says \u2018my way or the highway.\u2019\u201d Biden and Sanders spoke the most Both candidates spoke for about 20 minutes each, ahead of the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Buttigieg and Klobuchar. The most vocal candidates were also often the most willing to go on the offensive. Sanders and Buttigieg, who both declared victory after the Iowa caucuses, sparred over campaign finance, among other topics. \u201cUnlike some of the campaigns up here \u2013 Pete \u2013 I don\u2019t have 40 billionaires contributing to my campaign,\u201d Sanders said. Buttigieg, as he has in the past, responded that unlike other candidates \u2013 including Sanders \u2013 he wasn\u2019t a millionaire or a billionaire. Later, he added: \u201cI will not pursue politics by telling people they can\u2019t be by our side.\u201d Though the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren placed third in Iowa, she spoke for less time than competitors who had received less support. Political commentators noted she often faded into the background for long stretches \u2013 both because moderators seemed to single her out less often and because she wasn\u2019t as aggressive as her competitors in stealing the spotlight. The Democratic frontrunners \u2013 all of them white \u2013 grappled with race With all the candidates of color, save Andrew Yang, having either dropped out of the presidential race or failed to qualify for the debate, a group of white frontrunners tried to make a case for why each of them was best suited to win over black and Latino voters. \u201cWe should set up a commission on race to retell the story of the last 400 years,\u201d said Tom Steyer. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about Jim Crow, let\u2019s talk about Martin Luther King Jr, let\u2019s talk about Barbara Lee, the congresswoman from Oakland who is one of our great leaders.\u201d Steyer singled out Biden, calling on him to disavow racist comments from a campaign surrogate. Biden responded that he had earned endorsements from many black lawmakers, \u201cdouble what you have or anybody else has\u201d. Later, Buttigieg was questioned about an increase in black arrests in South Bend after he became mayor, Buttigieg tried to evade. \u201cI took a lot of heat for discussing systemic racism with my own police force,\u201d he said. Asked whether Buttigieg\u2019s answer was substantial enough, Warren responded simply: \u201cNo.\u201d She also advocated for \u201crace-conscious laws in education, in employment\u201d and other sectors of society. \u201cWe need to rework our criminal justice system,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we cannot just say criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race.\u201d The old guard faced off against the outsiders In a standout moment from the debate, Klobuchar knocked down the idea of being a \u201ccool newcomer\u201d. \u201cWe have a newcomer in the White House and look where it got us,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what people want right now.\u201d She, along with Warren, Biden and Sanders, touted experience and expertise. Buttigieg, the youngest candidate, asserted: \u201cIf we want to beat this president, we\u2019re got to be ready to move on from the playbook that we\u2019re relied on in the past.\u201d Biden hit back: \u201cI don\u2019t know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad.\u201d Steyer, another outsider, praised all the candidates\u2019 policies and plans. \u201cI love all these people, and they\u2019re all right,\u201d Steyer said. But what really mattered, he said, was \u201cwho can take down Mr Trump\u201d.",

I kept waiting for his fellow candidates to go after him for little things like, oh I don\u2019t know, claiming victory over a caucus before all results were tallied? Minor despotic behaviors, that sort of thing? Instead, we heard mostly the same talking points coming from the same candidates who were almost all wearing the same outfits from the last debate. Is that Klobuchar dress plum or more of an eggplant? I\u2019ve seen it so much by now you think I would have figured it out.

It\u2019s easy to talk about \u201crehabilitation\u201d being the solution to the opioid crisis, but no one talks about how <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/9/20870308/rehab-drug-addiction-treatment-cost-michel-cote-opioid-epidemic\">ineffective, expensive</a> and <a href=\"https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/06/27/deaths-at-california-rehab-centers-prompt-push-for-reform/\">dangerous</a> treatment facilities are in this country.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to talk in specifics when you\u2019re given 75 seconds to address structural problems, but the distance between political speech and actual reform never seems to stop growing.

While candidates talked about uniting the party, no other frontrunner can claim to have the economic, ethnic and ideological diversity as Sanders, who has the most people of color and lowest income constituency in his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/bernie-sanders-donor-lead/\">donor base</a> and success <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/01/14/why-bernie-sanders-is-electable-too/\">attracting </a><a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/01/14/why-bernie-sanders-is-electable-too/\">independents</a>.</p> <p>Contrasting Buttigieg, who seems to believe billionaires are mere constituents and not a part of a power structure that siphons wealth from everyday Americans, Sanders staked his allegiance assertively with the working class.

She\u2019s a moderate Democrat, far too conservative for my tastes. She\u2019s never going to be my candidate in a primary that has several solid contenders to her left.</p> <p>But stepping back from my own personal preferences and looking at who made a solid, thoughtful case for their candidacy, Klobuchar did it. She stood out from the pack, most of whom were saying what we\u2019ve heard before. And when they weren\u2019t \u2013 for example, when Sanders was asked about his record on guns \u2013 the debate moderators didn\u2019t push as hard as they could have, leaving those of us who have followed this election hearing more and more of the same.</p> <p>Joe Biden had a rough although not unusual night, meandering his way through half-answers and incomplete thoughts, a reminder that he is indeed pushing 80, and pushing it hard \u2013 not something you want voters to be thinking about. Bernie Sanders, by contrast, was his usual vigorous, sharp and delightfully cranky self despite being a touch older than Biden, making the contrast all the more apparent.</p> <p>Warren brought her usual mix of competence and capability, but also seemed frustrated. And who can blame her? As usual she\u2019s over-prepared, compelling and absurdly thoughtful, and she\u2019s still lagging behind a couple of less capable guys. But her exasperation showed. And unlike when it comes from always-exasperated Sanders or \u201cI was THERE!\u201d Biden \u2013 both of whom enjoy the presumption of authenticity and righteous irritation \u2013 exasperation from a woman doesn\u2019t tend to play as well. Andrew Yang was, well \u2013 you may have heard that he\u2019s very into the idea of a universal basic income? And Tom Steyer similarly had absolutely no reason to be on that stage.</p> <p>But Klobuchar stood out in what was hands-down her best debate yet. She was warm and approachable in her mom-joke way, and able to pivot to tough and considered at all the right moments. She was one of the few candidates on stage who seemed to actually imagine the average voters Democrats are trying to reach, and talked directly to them. She answered the questions, and she pushed on her opponents. And her closing statement \u2013 a riff off of a speech she also gave once it became clear that the Iowa results weren\u2019t coming in as planned \u2013 was pitch-perfect.</p> <p>She\u2019s not my candidate. It\u2019s not even clear that debate performance matters one iota in terms of securing votes. But Klobuchar had a great night.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jill Filipovic is the author of the The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness</p></li> </ul>",

Joe Biden had a rough although not unusual night, meandering his way through half-answers and incomplete thoughts, a reminder that he is indeed pushing 80, and pushing it hard \u2013 not something you want voters to be thinking about. Bernie Sanders, by contrast, was his usual vigorous, sharp and delightfully cranky self despite being a touch older than Biden, making the contrast all the more apparent. Warren brought her usual mix of competence and capability, but also seemed frustrated. And who can blame her? As usual she\u2019s over-prepared, compelling and absurdly thoughtful, and she\u2019s still lagging behind a couple of less capable guys. But her exasperation showed. And unlike when it comes from always-exasperated Sanders or \u201cI was THERE!\u201d Biden \u2013 both of whom enjoy the presumption of authenticity and righteous irritation \u2013 exasperation from a woman doesn\u2019t tend to play as well. Andrew Yang was, well \u2013 you may have heard that he\u2019s very into the idea of a universal basic income? And Tom Steyer similarly had absolutely no reason to be on that stage. But Klobuchar stood out in what was hands-down her best debate yet. She was warm and approachable in her mom-joke way, and able to pivot to tough and considered at all the right moments. She was one of the few candidates on stage who seemed to actually imagine the average voters Democrats are trying to reach, and talked directly to them. She answered the questions, and she pushed on her opponents. And her closing statement \u2013 a riff off of a speech she also gave once it became clear that the Iowa results weren\u2019t coming in as planned \u2013 was pitch-perfect. She\u2019s not my candidate. It\u2019s not even clear that debate performance matters one iota in terms of securing votes. But Klobuchar had a great night.

      "body": "<p>If you have siblings, the chances are that your relationship with them will be the longest you ever have with anyone. It\u2019s a tie that precedes the one you have with you partner, and that can last long after your parents and friends have gone.</p> <p>So why is so little attention paid to the brother and sister bond? The majority of sibling self-help books are aimed at parents who have young children locked in rivalry. Very little is written for adult siblings on how to maintain a healthy relationship. Michelle Qureshi, a London-based therapist, tells me she has seen a rise in the number of people seeking sibling counselling. \u201cPeople no longer stay in the same area or live close to their extended families,\u201d she says. \u201cBusy schedules mean we don\u2019t see each other as often as we used to. Sibling relationships can be intense and we set high expectations on them \u2013 so when they break, they can be difficult to resolve.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f14c81ac59d7ad90075b15e93d65002a553627b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f14c81ac59d7ad90075b15e93d65002a553627b2/0_0_808_914/442.jpg\" alt=\"Saima\u2019s parents in the late 70s.\" width=\"442\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saima\u2019s parents in the late 70s</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Saima Mir</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have some experience in this area. I\u2019m the eldest of six, spanning a decade and then some. My siblings have added to the texture of my life, brought me joy and irritation, as well as the kind of worry that can only emerge from unconditional love. These are some of the things I\u2019ve learned about the key stages of what I call sibship, after 40 years sharing my life with my brothers and sisters.</p> <h2><strong>The early years: </strong><strong>a bond forged through </strong><strong>bad dressing-up costumes</strong></h2> <p>My memories of early childhood are a blur of laughter, fights and chases around the house with my younger brother and sister, Zafar and Fozia. Now my own boys are the same: a whirlwind of energy, they wake each other at 6am, usually violently and noisily. The elder two are equal parts best friends and nemeses. The baby occasionally crawls into the ring to be met with an accidental flying foot and a cuddle.</p> <p>Sibship at this age is a CBeebies version of Mission Impossible: the world is full of intrigue and excitement; this is the age of hatching plans and whispering secrets. Your relationships are linear. Your place within the hierarchy is clear, and decided by age, like it or not.</p> <p>Dr Sheila Redfern, a consultant child and adolescent clinical psychologist at the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families in London, says these early relationships contribute hugely to our sense of self. \u201cChildren who are placed into foster homes together do better, even in difficult circumstances. You recover from trauma more easily if you have shared experiences. Even if they don\u2019t get on, the effect is not any less positive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c38ccd7f8ee9f6d120df5934835bd4f6206f0764\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c38ccd7f8ee9f6d120df5934835bd4f6206f0764/306_0_3152_2079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saima Mir (fourth left) at her childhood home in 1989\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saima (fourth left) at her childhood home in 1989</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Saima Mir</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For me, my siblings were allies with whom I could take on the world (AKA our parents). I am still scarred by memories of my primary school\u2019s annual May Day parade, when my mother, ignoring my protests, sent me to school as The Asian Girl. Things got worse when my brother, Zafar, started school, and joined me as The Asian Boy. There we were in our shalwar kameez, surrounded by superheroes, animals, and Roald Dahl characters. But then our younger sister, Fozia, came along, and things changed: she was stubborn, and this time Mum and Dad were outnumbered. Our demands were finally heard \u2013 we wanted actual costumes, not cultural garments. They worked feverishly through the night to provide us with outfits, which I now consider ingenious, but at the time left me mortified. I wore a vegetable sack with a sash of plastic veg and was \u201cMiss Vegetable Of The Year\u201d. My brother was \u201cSandwich Board Man\u201d, and poor Fozia, the instigator of the revolution, was a \u201cModern Humpty Dumpty\u201d, her costume a cardboard box. The bonds forged that day will last a lifetime.</p> <h2><strong>The teenage years: constant babysitting, perpetual embarrassment</strong></h2> <p>Before my 13th birthday, three more Mir babies had been born \u2013 to the surprise of my parents, who found themselves among that 1% of the population who get pregnant no matter what kind of contraception they use. As a result, my teenage years \u2013 a time when I wanted to hang out with cool older kids and do the things they did in American films \u2013 consisted, instead, of constant babysitting, snotty noses, sandwich-making and visits to A&amp;E. My siblings were an embarrassment.</p> <p>My sister Fozia is three years younger than me, and we wound each other up incessantly - me with my books and oversize glasses, she with her need to annoy me in every possible way. I pretty much hated her back then; I definitely did not understand her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0460fdb075c8bdb4d1252eea707fe367dbcd41e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0460fdb075c8bdb4d1252eea707fe367dbcd41e1/0_127_1129_707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Khola, Khizer and Javaria with their father, Raza Mir, in 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Khola, Khizer and Javaria with their father in 1990</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Saima Mir</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recently, though, we were looking at a photograph of my sons. \u201cAww, look at him in the back with the death stare,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants to be just like his brother. I used to be like that. I wanted to be you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>I was taken aback. It\u2019s taken us until middle age to find common ground. But then I realised it had been there all the time, on the evenings when my parents went out, and Dad would give us \u00a320, saying it was for emergencies. We knew that was code for \u201cpizza\u201d and would bring all the duvets into the living room to watch The Goonies, Indiana Jones or Mr India. The warmth of those times is still with us all.</p> <h2><strong>Young adulthood</strong><strong>: from bad marriages to </strong><strong>mutual cheerleading</strong></h2> <p>There comes a point in your 20s when life is filled with the kind of busyness that takes you away from family. New relationships, careers, exciting friends, travel: it almost feels like a rejection of the people you grew up with \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s the way it\u2019s meant to be.</p> <p>When you\u2019re no longer living under the same roof, it takes an effort to stay connected. Partners join the fold, and family dynamics inevitably change. If your siblings don\u2019t get on with your partner, the distance widens.</p> <p>Fozia\u2019s ex-husband created a space between us. For the 10 years she was married, I rarely called her, and visited her twice. My own early 20s were spent trying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/16/divorce-islam-me-woman-who-left-two-husbands\" title=\"\">to navigate a bad marriage</a>. I withdrew, and drifted away from my brothers and sisters. But when that marriage ended and I returned home, the old alliances were still there; we didn\u2019t need preamble and context. My siblings had grown up, too. Suddenly the age gap that had seemed so huge in childhood had narrowed, and I wanted to spend time with them.</p> <p>Now that we are adults, we have become a sort of cheerleading squad for each other. For the younger ones, there is someone who has already navigated the world and can brief them on it. For the older ones, we realise it isn\u2019t all on our shoulders any more.</p> <h2><strong>Parenthood</strong><strong>: the point at which loyalties subtly shift</strong></h2> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d I\u2019m videocalling my mum, and talking about my son\u2019s handwriting. My brother Khizer sits on my mum\u2019s sofa, defending my five\u2011year-old\u2019s poor penmanship. My sister Khola joins him. I\u2019m in trouble. I\u2019ve forgotten that we are pack animals, and, while the pack looks after its own, the hierarchy shifts with the introduction of new blood. In the hierarchy of sibship, I have been downgraded: my siblings\u2019 loyalties now lie with my children. And of course, I\u2019m OK with this. My offspring are being watched over by the people I trust most in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbcdbd306b0cfc0134ad889a3a0377e834236232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbcdbd306b0cfc0134ad889a3a0377e834236232/147_406_2121_1739/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saima Mir holding her sister Javaria, with brother Zafar and sister Fozia in 1984\" width=\"1000\" height=\"820\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saima holding her sister Javaria, with brother Zafar and sister Fozia in 1984</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Saima Mir</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The exhausted haze of parenthood revealed more reasons to love my siblings. Their company is the one place I can lay down my hypervigilance. They have held their breath with me as my children started school, fell sick or expressed their fears; my siblings cheer on their successes. Half-term at my sister Javaria\u2019s house means arriving to find a kitchen stocked with all my picky-eater child\u2019s favourite foods.</p> <p>My boys and I spent a summer in Yorkshire, flitting between my parents\u2019 home and my siblings\u2019 houses, and the strength of kinship was never more evident.

And when she lost her hair, thanks to chemo, my little brother, Khizer, and sister, Khola, photographed themselves in her wig and shared the images.</p> <p>At no time is the sibling support system more essential than when a parent gets sick. My mum was in hospital with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. All six of us came together, descending from various parts of the country. \u201cYou know it is going to be OK when your big sister arrives,\u201d my youngest sister, Khola, said as I stepped off the train at Leeds station.</p> <p>I was only there for a couple of weeks. Khola did all the heavy lifting: taking mum to her appointments, looking after her and making her meals. But we all knew we had to pull together. Only we knew mum\u2019s idiosyncrasies, her need for Egyptian cotton bedsheets, a clean house, and cappuccinos that she always pronounces \u201ccar-pacino\u201d.</p> <p>Mum has been cancer-free for almost seven years now, but in that moment the roles of parent and children were reversed \u2013 a reversal that gets more pronounced as we siblings progress to middle age.

      "bodyText": "If you have siblings, the chances are that your relationship with them will be the longest you ever have with anyone. It\u2019s a tie that precedes the one you have with you partner, and that can last long after your parents and friends have gone. So why is so little attention paid to the brother and sister bond? The majority of sibling self-help books are aimed at parents who have young children locked in rivalry. Very little is written for adult siblings on how to maintain a healthy relationship. Michelle Qureshi, a London-based therapist, tells me she has seen a rise in the number of people seeking sibling counselling. \u201cPeople no longer stay in the same area or live close to their extended families,\u201d she says. \u201cBusy schedules mean we don\u2019t see each other as often as we used to. Sibling relationships can be intense and we set high expectations on them \u2013 so when they break, they can be difficult to resolve.\u201d I have some experience in this area. I\u2019m the eldest of six, spanning a decade and then some. My siblings have added to the texture of my life, brought me joy and irritation, as well as the kind of worry that can only emerge from unconditional love. These are some of the things I\u2019ve learned about the key stages of what I call sibship, after 40 years sharing my life with my brothers and sisters. The early years: a bond forged through bad dressing-up costumes My memories of early childhood are a blur of laughter, fights and chases around the house with my younger brother and sister, Zafar and Fozia. Now my own boys are the same: a whirlwind of energy, they wake each other at 6am, usually violently and noisily. The elder two are equal parts best friends and nemeses. The baby occasionally crawls into the ring to be met with an accidental flying foot and a cuddle. Sibship at this age is a CBeebies version of Mission Impossible: the world is full of intrigue and excitement; this is the age of hatching plans and whispering secrets. Your relationships are linear. Your place within the hierarchy is clear, and decided by age, like it or not. Dr Sheila Redfern, a consultant child and adolescent clinical psychologist at the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families in London, says these early relationships contribute hugely to our sense of self. \u201cChildren who are placed into foster homes together do better, even in difficult circumstances. You recover from trauma more easily if you have shared experiences. Even if they don\u2019t get on, the effect is not any less positive.\u201d For me, my siblings were allies with whom I could take on the world (AKA our parents). I am still scarred by memories of my primary school\u2019s annual May Day parade, when my mother, ignoring my protests, sent me to school as The Asian Girl. Things got worse when my brother, Zafar, started school, and joined me as The Asian Boy. There we were in our shalwar kameez, surrounded by superheroes, animals, and Roald Dahl characters. But then our younger sister, Fozia, came along, and things changed: she was stubborn, and this time Mum and Dad were outnumbered. Our demands were finally heard \u2013 we wanted actual costumes, not cultural garments. They worked feverishly through the night to provide us with outfits, which I now consider ingenious, but at the time left me mortified. I wore a vegetable sack with a sash of plastic veg and was \u201cMiss Vegetable Of The Year\u201d. My brother was \u201cSandwich Board Man\u201d, and poor Fozia, the instigator of the revolution, was a \u201cModern Humpty Dumpty\u201d, her costume a cardboard box. The bonds forged that day will last a lifetime. The teenage years: constant babysitting, perpetual embarrassment Before my 13th birthday, three more Mir babies had been born \u2013 to the surprise of my parents, who found themselves among that 1% of the population who get pregnant no matter what kind of contraception they use. As a result, my teenage years \u2013 a time when I wanted to hang out with cool older kids and do the things they did in American films \u2013 consisted, instead, of constant babysitting, snotty noses, sandwich-making and visits to A&amp;E. My siblings were an embarrassment. My sister Fozia is three years younger than me, and we wound each other up incessantly - me with my books and oversize glasses, she with her need to annoy me in every possible way. I pretty much hated her back then; I definitely did not understand her. Recently, though, we were looking at a photograph of my sons. \u201cAww, look at him in the back with the death stare,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants to be just like his brother. I used to be like that. I wanted to be you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I was taken aback. It\u2019s taken us until middle age to find common ground. But then I realised it had been there all the time, on the evenings when my parents went out, and Dad would give us \u00a320, saying it was for emergencies. We knew that was code for \u201cpizza\u201d and would bring all the duvets into the living room to watch The Goonies, Indiana Jones or Mr India. The warmth of those times is still with us all. Young adulthood: from bad marriages to mutual cheerleading There comes a point in your 20s when life is filled with the kind of busyness that takes you away from family. New relationships, careers, exciting friends, travel: it almost feels like a rejection of the people you grew up with \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s the way it\u2019s meant to be. When you\u2019re no longer living under the same roof, it takes an effort to stay connected. Partners join the fold, and family dynamics inevitably change. If your siblings don\u2019t get on with your partner, the distance widens. Fozia\u2019s ex-husband created a space between us. For the 10 years she was married, I rarely called her, and visited her twice. My own early 20s were spent trying to navigate a bad marriage. I withdrew, and drifted away from my brothers and sisters. But when that marriage ended and I returned home, the old alliances were still there; we didn\u2019t need preamble and context. My siblings had grown up, too. Suddenly the age gap that had seemed so huge in childhood had narrowed, and I wanted to spend time with them. Now that we are adults, we have become a sort of cheerleading squad for each other. For the younger ones, there is someone who has already navigated the world and can brief them on it. For the older ones, we realise it isn\u2019t all on our shoulders any more. Parenthood: the point at which loyalties subtly shift \u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d I\u2019m videocalling my mum, and talking about my son\u2019s handwriting. My brother Khizer sits on my mum\u2019s sofa, defending my five\u2011year-old\u2019s poor penmanship. My sister Khola joins him. I\u2019m in trouble. I\u2019ve forgotten that we are pack animals, and, while the pack looks after its own, the hierarchy shifts with the introduction of new blood. In the hierarchy of sibship, I have been downgraded: my siblings\u2019 loyalties now lie with my children. And of course, I\u2019m OK with this. My offspring are being watched over by the people I trust most in the world. The exhausted haze of parenthood revealed more reasons to love my siblings. Their company is the one place I can lay down my hypervigilance. They have held their breath with me as my children started school, fell sick or expressed their fears; my siblings cheer on their successes. Half-term at my sister Javaria\u2019s house means arriving to find a kitchen stocked with all my picky-eater child\u2019s favourite foods. My boys and I spent a summer in Yorkshire, flitting between my parents\u2019 home and my siblings\u2019 houses, and the strength of kinship was never more evident. My children ran amok, destroyed things, and then fell asleep in the glow of family, amid conversations that have been going on for decades. From the moment they were born, it is as if they sensed that my siblings were their staunchest allies. Middle age: when parents get sick, and a new support system kicks in \u201cWell, Mum always said we\u2019d be upset when she got cancer, and here we are,\u201d I said. Everyone laughed \u2013 only siblings could. And when she lost her hair, thanks to chemo, my little brother, Khizer, and sister, Khola, photographed themselves in her wig and shared the images.

I was only there for a couple of weeks. Khola did all the heavy lifting: taking mum to her appointments, looking after her and making her meals. But we all knew we had to pull together. Only we knew mum\u2019s idiosyncrasies, her need for Egyptian cotton bedsheets, a clean house, and cappuccinos that she always pronounces \u201ccar-pacino\u201d. Mum has been cancer-free for almost seven years now, but in that moment the roles of parent and children were reversed \u2013 a reversal that gets more pronounced as we siblings progress to middle age.

      "body": "<p>On Sunday morning I notice a flat black rectangle, wrapped in plastic, sitting on the kitchen table. It\u2019s a brand new piece of luggage, a reminder that the middle one is off to America, to seek his fortune in the land of his father.</p> <p>For a long time, while his trip was in the planning stages, the departure date moved in step with the calendar: it was always three months away. It continued to do this in my head, even after plane tickets were purchased. He made his preparations; I made none. My wife comes downstairs, coughing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so ill,\u201d she says. \u201cI need to send you out.\u201d She writes me a supermarket list with medicines at the top. I add the word \u201cwine\u201d to the bottom and, after some thought, \u201cbeer\u201d.</p> <p>An hour later, in the middle of aisle eight, I suddenly find myself in distress: I\u2019m holding something I cannot see because of the tears in my eyes. To bystanders it must seem as if I am weeping over the price of a bottle of cough mixture. Later, consulting the receipt, I realise this would have been entirely justified. I paid less for the wine.</p> <p>I recover myself and head for the checkout. The woman seated at the till recognises the customer in front of me as her son\u2019s old maths teacher. Her son has just received a PhD, she says, and she wants to thank everyone who made a difference in his life. The teacher is visibly moved. I think: are you people trying to set me off, or what?</p> <p>The two shopping bags feel unbelievably heavy as I lift them on to the kitchen table.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m freaking out,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou say that,\u201d I say.</p> <p>She points upward, towards the youngest one\u2019s bedroom. \u201cMaybe you could change his overhead light today,\u201d she says. \u201cHe claims he can\u2019t see.\u201d This is very like my wife \u2013 inserting irrelevant strands into the narrative in order to distract me, potentially through electrocution.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a replacement?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d she says. She leaves the room and returns with a frosted glass globe on a flex.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the ladder,\u201d she says. The new fixture presents an immediate problem.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s meant to hang from a hook,\u201d I say. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t come with a hook.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo we have hooks?\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cNot big enough,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll have to go out again.\u201d</p> <p>As I walk down the road I realise why I\u2019m so worried my middle son will go off to another country and never return: it\u2019s because it\u2019s exactly what I did, 30 years ago to the month, when I first came to the UK. I don\u2019t just feel sad; I feel guilty. Then I think: pull yourself together; you can\u2019t have a meltdown outside Wilko.</p> <p>By the time I return with the hook, the youngest one is lying on his bed, and I am obliged to work over him.</p> <p>\u201cIs this safe?\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cTime will tell,\u201d I say. \u201cHow are we for length?\u201d I hold the end of the wire up to the ceiling so that the globe hangs six inches above his knees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/18/tim-dowling-its-day-two-of-the-silent-treatment-can-i-keep-it-up\">Tim Dowling: it\u2019s day two of the silent treatment. Can I keep it up?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBit higher, maybe,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to trim too much,\u201d I say. The middle one pokes his head through the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI got you a present,\u201d I say, pulling a UK-to-US plug adaptor from my pocket.</p> <p>\u201cCool,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWilko has them,\u201d I say. \u201cWho knew?\u201d</p> <p>The next morning the middle one\u2019s new bag is lying at the foot of the stairs. Unfolded and packed up, it\u2019s enormous; the kind of thing you would order if you needed to dispose of not one, but a pair of dead hitchhikers. My wife is giving him a lift to the station. When the time comes, I carry the bag out to the car.</p> <p>As I hug him goodbye, I take a deep breath to make sure I can iron the wobble out of my voice.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to come back,\u201d I say.

      "bodyText": "On Sunday morning I notice a flat black rectangle, wrapped in plastic, sitting on the kitchen table. It\u2019s a brand new piece of luggage, a reminder that the middle one is off to America, to seek his fortune in the land of his father. For a long time, while his trip was in the planning stages, the departure date moved in step with the calendar: it was always three months away. It continued to do this in my head, even after plane tickets were purchased. He made his preparations; I made none. My wife comes downstairs, coughing. \u201cI\u2019m so ill,\u201d she says. \u201cI need to send you out.\u201d She writes me a supermarket list with medicines at the top. I add the word \u201cwine\u201d to the bottom and, after some thought, \u201cbeer\u201d. An hour later, in the middle of aisle eight, I suddenly find myself in distress: I\u2019m holding something I cannot see because of the tears in my eyes. To bystanders it must seem as if I am weeping over the price of a bottle of cough mixture. Later, consulting the receipt, I realise this would have been entirely justified. I paid less for the wine. I recover myself and head for the checkout. The woman seated at the till recognises the customer in front of me as her son\u2019s old maths teacher. Her son has just received a PhD, she says, and she wants to thank everyone who made a difference in his life. The teacher is visibly moved. I think: are you people trying to set me off, or what? The two shopping bags feel unbelievably heavy as I lift them on to the kitchen table. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d my wife says. \u201cI\u2019m freaking out,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back.\u201d \u201cYou say that,\u201d I say. She points upward, towards the youngest one\u2019s bedroom. \u201cMaybe you could change his overhead light today,\u201d she says. \u201cHe claims he can\u2019t see.\u201d This is very like my wife \u2013 inserting irrelevant strands into the narrative in order to distract me, potentially through electrocution. \u201cDo you have a replacement?\u201d I say. \u201cI do,\u201d she says. She leaves the room and returns with a frosted glass globe on a flex. \u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll get the ladder,\u201d she says. The new fixture presents an immediate problem. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to hang from a hook,\u201d I say. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t come with a hook.\u201d \u201cDo we have hooks?\u201d my wife says. \u201cNot big enough,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll have to go out again.\u201d As I walk down the road I realise why I\u2019m so worried my middle son will go off to another country and never return: it\u2019s because it\u2019s exactly what I did, 30 years ago to the month, when I first came to the UK. I don\u2019t just feel sad; I feel guilty. Then I think: pull yourself together; you can\u2019t have a meltdown outside Wilko. By the time I return with the hook, the youngest one is lying on his bed, and I am obliged to work over him. \u201cIs this safe?\u201d he says. \u201cTime will tell,\u201d I say. \u201cHow are we for length?\u201d I hold the end of the wire up to the ceiling so that the globe hangs six inches above his knees. \u201cBit higher, maybe,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to trim too much,\u201d I say. The middle one pokes his head through the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he says. \u201cI got you a present,\u201d I say, pulling a UK-to-US plug adaptor from my pocket. \u201cCool,\u201d he says. \u201cWilko has them,\u201d I say. \u201cWho knew?\u201d The next morning the middle one\u2019s new bag is lying at the foot of the stairs. Unfolded and packed up, it\u2019s enormous; the kind of thing you would order if you needed to dispose of not one, but a pair of dead hitchhikers. My wife is giving him a lift to the station. When the time comes, I carry the bag out to the car. As I hug him goodbye, I take a deep breath to make sure I can iron the wobble out of my voice. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to come back,\u201d I say. I have a memory of my mother saying the same thing to me 30 years ago. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he says.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump was gloating again. \u201cNow I understand the votes are fried in Iowa,\u201d he told reporters at the White House on Friday. \u201cThink of it, all the money that Democrats spent and the votes are fried. They have no idea who won.\u201d The president\u2019s schadenfreude flowed from the debacle of the Democratic Iowa caucuses, the much-hyped first step to finding a nominee to challenge him in November. After seven debates, nearly a billion dollars in national campaign spending and a year of criss-crossing the midwestern state in search of every last voter, Monday ended with no winner and no official results. The main problem was an app the Iowa Democratic party used to tabulate the results. It had been rushed out shortly before caucusing began, did not undergo rigorous testing and hit a coding glitch. Back-up phone lines were jammed, compounding a meltdown that raised questions not only over the viability of the first-in-the-nation caucuses but Democrats\u2019 grasp of technology. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: \u201cWhen you consider that Barack Obama revolutionised the Democratic party\u2019s use of technology, large-N data and interactions with voters via mobile phones through texting, and that was 12 years ago, it is stunning how far from technological grace the Democrats have fallen and that was on full display in Iowa. \u201cWe saw some of this problem in the Clinton campaign in 2016 when they were using technology to recruit campaign volunteers and supporters rather than using it to court voters as Trump did. A perfect example is that Trump bought ads on SnapChat before the debates with Hillary Clinton.\u201d The Iowa app is just the tip of the iceberg. The last Democratic administration\u2019s healthcare website suffered a botched launch and went over budget. The Trump campaign outspent and outmanoeuvred Clinton on Facebook and other platforms in 2016, also receiving a boost from Russian interference. Since then, under manager Brad Parscale, the campaign has built a huge digital operation that will be difficult for the Democratic nominee to match. It is a very different landscape from when Obama revolutionised online organising on his way to beating John McCain and Mitt Romney. Romney\u2019s Orca Project, a big data voter-tracking app designed to rival Obama\u2019s ground game in 2012, crashed and burned at the crucial moment. The Republican National Committee (RNC) learned the lessons of those defeats, argues lobbyist Henry Barbour, a partner at Capitol Resources, with chair Reince Priebus and his successor Ronna McDaniel recruiting dedicated tech staff. In contrast, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rested on its laurels. Barbour said: \u201cWe\u2019re in a strong position as a party, whereas in the Obama years we were playing catch-up. Now I think the Democrats are. The DNC is a shell of its former self, a shambles. There is weak leadership left over from President Obama, who invested in his own organisation more than the DNC. \u201cPresident Trump is doing the opposite, investing in the RNC and the nuts and bolts. As a result, Republicans have built an advantage on the data side.\u201d Even as Obama won two elections, Democrats suffered punishing defeats in the Senate, House and key governorships while losing nearly 1,000 state legislative seats. In the wake of the Iowa chaos, Tom Perez, the DNC chair who had begun to turn things around, is facing calls to resign. Barbour, chairman of the Republican firm Data Trust and the RNC national committee member for Mississippi, added: \u201cThe Democratic data is controlled on the state level, whereas the Republicans have a national approach to it. I think it\u2019s a big advantage in 2020 when you\u2019re trying to figure out who to target, how to target them and when to do it. Better data yields better results.\u201d Republicans do not entirely have the upper hand. The Democrats have ActBlue, an easy-to-use online platform that enables grassroots activists and big-dollar donors to chip in small amounts to candidates or big sums to party committees. In 2019, it funneled more than $1bn to Democratic candidates and causes. While ActBlue was born in 2004, and played a role in Democrats\u2019 2018 midterms success, Republicans scrambled to catch up last year by launching WinRed. Barbour said WinRed raised $70m in the final quarter of last year and could hit between $800m and $1bn in 2020, but he predicted ActBlue may reach $2bn for this year. Whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee will be up against the Trump campaign\u2019s almost unlimited war chest and determination to \u201cflood the zone\u201d of social media with opportunistic merchandising and targeted advertising, including generous helpings of dishonest and inflammatory clickbait.

      "bodyText": "Democratic presidential candidates clashed on Friday night in a tense televised debate that was dominated by attacks against Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders, the two candidates who declared victory after the Iowa caucuses. In the week that Donald Trump was acquitted in his impeachment trial and days ahead of the New Hampshire primary, the competing visions for the Democratic party were on show as moderate candidates challenged the progressives, and those with more Washington experience called out the relative political newcomers. Sanders fielded criticism from his fellow candidates over his support for his Medicare for All universal healthcare proposal, a government-run health insurance plan favored by progressives that would revolutionize the US system, while Buttigieg was forced to fend off criticism over his youth and inexperience. \u201cHow much is it going to cost? Who\u2019s going to pay for it?\u201d the former vice-president Joe Biden asked Sanders while contrasting his own healthcare plan with the Vermont senators\u2019. The Friday night debate was a key test for Biden, who has long been regarded as the undeniable frontrunner in the Democratic primary race. But he appeared to have placed fourth in the Iowa contest, far behind Sanders, Buttigieg and the Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Opening the debate, Biden acknowledged he \u201ctook a hit\u201d in Iowa, and he predicted that he would \u201cprobably take a hit\u201d in New Hampshire too, casting himself as an underdog in the Granite state considering Sanders\u2019 strong finish there in 2016. But Biden warned that Sanders represented a risk because of his self-description as a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d, and that Buttigieg has not proved he has the experience to be president. Biden\u2019s longterm prospects appear to increasingly depend on how he performs in the South Carolina primary on 29 February, where he polls very favorably among the state\u2019s large Democratic African American population. The debate discussion moved to race and South Carolina, as the billionaire activist Tom Steyer went on the offensive against Biden by highlighting controversial comments from one of his surrogates in an apparent bid to challenge him for that support. The spectacle of white men bickering over who has the most support from African Americans was not lost on some observers. But Biden shot back, saying: \u201cI have more support in South Carolina, the Black Caucus and the black community than anybody else. Double what you have and anybody else.\u201d Buttigieg, who has struggled to appeal to non-white voters, repeatedly deflected a question about the rate of arrests of African Americans increasing while he was mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Moderator Linsey Davis asked Warren if Buttigieg\u2019s answer was sufficient. \u201cNo,\u201d Warren replied, in one of very few standout moments of the night, prompting applause. \u201cWe cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race,\u201d she added. Ahead of the New Hampshire primary vote, there is still no clear frontrunner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee who will take on Donald Trump in November\u2019s election, though recent polling has shown both Sanders and Buttigieg leading. Seven of the 11 remaining leading candidates took to the stage on Friday night; Sanders, Buttigieg, Warren and Biden, as well as the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, Steyer and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Klobuchar, a moderate who has been trailing the others but enjoyed several strong moments on the debate stage on Friday, presented herself as the person to challenge Trump and work across the aisle, warning that Sanders\u2019 healthcare proposal isn\u2019t supported by \u201ctwo-thirds of the Democrats in the Senate\u201d and that it would \u201ckick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years\u201d. When the debate veered toward a discussion on experience, 38-year-old Buttigieg \u2013 a former mayor and veteran of the war in Afghanistan \u2013 contrasted himself with Biden, Klobuchar and Sanders, saying he represented experience outside of Washington. But Klobuchar, 59, shot back that \u201cwe have a newcomer in the White House, look where it got us\u201d. She also called out Buttigieg for saying he had found watching the impeachment trial \u201cexhausting\u201d (as senators, Klobuchar, Warren, Sanders and long shot candidate Michael Bennet had all been in Washington to attend instead of campaigning in Iowa). \u201cThat\u2019s not leadership, to just suck up to a room and make a joke so everyone laughs at it about switching [the channel] to watch cartoons. I think that\u2019s degrading of the work that people do,\u201d she told CNN after the debate. At another point during the debate, Buttigieg took a veiled swipe at Biden and his \u201cpolitics of the past\u201d. Biden responded by touting his work in the Obama administration: \u201cI don\u2019t know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad.\u201d Meanwhile, Warren struggled to cut through, speaking far less than in previous debates. Speaking afterwards, she told MSNBC: \u201cI just didn\u2019t say enough, didn\u2019t fight hard enough, didn\u2019t tell you how bad I want this and how good we can make it if we just come together.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how much impact a messy debate on a Friday will have among New Hampshire voters. \u201cThere are a lot of New Hampshire voters who are still undecided so the debate gives voters an opportunity for a check on some \u2013 not all \u2013 of the candidates and an opportunity to help make up their mind,\u201d said the former New Hampshire Democratic party chair Kathy Sullivan.

The remaining Australians stranded in Wuhan had been scheduled to fly overnight on Friday from locked down Wuhan to a quarantine site outside of Darwin. But as they waited to board on Friday passengers were informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that the flight had been delayed because Australia had \u201cnot received official clearance\u201d from Chinese authorities to land in the city. \u201cYou should return to your homes or places of accommodation and we will send you more information when it is available,\u201d am email sent to passengers from Dfat read. \u201cWe are working with Chinese authorities in order to reschedule the flight for tomorrow. \u201cAs you had a previously confirmed seat/s on the aircraft this evening, your seat is confirmed for the next flight departing Wuhan which we anticipate will depart on Saturday February 8. \u201cWe know that this unexpected delay will cause stress and inconvenience, which we regret.\u201d The ABC has reported that on Saturday passengers received an update from Dfat informing them the plane was now scheduled to leave in the early hours of Sunday morning eastern Australian time, but subject to conditions. In an email to passengers obtained by the ABC passengers have been told that Chinese authorities will check temperatures before allowing passengers to board and that they may not be able to leave if their temperature is above 37.3C. \u201cIf a fever is detected at a checkpoint, it is possible they will be directed to a Chinese medical facility and not allowed to board the flight,\u201d the email read. \u201cThe Chinese authorities consider 37.3 degrees temperature as the point you will require medical assistance. \u201cYour temperature will be tested by Chinese officials, likely at a checkpoint prior to arrival at the airport and during check-in process.\u201d Passengers have also been told they must wear face masks, which will be supplied to them, and change masks every two hours, and that they should sneeze or cough into their elbows if they need to. Earlier in a statement Dfat confirmed the flight had been \u201cprepositioned\u201d in Hong Kong and was \u201cawaiting approval from the Chinese authorities to fly to Wuhan\u201d. \u201cMany flights out of Wuhan have been delayed.

Any such departure is always subject to operational requirements and to Chinese government final approval.\u201d Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said Australia was working with Chinese authorities to get clearance \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Asked whether he was confident of an airlift, he told reporters on Saturday: \u201cYes, I am confident, but I can\u2019t absolutely guarantee it because it is indeed on Chinese soil.\u201d Scott Morrison confirmed on Friday that a vacated former construction workers\u2019 village outside Darwin would be used as the quarantine site for the evacuees. More than 300 Australians remain trapped in Wuhan \u2013 which has been quarantined by Chinese authorities \u2013 and the flight was expected to be the last out of the city that the Australian government would be able to charter. Globally, the outbreak has infected almost 35,000 people and killed 724, the vast majority of those in Hubei province. The first Qantas flight evacuated 243 Australian citizens and permanent residents to Christmas Island on Monday. Thirty-six Australians who left Wuhan on a NZ-government chartered flight on Wednesday were also eventually taken to Christmas Island. A young evacuee has been tested for coronavirus after developing an illness, but Kelly says her sickness isn\u2019t serious. \u201cIt could be all sorts of other things, we don\u2019t have a test positive at this point,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra on Saturday. \u201cThat person is well, it is certainly not a serious illness at this stage. They have been further isolated from the other people that are on the island, and the appropriate steps in infection control and indeed clinical care are being taken.\u201d The centre on Christmas Island can house more than 1,000 people, but its capacity is significantly reduced because of the medical necessity to isolate coronavirus evacuees from each other to minimise the impact of any possible outbreak. Subsequent evacuees will be taken to the Manigurr-ma village in Howard Springs, 30km outside Darwin, which was built in 2012 by Japanese energy giant Inpex as accommodation for its workers. At the peak of construction work on Inpex\u2019s $55bn gas plant on Darwin Harbour it housed around 3,500 workers. The facility has swimming, cycling and indoor cricket facilities, as well as a medical centre, industrial kitchen, dining hall, cinema, library and gym. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said those staying at the Howard Springs facility were unlikely to become infectious and their health would be closely monitored. \u201cIt is important people living in and around Howard Springs know the novel coronavirus can only be transmitted by close contact with an infectious person and cannot be spread through the air,\u201d he said. \u201cThe health and safety of the Howard Springs community is of paramount importance and I am confident the security and public health measures put in place will prevent any risk to the community\u2019s health.\u201d Australian Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Authorities in Wuhan city have started going door to door checking temperatures, and rounding up suspected coronavirus patients for forcible quarantine in stadiums and exhibition centres that are serving as warehouses for the sick, the New York Times reported. The city and country face \u201cwartime conditions\u201d, the paper quoted vice-premier Sun Chunlan, who has been put in charge of the national campaign against the virus, as saying on a visit to Wuhan. She said: \u201cThere must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever.\u201d Meanwhile another three people on a cruise liner off Japan have tested positive, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 64. Foreign passengers on another ship, Holland America\u2019s Westerdam, have also been barred, with suspected virus patients on board, according to authorities. The ship, with more than 2,000 people, was near Okinawa and seeking another port. More than 34,500 people have been infected around the world, the vast majority inside China and two-thirds of them in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. There have been 724 deaths, all but two of them in mainland China. Chinese scientists claimed they may have found the animal source of the outbreak, based on genetic analysis, though their results have yet to be published. The coronavirus is thought to have originated in bats but passed through an intermediate host before infecting humans. The researchers have identified a coronavirus in pangolins that is 99% similar to the one causing the current outbreak. The only scaly mammal, the long-snouted, ant-eating pangolin is endangered but often hunted for meat or use in Chinese medicine. The World Health Organization on Friday hailed a fall in the number of new infections for a second consecutive day, which could signal some progress in containing the outbreak. But across mainland China there were 3,399 new confirmed infections in the last twenty four hours. And Sun\u2019s dramatic visit to Wuhan, stepping up efforts on the ground there, and promises of more help from Beijing suggest that party officials in China fear the epidemic is still not under control. Containment efforts across Hubei province should be stepped up, with efforts to increase the number of hospital beds and medical staff, top communist party officials agreed at a meeting chaired by the premier, Li Keqiang. The death rate in Wuhan was 4.1%, the New York Times reported, far higher than the 2.8% across Hubei province, and the national rate of about 2%. Some in Wuhan fear they are being sacrificed for the national good, and the death of a whistleblower doctor from the virus has stirred up popular anger across China. Li Wenliang had been reprimanded by security officials for warning fellow doctors in late December 2019 about a mystery new disease; he then caught the coronavirus from one of his own patients in January and, despite youth and apparent good health, he died early on Friday morning. The hashtag \u201cwe want free speech\u201d was briefly circulating on social media, amid memorials and tributes to Li, before it was wiped by censors. For weeks China has ignored offers of help from the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US and the WHO, the New York Times reported, though a spokeswoman for the WHO said it was just \u201csorting out arrangements\u201d. There have been thousands of cases in other parts of China where increasing numbers of cities, towns and even remote villages are locking themselves down. Two weeks into the crisis, however, it is clear that Beijing cannot afford to keep all of the country closed for business indefinitely. When the growing scale of the outbreak was first made public in mid-January the country was on holiday for the most important celebration on the Chinese calendar, the lunar new year festival. But after festivities that normally bring in a large slice of retail and service sector income were effectively cancelled, and the nationwide holiday was prolonged by a week, the cost of shuttered shops, factories, restaurants and other businesses has started mounting. Small businesses have warned about problems with everything from keeping livestock fed, to paying rent, and staff salaries for shops that can\u2019t make any sales. The impact of the shutdown has also been felt beyond China\u2019s borders, since the world\u2019s second-largest economy is now so integrated into international markets. South Korea\u2019s Hyundai has shuttered the most productive car factory in the world, a five-plant network that can make 1.4m cars a year, as the shutdown in China meant it ran out of a key component. Authorities may initially have planned only a short quarantine, hoping the disease would be brought under control as Sars was over a decade ago. But it is clear China cannot afford to delay most of its population going back to work, and a meeting of top Chinese leaders has called on businesses to \u201cresume operation in an orderly manner\u201d, the official Xinhua news agency reported. It suggested adapting working methods to reduce the risk of infection; options could include remote working or staggered shifts. Foxconn, the electronics company that supplies Apple, has begun manufacturing its own surgical masks, allowing Chinese workers to churn out iPhones uninterrupted. As people gear up to return home there are special regulations on trains and planes to try to reduce the risk of infection. Ticket sales will be capped at under half the usual numbers so passengers can sit further apart to reduce the risk of infection, the South China Morning Post reported. There will also be more temperature checks and quarantine areas at train stations. The effort to get people back to work might be complicated by childcare problems if schools do not reopen; authorities said only that they should \u201cpostpone the start of new semester in an appropriate manner\u201d, Xinhua reported. President Xi Jinping spoke with Donald Trump and urged the US to \u201crespond reasonably\u201d to the outbreak, echoing complaints that some countries are overreacting by restricting Chinese travellers. In a sign of growing worries overseas, Hong Kong has begun a mandatory two-week quarantine for anyone arriving from mainland China and announced fines and jail terms of up to six months for quarantine breaches. Singapore has upgraded its coronavirus alert level, sparking panic-buying of essentials.",

He was coming to the end of a week in which he had spent 80 minutes making the case for his re-election on primetime TV in his State of the Union speech and had been acquitted in his impeachment trial \u2013 with only one Republican breaking ranks to vote against him. A <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/284156/trump-job-approval-personal-best.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> put the president\u2019s approval rating at 49%, the highest level for that survey since 2017, and on top of that the Democratic primary race got off to a disastrously shambolic start in Iowa. Holding up a newspaper front page that said \u201cTrump acquitted\u201d, the president told his White House crowd: \u201cLet me take that home; maybe we\u2019ll frame it. It\u2019s the only good headline I\u2019ve ever had in the Washington Post.\u201d His speech sounded like a preview of the one he plans to make on 4 November after winning the election. <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"74571569-c2d1-4979-bfbb-a6316bacc50a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r6VFYRPP3SA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <h2>4/5: Pete Buttigieg</h2> \n  <p>If anyone managed to wring any momentum out of the mess in Iowa, it was the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who more or less declared victory before the results were in and went on to grab as much of the spotlight as possible. Did he even win? With almost 100% of the vote in, Buttigieg is only 0.09% ahead of socialist rival Bernie Sanders in the delegate count, and Sanders is ahead of the young pretender in the popular vote.

      "bodyText": "An updated evening summary of today\u2019s key political news as we close this blog for tonight. But as one blog closes, another opens: You can follow the Democratic presidential debate live blog for continued live updates. Two key witnesses in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial were fired by the White House: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and European Union ambassaor Gordon Sondland. Vindman\u2019s lawyer issued a statement saying that he was escorted out of the White House. He \u201cwas asked to leave for telling the truth,\u201d his lawyer said. Vindman\u2019s twin brother, a lawyer for the National Security Council, was also fired. Pundits dubbed the firings a \u201cFriday Night Massacre,\u201d in reference to the Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d in 1973. Democrats condemned the firings; Republican lawmakers said \u201cgood riddance.\u201d Meanwhile, Bill Taylor, another witness in the impeachment trial, went on CNN to defend Marie Yovanovitch, former ambassador to Ukraine, who was subject to a smear campaign that led to her own firing. \u201cIt of course bothers me any time I see someone like Masha Yovanovitch or Alex Vindman unfairly attacked,\u201d Taylor said. Trump spoke at an event in North Carolina this afternoon where he mocked Democrats for messing up the Iowa caucus and said that he would continue to hold rallies even if he wins the 2020 election. As Democratic presidential candidates prepared for another televised debate, the feud between Iowa front-runners Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg started to gear up today. Sanders slammed Buttigeg for having \u201cthe most exclusive billionaire donors of any Democrat.\u201d #PetesBillionaires was trending on Twitter this afternoon. Saturday Night Massacre Prompted Angry Telegrams Some more historical comparisons: 1973 was a different time. Do you remember what it was like when all major breaking news did not happen simultaneously? How good is the Saturday Night Massacre comparison? Curious how well the White House\u2019s actions tonight compare to Nixon\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d in 1973? You can look back at what Nixon did via: NPR\u2019s Brief History of the \u2018Saturday Night Massacre\u2019 The Saturday Night Massacre episode of the hit Watergate podcast Slow Burn The original Sunday morning report on the massacre in the Washington Post On a Saturday evening in October 1973, in the midst of the scandal that would lead to his resignation, President Richard Nixon demanded that his attorney general fire the special counsel assigned to investigate Watergate. Nixon\u2019s attorney general and deputy attorney general refused, and resigned. Then solicitor general Robert Bork became the acting attorney general, and he did what Nixon wanted: he fired special counsel Archibald Cox, who had refused to go along with the White House\u2019s plan to turn over only summarized material from the White House Watergate tapes to Cox\u2019s investigation. The forced resignation and firing became known as Nixon\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Massacre.\u201d Political pundits are already calling this Friday evening in Washington Trump\u2019s \u201cFriday Night Massacre,\u201d with two of the witnesses who testified in the impeachment inquiry against Trump already fired by 7 p.m. in the evening. Other commentators, like Rachel Maddow, are arguing that it\u2019s not quite an accurate comparison. Full statement from Second Fired Impeachment Witness The White House has moved to fire another person who testified in the House impeachment inquiry against President Trump: Gordon Sondland, who also testified about the president\u2019s efforts to pressure top Ukranian officials to investigate his political rivals, the New York Times reports. \u201cI was advised today that the president intends to recall me effective immediately as United States Ambassador to the European Union,\u201d Sondland said in a statement just hours after the White House fired a top National Security expert on Ukraine, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, who had also testified, the Times reported. Sondland expressed gratitude in the statement to Mr. Trump \u201cfor having given me the opportunity to serve.\u201d In November, Sondland delivered what had been characterized as \u201cbombshell\u201d public testimony against Trump, saying, \u201cWas there a \u2018quid pro quo [with Ukraine]?\u2019 As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.\u201d Just a reminder: there are 269 days until the 2020 presidential election! Tonight, the Democratic presidential primary continues with a televised debate. My colleague Joan Greave has more details on our debate night live blog. In a week marked by impunity and vengeance in Washington, my colleague Ed Pilkington has a story on a black radical who has finally won his freedom. The release of the final incarcerated member of the Move 9 comes more than three decades after Philadelphia police dropped an incendiary bomb on a row house where black activists lived, resulting in the deaths of eleven people, including five children, and a fire that razed dozens of homes in a predominantly black neighborhood. One of the great open wounds of the black liberation struggle of the 1970s has finally been healed with the release of the last member of the Move 9, the group of radicals rounded up in a Philadelphia police siege in 1978 and held behind bars for more than four decades. Chuck Sims Africa, 59, walked free from the Fayette state correctional institution in La Belle, Pennsylvania, on Friday morning. The youngest of the incarcerated group, he has been in custody since shortly after he turned 18. His freedom marked his reunion with his family for the first time in almost 42 years. Schumer Responds to White House firing Vindman \u201cThis action is not a sign of strength,\u201d senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Presenting this statement without comment, since the emoji I need is not available on this liveblog. White House Fires Twin Brother of Impeachment Witness The twin brother of Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a national security expert who testified during Trump\u2019s impeachment trial about his concerns about the president pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, his political rivals, was also fired by the White House today, multiple news outlets reported. Vindman\u2019s twin brother, Lieutenant Colonel Yevgeny Vindman, was a lawyer at the National Security Council. The New York Times reported that President Donald Trump spoke publicly yesterday, at a prayer breakfast, about his antipathy toward \u201cLieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother.\u201d Early GOP responses on Vindman\u2019s firing Lois Beckett here in our West Coast office, taking over our live politics coverage at the end of a week that has been quite uneventful, really, just an impeachment vote and some lively discussions about democracy in Iowa. (Remember last Friday, when the UK left the European Union?) Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney has some early reactions from GOP lawmakers to the White House\u2019s choice to fire one of the key witnesses in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial today. In two words: \u201cGood riddance.\u201d Here\u2019s what has happened this afternoon: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, one of the key witnesses in the impeachment trial, was fired from his post on the national security counsel. His lawyer issued a statement saying that he was escorted out of the White House today. He \u201cwas asked to leave for telling the truth,\u201d his lawyer said. Meanwhile, Bill Taylor, another witness in the impeachment trial, went on CNN to defend Marie Yovanovitch, former ambassador to Ukraine, who was subject to a smear campaign that led to her own firing. \u201cIt of course bothers me any time I see someone like Masha Yovanovitch or Alex Vindman unfairly attacked,\u201d Taylor said. Trump spoke at an event in North Carolina this afternoon where he mocked Democrats for messing up the Iowa caucus and said that he would continue to hold rallies even if he wins the 2020 election. The feud between Iowa front-runners Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg started to gear up today. Sanders slammed Buttigeg for having \u201cthe most exclusive billionaire donors of any Democrat.\u201d #PetesBillionaires was trending on Twitter this afternoon. Congressional Democrats are on Twitter expressing their shock at the news that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was fired from his post on the national security counsel. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an adviser on the national security counsel who testified in the impeachment trial, was fired from his post. \u201cToday, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was escorted out of the White House where he has dutifully served his country and his President,\u201d said his attorney, David Pressman in a statement. \u201cLTC Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth.\u201d The news comes just hours after Donald Trump told reporters that he is \u201cnot happy with him\u201d and made vague comments saying \u201cthey\u2019ll make that decision\u201d about whether he would be keeping his job. Later, Trump retweeted posts on Twitter that called on him to fire Vindman. Vindman was considered the top expert on Ukraine on the national security counsel. During his testimony in Congress, Vindman expressed concerns about a call Trump had with the president of Ukraine where he demanded an investigation into Joe Biden. \u201cIt was improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigation of a US citizen and a political opponent,\u201d Vindman said during the testimony in November. Vindman is largely respected as a veteran who came to the United States when he was three after his family fled Ukraine. He served multiple tours overseas and was wounded by a roadside bomb during a combat deployment in Iraq, earning him a Purple Heart. He went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in Russian from Harvard and served at US embassies in Kyiv and Moscow. During his testimony, Vindman outlined why he felt comfortable coming forward with the information he had through a message to his father. \u201cDad, my sitting here today, in the US Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d Bill Taylor: Smears against Marie Yovanovitch \u2018unconscionable\u2019 Bill Taylor, a former acting ambassador to Ukraine who testified in the impeachment trial, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in an interview that the smear campaign against Marie Yavonovitch, former US ambassador to Ukraine who also testified in the impeachment trial is \u201cunconscionable\u201d. Yovanovitch was removed from her post after attacks from Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, went on a smear campaign with the goal of removing her from office so the investigation into Hunter Biden could continue. While Tapper did not reference Donald Trump specifically in his question, the president lashed out against Yovanovitch on Twitter in November, seemingly as backlash against her testifying in front of Congress. \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\u201d he wrote. Defending Yovanovitch, Taylor said he believes the former ambassador\u2019s credibility. \u201cIt of course bothers me any time I see someone like Masha Yovanovitch or Alex Vindman unfairly attacked,\u201d Taylor said, referring to Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an adviser on the national security counsel who testified in the impeachment trial. If you see your local influencer gushing about former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg on Instagram anytime soon, here\u2019s why: Bloomberg is turning to social media influencers to help him gain traction in the 2020 election, according to the Daily Beast. The Bloomberg campaign is using Tribe, a platform that connects influencers with brands for advertising purposes. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign is specifically targeting \u201cmicro-influencers\u201d \u2013 users who have between 1,000 and 1,000 \u2013 for $150 posts on why they support the mayor. The campaign\u2019s posting on Tribe asks influencers to \u201cShow+Tell why Mike the candidate who can change our country for the better, state why YOU think he\u2019s a great candidate\u201d. Trump just ridiculed Democrats during a speech he delivered in North Carolina, saying, \u201cThey can\u2019t count simple votes, but they want to fix your healthcare system,\u201d he told the crowd at the Opportunity Now Summit in Charlotte. Donald Trump is now giving a speech at the North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina. Here\u2019s a little cheery nugget from his speech: Reminder that rallies are typically for presidential candidates looking to run for office, which a president cannot do if they just served for two terms. With Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders still neck and neck amid the ongoing Iowa debacle (still no official winner), and Buttigieg surging into a position as surprise threat in New Hampshire, Sanders has been chewing the fat at the traditional Politics &amp; Eggs breakfast in event the Granite State. \u201cI\u2019m reading some headlines from newspapers about Pete Buttigieg,\u201d he said. \u201cPete Buttigieg has most exclusive billionaire donors of any Democrats, that was from Forbes. The Hill: Pete Buttigieg tops billionaire donor list. Fortune: Pete Buttigieg takes lead as big business candidate in 2020 field. Washington Post: Pete Buttigieg lures even closer look from Wall Street donors following strong Iowa caucus performance. Forbes magazine: here are the billionaires backing Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign,\u201d Time reports. \u201cI like Pete Buttigieg, nice guy,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we are in a moment where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life.\u201d And this: Sanders must have thought he was a shoo-in for a strong win in New Hampshire, being a left-wing fixture for decades in next-door Vermont. Buttigieg is nipping at Sanders\u2019s heels in the latest opinion poll in New Hampshire. The Boston Globe/WBZ-TV/Suffolk University poll showed Sanders just in the lead in New Hampshire at 24 percent, with Buttigieg at 23 percent. Then a gap before the third-placed Elizabeth Warren, also a New England politician as the Senator for nearby Massachusetts, but now in danger of stalling in the middle of the leading group despite a solid performance in Iowa. Warren received 13 percent support, ahead of the flagging Joe Biden on 11 percent. Donald Trump retweeted this afternoon two tweets that recommended he fire Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an adviser on the national security counsel who testified in the impeachment trial. This morning, Trump said he wasn\u2019t happy with Vindman and that decisions would be made about his post. Here are the tweets \u2013 one is from November. Here\u2019s what has happened so far today: Donald Trump said that he is not happy with Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and alluded to \u201cdecisions\u201d that would be made about his standing on the national security council, essentially confirming reports that the White House is thinking about moving him out of his position. All attention is on New Hampshire ahead of the state\u2019s Democratic primary on Tuesday. A new poll showed senator Bernie Sanders and former South Bend Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg are head-to-head for New Hampshire voters. Sanders has a slight lead at 24%, while Buttigieg polled at 24%. A US appeals court in DC ruled that a lawsuit brought forth by congressional Democrats that says Trump violated the Constitution by not turning over information about his personal investment has no standing. Trump celebrated the news about the \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d with a tweet. A Washington Post reported this morning that Trump\u2019s properties have billed Secret Service agents as much as $650 for a night\u2019s stay while protecting the president, ultimately paid by US taxpayers. House passes Puerto Rico aid package The House just passed a $21bn emergency aid package in response to the 6.4 magnitude earthquake that struck the island 7 January. The earthquake left one dead and destroyed dozens of homes and structures, along with disrupting power and water for days. \u201cIn recent weeks, thousands of families in Puerto Rico were forced from their homes, schools were flattened, roads and infrastructure were severely damage,\u201d said US rep Nita Lowey, House appropriations chairwoman, in a statement. Congressional Republicans, 17 of whom in the House voted for the bill, have indicated that they will give the package trouble once it gets to the Senate. Donald Trump has already threatened to veto it. Is this a preview of the kind of content former NYC mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign Twitter will be spitting out during tonight\u2019s debate? Only time will tell. Standing outside the White House for some Chopper Talk this morning, Donald Trump said that there will be a decision sometime in the future about what to do with Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a member of the national security council who testified against the president during the impeachment trial. Bloomberg News reported last night that the White House is thinking about moving Vindman out of the council and rotate him to a position in the Department of Defense. One reporter said that a source close to Vindman indicated that he was at the White House yesterday and will likely work today as well, amid reports of his departure. When asked about any plans to remove Vindman from his position, Trump said that he is \u201cnot happy with him\u201d and that a decision about what do with him will be made later. Trump also denied reports that the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, is on his way out. Comments that pundit Donny Deutsch made on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe about senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s electability is getting some heated backlash on Twitter this morning. When the show\u2019s host, Joe Scarborough, asked Deutsch and Vice reporter Shawna Thomas why they think Warren has fallen behind senator Bernie Sanders, Thomas made the argument that it was because people weren\u2019t comfortable about the electability of a woman. \u201cIf you look around and your neighbors, they\u2019re not sure a woman can beat him, that starts to wear on a campaign,\u201d Thomas said. Deutcsh cut in. \u201cIs it a woman or is it her? There\u2019s a certain stridentness to her that, do we want to invite her into our bedrooms and living rooms every day for four years?\u201d Deutsch said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a gender issue \u2013 it\u2019s a likability issue.\u201d Something interesting to keep in mind: Educational attainment is a top determinant for who shows up to the polls. During the 2018 election, those whose highest degree is a high school diploma had a 42% turnout rate in 2018, while those without a high school degree had a 27% turnout. Comparatively, 65% and 74% of those with a bachelor\u2019s degree and advanced degree, respectively, went to the polls. A US Appeals Court in DC just ruled on a lawsuit brought forth by lawyers for over 200 congressional Democrats that argues Donald Trump violated the Constitution\u2019s Emolument Clause by not allowing Congress to approve his financial interests. The suit was meant to allow Democrats to figure out how Trump has profited from foreign dignitaries in his business dealings, like when they stay at his hotels. The clause bans the president from receiving gifts or titles from leaders of state governments or foreign countries and requires Congress to approve any gifts the president receives. The lawsuit is one of multiple that charges the president for violating the clause. Would you like a side of politics with those eggs? Senator Bernie Sanders is scheduled to speak this morning at a quirky event that\u2019s become a New Hampshire tradition: Politics &amp; Eggs. The event, which has been held for over 20 years, largely consists of local business leaders, giving politicians a chance to schmooze and campaign for the upcoming primary. Politics &amp; Eggs even comes with souvenirs for attendees. Commemorative wooden eggs from the event have become something of a collectible in the state, especially since candidates are often asked to autograph the eggs while attending the breakfast. And if you were wondering, the eggs are actually made in nearby Maine. Trump pockets up to $650 when his own Secret Service agents stay at his hotel The president\u2019s company charges his own Secret Service agents up to $650 a night to stay at his properties \u2013 a bill that is ultimately paid by U.S. taxpayers \u2013 when they stay the night protecting him, the Washington Post reported this morning. Here\u2019s more from the Post: At Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, the Secret Service was charged the $650 rate dozens of times in 2017, and a different rate, $396.15, dozens more times in 2018, according to documents from Trump\u2019s visits. And at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster, the Secret Service was charged $17,000 a month to use a three-bedroom cottage on the property, an unusually high rent for homes in that area, according to receipts from 2017. Trump\u2019s company billed the government even for days when Trump wasn\u2019t there. These payments appear to contradict the Trump Organization\u2019s own statements about what it charges members of his government entourage. \u201cIf my father travels, they stay at our properties for free \u2014 meaning, like, cost for housekeeping,\u201d Trump\u2019s son Eric said in a Yahoo Finance interview last year. Dostre effect a la today\u2019s Washington Post B-boys are battling it out in town Though Democrats are still trying to wrap their heads around what the hell actually happened in Iowa this week, the race still goes on. The candidates will be brawling on TV tonight for the latest Democratic debate in New Hampshire tonight before the primary vote takes place on Tuesday. The scene in New Hampshire is tense in the wake of the Iowa caucus. Former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s on-the-margin win in Iowa helped him surge in a recent New Hampshire poll, putting him in a near-tie with senator Bernie Sanders, who closely followed him in the caucus (though declared a caucus victory of his own). Sanders received 24% of support in the poll, while Buttigieg got 23% \u2013 a huge soar compared to the 11% he scored in a New Hampshire poll on Monday. Expect the two to throw punches at each other on stage tonight. Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s campaign appears to be quickly losing momentum. In the poll, Biden trailed senator Elizabeth Warren \u2013 who received 13% of support in the poll \u2013 getting 11% of support. Biden recently got backlash for a cringey video of Biden apparently stroking the face of Samuel Habib, a 20-year-old student and disability rights advocate, who approached the candidate asking him what he will do to support students with disabilities. Habib has since said the interaction felt patronizing. The US added 225,000 jobs in January, a much higher figure than expected. For all the jobs numbers, reaction and analysis, here\u2019s our business live blog. After retweeting various people praising him and attacking enemies like Elizabeth Warren and Nancy Pelosi, Trump has welcomed actor James Woods back to Twitter after he left the platform, claiming it was censoring him. Trump told him: \u201cWelcome back James!\u201d and earlier on retweeted a post by Woods that called Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a \u201cmoron\u201d. He also weighed in on the Democrats\u2019 inability to declare a winner in Iowa, suggesting that they should blame Russia and making a disingenuous comparison with their plans for increased health coverage. Trump has always poured scorn on the US intelligence community\u2019s assertion that Russia meddled in the 2016 election in order to help him win. How Donald Trump and his allies will react towards his perceived political enemies now that he has been acquitted in his impeachment trial remains to be seen. Bloomberg News reports that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman \u2013 who gave evidence against Trump during the impeachment \u2013 may be moved from the National Security Council. Trump made reference to Vindman as he hit out at his foes during his post-acquittal speech at the White House yesterday. \u201cLieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, we had some people that were really amazing,\u201d he said, before moving on. Meanwhile Yahoo News reports that the US Treasury Department has given congressional Republicans access to financial information relating to Hunter Biden \u2013 the son of Democratic hopeful Joe Biden, whose work in Ukraine played a key role in kicking off the impeachment. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin has blocked Democratic requests for access to Trump\u2019s tax filings, saying: \u201cThe legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power.\u201d Nevertheless, Axios has reported that there is little appetite among the Republican leadership in Washington to pursue the Bidens. Alayna Treene wrote: \u201cSome Republicans fear aggressively pursuing any investigations about Burisma will give the appearance of trying to hurt Joe Biden \u2014 a former Senate colleague \u2014politically, which isn\u2019t worth it to them, the aide said, \u2018especially since the Biden campaign looks like it\u2019s toast.\u2019\u201d Walsh placed third in the Republican Iowa caucuses this week, with 1.07% of the vote. His move leaves former governor Bill Weld as the only Republican challenger to Trump. He got 1.32% in Iowa. Trump came in first with 97.14%. The president mused about his two challengers during his speech yesterday. We also had an election out there and we got 98 percent of the vote. We have two people running, you know. I guess they consider them non-people. One is a governor, but they\u2019re running. They said, who is that crowd over there? It was Trump, right, Mark Meadows? It was Trump. This was a Trump crowd. Walsh said today: \u201cDonald Trump is the greatest threat to our republic right now ... The rest of this country needs to come together to stop this guy, period.\u201d My colleague David Smith interviewed Walsh recently. Former congressman Joe Walsh has dropped his primary challenge against Donald Trump, telling CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s not a party. It\u2019s a cult. He can\u2019t be beat in the Republican primary so there\u2019s no reason for me, or any candidate, really to be in there.\u201d It\u2019s been a rollercoaster week in US politics, starting with the voting debacle in Iowa on Monday and carrying on through Donald Trump\u2019s divisive State of the Union speech and his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial. But who are the losers and winners from a dramatic few days for Republicans and Democrats? 5/5: Donald Trump A swaggering and aggressive US president called his speech at the White House on Thursday a \u201ccelebration\u201d \u2013 and well he might. He was coming to the end of a week in which he had spent 80 minutes making the case for his re-election on primetime TV in his State of the Union speech and had been acquitted in his impeachment trial \u2013 with only one Republican breaking ranks to vote against him. A Gallup poll put the president\u2019s approval rating at 49%, the highest level for that survey since 2017, and on top of that the Democratic primary race got off to a disastrously shambolic start in Iowa. Holding up a newspaper front page that said \u201cTrump acquitted\u201d, the president told his White House crowd: \u201cLet me take that home; maybe we\u2019ll frame it. It\u2019s the only good headline I\u2019ve ever had in the Washington Post.\u201d His speech sounded like a preview of the one he plans to make on 4 November after winning the election. 4/5: Pete Buttigieg If anyone managed to wring any momentum out of the mess in Iowa, it was the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who more or less declared victory before the results were in and went on to grab as much of the spotlight as possible. Did he even win? With almost 100% of the vote in, Buttigieg is only 0.09% ahead of socialist rival Bernie Sanders in the delegate count, and Sanders is ahead of the young pretender in the popular vote. But the veteran Vermont senator will now have to wait until New Hampshire next week to grab his share of the glory. 3/5: Mike Bloomberg The billionaire former mayor of New York\u2019s decision to sit out the early states and instead blanket California with advertising seems partially vindicated. With the usual momentum conferred on the winner of Iowa blunted, a strong showing from Bloomberg in the array of states voting on Super Tuesday (3 March) is bound to launch a thousand think-pieces asking whether Bloomberg can elbow aside Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg and unite the centre. Feel queasy about a rich man buying the race? Bloomberg has an answer. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Are you spending too much money?\u2019 and I said, \u2018I\u2019m spending money to get rid of Donald Trump.\u2019 And the guy said, \u2018Spend more.\u2019 \u201d 2/5: Joe Biden Barack Obama\u2019s former vice-president went into the week as the frontrunner in the Democratic race and still leads most national polls and match-ups with Trump. But coming fourth in Iowa \u2013 a result he called a gut-punch \u2013 has seriously dented his pitch that he is the most electable candidate. If he underperforms again in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Biden could find supporters and donors abandoning him for Buttigieg or Bloomberg. 1/5: Nancy Pelosi The leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives took a lot of persuading to agree to impeach Trump, only doing so when the strength of the evidence in the Ukraine case became overwhelming. She initiated the process knowing it was almost certain Trump would be acquitted, but hoping to put his impeachment on the record for posterity, gum up his legislative agenda, and damage him ahead of this November\u2019s election. She has succeeded on the first two points, but the latter is very much up for debate. And on top of that, Pelosi \u2013 usually so poised in her dealings with Trump \u2013 risked losing the moral high ground when she tore up her copy of his State of the Union speech on live TV, leading secretary of state Mike Pompeo to liken her to Lisa Simpson. (Critics said he hadn\u2019t understood the episode.) 0/5: The state of Iowa Iowa was already facing criticism that as a small, 90% white, largely rural state it had a disproportionate impact on the Democratic race even before Monday\u2019s debacle, in which apps failed and telephone lines were overwhelmed, meaning that even by Friday Democrats were unable to say who had won the first contest of primary season. In the results the party eventually released, vote tallies did not add up, and figures contained inconsistencies and errors, according to the New York Times, leading the national party chair to demand a review \u201cto assure public confidence in the results\u201d. Conspiracy theories raged that the party was deliberately sabotaging Sanders\u2019 chances \u2013 and the Trump campaign gleefully fanned the flames. If the Iowa state party had deliberately set out to undermine its own place in the primary hierarchy it couldn\u2019t have done better than this. Donald Trump has been tweeting his support for his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping as Beijing struggles to deal with the coronavirus (you can read the latest on that here). China is reportedly worried about what the virus means for its ability to stick to the terms of its new trade agreements with the US, and some officials are apparently angry at Washington\u2019s travel restrictions and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019s comment that the outbreak \u201cwill help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America\u201d. Who has won the Iowa caucuses? We still don\u2019t know. With almost 100% of the vote in, former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is only 0.09% ahead of socialist rival Bernie Sanders in the delegate count, while Sanders is ahead of the young pretender in the popular vote. The Associated Press says it is still too close to call. Both Buttigieg and Sanders claimed victory last night. CNN asked the centrist former mayor for his reaction to the latest tally. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic news, to hear that we won,\u201d Buttigieg said. Meanwhile, Sanders pumped out social media posts baldly claiming \u201cBernie wins Iowa\u201d \u2013 and basing that in the small print on his lead in the popular vote. \u201cWe did very well,\u201d Sanders told CNN. \u201cWe won in Iowa.\u201d In truth, it\u2019s probably accurate to call Iowa a draw. The Democratic race will be decided based on the number of delegates won, and both Buttigieg and Sanders will probably come out of Iowa with the same number. That said, Sanders went in to the contest as the narrow favourite, so in terms of perception and momentum it has probably been a win for the former mayor. The winner certainly wasn\u2019t the Iowa Democratic party. National party chair Tom Perez called for a \u201crecanvass\u201d of the tally on Thursday. \u201cA recanvass is a review of the worksheets from each caucus site to ensure accuracy,\u201d he explained after some confusion about that. He later said he was only calling for a recanvass in certain sites. To add to the confusion, AP reported that \u201cit was unclear if the party planned to follow the directive of the national leader to recanvass those results \u2026 Iowa chairman Troy Price suggested in a statement Thursday that he would only pursue a recanvass if one was requested by a campaign.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough of Iowa,\u201d Sanders told CNN on Thursday night. \u201cI think we should move on to New Hampshire.\u201d That contest is on Tuesday and uses a conventional voting system. Also today: 8.30am ET (1.30pm): The monthly US jobs report will be released 1pm ET: Trump will speak at the North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit. He will later speak at the Republican Governors Association Finance Dinner in Washington 8pm ET: Democratic candidates will take part in a debate in New Hampshire",

In a further sign that plant-based food is now firmly mainstream, retailers have reported rocketing sales of vegan takeaway foods, with ingredients such as hummus gaining popularity. There has been a surge in the number of plant-based foods on offer in the UK, and this year a record 400,000-plus people worldwide signed up to the Veganuary campaign. Since 2014, it has asked people to pledge to eat a vegan diet for the month of January. It said the latest figure compares with 250,000 participants in 2019 and 170,000 in 2018. In the UK, 130,000 people signed up compared with 100,000 last year. Manufacturers, supermarkets, restaurants and pub chains are increasingly tapping into not only the burgeoning vegan market but the much larger group of \u201cflexitarians\u201d, who enjoy meat but want to reduce their meat consumption.

His 19-race winning streak has, as Tony McCoy always said about his winner-count at the start of a new season, been reset to zero. Unlike McCoy, though, Altior can\u2019t tell us how he feels about starting from scratch.</p> \n<p>That will become apparent only when, or if, he comes under some pressure on Saturday. Altior has always been, in the eyes of the stern judges at Timeform, \u201cnotably genuine and reliable\u201d.

First time up in the new season, on soft ground and over a new trip three furlongs beyond anything he had tried before, Altior was pitched into a gladiatorial head-to-head with Cyrname, the top-rated chaser in training. It was at Ascot too, which is akin to opting to play Liverpool at Anfield instead of your own home patch, and Nicky Henderson, his trainer, still seems to be regretting it even now.</p> \n<p>The form numbers and timefigures for the Christy 1965 Chase in November suggest that both Cyrname and Altior drew the sort of performances from each other that are usually reserved for Cheltenham in March, after several months of steady race-to-race conditioning. To do it first time up is something else entirely, and while Cyrname went on to finish second in the King George in his next race, he was 21 lengths behind Clan Des Obeaux and, again according to Timeform, 30lb below his Ascot form.</p> \n<p>Henderson pointed to Cyrname\u2019s below-par run at Kempton earlier this week, while also claiming that Altior went to Ascot in an attempt to prove that he was not just a \u201cboring two-miler\u201d. A quick Google search of \u2018Altior\u2019 and \u2018boring\u2019 however, suggests that Henderson himself is the only person who has ever used the words together \u2013 as in \u201ceverybody says it is boring watching him go round over two miles\u201a\u201d a couple of days before his Ascot defeat.</p> \n<p>Altior has had longer to recover from Ascot, as possible engagements at Kempton and back at Ascot came and went amid some high-profile uncertainty about Altior\u2019s readiness for a return to action. But history shows that while some horses have little trouble rediscovering their winning mojo after a long streak of victories is snapped, for others it is much more difficult.</p> \n<p>Big Buck\u2019s, who held the record for consecutive wins over jumps until Altior overtook him at Sandown last April, had been off the track for 14 months when he lost for the first time in 19 races at Cheltenham in January 2014. Next time up, in what turned out to be his final race, he was beaten again, in the Stayers\u2019 Hurdle at the Festival.</p> \n<p>But Faugheen and the Henderson-trained Buveur D\u2019Air, who both racked up 11-race winning streaks, were winners next time up after defeat \u2013 in a Grade One in the case of Faugheen \u2013 though neither has ever quite recaptured the air of invincibility that preceded them to the track in their pomp.</p> \n<p>Which way will Altior turn at Newbury on Saturday?
