      "bodyText": "A staggering 80% of asylum seekers sent to Mexico to await US court hearings report being victims of violence, according a survey by Doctors Without Borders (MSF). In one month \u2013 October \u2013 three-quarters of asylum seekers seen by MSF physicians in Nuevo Laredo reported having been kidnapped for ransom, according to the figures released on Wednesday. Some 44% of MSF patients also reported having been victims of violence in the week leading up to their consultations. Wednesday marked the first anniversary of a scheme officially known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), under which migrants seeking asylum in the United States are sent to Mexico to wait as their cases wind their way through US courts. Under the scheme, also known as \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d, more than 57,000 non-Mexican asylum seekers have been sent to wait in cities along the border \u2013 many of which have been plagued by drug-war violence for years. Migrants \u2013 who stand out because of their appearance and accents \u2013 are routinely targeted for abduction outside migration offices and bus terminals, and held until relatives back home wire ransom payments to the kidnappers. \u201cThe US continues to send asylum seekers back into danger and into the hands of the cartels that control the migration routes in Mexico,\u201d said Sergio Mart\u00edn, MSF general coordinator in Mexico. \u201cThe Mexican government lacks the ability to provide the most minimum of conditions for thousands of people who are being sent to its territory,\u201d he said. Migrants are at risk along the entire border, \u201cbut mainly in places like Nuevo Laredo, where there is serious violence \u2013 and migrants are \u2018merchandise\u2019 for organised crime,\u201d Mart\u00edn said. Nuevo Laredo is considered so insecure that the US government has issued a Level 4: \u201cDo not travel\u201d alert to its citizens for the city and surrounding state of Tamaulipas \u2013 the same as war-torn countries like Syria and Afghanistan. The Cartel del Noreste \u2013 an offshoot of the blood thirsty Zetas cartel \u2013 \u201coperates a sophisticated kidnapping business that targets asylum seekers \u2013 many of whom are women and children \u2013 who enter the city,\u201d said Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the Strauss Center at the University of Texas. \u201cThe kidnappers charge several thousand dollars for each kidnapped asylum seeker and operate with almost complete impunity.\u201d The Mexican government promised to provide asylum seekers with shelter, work permits and access to health services, but observers say many of the migrants have been left to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, the US department of homeland security announced that the scheme would be expanded to include Brazilians. Brazilian arrivals at the border have tripled in the past year.",

He sniffed the mounting embarrassment for himself.</p> <p>After Navratilova used the still-live microphone on an empty umpire\u2019s chair on an outside court on Tuesday to signal her and McEnroe\u2019s objections, Tennis Australia went into the sort of damage limitation familiar to politicians who \u2013 let\u2019s say \u2013 are out of the country on holidays when they should be at their post dealing with a national emergency. A statement concluded: \u201cTwo high-profile guests have breached these protocols and we are working through this with them.\u201d</p> <p>It sounded like a couple of jail escapees had been recaptured and were undergoing re-education chained to a wall in a dungeon under the supervision of Nurse Ratched.</p> <p>It was easy to feel some sympathy for TA. No sooner had the choking air from surrounding bushfires eased to manageable proportions than Tiley and his team were lumbered with a moral dilemma that, to be fair to them, was not of their making.

      "bodyText": "Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe, for once, had nothing of substance to apologise for. Nevertheless, two of the most outspoken voices in tennis, went through the motions here on Wednesday to soothe the ego of Margaret Court, Australia\u2019s finest ever woman player, who is also a homophobe of no regrets and holds views that went out of fashion in the 19th century, as well as the sensitivities of Craig Tiley, whose normally excellent stewardship of the Australian Open has looked more like the captain of the Hesperus ignoring an advancing storm that his drunken first mate could see coming. Court probably did not have to lean on Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia and the tournament director of the Australian Open, to demand that Navratilova and McEnroe apologise for suggesting that her eponymous stadium be renamed after Evonne Goolagong Cawley. He sniffed the mounting embarrassment for himself. After Navratilova used the still-live microphone on an empty umpire\u2019s chair on an outside court on Tuesday to signal her and McEnroe\u2019s objections, Tennis Australia went into the sort of damage limitation familiar to politicians who \u2013 let\u2019s say \u2013 are out of the country on holidays when they should be at their post dealing with a national emergency. A statement concluded: \u201cTwo high-profile guests have breached these protocols and we are working through this with them.\u201d It sounded like a couple of jail escapees had been recaptured and were undergoing re-education chained to a wall in a dungeon under the supervision of Nurse Ratched. It was easy to feel some sympathy for TA. No sooner had the choking air from surrounding bushfires eased to manageable proportions than Tiley and his team were lumbered with a moral dilemma that, to be fair to them, was not of their making. It was Court, invited over from Perth to be recognised with a replica trophy on the 50th anniversary of her calendar grand slam, who would not let it lie. Court demanded recognition for her tennis \u2013 rightly so \u2013 and now TA had to seek an apology from two former players who disagreed strongly with her non-tennis views but who, fortuitously, had given the headmaster a way to punish them, because they had infringed \u201csafety protocols\u201d. There are probably more safety protocols in Australia than exist in a humidicrib. Navratilova\u2019s hijacking of a microphone was obviously a very dangerous transgression indeed. Anyway, she said sorry. Sort of. Talking on the Tennis Channel (rather than risking further opprobrium by snatching another microphone), she said, \u201cI got in trouble. I am sorry. I broke protocol. I had no idea there was this kind of protocol.\u201d McEnroe, whose part in this life-threatening villainy was to hold up a banner that bore the anarchic words, \u201cEvonne Goolagong Arena\u201d, danced a similarly silly tango. \u201cAdmittedly, I was never one to study the rule book carefully or, for that matter, even at times abide by the rules,\u201d he said in a statement, stopping only to throw in a joke against himself. He added, \u201cFor that I apologise to Tennis Australia and recognise and appreciate the great job they have done to make the Australian Open a great event for the fans, players and myself.\u201d He might have added, \u201cAnd will you now please take that gun out of my back.\u201d No shots were fired. No blood was spilt. The Hesperus did not crash on the rocks. Yet, the Margaret Court saga will rumble on. Because, it seems, she will never apologise.",

      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid is expected to throw his weight behind the controversial HS2 rail project at a key meeting on Thursday, after the Treasury concluded it will still deliver economic benefits despite spiralling costs. The chancellor is poised to tell Boris Johnson and Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, that he believes the sums still add up despite the price tag having risen to an estimated \u00a388bn. A final decision is unlikely to be made until next week \u2013 but with value for money the main source of concern inside government, Javid\u2019s backing removes an important obstacle. Allies of Javid said Treasury officials had been scrutinising the economic case for the plan \u2013 and that he had concluded there was little alternative given the government\u2019s stated aim of \u201clevelling up\u201d regions outside London. However, the chancellor is expected to demand tighter budget controls over future stages of the project. A National Audit Office report concluded last week that the final cost of the scheme was \u201cimpossible to estimate with certainty\u201d. Before December\u2019s election, Johnson postponed making a decision about the future of the 250mph Y-shaped rail network, which would link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. HS2 has long been politically controversial but Johnson has tended to support public infrastructure schemes in the past, and during the election campaign he called it a project of \u201cgreat national importance\u201d. The prime minister has also faced enthusiastic lobbying in favour of the rail link from northern mayors, including Conservative Andy Street, the mayor of Birmingham, who called HS2 \u201ca once in a generation game-changing investment\u201d. By contrast, a group of new Conservative MPs in \u201cblue wall\u201d northern seats have banded together to call for the project to be scrapped, and the money saved spent on smaller-scale infrastructure projects in the Midlands and the north. But with the Treasury planning a significant increase in borrowing to fund investment, government sources suggest Tory MPs can be reassured that many of these projects may still be affordable even if HS2 goes ahead. The Treasury is currently reviewing the way the government assesses the costs and benefits of public sector projects. Changes to the so-called \u201cgreen book\u201d, which sets the framework for officials to judge value for money, are expected to work in favour of schemes such as HS2, by allowing a wider definition of economic benefits to be included. Johnson was asked by Conservative backbencher Kevin Hollinrake at PMQs on Wednesday: \u201cDoes the prime minister agree that we need to increase capacity in our railways in and between the north, the Midlands, the south and Scotland, and unless we want decades of disruption, the only way to do this through the Midlands engine rail, northern powerhouse rail and HS2?\u201d He would only reply that an announcement would be made \u201cvery shortly\u201d.",

Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle company made a profit of $105m in the last quarter of 2019 on revenues of $7.38bn, both were better than expected and sent Tesla\u2019s share close to 7% higher in after-hours trading. The good news continued a remarkable streak for Tesla after a period when many doubted its long-term viability. Tesla\u2019s shares have surged nearly 120% since the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings release in October.

Nevertheless, to win his 21st major the six-time champion will have to go through the man who has turned the screws on his genius more often in recent years than anyone in the game and who, last summer at Wimbledon, inflicted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/novak-djokovic-roger-federer-wimbledon-mens-final-match-report\" title=\"\">searing defeat on him</a>.

Twice he squandered the advantage. And, uncharacteristically, he lost his temper with the officials when given a time violation for slow serving in the second set. He had bounced back three times from 2-0 down, and raised his level appreciably to stay in the tournament, but he could not sustain it in the fourth set, when his stamina looked to leave him. A break up, Thiem wobbled at the end.</p> <p>As Kyrgios did two nights previously, Thiem wobbled in sight of the line, a double fault and three unforced errors letting Nadal back in the conversation at 5-all. As the clocked ticked past four hours, they went to a third tie-break \u2013 Thiem\u2019s fifth of the tournament, Nadal\u2019s sixth. The younger man, trembled again on the first of three match points, serving, but prevailed (aided by the net), 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (6). There were a lot of stories in Nadal\u2019s closing, weary forehand into the net.</p> <p>Thiem\u2019s battle with Zverev on Friday will be engrossing, a pointer to the future, with no clear favourite \u2013 and still it will not hold the history of Federer versus Djokovic.</p>",

Federer knows he could have lost against John Millman; perhaps he should have lost against Tennys Sandgren. Nevertheless, to win his 21st major the six-time champion will have to go through the man who has turned the screws on his genius more often in recent years than anyone in the game and who, last summer at Wimbledon, inflicted a searing defeat on him. It was the Serb\u2019s 26th triumph in their 49-match rivalry \u2013 and his 20th from their past 30, including a walkover \u2013 when he saved two match points to move within four slam victories of Federer\u2019s record tally. How, we wondered, could he recover from that to remain in contention here? A subsequent victory against Djokovic at the ATP World Tour Finals helped, he acknowledged. \u201cIt showed me he is beatable,\u201d Federer said. \u201cIf I play my game, I have to do several things well. But I hope it is the same thing for players against me, and Rafa [Nadal] as well. You cannot just serve well, you cannot just play well from the back of the court. You need to have mixed skills and he is one of these players who are like that. It does me good to know that, at my age, I can prove, from time to time, that I can beat Rafa and Novak and win tournaments. The challenge in five sets is bigger. You have to do even more good things for longer. But I have played so many matches that obviously I believe. I believe until the end.\u201d They all believe. They would be skiing in Switzerland if they didn\u2019t. Or fishing in Mallorca. And, whether Zverev wins the title or not, whether or not he even gets to the final, the 22-year-old German has already won Australia. The son of parents who grew up in the Soviet Union lives in the tax haven of Monte Carlo and has earned more than $US20m in his short career. And he is standing by his pre-tournament promise to donate his entire $A4.12m purse to bushfire relief if he finally becomes a grand slam champion on Sunday; that is a gesture of rare magnanimity in modern professional sport. \u201cOf course, if I win the $4m, it\u2019s a lot of money for me,\u201d he said after his excellent four-set win against the 2014 champion. \u201cI\u2019m not Roger, I\u2019m not LeBron James. This is still big. But, at the same time, I know there are people right now in this country, in this beautiful country, who lost their homes and they need the money. They depend on it, building their homes again, building up the nature that Australia has, the animals as well. I think there\u2019s much better use for those people with that money than I have right now.\u201d Whatever cynicism attaches to his decision to decline playing for his country in the Davis Cup Finals last November, then embarking on a lucrative exhibition tour with Federer, Zverev is going to \u201cpony up\u201d in Melbourne, and a bit of sentimental history is there for the taking if he backs his generosity with the sort of tennis that has made him one of the most exciting young players on the Tour. Twice in the first two hours of the evening quarter-final, Nadal led Thiem 4-2. Twice he squandered the advantage. And, uncharacteristically, he lost his temper with the officials when given a time violation for slow serving in the second set. He had bounced back three times from 2-0 down, and raised his level appreciably to stay in the tournament, but he could not sustain it in the fourth set, when his stamina looked to leave him. A break up, Thiem wobbled at the end. As Kyrgios did two nights previously, Thiem wobbled in sight of the line, a double fault and three unforced errors letting Nadal back in the conversation at 5-all. As the clocked ticked past four hours, they went to a third tie-break \u2013 Thiem\u2019s fifth of the tournament, Nadal\u2019s sixth. The younger man, trembled again on the first of three match points, serving, but prevailed (aided by the net), 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (6). There were a lot of stories in Nadal\u2019s closing, weary forehand into the net. Thiem\u2019s battle with Zverev on Friday will be engrossing, a pointer to the future, with no clear favourite \u2013 and still it will not hold the history of Federer versus Djokovic.",

Staff who have seen multiple rounds of redundancies and reorganisations in recent BBC history appeared resigned to their fates today, while being intensely sceptical of the idea that one crew of journalists could produce content for wildly different programmes such as BBC Breakfast, 5 Live, and Newsnight. Many pointed out the five BBC News managers announcing the cuts in the broadcaster\u2019s central London headquarters had combined salaries approaching a million pounds a year, and appear to be remaining in their positions. The cuts announced today have also kept headline programme closures to a minimum, making it easier for BBC bosses to push through a substantial reduction in the headcount. Show closures cause outrage among politicians and audiences when they learn that their favourite programme is going off air \u2013 as seen by the reaction to canning Victoria Derbyshire\u2019s programme. But saving the brand name while removing much of a show\u2019s resources is a much easier sell. Unsworth is aware that the BBC will come under pressure over the job cuts but she told staff that the BBC now has no choice but to redirect resources into online journalism if it wants to ensure it has a future audience. \u201cOur friends and enemies in the press, well mainly enemies, would like us to be in the broadcasting model only. The problem is the under-35 audience are getting all their news from social media and the internet. They\u2019re not watching bulletins,\u201d she said, making clear that she expected pushback. \u201cIf the press don\u2019t like it and the Sun don\u2019t like it \u2013 well I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s just tough.\u201d",

It was never a sending off, absolutely a joke. It\u2019s ironic that he gets a yellow on his first foul, almost gets a yellow on his second foul which isn\u2019t even a foul, and yeah the last one is a yellow. But how many times did they foul us? How many times was Dan James fouled? In the first half, Jesse? That\u2019s the first question you have asked and it shouldn\u2019t be like this because I am so proud of my players. They have beaten City twice in six weeks at their place. We\u2019ve come so far with these boys and we have given absolutely everything.

We conceded a goal the first time they shot on target, one set piece, we were unlucky. We created enough chances to score many goals, but we didn\u2019t convert, we have to be more clinical. We have to score goals. But I was not concerned, I was incredibly happy. We played really well.\u201d Were you pleased with it? \u201cA lot. In 180 minutes, we were better than United. We are incredibly happy to go to Wembley again for our third final in a row. So that means when people say we are complacent, relaxed after success ... you can be distracted but it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e32006b8f0811db2faedc10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T22:00:51.596Z\">10.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hot managerial chat coming up soon!</strong> In the meantime, David Hytner\u2019s verdict has landed, and here it is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/29/manchester-city-manchester-united-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\">Manchester City reach Carabao Cup final despite Matic\u2019s winner for United</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e31fdfe8f08e133247396ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T21:54:26.867Z\">9.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Kevin De Bruyne speaks. </strong>\u201cI can\u2019t really comprehend how we lost this game.

Now we are going to fight to win the cup.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ilkay Gundogan adds: </strong>\u201cWe started well but after United scored we were a bit sloppy and lost some balls unnecessarily. We should have scored at least one or two goals today, but it was not meant to be. But obviously we are very happy to go to another final. And it is a learning process for the Real Madrid games.\u201d</p> <p>Neither of them looked particularly happy.

Meanwhile City can look forward to yet another cup final; they\u2019ll be hot favourites to make it three League Cups in a row against Aston Villa. Though it\u2019s not all good news for them tonight: Liverpool have won 2-0 at West Ham United, thanks to a first-half penalty from Mohamed Salah and a second-half Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain goal.

They can do it. They have done it.\u201d</strong> Twice in the Champions League recently, in fact, coming back from two goals down to beat Olympiakos in 2014 under David Moyes, then repeating the trick against PSG last year with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the wheel. Say what you will about the current state of United; they\u2019re still a club who know how to turn around a cup tie.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s also the weird lop-sided nature of the Manchester derby to take into account.</strong> United have won their last two matches at City\u2019s gaff, and three of the last five. City, who by contrast regularly turn United over at Old Trafford, have won just one of their last five derbies at home. The away side has won five of the last six. There\u2019s no point trying to rationalise any of this. It is what it is.</p> <p><strong>So while United go into tonight\u2019s second leg 3-1 down, and their chances on the face of things look slim, they\u2019ll retain some hope. </strong>Then again, only Tranmere Rovers have ever let a two-goal League Cup semi-final lead slip, in 1994 against Aston Villa; City have won seven of their last eight matches in all competitions; and if Pep\u2019s men turn it on like they did in the first half hour at Old Trafford, the holders will breeze their way to the final yet again.</p> <p><strong>Who will face Aston Villa in the Wembley final on March 1? </strong>City should finish the job, and are the hot bookies favourites. But in the Manchester derby, nothing\u2019s ever certain. So good luck to the sky blues, good luck to the reds, and may the best team win. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>7.45pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T19:39:14.630Z\">at 7.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Congratulations to Manchester City, commiserations to Manchester United. Looking forward to the final already. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! A visibly irritated Solskjaer gives his verdict on the dismissal of Matic. \u201cIt is hard to go here and score a goal with 11, never mind ten. It was never a sending off, absolutely a joke. It\u2019s ironic that he gets a yellow on his first foul, almost gets a yellow on his second foul which isn\u2019t even a foul, and yeah the last one is a yellow. But how many times did they foul us? How many times was Dan James fouled? In the first half, Jesse? That\u2019s the first question you have asked and it shouldn\u2019t be like this because I am so proud of my players. They have beaten City twice in six weeks at their place. We\u2019ve come so far with these boys and we have given absolutely everything. They\u2019ve come a long way, they\u2019ve developed.\u201d Pep\u2019s verdict. \u201cWe played really well, in both games, and were fantastic. We conceded a goal the first time they shot on target, one set piece, we were unlucky. We created enough chances to score many goals, but we didn\u2019t convert, we have to be more clinical. We have to score goals. But I was not concerned, I was incredibly happy. We played really well.\u201d Were you pleased with it? \u201cA lot. In 180 minutes, we were better than United. We are incredibly happy to go to Wembley again for our third final in a row. So that means when people say we are complacent, relaxed after success ... you can be distracted but it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Hot managerial chat coming up soon! In the meantime, David Hytner\u2019s verdict has landed, and here it is. Kevin De Bruyne speaks. \u201cI can\u2019t really comprehend how we lost this game. For me, United had only one chance today. In front we were way too wasteful, and we have to learn from this. But in the end it\u2019s good that we go into the final. Now we are going to fight to win the cup.\u201d Ilkay Gundogan adds: \u201cWe started well but after United scored we were a bit sloppy and lost some balls unnecessarily. We should have scored at least one or two goals today, but it was not meant to be. But obviously we are very happy to go to another final. And it is a learning process for the Real Madrid games.\u201d Neither of them looked particularly happy. Manchester City\u2019s relentless professionalism and never-ending pursuit of perfection, right there! City celebrate not so much in giddy happiness but relief. United by contrast look thoroughly gutted, having come closer than most expected to forcing this semi-final to penalties. Harry Maguire in particular is a picture of misery. But United should be proud of their efforts tonight, and once the pain of winning the battle but losing the war subsides, they\u2019ll reflect on an evening of precious positivity as the Solskjaer rebuild continues. Meanwhile City can look forward to yet another cup final; they\u2019ll be hot favourites to make it three League Cups in a row against Aston Villa. Though it\u2019s not all good news for them tonight: Liverpool have won 2-0 at West Ham United, thanks to a first-half penalty from Mohamed Salah and a second-half Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain goal. They\u2019re now 19 points clear at the top of the Premier League. Nope. There\u2019s just enough time for a pitch invasion by a six-year-old. He\u2019s ushered off, and the referee blows for time. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer warmly congratulates his opposite number Pep Guardiola. His team did him proud tonight, but this tie was lost in the first 30 minutes at Old Trafford. City stumble over the line, and they\u2019ll face Aston Villa at Wembley on March 1! 90 min +4: Jesus meanders down the left and draws a foul from a frustrated Wan-Bissaka, who is booked. City take the free kick short, but in trying to hold it by the corner flag, run it out for a goal kick. Can United launch one last hail-Mary attack? 90 min +3: Sergio Aguero is replaced by Gabriel Jesus. That clock ticks on. 90 min +2: James crosses deep from the right. Maguire, at the far post, would have to be ten feet tall to meet it. Goal kick. 90 min +1: The first of four added minutes flies by for United without incident. 90 min: City go into lockdown, replacing Kevin De Bruyne with John Stones. 89 min: Walker creams a pass down the middle. With everyone in red upfield, Bernardo Silva is sent clear! But as he scampers goalward, the whistle goes. Turns out at the start of the move, Mata took a throw-in with one foot off the ground. Foul throw. City are beyond furious, the decision has done them no favours whatsoever. 88 min: Fred blooters a witless free kick into the wall. As City skelp clear, the home fans cheer as loudly as they would for a goal. 87 min: There really was no need for that challenge, Maguire was going nowhere. Otamendi deservedly goes in the book, and is bollocked by De Bruyne as well. Why?!? 86 min: United pass and probe, looking for a way through. Suddenly Otamendi races out from the back and clatters into Maguire. What a buffoonish challenge. And this is a free kick in a central position, just outside the D. 84 min: City look to have clinched it as Cancelo slips a perfectly weighted pass down the inside left, teeing up Aguero to flick past De Gea and into the bottom right in the insouciant style. But the flag goes up for offside. About an inch in it, but the correct decision. 83 min: On the touchline, Pep bollocks his players with the burning intensity of a thousand suns. He\u2019s far from happy at his team\u2019s performance tonight. Nevertheless, they\u2019re still a mere ten minutes away from yet another League Cup final. 82 min: Walker\u2019s up again, and fine to continue. 81 min: But the nerves haven\u2019t gone away totally. Walker and Otamendi clatter into each other as they deal with a ball bouncing down the United left, one that Martial was never going to get. Walker\u2019s taken a sore one there. On comes the physio. 80 min: City make use of their extra man, stroking the ball around the back, letting the clock do its thing. 79 min: But United still have to go for it in attack, with time running out. With this in mind, Luke Shaw is replaced by Juan Mata. 78 min: Aguero spins on the edge of the box. Shaw blocks him. The ball breaks to Gundogan, who lashes over the bar from distance. Panic in the United ranks there, as they reel from Matic\u2019s dismissal. 76 min: United overplay near the City box. Fred gives the ball away to De Bruyne, who slides a pass towards Bernardo Silva on the right. Matic steps across Silva cynically to put a stop to the counter. He\u2019s already been booked, and the referee has no choice. Off he goes, from goalscoring hero to zero. 75 min: Some United possession in the City half now. The nerves beginning to jangle, the crowd whistling with concern. But ... 73 min: City must be wondering whether a place in the final is simply not to be. Maguire plays a godawful pass in his own area, clumping it straight at Aguero. The ball breaks to David Silva, who has to score. But instead of shooting from six yards, he tees up his namesake Bernardo instead, allowing Maguire time to close him down and redeem himself. Then they come again, Aguero shooting into the side netting when set free down the left. How have City not scored there? 72 min: Gundogan tries to open up United with a cute chip down the inside right. The ball flies straight out for a goal kick. 71 min: Gundogan and Sterling combine neatly down the left and win a corner of Wan-Bissaka. It\u2019s City\u2019s eighth of the game; United haven\u2019t had one yet. De Gea fists it clear. Walker, from a mile out, returns a rising missile. What a shot, screaming towards the top left. But it\u2019s too close to De Gea, who is able to punch away spectacularly. 69 min: David Silva nearly has an immediate assist, slipping the ball down the inside left channel for Sterling. But again Sterling can\u2019t get a shot away. Aguero has a go. Nope. Then Lindelof needlessly concedes a corner with a panicked header under no pressure whatsoever, but City do nothing with it. The home side are dominating possession now, but they\u2019ve not forced De Gea into a serious save in this second half yet. 68 min: Riyad Mahrez is replaced by David Silva, who has been sent on to regain a semblance of control for City. 67 min: Mahrez dribbles hard at Shaw down the right. He enters the area and tries to flick De Bruyne clear with a backheel, but the tricks aren\u2019t coming off right now. 65 min: Fred drives City back. He slips the ball wide for Martial, who blazes wildly into the stand. No control or precision whatsoever. He cocks his head back in misery. Then United make their second change, replacing Jesse Lingard with Andreas Pereira. 64 min: Sterling and Gundogan combine well down the left. The ball\u2019s slipped forward to Bernardo, who clumsily miscontrols, allowing Lindelof to shepherd the ball out of play for a goal kick. 62 min: A reminder that, should United find a second and level the scoreline, this tie would go straight to penalties. No away-goal rule, no extra time. 61 min: After an extremely wobbly start to the half, City are beginning to find their feet again. A period of possession in the middle of the park to settle the nerves. 60 min: City\u2019s fans find their voice, hoping to drive their team on. Sterling dribbles hard down the left but can\u2019t get a shot away. Then De Bruyne has a go, but his low cross-cum-shot is easily gathered by De Gea. 58 min: City should have turned the tide here. De Bruyne slips Sterling clear down the inside left. He should slip the ball past De Gea when he enters the area, but hesitates and allows Lindelof to get in the road. Sterling shifts the ball inside, going past one man, then another ... and then he blasts wildly over the bar. Still no goal for Sterling against United. City are still in the lead, but they may be beginning to wonder. 57 min: De Bruyne\u2019s radar goes haywire. De Bruyne\u2019s radar never goes haywire. A scooped forward pass softly lands in De Gea\u2019s arms, nowhere near a sky-blue shirt. Then Rodri is booked for a panicked tug on Lingard, who was threatening to tear down the right wing. City are rocking a little. The crowd are audibly anxious. 55 min: Another loose City pass, straight into touch. The home side are extremely nervous, their fans a little jittery. They need something to happen, because United have the wind in their sail right now. Levelling the tie is far from a pipe dream. 54 min: Martial has a whistle from the best part of 30 yards. Easy meat for Bravo. But United are getting a few chances now. 53 min: The referee tells United captain Maguire that Matic is tip-toeing along the old disciplinary tightrope, having now fouled Aguero unnecessarily. One more and he might be off. Mahrez takes the resulting free kick, out on the left, and makes a mess of it, sending the ball harmlessly out of play for a goal kick. 52 min: The City fans complain a little, though, as their team send simple passes into touch twice in the space of 30 seconds. On the touchline, Pep encourages his players to calm down. They look a little edgy at the moment. 51 min: Matic is booked for a needless clip on Mahrez in the midfield. He doesn\u2019t bother complaining about it. 50 min: United are visibly more confident in this second half. A complete contrast to the first half-hour of City dominance. Plenty of nervous energy in the Etihad. 49 min: Fred swings it towards the far post. Maguire rises above Cancelo, six yards out, and should at least get his header on target. He should score, really. But his effort flies over the bar. Big chance. 48 min: Matic creams a pass down the right for James to chase. James has the legs to beat Cancelo, so the City left-back shoves him over. A free kick in a dangerous position just to the right of the City box. 47 min: Cancelo goes on a storming run down the left, but can\u2019t quite find Aguero with his low pass infield. Then De Bruyne flicks a pass down the right and nearly releases Mahrez, but Maguire is quickly across to cover. City get the second half underway. The visitors have made one half-time change, replacing Mason Greenwood with Dan James. Greenwood apparently took a knock in the first half, though he was also fairly anonymous. Half-time entertainment. A poor Lindelof backpass nearly lets in Aguero. De Gea does enough, racing out of his box and block-tackling Aguero. The ball pings out for a goal kick. And that\u2019s the end of the first half. City were by far the better side for the first 35 minutes, but then Nemanja Matic scored, and now we\u2019ve got ourselves a cup tie. 45 min: Sterling has a whack after cutting in from the left. The rising shot hits Lindelof on the upper arm. Sterling wants a penalty, but the defender had no time to react, and his arm was right by his body in any case, in a natural position. The referee waves play on. 43 min: City have the ball in the net, the result of a sweet flowing move from right to left involving Bernardo, Mahrez, Aguero and De Bruyne. The latter rolls a ball infield for Sterling to slap home from six yards. But there\u2019s to be no first goal against United for Sterling. He\u2019s gone a split second too early, Lindelof holding his position bravely. The flag goes up correctly for offside. 41 min: Silva nearly settles their nerves, dribbling dangerously down the right, past Shaw and into the box. He rolls a pass across the face of goal. A toe-poke would do it, but Aguero is uncharacteristically on the back foot. United were opened up there. 39 min: De Bruyne rolls a pass towards Sterling on the left. The ball\u2019s travelling at 1mph. Sterling lets it trundle slowly under his boot and out for a throw. City and their followers are suddenly a bag of nerves. They need to settle quickly. 37 min: City have been the better side. But United have held firm at the back, and now look. Suddenly the Etihad is a very nervous place. Bravo hesitates over a simple clearance and is nearly closed down by Greenwood. A collective sharp intake of breath, but the keeper clears eventually. Fred curls the free kick in from the left. Silva can only eyebrow a clearing header towards Matic, level with the right-hand post, just inside the box. Matic meets the dropping ball first time, and sweeps a glorious shot into the bottom right! Bravo had no chance, and this semi-final is back on! 34 min: Rodri comes sliding in on Lingard as he races down the left. He clips him, and is slightly fortunate not to go in the book. Just a free kick. From which ... 33 min: City have had nine efforts to United\u2019s zero, and 69% of possession. But look at the scoreline. United will be happy enough so far. More of this, and City may get frustrated. And then if United were to somehow nick a goal, the nerves may kick in. On the touchline, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks relaxed enough. 32 min: Otamendi, accidentally or otherwise, gave De Gea a wee nudge in the ribs there. The keeper also landed painfully on his boot when the pair fell. A sore one, but he\u2019s a big man and is soon up and about again, fine to continue. 30 min: De Bruyne clips a pass down the inside-left channel to release Sterling, who should get a shot away upon reaching the box, but hesitates, allowing Maguire to slide in. The resulting corner ends in a free kick to United, with Otamendi and De Gea falling in a tangle. The keeper\u2019s landed awkwardly, and looks in some pain. On comes the physio. 29 min: Fred loops it towards the far post. Matic tries to meet the high ball, but falls over under a pincer movement launched by Rodri and Cancelo. He wants a penalty but it\u2019s shoulder to shoulder to shoulder and he\u2019s not getting it. 28 min: Lingard drifts in from the left and pings a pass to Greenwood, who is clumped from behind by Otamendi. A free kick to the left of centre, 35 yards out. Everyone lines up on the edge of the box, waiting for Fred\u2019s delivery. 26 min: Walker sprays a long pass down the right. Walker springs the offside trap and whips a cross towards Aguero, who is denied a close-range header by the presence of Lingard. The resulting corner comes to nought. 24 min: City are playing with the patience and confidence you\u2019d expect from a superior team two goals to the good. Pass, pass, passity pass. Suddenly they spring forward en masse, Silva and Aguero combining before teeing up De Bruyne just to the left of the D. De Bruyne looks for the top left, but his fierce rising shot is a wee bit too high. 22 min: City stroke it around the middle of the park, re-establishing control. 20 min: Some good work by Williams down the inside-left channel, as City are pushed back a little. His attempt to work a cute, crisp move with Shaw and Lingard doesn\u2019t quite come off, but full marks for ambition. 19 min: Mahrez fires it long down the middle, but his pass is too meaty for Aguero. City are happy to mix it up. United don\u2019t look comfortable in defence, whatever they do. 17 min: Upon taking the corner, City ping it around awhile. Eventually Sterling peels off down the left and looks like bursting clear into the box. But he runs it out of play with a heavy touch. A wry smile as he picks himself up. 16 min: Gundogan, Silva and Aguero shuttle the ball upfield at speed. Suddenly Aguero is drifting left to right, across the face of the box. He launches towards the top right. De Gea claws it out for a corner. 14 min: Fred spins out of trouble in United\u2019s final third and suddenly there\u2019s a lot of space to work with, City\u2019s press beaten. First Wan-Bissaka nearly breaks clear down the right, then Williams crosses from the left, only just failing to find Martial in the middle. Some hope for United; all they need to do is beat City\u2019s press. All they need to do! 13 min: Sterling whips in low from the left. Aguero nearly gets a toe to the cross but misses it by an inch and the ball sticks to De Gea. 12 min: United spend a little time in the City half. They don\u2019t really go anywhere but that\u2019s not the point of the endeavour. It\u2019s their first prolonged period away from their own third. 10 min: VAR isn\u2019t interested. It\u2019s just a corner. The fact that Maguire slipped clumsily might have swayed the decision, but it\u2019s VAR, so who knows. The corner comes to nothing. 9 min: De Bruyne crosses from the left. Under the ball, Sterling wants a penalty kick as he\u2019s bowled over from behind by Maguire, who took him down while slipping. This is going to VAR. 8 min: Now De Gea is forced to kick a Mahrez snapshot clear. United are finding it difficult to get out of their final third. City have flooded the midfield and are all over them. 7 min: Bernardo, quarterbacking from deep on the left, floats a diagonal ball into the box. Aguero breaks clear of Shaw down the inside-right channel, guiding a header across De Gea and towards the bottom left. De Gea sticks out a strong arm to parry clear. Stunning save. 5 min: City are beginning to find their groove. Rodri has a whack from distance. It\u2019s charged down and half cleared. City come straight back at United. De Bruyne nearly breaks through down the middle. Bernardo then overhits a pass that would have released Sterling down the left. 3 min: Wan-Bissaka launches long. The ball bounces off Martial\u2019s chest. Poor control. Had he taken that down, he had Greenwood to his left, ready to assist in attack, with City light at the back. 2 min: All a bit frantic in the opening stages. A poor clearing header by Maguire gives De Bruyne the chance to scoop a pass down the middle with the view of releasing Aguero, but Matic reads the play well to intercept and clear United\u2019s lines properly this time. Here we go, then! A quick blast of Blue Moon, then United get the ball rolling in front of a full house at the Etihad. A derby-day roar. The semi-final is happening! Here come the teams! City wear their famous sky blue shirts, United sport their legendary red. The home fans enjoy their usual pre-match singalong of Hey Jude. We\u2019ll be off in a minute or two! Pep talks! He looks extremely relaxed in contrast to his slightly more edgy opposite number. \u201cWe have 2-0. They have to play the game to score goals. But we are going to try to score goals and play our game.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks. First on the Bruno Fernandes transfer: \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed with the club so we can hopefully announce it very soon. That\u2019s of course exciting.\u201d Then last night\u2019s attack on Ed Woodward\u2019s house: \u201cEveryone at the club and proper supporters were disgusted with what had happened. Fans can be passionate and opinions can be voiced in different ways. We\u2019ve got to stick together and stay united.\u201d And finally on tonight\u2019s upcoming spat: \u201cWe need to score two more goals than them! We\u2019ve done it before. We need to match our performance six weeks ago. PSG away is always a good memory. But we need a proper performance with and without the ball. We will throw loads of energy at it.\u201d United have also announced the impending arrival of Bruno Fernandes. This is what they\u2019re getting for their \u00a347m, subject to a medical. There are two differences to the side City put out in the first leg. Joao Cancelo and Sergio Aguero come in for Benjamin Mendy and Fernandinho. United make four swaps from the first leg. Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Nemanja Matic and Anthony Martial come in for Daniel James, Andreas Pereira and Phil Jones, who drop to the bench, and the injured Marcus Rashford. Manchester City: Bravo, Walker, Rodri, Otamendi, Joao Cancelo, De Bruyne, Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Mahrez, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Stones, Gabriel Jesus, Zinchenko, Silva, Ederson, Foden, Garcia. Manchester United: de Gea, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Wan Bissaka, Fred, Matic, Williams, Lingard, Greenwood, Martial. Subs: Bailly, Jones, Mata, Andreas Pereira, Dalot, James, Romero. Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands). This may not be the greatest Manchester United side of all time, and Manchester City might look well in control of this tie. But if you believe in the spiritual - things like club DNA, that kind of stuff - this League Cup semi-final remains in the balance. Pep Guardiola certainly thinks so: \u201cIt\u2019s Manchester United. They can do it. They have done it.\u201d Twice in the Champions League recently, in fact, coming back from two goals down to beat Olympiakos in 2014 under David Moyes, then repeating the trick against PSG last year with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the wheel. Say what you will about the current state of United; they\u2019re still a club who know how to turn around a cup tie. There\u2019s also the weird lop-sided nature of the Manchester derby to take into account. United have won their last two matches at City\u2019s gaff, and three of the last five. City, who by contrast regularly turn United over at Old Trafford, have won just one of their last five derbies at home. The away side has won five of the last six. There\u2019s no point trying to rationalise any of this. It is what it is. So while United go into tonight\u2019s second leg 3-1 down, and their chances on the face of things look slim, they\u2019ll retain some hope. Then again, only Tranmere Rovers have ever let a two-goal League Cup semi-final lead slip, in 1994 against Aston Villa; City have won seven of their last eight matches in all competitions; and if Pep\u2019s men turn it on like they did in the first half hour at Old Trafford, the holders will breeze their way to the final yet again. Who will face Aston Villa in the Wembley final on March 1? City should finish the job, and are the hot bookies favourites. But in the Manchester derby, nothing\u2019s ever certain. So good luck to the sky blues, good luck to the reds, and may the best team win. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 7.45pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "Finlay Calder, the former Scotland and Lions captain, believes England will struggle to replicate the form that took them to the World Cup final three months ago in the forthcoming Six Nations. England\u2019s semi-final dismantling of New Zealand was widely regarded as their finest performance of the professional era, but a 32-12 humbling by South Africa brought a chastening conclusion to their global campaign. Calder, a key figure in the side that beat England in a seismic grand slam decider in 1990, claims the fallout from Saracens\u2019 relegation over salary-cap breaches will also have a negative effect on Eddie Jones\u2019s squad. \u201cI think England will find it tough,\u201d he said. \u201cThat World Cup final knocked the stuffing out of their confidence. They never saw that coming. And with everything going on at Saracens as well, I think that will be a distraction.\u201d England won a grand slam in Jones\u2019s first year in 2016 and the title again the following year. They finished fifth in 2018 and runners-up last year. After opening their campaign in Paris on Sunday, England next head to Murrayfield, where they lost 25-13 two years ago. It is one of only two home games for Gregor Townsend\u2019s side, with France the other visitors. \u201cOf the two sides, I think France will be very difficult,\u201d the 62-year-old Calder said. \u201cThey have got [the defence coach] Shaun Edwards in and he will sort out their discipline; they will be very hard to score against. I think Wales have peaked, too. The World Cup was a big ask and it took it out of them. If I was putting money on anyone, I would put it on France.\u201d Calder, who is helping promote a charity event uniting Scotland\u2019s 1984 and 1990 grand slam squads to raise funds for seriously injured players, is candid about Scotland\u2019s prospects. \u201cWhen Finn Russell [who misses Saturday\u2019s opener in Ireland for disciplinary reasons] wants to play, he is absolutely sublime,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he would have been a nightmare to play with.

      "body": "<p>The day is nearing when, if he were so minded, J\u00fcrgen Klopp could copy his strategy for FA Cup replays and hand the rest of Liverpool\u2019s league season to their second string. Games in hand are only an advantage if you win them and this one was ultimately negotiated in comfort, confirming a 19-point lead that only a wild-eyed fantasist would deem surmountable.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table\" title=\"\">Nineteen points ahead</a>; 23 wins from 24; all 19 Premier League teams defeated at least once. They are statistics that will swill around for the rest of this week but they should not dull in the telling, even if the figures are likely to grow yet more jawdropping in the months to come. Liverpool did not please Klopp with this display and they certainly laboured in the 35 minutes before Mohamed Salah put them ahead from the penalty spot. The number of mistakes that crept in, even once Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had doubled the lead, was enough to afford Alisson the platform to remind everyone that his excellence underpins the imperturbable machine that ploughs on in front of him. But none of it mattered too much: West Ham were allowed their moments, but this is emphatically Liverpool\u2019s season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/29/manchester-city-manchester-united-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\">Manchester City reach Carabao Cup final despite Matic\u2019s winner for United</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m only happy about the three points,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe could have done a lot of things better. We could have passed better and defended better. These boys have played outstanding football throughout the season. Tonight was a normal performance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Liverpool\u2019s version of normal tends to be enough. They took time to find their bearings, with Klopp admitting that West Ham\u2019s 5-4-1 setup made life awkward. \u201cA very important element of football is countering the counter but for that you need the other team to have counterattacks,\u201d was how he put it. They had come particularly close only through Andy Robertson, whose clipped effort was chaperoned away from goal by Issa Diop, in the opening half-hour but then Salah was granted the chance to hold his nerve.</p> \n<p>The opportunity arose when Roberto Firmino, finding the elements of time and space that had hitherto been lacking, did admirably to keep Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s near-post cross alive. He duly threaded the ball across to Divock Origi, who had come in for the injured Sadio Man\u00e9, but the forward still had plenty to do given Diop and the 19-year-old debutant, Jeremy Ngakia, both stood in his way.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"556e64f1a93ef9799a7be6f623baec553b76559c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/556e64f1a93ef9799a7be6f623baec553b76559c/0_113_4682_2809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Ngakia takes on Liverpool\u2019s Andrew Robertson on his West Ham debut.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Ngakia takes on Liverpool\u2019s Andrew Robertson on his West Ham debut.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Meek/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Origi attempted to wriggle between them and was stopped when Diop, wafting out a leg, tripped him on the six-yard line. It seemed needless in such a tight area but Jonathan Moss\u2019s award of a penalty was confirmed at length by VAR, which decided Firmino should not be penalised for what appeared to be a touch with his hand in the buildup. Salah sent Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way and the die was cast.</p> \n<p>Seven minutes after half-time, Salah delightfully assisted Oxlade-Chamberlain. Much to David Moyes\u2019s frustration, the move came about when a West Ham corner landed straight on to the head of Virgil van Dijk.</p> \n<p>They were unable to deal with the second ball in midfield and this time Liverpool had their counter. The home side were caught ahead of the play and Salah, weighting a sublime pass with the outside of his left foot, sent his teammate bursting through. Oxlade-Chamberlain shrugged off the attentions of Manuel Lanzini and finished slickly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a1347ced-6bc5-4c6f-81f5-71c59b0e47b2\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a particularly grim night for Lanzini, who should have equalised several minutes earlier but instead scuffed Robert Snodgrass\u2019s cross weakly at Alisson. The Argentinian\u2019s substitution, in the 69th minute, was cheered.

      "bodyText": "The day is nearing when, if he were so minded, J\u00fcrgen Klopp could copy his strategy for FA Cup replays and hand the rest of Liverpool\u2019s league season to their second string. Games in hand are only an advantage if you win them and this one was ultimately negotiated in comfort, confirming a 19-point lead that only a wild-eyed fantasist would deem surmountable. Nineteen points ahead; 23 wins from 24; all 19 Premier League teams defeated at least once. They are statistics that will swill around for the rest of this week but they should not dull in the telling, even if the figures are likely to grow yet more jawdropping in the months to come. Liverpool did not please Klopp with this display and they certainly laboured in the 35 minutes before Mohamed Salah put them ahead from the penalty spot. The number of mistakes that crept in, even once Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had doubled the lead, was enough to afford Alisson the platform to remind everyone that his excellence underpins the imperturbable machine that ploughs on in front of him. But none of it mattered too much: West Ham were allowed their moments, but this is emphatically Liverpool\u2019s season. \u201cI\u2019m only happy about the three points,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe could have done a lot of things better. We could have passed better and defended better. These boys have played outstanding football throughout the season. Tonight was a normal performance.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s version of normal tends to be enough. They took time to find their bearings, with Klopp admitting that West Ham\u2019s 5-4-1 setup made life awkward. \u201cA very important element of football is countering the counter but for that you need the other team to have counterattacks,\u201d was how he put it. They had come particularly close only through Andy Robertson, whose clipped effort was chaperoned away from goal by Issa Diop, in the opening half-hour but then Salah was granted the chance to hold his nerve. The opportunity arose when Roberto Firmino, finding the elements of time and space that had hitherto been lacking, did admirably to keep Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s near-post cross alive. He duly threaded the ball across to Divock Origi, who had come in for the injured Sadio Man\u00e9, but the forward still had plenty to do given Diop and the 19-year-old debutant, Jeremy Ngakia, both stood in his way. Origi attempted to wriggle between them and was stopped when Diop, wafting out a leg, tripped him on the six-yard line. It seemed needless in such a tight area but Jonathan Moss\u2019s award of a penalty was confirmed at length by VAR, which decided Firmino should not be penalised for what appeared to be a touch with his hand in the buildup. Salah sent Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way and the die was cast. Seven minutes after half-time, Salah delightfully assisted Oxlade-Chamberlain. Much to David Moyes\u2019s frustration, the move came about when a West Ham corner landed straight on to the head of Virgil van Dijk. They were unable to deal with the second ball in midfield and this time Liverpool had their counter. The home side were caught ahead of the play and Salah, weighting a sublime pass with the outside of his left foot, sent his teammate bursting through. Oxlade-Chamberlain shrugged off the attentions of Manuel Lanzini and finished slickly. It was a particularly grim night for Lanzini, who should have equalised several minutes earlier but instead scuffed Robert Snodgrass\u2019s cross weakly at Alisson. The Argentinian\u2019s substitution, in the 69th minute, was cheered. Dispiriting moments like that have become this stadium\u2019s stock in trade but Moyes knows West Ham, who face a potentially far more telling assignment against Brighton here on Saturday, need all the help they can get at this point. \u201c[Lanzini] is arguably one of our best players, if not our best player,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has had a bad injury and what I need is for the supporters to be right behind him because we need him. At the moment he is our flair, he is our person that might make the difference.\u201d Even if Lanzini could not extend Alisson, a first-time effort from Snodgrass drew a fine one-handed stop and, towards the end, a tip-over from Declan Rice\u2019s header was genuinely breathtaking. There was also a moment of slapstick when Alexander-Arnold hammered against his own upright; fortunately for Liverpool, they could afford to get those moments out of their system. \u201cThese boys I rely on,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI would give them my kids to take care of them, so I trust them 100% in these situations. They still make these ridiculous mistakes. It\u2019s nothing to do with motivation, it\u2019s staying concentrated when you are constantly in charge. That is so difficult.\u201d Salah clipped the woodwork himself in those dying moments; one of the night\u2019s more obscure statistics was that he had not scored in his previous nine games in London, but he grew stronger as this one progressed. Those who had travelled in support are well used, by now, to success in the capital and virtually everywhere else. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win the league, and now you\u2019re going to believe us,\u201d they sang, but any moment of epiphany came long ago.",

It\u2019s the early 1980s and Korean parents Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) have decided to move their American-born children out of the city to live in rural Arkansas. Jacob has a plan to turn a large chunk of remote land into a farm, growing Korean vegetables to sell to other immigrant families. But Monica is unsure, wary of his lofty ambitions and concerned for what it might mean for their family. Their son David (Alan S Kim) has a heart murmur but is too preoccupied with causing mischief to care, while their daughter Anne (Noel Cho) is restless, with little to do in their country setting.</p> <p>It\u2019s a delicately told tale, quietly engaging us with the day-to-day minutiae of the family without coercing them into a more traditionally dramatic structure. Chung is focused on the small things, and it\u2019s in these moments that Minari (named after a plant otherwise known as Chinese celery) really comes to life, whether it\u2019s the kids making paper aeroplanes with the words \u201cDon\u2019t fight\u201d as their parents quarrel, or the excitable squeal of Monica as her mother arrives from South Korea, having packed giant bags of chilli powder and anchovies.

At last year\u2019s Sundance, Emile Mosseri\u2019s heart-grabbing score for The Last Black Man in San Francisco did far too much of the heavy lifting for a film that couldn\u2019t match its epic feel. Later in the year, Trey Edward Shults used a stellar soundtrack in Waves to move us further than the film deserved. As Minari begins, so does a similarly hair-raising score, also from Mosseri, and it\u2019s one that only increases in stature as the film progresses. But it\u2019s not working in isolation: it reinforces and deepens the story, and as the finale arrives, its grandiosity suddenly matches what we see on screen.</p> <p>It\u2019s not as if the majority of the film is lacking in emotion, exactly. It\u2019s just a quiet story, at times almost whispered to us. It\u2019s richly textured yet restrained, and I was always engrossed, but it wasn\u2019t until the last 15 minutes, as tragedy strikes, that I suddenly understood how attached I was to the characters, and how ingenious Chung\u2019s slow build was, subtly enveloping us into the fold without us fully realising.

      "body": "<p>There have been some notable heavy rainfall and snowfall events recently. Flooding and landslides in south-east Brazil have killed at least 30 people, with a further 17 missing and 2,600 evacuated from their homes. The events followed extreme rainfall on 24 January, with Belo Horizonte receiving 173mm of rain in 24 hours (a quarter of the expected annual rainfall across south-east England). This was their largest daily rainfall total in 110 years of weather records.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Spain, the effects of Storm Gloria led to 13 deaths last week. The system delivered 86cm of snow over Vilafranca in Valencia on the 22 January. Heavy rain also caused flooding, with some areas of Catalonia receiving more than 150mm of rainfall in 24 hours. Winds from Storm Gloria also generated a wave height of 8.44 metres, the biggest wave ever recorded in the Mediterranean.</p> <p>Eastern Africa has also had abnormally wet weather.

Flooding and landslides in south-east Brazil have killed at least 30 people, with a further 17 missing and 2,600 evacuated from their homes. The events followed extreme rainfall on 24 January, with Belo Horizonte receiving 173mm of rain in 24 hours (a quarter of the expected annual rainfall across south-east England). This was their largest daily rainfall total in 110 years of weather records. Meanwhile in Spain, the effects of Storm Gloria led to 13 deaths last week. The system delivered 86cm of snow over Vilafranca in Valencia on the 22 January. Heavy rain also caused flooding, with some areas of Catalonia receiving more than 150mm of rainfall in 24 hours. Winds from Storm Gloria also generated a wave height of 8.44 metres, the biggest wave ever recorded in the Mediterranean. Eastern Africa has also had abnormally wet weather. Kenya is experiencing its worst outbreak of locusts in 70 years. Rainfall from mid-October has been 200% above average across the region, where billions of locusts are swarming.

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has welcomed a decision by France to dispatch war frigates to the eastern Mediterranean as a standoff with Turkey over regional energy reserves intensifies. With tensions between Athens and Ankara causing growing international alarm, Mitsotakis described the vessels as \u201cguarantors of peace\u201d. \u201cThe only way to end differences in the eastern Mediterranean is through international justice,\u201d he told reporters after holding talks in Paris with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. \u201cGreece and France are pursuing a new framework of strategic defence.\u201d Mitsotakis was in the French capital on a visit aimed at rallying EU support at a time when hostile relations with Turkey have eclipsed all other issues on the agenda of his near seven-month-old government. Macron pledged France would step up its strategic bond with Greece, accusing Turkey of not only exacerbating regional tensions but failing to stick to its promised course of action in war-torn Libya. \u201cI want to express my concerns with regard to the behaviour of Turkey at the moment \u2026 we have seen during these last days Turkish warships accompanied by Syrian mercenaries arrive on Libyan soil. This is an explicit and serious infringement of what was agreed [at last week\u2019s peace conference] in Berlin. It\u2019s a broken promise.\u201d The Gallic-Greek alliance cements what officials in Athens are calling a renewed diplomatic push to counter Turkish belligerence in the Mediterranean. Greece\u2019s defence minister, Nikos Panagiotopoulos, recently went as far as to warn that armed forces were \u201cexamining all scenarios, even that of military engagement\u201d in the face of heightened aggression from Ankara. Rejecting Turkish demands that Greece demilitarise 16 Aegean islands, he accused Turkey of displaying unusually provocative behaviour. The demand, made by his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar, follows a dramatic surge in recent months in the number of violations of Greek airspace by Turkish fighter jets. \u201cGreece does not provoke, does not violate the sovereign rights of others, but it doesn\u2019t like to see its own rights violated,\u201d said Panagiotopoulos. Tensions between the Nato allies prompted Donald Trump to take the unprecedented step of voicing concerns over the situation in a telephone call with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, on Monday. The White House spokesman Judd Deere tweeted that in a conversation focusing on Libya and Syria, the US president had also \u201chighlighted the importance of Turkey and Greece resolving their differences in the east Mediterranean\u201d. Friction between the two neighbours has not been so acute since the invasion of Cyprus in 1974 \u2013 an operation that resulted in the island\u2019s permanent division that is still viewed by Ankara as one of its greatest modern military successes. Privately, Greek officials liken the mood music between the rival countries to 1996, when a military clash over an Aegean islet inhabited solely by goats was narrowly averted after Washington stepped in. \u201cThe intervention has been welcomed,\u201d said one well-placed MP. \u201cBut whether it will help avoid armed confrontation is far from sure.\u201d Regional tensions have escalated as Turkish anger has risen over conflicting claims to potentially massive energy reserves in the eastern Mediterranean. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ire has so far been aimed at Cyprus, where a feud over exploration rights has deepened following the discovery of natural gas deposits in waters around the island. Ignoring Turkish anger at not being included, the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government has forged ahead with the search, commissioning international energy companies, including the French multinational Total, to explore allocated blocs off the island for underwater resources. This month the Turkish president threatened to send more drill ships to the region in retaliation.

      "bodyText": "After a small pause (the intrepid reporter had the microphone upside down, but we\u2019ll preserve his blushes) we have the final question: Q: Do you have sympathy with savers who have suffered from low interest rates? Monetary policy is a \u201cblunt but powerful tool\u201d, Powell replies, and the Fed uses it to keep inflation low and employment high. He points out that many, many people benefit from low interest rates -- and you won\u2019t hear many people on low and moderate incomes pleading for higher rates. They want the economy to keep growing. But ..... he \u201cabsolutely\u201d sympathises with those who are reliant on savings for their income. But if you also own a home or equities (like many wealthier pensioners) you have benefited from higher asset prices. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference! Here\u2019s a clip of America\u2019s top central banker talking about the coronavirus: Q: US stock market levels are very high - are you concerned? Jay Powell says the Fed looks at a range of financial conditions, including leverage in the financial and non-financial sectors, debt levels, and asset price levels. We do see asset prices as \u201csomewhat elevated\u201d he says - but not at \u201cextreme levels\u201d. But funding levels, another key issue, are very stable. Q: How might the coronavirus outbreak affect China\u2019s ability to deal with its bad debts? Jay Powell says China had a significant problem with debts. It decided to tackle those high debt levels a few years ago - which was one of the causes of the global slowdown. Powell agrees that the coronavirus will have \u201csome effect on the Chinese economy\u201d at least in the short term. There may not be an immediate bounce from the US trade deal with Mexico and Canada, Powell cautions. He sees a \u2018wait and see\u2019 attitude among American businesses, so there\u2019s no \u201cdecisive\u201d recovery in manufacturing. Q: Does climate change pose a system-wide risk to financial stability? It\u2019s certainly possible over the long-term, Powell replies, but ultimately the issue must fall to elected officials. But he agrees that the Fed must ensure the financial system is prepared to withstand climate change. So yes, it\u2019s part of its role -- but the Fed can\u2019t take on responsibility for the whole issue. Q: So why haven\u2019t you joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, with over 40 other central banks? Powell says the Fed has attended meetings, and will probably join in the future. Q: Various US companies are closing factories, bringing staff home or seeing supply chain disruption due to the coronavirus. So what impact could it have on US growth, and is it a significant risk to the global economy? Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says the coronavirus is a very serious issue, which has already caused significant human suffering. It is likely to cause some disruption to growth in China, and globally, he predicts. But it is \u201cvery uncertain\u201d how far it will spread within China and to its neighbours, and thus what the impact will be. As such, Powell won\u2019t speculate, but he does add: Of course we are very carefully monitoring the situation. He also suggests that the global economy appeared to be picking up, due to easing trade tensions, the lower risk of a no-deal Brexit, and signs of manufacturing bottoming out. On the US economy, Powell says the labour market is still performing well.... and it\u2019s a \u201cbit surprising\u201d that wages haven\u2019t risen faster. Hmmm.... Powell is giving (well, reading out) a long answer on the Fed\u2019s repo operation (buying short-term treasury bills with new money). He\u2019s basically saying the Fed will keep running the programme until it has build up \u2018ample reserves\u2019 - of at least $1.5tn. Q: But aren\u2019t you worried that the markets think your repo operation is QE, and are trading accordingly? Powell says the goal is simply to deliver effective monetary policy. It\u2019s not the same as a broad asset-purchase programme (ie QE), and it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s moving markets. Onto questions, and Powell confirms that the Fed has tweaked its language on the inflation target. It now states clearly that it wants to see inflation at 2%, not merely near it. Jay Powell (who may have a touch of the sniffles) says US inflation should move closer to the 2% target in coming months. We are determined to avoid inflation running persistently below 2%, he insists. He then confirms that the Fed will keep running its repo operations until April, but will \u2018slow\u2019 these purchases over time. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is giving a press conference now. He confirms that the Fed has left interest rates on hold today, adding that monetary policy is well purposed to serve the US economy, create jobs and get inflation on target (it\u2019s currently 1.5%, below the 2% target). Powell blames sluggish growth abroad, and trade tensions, for weak business investment and manufacturing. But uncertainties remain, he adds, and there are risks to the outlook -- including the coronavirus outbreak. Another small change -- the Fed has decided to keep lubricating the plumbing of the US financial system for a few more months. This repo scheme, in which the Fed buys hundreds of billions of dollars of short-term bonds, was meant to expire in January - but will now run until April. The Fed insists it is simply providing liquidity, not stimulating the system.... but many investors have compared it to quantitative easing programmes launched after the crisis. And indeed, the scheme appears to have pumped up the stock markets (just like QE did). The Fed has made a small technical tweak - raising the interest rate it pays banks on their excess reserves. That\u2019s meant to keep interest rates within the Fed\u2019a 1.5%-1.75% target. There\u2019s no mention of the coronavirus in the Fed statement. That suggests the central bank isn\u2019t too worrked about the epidemic, says Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade: The FOMC decision failed to turbocharge market reaction and the fact the Fed didn\u2019t mention anything Coronavirus made it clear for investors that the Fed isn\u2019t worried. Gold traders were hoping that perhaps the Fed will mention the economic impact of this virus but the absence of these comments kept bulls out of this trade. Understandably, there\u2019s not much market reaction to the Fed\u2019s decision (which Bloomberg\u2019s Mike McKee has astutely dubbed a \u2018nothing-burger\u2019). The Dow Jones industrial average is up 166 points, or over 0.5%, at 28,889, having been 133 points higher just before the decision was announced. The Fed also sounds upbeat about the state of the US economy, saying: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.... The statement, explaining why US interest rates remain on hold, is online here. Today\u2019s decision is unanimous -- every Federal reserve policymaker decided to do nothing this month. And the FOMC\u2019s accompanying statement looks nearly identical to December\u2019s offering. As before, it says US jobs gains are solid while inflation is below target. One tweak -- the committee says household spending is rising at a \u2018moderate rate\u2019 (last month, it was \u2018strong\u2019). But it also reiterates that business fixed investment and exports remain weak. NEWSFLASH: The Fed has left US interest rates unchanged, at 1.5%-1.75%. Melissa Davies, Economist at Redburn, agrees that the Fed will be cautious today, partly due to the health crisis in China: \u201cTonight\u2019s FOMC meeting should not bring any headline changes to interest rates. Indeed, with coronavirus having taken the wind out of the sails of hopes for a sustained bounce in global commercial activity in early 2020, and some particularly poor US manufacturing surveys of late, the FOMC has plenty of reason to strike a dovish tone. It\u2019s nearly time for the first US interest rate decision of 2020 - but don\u2019t expect many fireworks. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its benchmark Fed Funds rate unchanged, at 1.5% to 1.75%. Following three cuts in the second half of 2019, the Fed is effectively on hold - waiting to see how the economic data plays out. Although trade tensions have eased, the coronavirus crisis is a new threat to global growth - so central bankers will remain cautious. Coronavirus worries have kept a lid on the London stock market today. The FTSE 100 index has closed just 2 points higher at 7,483 - still 100 points down this week after Monday\u2019s troubles. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames the risk of a Chinese slowdown: The market rebound petered out on Wednesday afternoon, investors struggling to justify the gains in the face of the latest coronavirus news. Probably the most relevant headline came from Chinese government economist Zhang Ming, who warned that the country\u2019s first quarter growth may fall under 5% as the virus spreads, with the forecast based on a mid-February peak for the outbreak. Given investors freaked out as China\u2019s GDP dropped to 6.0%, a reading more than 1% under that is a potential nightmare. Time for a quick recap, as investors await the Federal Reserve interest rate decision in four hours time. Concerns over the coronavirus continue to weigh on market today. A top Chinese economists has warned that the outbreak could cause more economic damage than Sars in 2003. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market tumbled as it reopened after the Lunar New Year. The Hang Seng fell almost 3%, with property companies and gambling firms based in Macao leading the rout. European markets, though, are calmer after two days of volatility. A swathe of companies have been cutting their activity in China, with several airlines including British Airways freezing flights. Car firms, such as Toyota, are leaving factories suspended until mid-February. Apple\u2019s share price has hit a new alltime high, after beating Wall Street forecasts again. It\u2019s now worth a sizzling $1.4tn, as much as every company on Germany\u2019s DAX 30. UK house pries have risen, as political uncertainty eases (somewhat). Rail operator Northern has been nationalised, after the government lost patience with its shoddy service. There are reports that American Airlines and Lufthansa are now cancelling their services to China, following British Airways\u2019 lead this morning. Apple\u2019s stock surge means the company is worth over $1.4tn -- more than every company on Germany\u2019s DAX index combined (as flagged earlier). Amanda Lyons, investment manager, GAM, has delved into last night\u2019s numbers -- and concluded that not everything is as rosy as you\u2019d think. She points out that strong iPhone sales drove the strong revenue growth -- probably existing iPhone users shifting to the new, more expensive, iPhone 11s. With iPhone still accounting for over 60% of total revenue it shows how much the company still relies on this product for growth and that outperformance elsewhere is not enough to fuel future growth. But service revenue growth missed expectations, at 17% per year. Although Services revenue is impressive, it is intricately liked to Product sales. In the earnings release (and again on the call), Apple highlighted that the installed base has reached 1.5bn devices. It is hard to see that this segment can grow to become the driver of the company and overtake the iPhone. And what about Apple\u2019s TV? \u201cAlmost no colour was given regarding the Apple TV+ launch; in its current form, it does not feel that TV+ will be the new Netflix. Its content offering is significantly lighter than competitors and is relying on gaining subscribers through the service being bundled for free for a year with the purchase of any Apple hardware. Without significant investments in content, it is hard to see many of those \u2018free\u2019 subscribers converting to paid subs at the end of the year. Boom! Apple\u2019s share price has hit a new record high, at the start of trading in New York. Apple has gained more than 2% to above $326 per share, which means it has more than doubled in the last year. The tech giant is cheering investors after reporting a 9% jump in revenues to $91.8bn last night, a record. This lifted net earnings to $22.2bn (also a record). Boeing has taken another big hit from the 737 Max crisis. The US aircraft maker has doubled the likely cost of fixing the problem, to over $18bn, in its new financial results today. This has dragged Boeing into its first annual loss since 1997. More here: Oil has now unrallied -- as traders take claims of an attack on Saudi facilities in their stride. Back in the markets, the oil price is rallying following reports of an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities. Not much detail yet, but Brent crude rallied by over 1.2% to $60.25 per barrel. Back in the UK, another rail operator has been taken out of private hands into the tender care of the government. Northern Rail, which operates services (badly) in the North of England will be nationalised on the first of March. The government has run out of patience over the litany of problems - from cancelled trains and carriage shortages to faulty ticket machines and a lack of drivers. Passengers have also been unimpressed that it has still used the old Pacer trains -- constructed from busies in the 1980s, and due to be phased out years ago. It should be a popular decision: Here\u2019s the story: Newsflash: A Chinese government economist has warned that the Wuhan coronavirus may cause more economic damage than the SARS epidemic. Zhang Ming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (part of Beijing\u2019s State Council) predicted that China\u2019s annual growth rate could drop below 5% in January-March quarter. The official target is 6%; some economists have predicted that the economy could actually shrink during the quarter, as firms halt production and transport links are shuttered. Writing in Caijing magazine, Zhang said the coronavirus\u2019s economic impact could be \u201csignificantly bigger\u201d than Sars, which slowed growth back in 2003. That is based on the forecast that the outbreak, which began in Wuhan\u2019s meat market late last year, will peak in mid-February and end by April. For comparison, Pantheon Economists estimates that SARS dragged China\u2019s quarterly growth rate down to 1.8% in April-June 2003, from an average of 2.8%. Zhang also predicted that Beijing could pull on the stimulus levers to prevent the economy weakening -- perhaps by cutting interest rates or encouraging banks to lend more money (by cutting the amount of capital they have to hold). Just in: Fast food giant McDonalds has beaten Wall Street forecasts, achieving more than 100 billion dollars of annual sales for the first time. The burgers, fries, salads and fizzy pop provider has posted a 5.9% jump in sales in the last quarter, better than expected and the strongest result since 2010. For 2019 as a whole, systemwide sales increased 4% to $100.2 billion. McDonald\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski says: \u201c2019 marked a year of significant milestones for McDonald\u2019s - including surpassing $100 billion in Systemwide sales and achieving our highest global comparable sales growth in over a decade.\u201d The long grind of job cuts at banking group Lloyds continues today. Banking union Accord has announced that Lloyds is cutting almost 80 jobs, as part of a drive to close 56 branches this year. It affects 31 Lloyds, 10 Halifax and 15 Bank of Scotland branded branches, the union said, with many staff being redeployed. Ovo Energy, which recently joined the ranks of Britain\u2019s biggest energy firms, has now also joined the ranks of firms fined by the regulator. Ovo\u2019s sin was to send inaccurate bills, or no statement at all, to over 500,000 customers over several years. Readers with long memories may be surprised to hear that Greece can now borrow at an interest rate just below zero. Yes, investors are prepared to pay Athens for the privilege of buying its debt -- at least the short-term bonds, repayable in six months. Athens also saw solid demand for its first 15-year bond, which went on sale yesterday. Investors placed bids worth almost \u20ac19bn for the \u20ac2.5bn bond on offer, as Greece continues to slowly recover from its debt crisis. Financial analysts have been hiking their price targets for Apple, after it beat expectations yesterday with its strong profit and revenue growth. Fair enough. Except...shouldn\u2019t Wall Street\u2019s finest minds have expected such a good performance, given they\u2019ve been watching Apple so closely? Here\u2019s a great chart showing how Apple\u2019s share price has rocketed since Steve Jobs was lured back to run the company 23 years ago. Jobs\u2019 return in 1997 is one of the great \u2018what ifs\u2019 of business. Had he not returned to revive the company, on $1 per year, would we ever have had the iMacs, the iPod or the iPhone? Would Apple have moved into media, with iTunes, or pioneered smartphones with the App Store? Would Apple be worth more than $1 trillion today? Surely not. More likely it would have continued to slide into relative obscurity, losing money despite a loyal army of desktop fans devoted to its Mackintosh machines. Back in the UK, house prices have risen as the market shakes off some of its recent lethargy. Average house prices rose by 0.5% during January, Nationwide reports. This lifts the annual rate of housing inflation to 1.9%. This might bolster the argument that the Conservative\u2019s election win has lifted some economic uncertainty, ungumming the economy. Lucy Pendleton, of estate agents James Pendleton, says: \u201cSparks were flying after the election but this month the housing market has ignited, with the Boris Bounce providing the match. \u201cA year ago the annual growth rate was just 0.1%. This step change in house price growth is being driven by a resurgence of demand and, with it coming before we\u2019ve even left the EU, is clearly significant. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, sounds more cautious, saying: \u201cJanuary saw a further modest pick-up in annual UK house price growth to 1.9%, from 1.4% in December. This follows twelve 12 successive months in which annual price growth had been below 1%. \u201cIndicators of UK economic activity were fairly volatile for much of 2019, but the underlying pace of growth slowed through the year as a result of weaker global growth and an intensification of Brexit uncertainty. More here: Over at the Hong Kong harbour, Bloomberg\u2019s Alex Longley reports that things are unusually quiet - a bad sign for the economy as it tries to clamber out of recession. More reaction to the slowdown in eurozone money supply: Apple\u2019s shares have jumped 2% in after-market trading, following its record-break profits and revenues last night. That lifts its market capitalisation to over $1.4 trillion, tightening its place as the world\u2019s most valuable tech company (only Saudi Aramco is worth more). Astonishingly, this is more than Germany\u2019s 30 largest listed companies who make up the DAX index. The DAX is worth a combined $1.36tn, including software giant SAP ($162bn), chemicals firm Linde ($111bn), engineering company Siemens ($108bn), and insurance group Allianz ($100bn). Allianz\u2019s chief economist, Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl, says it\u2019s a warning sign to Europe: In a worrying sign, money supply growth in the eurozone has slowed. The European Central Bank reports that growth in broad money slowed to 5% last month, from 5.6% in November. Growth in the narrower M1 measure (how much currency is circulating) also slowed -- indicating a cooling of economic growth. European stock markets have just opened a little higher, as investors resist hitting the panic button (yet, anyway). The Stoxx 600 index of Europe\u2019s top companies has risen by 0.5%, with gains in Spain, Italy, France and Germany. In London the FTSE 100 has risen by 6 points, or 0.1%. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale sums up the mood: The virus outbreak marches on but markets are trying hard not to over-react. Treasury yields are back up a bit, most Asian equity indices are back up a bit, though the Hang Seng is playing catch-down as it re-opens. Commodity prices are rising slightly today, as traders try to calculate the impact of the virus outbreak on the global economy. Copper, nickel and zinc all rose, recovering some of their recent losses. Yesterday, a basket of metal prices hit its lowest level since early 2017: After a rough day, the Hang Seng index closed 2.8% lower. That\u2019s a bad start to the new year, but frankly the rout could have been worse, given anxiety over the coronavirus. Here\u2019s a nice summary of the economic impact of the coronavirus, from the BBC\u2019s Victoria Fritz: Here\u2019s our main liveblog on the coronavirus outbreak - which has now claimed at least 132 lives: Japanese car maker Toyota has announced it will leave its Chinese factories closed until February 9th, extending the usual New Year shutdown. Reuters has the details: Toyota, which runs plants in regions such as the northern city of Tianjin and the southern province of Guangdong, said the closures after the Lunar New Year holidays were in line with transport lockdowns in some places, and as it assesses its parts supply situation. That\u2019s another sign of the economic damage that the virus outbreak is causing; several carmakers including Nissan, Honda and PSA Group are also withdrawing staff from China. British Airways has just suspended all its flights to mainland China, underlining how the virus crisis will hit businesses around the globe. It says: \u201cWe apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority. Customers due to travel to or from China in the coming days can find more information on BA.com.\u201d While Hong Kong stocks slumped, other Asian markets had a better day. Australia, South Korea and Japan all gained around 0.5%, as traders grasped onto hopes that the outbreak will be contained. Shares in medical mask-makers continue to surge, as the public try to protect themselves from the Wuhan coronavirus. The biggest fallers on the Hang Seng today were two Hong Kong real estate firms, Hang Lung Properties (-6.3%) and Country Garden Holdings (-5.7%).Demand for their properties will surely be knocked by the coronavirus outbreak. They were followed by two Macao casino operators Sands China (-5.3%) and Galaxy Entertainment Group (-5.2%). Their betting operations will suffer from the clampdown on travel between the City and mainland China (Macau is an autonomous region, across the Pearl River Delta from Hong Kong). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Returning to the office after a holiday is rarely fun. But Hong Kong investors have suffered a hefty dose of back-to-work blues today as trading resumed after the Lunar New Year break. Stocks tumbled across the Hang Seng index, as traders responded to the coronavirus outbreak. Every stock lost ground in a wave of selling, driving the index down to a seven-week low. Consumer goods companies, energy firms and financial stocks led the sell-off, on concerns that the virus crisis will hurt Hong Kong\u2019s economy -- which is already in recession after months of pro-democracy protests. In late trading, the Hang Seng is down 807 points, or 2.9%, at 27,141 -- wiping out all the gains posted since mid-December. It\u2019s the worst start to a New Year since 2016 (the Year of the Pig); Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak of Oriental Patron Financial Group explains why the Year of the Rat has begun badly: \u201cThe Wuhan coronavirus has been spreading around the world. It will affect market sentiment in the near term, as the disease will hit the tourism and retail industries of Hong Kong,\u201d \u201cThese sectors have already been hit hard by the eight-month-long anti-government protests.\u201d But while Hong Kong played catch-up, other markets are looking a little calmer today amid hopes that the coronavirus outbreak could peak soon. Traders are also encouraged by strong results from Apple after Wall Street closed last night. The tech giant posted record revenues and profits for the last quarter, justifying the doubling of its share price over the last year. My colleague Julia Carrie Wong reports: Sales of the iPhone 11 propelled Apple to all-time record revenues and profits for the final three months of 2019, a strong performance that comes amid concerns over the impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy. Apple\u2019s $91.8bn in quarterly revenue topped analyst expectations thanks to $56bn in iPhone sales. The strong performance marks a rebound for the company, which suffered a rare setback in holiday sales one year ago. CEO Tim Cook reported strong demand for iPhones, and for the company\u2019s newer wearable technology. He also said Apple was \u201cclosely following the development of the coronavirus\u201d, amid worries that its supply chain could be disrupted. Also coming up today The US central bank meets to set interest rates today. The Fed probably won\u2019t cut borrowing costs, despite ongoing pressure from Donald Trump, but it could pave the way to ease later this year. Fed chair Jay Powell may also talk about the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy, which comes just as trade war tensions are easing. It\u2019s also a big day for US corporate news, with McDonalds, Boeing, Facebook, Microsoft and Tesla all reporting results. The agenda 1.30pm GMT: US trade balance for December 7pm GMT: US Federal Reserve interest rate decision 7.30pm GMT: Fed chair Jerome Powell holds press conference",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s something post-coital about Boris Johnson these days. He appears distracted, disappointed. On the verge of boredom. Even when he rouses himself to public displays of optimism with calls to \u201cstop talking Britain down\u201d, it feels like a tired performance rather than a lived experience. Soon his only comforts will be homeopathic traces of memory.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t meant to be this way. He\u2019d thought being prime minister would be a sustained triumph \u2013 the climax that was so high and wild he\u2019d no longer need to have another \u2013 but it had turned out to be just as transient as all the rest. In some ways, it was even worse. Now there was nothing more to look forward to. Everything was downhill from here. A slow slide into insignificance. Just think of David Cameron.</p> <p>Back in the day, there had been an edge to his life. A sense of jeopardy. The lies and backstabbing to further his career. Now his days \u2013 from the moment he woke up to the time he went to bed \u2013 were managed to the point of inertia. No free time to nip out for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/boris-johnson-repeatedly-declines-to-comment-on-claims-he-awarded-public-funds-to-friend\">IT refresher courses in Shoreditch</a>. No easy money to be made from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/daily-telegraph-rehires-boris-johnson-on-275000-salary\">recycling old columns for the Daily Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>Frankly, it was getting harder and harder for him to give a toss about anything. Only the previous night, he\u2019d had to put Silent Witness on pause for five minutes because Dominic Cummings had wanted him to make a totally pointless Twitter video about how everything was going to be brilliant after Brexit. What a waste of his and everyone else\u2019s time. He\u2019d barely even bothered to go through the motions. Brexit had only been interesting while it had been an idea to be won. Now it was a reality to be delivered all the fun had drained away.</p> <p>The closest to any genuine excitement Boris could now get was prime minister\u2019s questions. A session he always seemed to enjoyed more, the less preparation he put in. The thrill of winging it in front of a large audience. But even PMQs was beginning to pall. It was all just too easy. He could say whatever he liked and almost no one would dare challenge him. The Labour party was entirely comatose and some of his own MPs were a far tougher audience. But enough of them were either fawning or supine, so he still didn\u2019t really need to break sweat. He\u2019d never have believed it before, but you really could tire of flattery. The insincerity was corrosive.</p> <p>Boris barely bothered to engage with Jeremy Corbyn. Then the Labour leader can\u2019t even manage to engage with himself any more. He realises it was a huge mistake to stay on while his party chose his successor, but is too proud to admit it. So he just plods on, mumbling out his computer-generated questions in a detached monotone, neither inviting, nor expecting any answers. Not even getting round to exposing possible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/29/johnson-faces-tory-rebellion-over-huawei-5g-plans-for-britain\">cracks in the Tory ranks over Huawei</a> or HS2.</p> <p>More out of habit than anything else, Johnson laced his contempt with indifference. Have you finished yet? He yawned, having failed to answer any questions on President Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/donald-trump-middle-east-peace-plan-israel-netanyahu-palestinians\">idiotic Israel-Palestine peace deal</a> or the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. He barely even seemed aware of the SNP\u2019s demands for a Scottish visa. Page 20? He didn\u2019t even know there was a page 20. Instead he just said we\u2019re leaving the EU on Friday and invited anyone who wanted to buy a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/28/got-brexit-done-tory-party-sells-12-tea-towel-in-celebration\">\u201cSod Off Europe</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/28/got-brexit-done-tory-party-sells-12-tea-towel-in-celebration\">\u201d tea towel</a> should get shopping on the Tory party website. And for an extra \u00a320 \u2013 cash only \u2013 he\u2019d even sign one.</p> <p>Dialling down the triumphalism and uniting the country is proving a spectacular success. Boris wouldn\u2019t have been totally out of place waving Union Jacks and flicking V signs with Nigel Farage and the Brexit party in the EU parliament later in the afternoon. They\u2019ve all been consistent in their gracelessness. For a man who prides himself on charm, Boris can be surprisingly charmless. Then part of his appeal has always been his brazen amorality. Talking big, but acting small.</p> <p>While \u2013 Farage and his gang of MEPs excepted \u2013 the EU was bidding a heartfelt, dignified and moving farewell to the UK in Brussels, Boris was back mugging off the country in another edition of his \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d. A 15-minute piece of nihilistic narcissistic indulgence that serves no discernible democratic function. But with parliamentary PMQs no longer giving Boris his required dopamine hit, he needs all the attention he can get.</p> <p>Yet again Johnson raced through a whole load of questions sent in by members of his own team at Number 10, while Classic Dom kept watch off camera. Homelessness was a bad thing \u2013 he knew that from personal experience having been kicked out of his home several times already and it was only a matter of time before it happened again. It won\u2019t be the Labour party that brings him down. It will be his own capacity for self-destruction.</p> <p>Of course we\u2019d get a trade agreement in a matter of weeks. We were already aligned with the EU and they were far too stupid to notice we were planning to diverge. Was Huawei safe? Of course, because the Chinese already had all our secrets anyway. There were already 50,000 nurses waiting to start work in the 40 hospitals he was going to build inside a month.</p> <p>Before long, Boris inevitably got bored and wound things up. Just one last question. How was he going to celebrate leaving the EU on Friday. Hmm. Boris had to think about that. Well, first he\u2019d make an entirely missable speech to the nation. So no need for anyone to tune in. Then he\u2019d knock back a couple of bottles of wine, fall over and hope for a shag. Much like any other Friday night.</p>",

In some ways, it was even worse. Now there was nothing more to look forward to. Everything was downhill from here. A slow slide into insignificance. Just think of David Cameron. Back in the day, there had been an edge to his life. A sense of jeopardy. The lies and backstabbing to further his career. Now his days \u2013 from the moment he woke up to the time he went to bed \u2013 were managed to the point of inertia. No free time to nip out for IT refresher courses in Shoreditch. No easy money to be made from recycling old columns for the Daily Telegraph. Frankly, it was getting harder and harder for him to give a toss about anything. Only the previous night, he\u2019d had to put Silent Witness on pause for five minutes because Dominic Cummings had wanted him to make a totally pointless Twitter video about how everything was going to be brilliant after Brexit. What a waste of his and everyone else\u2019s time. He\u2019d barely even bothered to go through the motions. Brexit had only been interesting while it had been an idea to be won. Now it was a reality to be delivered all the fun had drained away. The closest to any genuine excitement Boris could now get was prime minister\u2019s questions. A session he always seemed to enjoyed more, the less preparation he put in. The thrill of winging it in front of a large audience. But even PMQs was beginning to pall. It was all just too easy. He could say whatever he liked and almost no one would dare challenge him. The Labour party was entirely comatose and some of his own MPs were a far tougher audience. But enough of them were either fawning or supine, so he still didn\u2019t really need to break sweat. He\u2019d never have believed it before, but you really could tire of flattery. The insincerity was corrosive. Boris barely bothered to engage with Jeremy Corbyn. Then the Labour leader can\u2019t even manage to engage with himself any more. He realises it was a huge mistake to stay on while his party chose his successor, but is too proud to admit it. So he just plods on, mumbling out his computer-generated questions in a detached monotone, neither inviting, nor expecting any answers. Not even getting round to exposing possible cracks in the Tory ranks over Huawei or HS2. More out of habit than anything else, Johnson laced his contempt with indifference. Have you finished yet? He yawned, having failed to answer any questions on President Trump\u2019s idiotic Israel-Palestine peace deal or the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. He barely even seemed aware of the SNP\u2019s demands for a Scottish visa. Page 20? He didn\u2019t even know there was a page 20. Instead he just said we\u2019re leaving the EU on Friday and invited anyone who wanted to buy a \u201cSod Off Europe\u201d tea towel should get shopping on the Tory party website. And for an extra \u00a320 \u2013 cash only \u2013 he\u2019d even sign one. Dialling down the triumphalism and uniting the country is proving a spectacular success. Boris wouldn\u2019t have been totally out of place waving Union Jacks and flicking V signs with Nigel Farage and the Brexit party in the EU parliament later in the afternoon. They\u2019ve all been consistent in their gracelessness. For a man who prides himself on charm, Boris can be surprisingly charmless. Then part of his appeal has always been his brazen amorality. Talking big, but acting small. While \u2013 Farage and his gang of MEPs excepted \u2013 the EU was bidding a heartfelt, dignified and moving farewell to the UK in Brussels, Boris was back mugging off the country in another edition of his \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d. A 15-minute piece of nihilistic narcissistic indulgence that serves no discernible democratic function. But with parliamentary PMQs no longer giving Boris his required dopamine hit, he needs all the attention he can get. Yet again Johnson raced through a whole load of questions sent in by members of his own team at Number 10, while Classic Dom kept watch off camera. Homelessness was a bad thing \u2013 he knew that from personal experience having been kicked out of his home several times already and it was only a matter of time before it happened again. It won\u2019t be the Labour party that brings him down. It will be his own capacity for self-destruction. Of course we\u2019d get a trade agreement in a matter of weeks. We were already aligned with the EU and they were far too stupid to notice we were planning to diverge. Was Huawei safe? Of course, because the Chinese already had all our secrets anyway. There were already 50,000 nurses waiting to start work in the 40 hospitals he was going to build inside a month. Before long, Boris inevitably got bored and wound things up. Just one last question. How was he going to celebrate leaving the EU on Friday. Hmm. Boris had to think about that. Well, first he\u2019d make an entirely missable speech to the nation. So no need for anyone to tune in. Then he\u2019d knock back a couple of bottles of wine, fall over and hope for a shag. Much like any other Friday night.",

      "bodyText": "Moderate Republican senators were under an intense spotlight on Wednesday as the impeachment trial of Donald Trump moved into a dramatic new phase \u2013 and the president lashed out at former national security adviser John Bolton, who Democrats want to call as a key witness. Trump\u2019s Twitter attack on Bolton \u2013 and subsequent moves by the White House to block his potentially damaging planned book \u2013 came amid signs the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, does not have enough Republican votes locked down to block Democrats\u2019 efforts force witnesses into the impeachment trial. Leading Republican moderates Susan Collins, Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski kicked off the questioning phrase of the trial on Wednesday by asking, if Trump had multiple motives for delaying US military aid to Ukraine, how the Senate would handle that. That goes to the heart of the impeachment accusation that Trump inappropriately pressured Ukraine by holding back aid until the Ukrainian government agreed to investigate the president\u2019s leading election rival Joe Biden, in what Democrats charge is an abuse of power. A looming question over Wednesday\u2019s impeachment proceedings is whether centrist senators will side with Democrats to form a majority voting bloc to bring witnesses in. While Democrats have Bolton at the top of their list, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, brushed off the prospect of moderate Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia supporting the prospect of Biden\u2019s son Hunter being requested by Republicans to testify about his time working for a Ukrainian gas company. Manchin said on MSNBC on Wednesday he thought Hunter Biden should testify, which most Democrats have opposed. \u201cWe are totally united and have been totally united for a month and continue to be,\u201d Schumer said of his Senate members at a press conference. Meanwhile, Trump attacked Bolton after reports that a draft manuscript of Bolton\u2019s forthcoming book claims Trump directly linked a delay in military aid to Ukraine to a condition that the Ukrainian government investigate his Democratic rivals, especially Joe Biden. Trump wrote of Bolton: \u201c\u2026 if I listened to him, we would be in World War Six by now, and goes out and IMMEDIATELY writes a nasty &amp; untrue book. All Classified National Security. Who would do this?\u201d One of Trump\u2019s defense arguments during the impeachment inquiry was that those two were not connected. Critics say he was trying to use a vulnerable Ukraine to help his re-election chances; Trump said he was just trying to root out corruption there. Trump maintains Bolton was fired last fall, while Bolton claimed he resigned. On Wednesday, Trump also complained about Bolton\u2019s timing. He wrote: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t John Bolton complain about this \u201cnonsense\u201d a long time ago, when he was very publicly terminated. He said, not that it matters, NOTHING!\u201d The White House later sent a letter to Bolton\u2019s attorney, which claimed his client\u2019s book cannot be published in its current form because it contains top secret material. McConnell is under pressure to round up his caucus and move to a vote by the end of the week first to block witnesses and then to acquit Trump on the impeachment charges altogether. McConnell told his caucus in a meeting on Tuesday night, according to multiple reports, of the stakes. With an unknown number of Republican senators still undecided about calling witnesses, McConnell could still get the votes he needs to block witnesses and stop the trial from reeling off into unpredictable \u2013 and potentially hazardous \u2013 territory for the president. At least four Republicans would need to join Democrats to force witness testimony. Murkowski met with McConnell on Wednesday morning, adding to speculation that she could join Democrats in supporting a motion to bring in witnesses, according to a Senate aide. Trump\u2019s defense team and his Republican allies have argued vehemently against the inclusion of witnesses at the trial, saying they already had enough information to decide the case and that the Senate should not be burdened by what they have framed as an incomplete process in the House of Representatives. But those arguments appear not to have been persuasive to the necessary number of senators. Trump\u2019s lawyers concluded their opening arguments on Tuesday. Led by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, the defense team dismissed objections to Trump\u2019s conduct towards Ukraine as \u201cpolicy disagreements\u201d and warned senators not to \u201clower the bar of impeachment\u201d by voting to convict the president. A furious Trump complained on Twitter on Wednesday morning that Democrats would never be satisfied. During the inquiry process in the House of Representatives last year, the White House blocked senior administration officials from testifying in the House. No witnesses have appeared at the trial in the Senate, with House managers detailing the case for the prosecution of Trump that he abused the power of his office and, in gagging officials and blocking the release of some documentary evidence, obstructed Congress \u2013 forming the two articles of impeachment relating to Trump\u2019s conduct with regard to Ukraine. Trump has no plans to appear at his own trial and has been pressing Congress to get it finished before he has to give his State of the Union address next Tuesday \u2013 the day after the crucial Iowa caucuses occur as the first voting event in the primary contest to choose the Democratic party nominee to challenge Trump for the White House this November.

Johnson defied the US and rebels in his party on Tuesday by deciding to allow Huawei to build part of the UK\u2019s 5G network as long as it is restricted to \u201cnon-core\u201d parts of infrastructure and has no more than 35% of market share. A group of anti-Huawei Tories want an assurance that the government will work towards reducing the Chinese company\u2019s influence in UK infrastructure to zero, ultimately stripping it out of the 4G network as well. Their argument is that any provider deemed high-risk by the intelligence services should be phased out of the supply chain, although Britain\u2019s spy agencies say that any security risk from Huawei can be managed. Unhappy MPs held a series of meetings in Westminster on Tuesday night after Johnson\u2019s announcement to discuss tactics, although they are keen to operate behind the scenes to push for a concession without embarrassing No 10. If Downing Street does not offer assurances, several senior Tories believe they have a chance of getting the 45 rebels needed for a successful backbench revolt on legislation relating to regulation of Huawei. They are looking at forcing a Commons vote on legislation expected next month to set out Ofcom\u2019s powers to monitor the 5G network, potentially laying an amendment to toughen the proposal that Huawei would be limited to a 35% market share per mobile phone operator. Among the public critics of the Huawei decision are the former party leader Iain Duncan Smith, the former Brexit secretary David Davis, and the former defence secretary Penny Mordaunt, as well as Tom Tugandhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, and Damian Green, Theresa May\u2019s former deputy. Green told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cOne of the things that frankly surprised me was the breadth of opposition to the current stance of the government on the Conservative backbenches.\u201d The culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, toured the airwaves on Wednesday defending the government\u2019s decision, saying the cabinet was \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about the risks of Huawei as a vendor with links to the Chinese state. She argued that Britain\u2019s security services had already been dealing with Huawei in the 4G network for years and therefore it did \u201cnot present the security challenge that others are worried about\u201d. However, that has not reassured many Tory backbenchers, who are concerned that the US and Australia have banned Huawei over fears China could use the company\u2019s role in the network for spying. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, vociferously protested against the move in the national security council meeting on Tuesday, although he eventually signed up to it as part of collective responsibility. The re-election of Tugendhat, one of the government\u2019s fiercest critics over Huawei, to the chairmanship of the powerful foreign affairs committee, is also likely to increase the pressure on ministers. Tugendhat warned earlier in the week that allowing the Chinese firm a role in building the 5G network would be akin to \u201cletting the fox into the hen house, when really we should be guarding the wire\u201d. He was one of several senior, independent-minded Tories elected to key committee posts after elections among MPs on Wednesday. Johnson\u2019s leadership rival Jeremy Hunt is the new chair of the health select committee, and former defence minister Tobias Ellwood will chair the defence committee.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 30 January. Top stories Japan and the US have airlifted hundreds of their citizens from Wuhan, with China confirming a sharp escalation in the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak, with the official figure now 132. Nearly 1,500 new cases have been identified across the nation, as McDonald\u2019s announced it would shut 300 restaurants throughout China. Germany is expected to repatriate its nationals in coming hours, as health officials have confirmed the virus\u2019 spread to the UAE and Finland. It comes a day after Australia announced plans to quarantine citizens airlifted from Hubei on Christmas Island for two weeks. Queensland confirmed its first case on Wednesday evening, bringing the number of confirmed cases in Australia so far to seven. A Northern Territory shooting club that boasted the former Coalition senator Nigel Scullion as a \u201cdiehard\u201d member received $500,000 under the sport grants program, with the embattled former sport minister Brigid McKenzie, a keen recreational shooter, allocating nearly $1m in funding to gun clubs around Australia. A spokesman for Scullion said the club was \u201cvery deserving\u201d of the grant, with shooting one of the fastest growing sports in the NT. On Tuesday it was revealed that Sport Australia had written to McKenzie before the last election, lodging its concerns that the grants program was being politicised. Newstart recipients are able to cover only 75% of their basic living costs, research has revealed. The Australian Council of Social Services has called it \u201csenseless cruelty\u201d to ignore calls for an increase, campaigning for a $100-a-week boost to the unemployment benefit. The Newstart allowance has not increased in real terms in 25 years. Acoss\u2019s proposal would cost $3.8bn a year, boosting payments for 850,000 people across the country. The accounting giant KPMG called for a $92-a-week raise last year but its proposal was rejected by the federal government. Australia Vulnerable dolphin species are facing increasingly harmful levels of long-banned chemicals, with pesticides such as DDT that are linked to mass mortality events within snubfin or humpback populations being detected at record levels. Australia\u2019s reliance on temporary migration is creating an economic underclass, Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally has warned, predicting that on current trends there could soon be 3 million temporary migrants working in Australia, causing wages to stagnate. The federal government has begun the process for 50,000-year-old rock art on the Burrup Peninsula to become Unesco heritage-listed, lodging a submission for the Murujuga cultural landscape in Western Australia to be added to the global watch list. The world Strongmen leaders across the Asia-Pacific region have led to a year dominated by repression, Amnesty International\u2019s annual human rights review has found, with China and India singled out for seeking to impose a \u201cbleak domineering vision\u201d across the region. The Palestinian town Donald Trump earmarked as the future capital has strongly rejected the idea, with its mayor, Ahmed Abu Hilal, emphatically stating: \u201cJerusalem is the capital of Palestine\u201d. Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has also strongly condemned Trump\u2019s proposed two-state plan as \u201clegitimising Israel\u2019s occupation\u201d. Trump has launched a scathing attack on his former national security adviser John Bolton, with analysts suggesting Republicans may not have the votes to block the Democrats from calling Bolton as an impeachment trial witness. The Inouye solar telescope has captured images of the surface of the sun in unprecedented detail, showing the turbulent churning plasma exterior in sharp focus, revealing a hidden level of structure to how the sun operates. Recommended reads When Guardian Australia asked readers to nominate their most memorable moments of Australian television history, the TV presenter and author Yumi Stynes was struck by the absence of Asian representation in the avalanche of replies. \u201cAustralian TV has always been like that: it\u2019s great until you notice what\u2019s missing.

As Greg Jericho writes, upticks in growth have come about not due to an increase in demand but rather a reduction in supply \u2013 notably, of food. Listen After 46 years of membership, the UK is preparing to leave Europe. John Palmer was the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent in 1973 at a time when Britain was excited about joining the union. On this episode of Today in Focus, he speaks with Anushka Asthana about how the mood changed. Sport Rafael Nadal has crashed out of the Australian Open, going down in four sets to Austria\u2019s Dominic Thiem, 7-6, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6. Looking to equal Roger Federer\u2019s men\u2019s record of 20 grand slams, the Spaniard finally succumbed to the opponent he\u2019d beaten during the last two French Open finals. The regular BBL09 season has drawn to a close but with the on-field product providing few clear narratives is the Big Bash in the doldrums or is the angst overstated? Sam Perry prosecutes the numbers. The age of entitlement is over for Australian rugby. As the code faces a potential plummet in broadcast revenue the 2020 season looms as decisive for the game\u2019s future, writes Bret Harris. Media roundup The Victorian attorney general has called for the men\u2019s rights activist Bettina Arndt to be stripped of her Order of Australia award, reports the Age, writing to urge the governor general, David Hurley, to overturn the decision. The Chinese tech giant Huawei is planning a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d to overturn its ban on taking part in Australia\u2019s 5G network, writes the Australian, after Britain\u2019s partial approval for its 5G rollout. And south-east Queensland is bracing for a bat invasion as little red flying foxes hunt for food escaping areas ravaged by bushfires and drought, according to the Courier-Mail. Coming up Australians trapped in Wuhan due to the coronavirus will be evacuated to Christmas Island. World No 1 Ash Barty bids to reach the Australian Open final when she plays 14th seed Sofia Kenin at Melbourne Park. Follow the match in our live blog from 2pm (AEDT).

      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid has written to ministers urging them to identify projects that could be scrapped, to cut costs and \u201crefocus\u201d resources on Boris Johnson\u2019s priorities of hospitals, schools and \u201clevelling up\u201d. In a letter signed by the chancellor and the PM, each department has been told to identify potential cost savings worth up to 5%, by 2 March. \u201cThis will allow us to refocus our efforts towards the things which matter most: strengthening our NHS; making our streets safer; and levelling up opportunity across the country,\u201d the letter says. Officials will be expected to examine their budgets line by line, asking whether each item supports what Johnson likes to call \u201cthe people\u2019s priorities\u201d. Asking for potential spending cuts is standard practicebefore a spending review \u2013 but the emphasis on excising plans that don\u2019t fit the Johnson agenda underlines the urgency with which Downing Street hopes to reshape government. March\u2019s budget is expected to include a significant expansion of long-term investment, funded through extra borrowing, as the Conservatives ditch the tight spending constraints of the past decade. In a speech during the election campaign setting out his plans for the economy, the chancellor said: \u201cIncredibly, at the moment, we can borrow in real terms at negative rates, meaning it is a responsible time to invest.\u201d This approach of borrowing to invest was enshrined in Gordon Brown\u2019s \u201cgolden rule\u201d, and championed by a string of Labour shadow chancellors \u2013 but rejected by successive Tory chancellors as too lax. Javid is also expected to use Brexit as an opportunity to rewrite the Treasury\u2019s \u201cgreen book\u201d for measuring the value of investment proposals \u2013 a decision that could favour costly plans such as the controversial HS2 rail project. Javid said he would still aim to match current spending with tax revenues, however. \u201cWe can\u2019t run an overdraft for ever on our day-to-day spending,\u201d he insisted in his November speech. That is likely to mean the Tories\u2019 more immediate manifesto promises, including recruiting extra nurses and police, will have to be funded partly from within existing budgets \u2013 with detailed plans set out in a spending review expected by the autumn. Whitehall departments are being urged to consider ditching some activities outright in order to save money, rather than seeking the \u201cefficiency savings\u201d often favoured by previous administrations. With many infrastructure projects taking years to deliver, Downing Street insiders also say Johnson is impatient to identify more immediate ways of appealing to voters \u2013 particularly in some of the seats it snatched from Labour last month. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the letter, which was first leaked to Sky News and the Sun, was evidence that the chancellor would not end austerity, however. \u201cWe were promised by Johnson and Javid that austerity had ended and the cuts in public services were over. They clearly aren\u2019t on this evidence. Another Johnson lie exposed,\u201d McDonnell said.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

      "bodyText": "The whole world must be on alert to deal with the spread of coronavirus, the World Health Organization has said as it urged countries to prepare so that they are ready to detect any cases that occur and isolate and treat the sick. WHO will reconvene its expert committee on Thursday to decide whether to declare the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. There are now 7,183 confirmed cases of viral pneumonia caused by the virus and 170 deaths, all of them in China. Just 68 cases have been confirmed outside China, in 15 countries, but in three countries, Germany, Vietnam and Japan, there has been human-to-human transmission, raising fears over the spread of the disease. \u201cThe whole world needs to be on alert now. The whole world needs to take action and be ready for any cases that come from the epicentre or other epicentre that becomes established,\u201d said Dr Michael Ryan, the head of the WHO health emergencies programme. He and the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised China for its openness and its crackdown in Wuhan, the centre of the disease outbreak. \u201cThe fact that to date we have seen only 68 cases outside China and no deaths is due in no small part to the extraordinary efforts China has made,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cThey are doing that at the expense of their economy and other factors.\u201d But China\u2019s containment of the coronavirus, which emerged probably from wild animals sold for food in Wuhan\u2019s seafood market, has only reduced the danger to the rest of the world, not removed it. \u201cThe continued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to human transmission outside China are of course most deeply concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak.\u201d The emergencies committee met on two days last week but backed off from declaring the outbreak of international concern, largely because the spread to other countries had not been extensive. The declaration, which was made in the Ebola outbreaks in west Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as the Sars epidemic, would attract resources to countries that have outbreaks and streamline the measures taken. Ryan warned that 194 countries implementing unilateral measures was a \u201cpotential recipe for disaster\u201d. The evacuation of foreign nationals from Wuhan began with airlifts of hundreds of people by Japan and the US. A government-chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo from Wuhan on Wednesday morning. Two showed symptoms of pneumonia following scans, but a coronavirus diagnosis had not been confirmed, hospital representatives said. Two more were admitted to hospital. Seven others with symptoms such as coughs and fever will undergo tests. The rest of the passengers were sent home with instructions to stay in and not mix with people for 14 days. Officials in the US said a chartered plane had made a refuelling stop in Anchorage, Alaska, with about 240 US citizens onboard, including staff from the US consulate in Wuhan. The passengers were due to be re-screened in Anchorage and hospitals there were on alert to take any who needed medical tests or treatment. The first cases in the Middle East were reported in the United Arab Emirates. Four members of a Chinese family who had been in Wuhan and arrived in the UAE on 16 January for a visit were confirmed to have the virus. All four are in a stable condition and under medical observation, the health ministry said. The Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s (GCC) health committee met on Wednesday in the Saudi capital of Riyadh to discuss the virus and to unify Gulf efforts to prevent its spread, Bahrain\u2019s state news agency BNA said. There have been several suspected cases in African countries, although none have yet been confirmed. The toll of the Wuhan coronavirus now exceeds the 5,327 confirmed cases in mainland China during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic. The Sars outbreak killed more than 770 people globally, including 349 in mainland China. The death rate from Sars, caused by a more virulent member of the coronavirus family than the Wuhan strain appears to be, was more than 10%. So far, the death rate among confirmed cases of coronavirus is 2%, and may be less if there are many mild cases that do not end up in hospital, as experts believe. Unicef said it had shipped six tonnes of respiratory masks and protective suits to Shanghai to protect health workers. \u201cThis coronavirus is spreading at a breakneck speed and it is important to put all the necessary resources into halting it,\u201d said Unicef\u2019s executive director, Henrietta Fore. \u201cWe may not know enough about the virus\u2019s impact on children or how many may be affected \u2013 but we do know that close monitoring and prevention are key. Time is not on our side.\u201d British Airways said on Wednesday it had suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China after British authorities warned against \u201call but essential\u201d travel to the country.",

He was a big guy, and he was towering over me. I was really scared.\u201d</p> <p>Dunning, then 24, had come to an InterContinental hotel in Manhattan some time in 2004 to have what she had thought would be a business meeting with Weinstein about her aspirations for a movie career.

On a coffee table were three sets of documents.</p> <p>She testified that Weinstein said to her: \u201cHere\u2019s contracts for my next three films. I\u2019ll sign them today if you have a threesome with me and my assistant.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed, thinking he was kidding, just part of his sense of humor.

This is how the business works. This is how actresses got where they are.\u201d</p> <p>The witness said that Weinstein name-checked two prominent actors as examples \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlize-theron\">Charlize Theron</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/salma-hayek\">Selma Hayek</a>.</p> <p>Dunning is one of four witnesses who have been called by the prosecution to provide supporting evidence of Weinstein\u2019s alleged pattern of behavior as a serial offender.

Then, a few weeks before the alleged incident at the InternContinental, he summonsed her to a boutique hotel in Soho, where Miramax was staging a movie in one of the rooms.</p> <p>Dunning told the jury that she was taken to the room by the same assistant. Half of the suite was full of chaotic activity relating to the movie production, the other half was a bedroom.</p> <p>Weinstein led her down the hallway to the bedroom and they sat side-by-side on the bed, she said. \u201cThere were no red flags or alerts or anything that would make me suspect this would happen.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly, he put his hand up her skirt.

This approach is deeply concerning for the AIU Board as it seems to indicate that the current leadership of the federation is merely a continuation of the former.\u201d In a statement World Athletics said that if Rusaf continued its \u201cblanket denials approach\u201d over the Lysenko case it would go to the court of arbitration for sport to get the federation thrown out of the sport. World Athletics also confirmed it would not consider any applications for \u201cauthorised neutral athlete\u201d status for the 2020 season unless Rusaf and its former officials admitted the charges against them. A total of 29 Authorised Neutral Athletes from Russia competed at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha in October, winning six medals. In a statement, World Athletics said that if Rusaf admitted fault its council would decide on a new process that would result in the federation and Russian athletes being given another chance, next month. Meanwhile another top British coach has joined Malcolm Arnold in severely criticising UK Athletics for its terrible performances since London 2012. Max Jones, who led the British Athletics team at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, said he was \u201castonished\u201d that UK Sport continued to fund UKA given that athletics had gone backwards. Speaking to the Track and Field Stats and Research website, Jones said: \u201cWhat I\u2019m constantly astonished at is that no account is taken of the \u00a3100+ millions of lottery money that has been invested in the sport over the last 20 years. \u201cWe are no further on than 25 years ago and certainly have gone backwards from 25-40 years ago and that at a time when we don\u2019t have to face a \u2018stoked up\u2019 Russia! When will UK Sport wake up to the fact that \u2018insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results?\u2019 \u201cTo use a housebuilders\u2019 analogy, they spend far too much on building the roof (the elite) while neglecting the foundations (grassroots) which will ultimately lead to a slowdown in talent emerging and therefore less talent to work with.\u201d On Tuesday Arnold, who was British Athletics head coach at the 1996 Olympics, told the Guardian that UKA was guilty of a \u201cdreadful neglect\u201d of the sport since 2012.",

There is now very good scientific evidence that the incubation period before symptoms appear can be as long as 14 days. In addition, there is some limited evidence of spread from people who are not yet showing symptoms. Both of these issues highlight the need for quarantine. Although there are appropriately some concerns raised about the human rights issue, these need to be considered in the light of the wider risk to the population of the potential spread of the virus. Restricting person-to-person contact is the most effective way of preventing this spreading.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the level of coronavirus infection, it makes sense to quarantine and test people being evacuated form Wuhan City. But we might lose sight of the fact that the outbreak seems more widespread than that and at some time, probably soon, a decision will have to be made about all Britons located in Hubei province and China in general, especially if the virus outbreak continues to escalate. If these people also need to be brought back, then the task in hand would probably become unmanageable.</p> <p>The rapidity of this outbreak is startling and certainly much more rapid than Sars. The reasons for this are unclear, but clearly the larger the outbreak grows the more difficult it becomes to contain it using usual infection control measures \u2013 identifying then isolating infected people and tracing and monitoring their contacts.</p> <p>At the moment, virus that has been exported from China to other countries has not led to significant onward transmission, although the identification of infected individuals in some of those countries that have not had direct contact with China is concerning as it reminds us that the virus has the capability of being passed on.</p> <p>There are still too many unknowns \u2013 the true scale of the problem, the frequency of symptom-less infection, the amount of transmission that occurs by people with and without symptoms, the extent at which infected individuals have travelled and their destination \u2013 to be certain. It is certainly possible for this virus to become widespread and eventually become just another circulating human respiratory virus, but it\u2019s still very early days and with little onward transmission in other parts of the world, this might not happen. If this scenario did play out, however, then we need to get a better handle on the relative frequency of severe disease and death so that healthcare structures are able to deal with it.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T15:27:30.415Z\">at 3.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e31a06a8f086a28115a1a91\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T15:13:10.403Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Damien Gayle</strong> here, taking over the live blog from my colleague Aamna Mohdin, who has finished for the day. </p> <p>If you have come across coronavirus news you think we need to look at, please do drop me a line.

Here, there have been more cases in China, but so far with a lower death rate than the Sars outbreak. </p> <p>A pandemic is typically called by the World Health Organization after there has been sustained transmission across many countries. Though there have been cases reported in several countries now, we\u2019re not quite at that stage of sustained transmission yet. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T14:03:11.945Z\">at 2.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e318b798f08e13324739165\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rachel-obordo\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T13:41:32.303Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A British teacher in Shanghai, who asked the Guardian to remain anonymous, is staying in China after he was unable to get a visa for his young daughter.</p> <p>\u201cWe were unable to get out and now airlines are shutting down flights.

      "bodyText": "The official death toll in China from coronavirus has risen to 132, with 5,974 cases confirmed, overtaking the number of people infected in the mainland by the Sars epidemic in 2002-3. In the UK 130 people have been tested for coronavirus, with all results negative, according to the latest update from the Department of Health and Social Care. British nationals are due to be repatriated from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, on Thursday morning. However, with the city on lockdown, fears have been raised that many may not be able to reach the airport. Finland, the United Arab Emirates and Tibet confirmed their first cases of coronavirus, while a fourth case was confirmed in France and a sixth in Australia. British Airways has suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China, following travel advice from the Foreign Office that warned against all but essential travel to the country due to the coronavirus outbreak Evacuation flights from Wuhan to Japan and the United States have taken place, repatriating about 200 Japanese and 200 US nationals. The World Health Organisation\u2019s emergency committee will meet again on Thursday, the third time in a week, to evaluate whether the new coronavirus spreading from China constitutes an international emergency. Fears have been raised that many of the British nationals registered for the evacuation flight from Wuhan tomorrow morning may not actually be able to make it to the airport to catch the plane. The Guardian was contacted by Robert Dowling, from Nottingham, whose 22-year-old son is in Wuhan and had been due to get the flight. But Dowling\u2019s son lives on the other side of the city, south of the Yangtze river which intersects it, and, with the entire city on lockdown, there is no means of travel to reach the airport. The Foreign Office, Dowling said, is not helping Britons with their travel through Wuhan. He told the Guardian: [My son] did phone up the Foreign Office for advice. They told him to go to the local police station to ask for transport. He did that and the police told him to phone the embassy. On the group chat [on social media between British nationals in Wuhan] this is a constant theme with it sounds like quite a number of them not at all sure how they are going to get to the airport. I have just spoken myself to the FCO and the person there was still saying that as far as he knew there was not meant to be any assistance in reaching the airport other than to send [Britons in Wuhan] an email to show to the road blocks. The Guardian has contacted the Foreign Office for comment. The World Health Organisation\u2019s emergencies chief says China is taking \u201cextraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge\u201d because of the virus outbreak, the Associated Press reports. Dr Michael Ryan said the epidemic remains centred in the city of Wuhan and in Hubei province but that information is being updated and is changing by the hour. Many of those affected experience only a mild illness and estimated that the death rate is at about 2%, he said. The death rate for SARS, a related virus, was about 10%. However, the few instances of the new virus spreading between people in countries beyond China, including Germany, are of great concern, Ryan added. He said that is part of the reason why the UN health agency\u2019s director-general has reconvened a coronavirus expert committee to meet Thursday. It will assess whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency. Ryan made his comments to reporters on Wednesday after returning from a trip to Beijing to discuss the new virus with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior government leaders. To date, about 99% of the nearly 6,000 cases are in China. A plane evacuating 201 Americans from the Chinese city at the centre of the virus outbreak has arrived at a southern California military base after everyone onboard passed a health screening test in Anchorage, where the aircraft had stopped to refuel, the Associated Press reports. The jet landed shortly after 8am local time at March Air Reserve Base about 60 miles (96km) east of Los Angeles. Ground crew dressed in white protective clothing approached the aircraft shortly after it landed and three charter-style buses parked near the plane. Federal and local public health officials scheduled a media briefing for later in the morning. All the passengers had already undergone two health screenings in China and were screened twice more in Anchorage by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. One passenger received medical attention for a minor injury that happened before boarding the airplane in China, Dr Anne Zink, Alaska\u2019s chief medical officer, told reporters after the plane left. A major international summit on biodiversity set to take place in China next month is under threat because of the coronavirus outbreak, Patrick Greenfield reports. The Chinese government and the United Nations are now considering postponing the planned negotiations for a Paris-style agreement on biodiversity, which had been due to take place between 24 and 29 February. Biodiversity experts and government policy makers were set to meet in Kunming, Yunnan to discuss plans to protect a third of the world\u2019s oceans and land by 2030. The United Nations told the Guardian that they are reviewing the in consultation with the Chinese government, the WHO and other agencies. The British government is urgently pressing Beijing to allow dual nationals to leave China after public outcry over families being split up during the coronavirus evacuations, reports my colleague Jess Murray. Only British passport holders who do not also hold Chinese nationality are being allowed to leave. The British embassy in Beijing is urging the Chinese to let dependents of British nationals and British-Chinese dual nationals leave too. \u201cOur priority is to keep British nationals and their family members together and we have urgently raised this with the Chinese authorities,\u201d a Foreign Office spokesperson said on Wednesday. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, raised the issue of dual nationals with his Chinese counterpart on Tuesday, but the Chinese government has maintained its stance. The World Health Organization\u2019s emergency committee will meet on Thursday, the third time in a week, to evaluate whether the new coronavirus spreading from China constitutes an international emergency, the WHO said. \u201cThe committee will advise the director general on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and what recommendations should be made to manage it,\u201d the WHO said in a statement issued in Geneva before a news briefing by senior WHO expert Mike Ryan on his return from China. The emergency committee, composed of 16 independent experts, twice last week declined to declare a global emergency. But today, the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who recently returned from a trip to China, tweeted that he would reconvene the committee to discuss whether such a declaration was now warranted. Sudan suspects that two of its citizens who returned to the country from China are infected with the new coronavirus, the information minister told Reuters. One of the pair, a man and a woman, had been in the region of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the virus, said Faisal Saleh. Both are under medical checks. We will update if there is any further information or a confirmation on whether the pair are infected. Finland has announced its first confirmed case of coronavirus, in a tourist from Wuhan who was visiting Lapland, the Helsinki-based Swedish language paper Hufvudstadsbladet reports. The patient has been quarantined at Lapland\u2019s central hospital in Rovaniemi after developing symptoms and seeking medical help. About 15 people may have been exposed to the infection. Mika Salminen, the director of Finland\u2019s institute of health and welfare said: It was expected that illness cases related to tourism would also occur in Finland. The risk is still small that the disease is spreading in Finland, so you do not have to worry We have prepared for any cases in Finland. The healthcare and laboratories have ready-made business models. The hospitals are prepared to investigate and treat coronavirus infections in isolated conditions A fourth case of coronavirus has been confirmed in France, Le Parisien reports. The patient is a Chinese tourist from Hubei province of about 80 years old, according to details released at a press conference on Tuesday. The man was in intensive care at a Paris hospital. France was the first European country to confirm coronavirus infections, with three confirmed diagnoses announced last Friday. More British scientists have been giving their reactions to the news that Britons evacuated from Wuhan will be placed in a 14-day quarantine. Prof Mark Harris, Professor of Virology, University of Leeds: The plans for an organised quarantine of people evacuated from Wuhan makes much more sense than a proposal that people would quarantine themselves. There is now very good scientific evidence that the incubation period before symptoms appear can be as long as 14 days. In addition, there is some limited evidence of spread from people who are not yet showing symptoms. Both of these issues highlight the need for quarantine. Although there are appropriately some concerns raised about the human rights issue, these need to be considered in the light of the wider risk to the population of the potential spread of the virus. Restricting person-to-person contact is the most effective way of preventing this spreading. Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham: Given the level of coronavirus infection, it makes sense to quarantine and test people being evacuated form Wuhan City. But we might lose sight of the fact that the outbreak seems more widespread than that and at some time, probably soon, a decision will have to be made about all Britons located in Hubei province and China in general, especially if the virus outbreak continues to escalate. If these people also need to be brought back, then the task in hand would probably become unmanageable. The rapidity of this outbreak is startling and certainly much more rapid than Sars. The reasons for this are unclear, but clearly the larger the outbreak grows the more difficult it becomes to contain it using usual infection control measures \u2013 identifying then isolating infected people and tracing and monitoring their contacts. At the moment, virus that has been exported from China to other countries has not led to significant onward transmission, although the identification of infected individuals in some of those countries that have not had direct contact with China is concerning as it reminds us that the virus has the capability of being passed on. There are still too many unknowns \u2013 the true scale of the problem, the frequency of symptom-less infection, the amount of transmission that occurs by people with and without symptoms, the extent at which infected individuals have travelled and their destination \u2013 to be certain. It is certainly possible for this virus to become widespread and eventually become just another circulating human respiratory virus, but it\u2019s still very early days and with little onward transmission in other parts of the world, this might not happen. If this scenario did play out, however, then we need to get a better handle on the relative frequency of severe disease and death so that healthcare structures are able to deal with it.\u201d Damien Gayle here, taking over the live blog from my colleague Aamna Mohdin, who has finished for the day. If you have come across coronavirus news you think we need to look at, please do drop me a line. As usual, you can contact me via my Twitter account \u2013 @damiengayle \u2013 or via email on damien.gayle@theguardian.com. 130 people have tested negative in the UK for coronavirus, according to the latest update from the Department of Health and Social Care. The UK has asked the European Union for help to repatriate its citizens from Wuhan \u2013 two days before the country leaves the bloc. Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, the European commissioner for crisis management, listed the countries that have requested help from the EU at a press conference this afternoon. The list includes Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and the UK. A 21-year-old British student in Beijing has been told she cannot leave her dorm room for 12 days after returning from a trip to Wuhan. Georgia, who is at Tsinghua University, arrived in Wuhan on 12 January and returned to Beijing on 23 January after spending a few days in Dalian. She is showing no symptoms of the coronavirus but is quarantined to her room until 3 February. She said: \u201cWhen I left Wuhan no one was really wearing a mask. Some people were even under the impression that the situation was getting better. The university wanted me to move to a centralised isolation building on campus, but I have type 1 diabetes so asked to stay in my room so I could access a fridge. I\u2019m not allowed to leave and have to call the dormitory manager twice a day with my temperature, but the university has been wonderful and provides free meals which are delivered to my door.\u201d The sudden change in activity levels and a diet that consists almost purely of rice is starting to take a toll on my diabetes management. The isolation paired with the constant high sugar levels has made it difficult, but I understand that it\u2019s essential and I\u2019m grateful for the care I\u2019ve been shown.\u201d Here\u2019s some reactions from scientists in the UK to the news that British nationals will be evacuated from Wuhan and quarantined for 14 days. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: The quarantine will be precautionary. Over 100 tests have been carried out in the UK so far with all of them negative for coronavirus infection. However, this new restriction may reflect the increase in cases in China over the last 24 hours, and ongoing concern about cases coming into the UK and the potential for person-to-person transmission.\u201d Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: This is a different type of coronavirus, compared with what we saw with Sars, so it will behave a little differently. Here, there have been more cases in China, but so far with a lower death rate than the Sars outbreak. A pandemic is typically called by the World Health Organization after there has been sustained transmission across many countries. Though there have been cases reported in several countries now, we\u2019re not quite at that stage of sustained transmission yet. A British teacher in Shanghai, who asked the Guardian to remain anonymous, is staying in China after he was unable to get a visa for his young daughter. \u201cWe were unable to get out and now airlines are shutting down flights. We are safely back in our apartment and trying to relax and make the best of the situation. We have food to last around two weeks but obviously we are a little concerned. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two small children and with the situation rapidly changing we are becoming more and more isolated. I think this raises many questions about the British government\u2019s policies on family and citizenship. It\u2019s incredibly hard to stay as a family and be mobile internationally if you\u2019re in a \u2018mixed citizenship\u2019 family. We will only leave if we can go together.\u201d Japan and the US have airlifted hundreds of their citizens from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, as officials in China said the death toll from the disease had risen sharply overnight to 132, with nearly 1,500 new cases in the country. A government-chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo from Wuhan on Wednesday morning. Officials said four of the passengers \u2013 a woman and three men \u2013 had coughs and fevers and had been taken to a hospital in separate ambulances for treatment and further tests. Two of the four showed symptoms of pneumonia following scans, but a coronavirus diagnosis has not been confirmed, hospital representatives said. Officials in the US said a chartered plane had landed in Anchorage, Alaska, with about 240 US citizens onboard, including staff from the US consulate in Wuhan. More details have come through about the German plans for evacuation and quarantine. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he expected the federal government to reach an agreement with authorities in the state of Hesse in the next few hours to get an evacuation of German citizens from China under way. Spahn said Germany wanted to fly out citizens in the province of Hubei as quickly as possible but wanted to ensure the evacuation was well prepared before evacuees were transported to Frankfurt. \u201cWe are therefore in close contact with the Hessian authorities to come to a solution between the federal government and authorities there and I assume that we will succeed in that in the next few hours so that the plane can take off quickly,\u201d he told reporters. \u2022 This entry was amended on 31 January 2020. It previously stated that Frankfurt was the capital of Hesse. This has been removed. China watchers have picked up on the way discontent with the authorities is rumbling \u2013 and finding an outlet online. Chenchen Zhang, a lecturer at Queens University Belfast, points out that legal authorities took issue with apparent punitive measures taken against some people for allegedly spreading false information. That intervention was followed up by a post on Weibo, the Chinese microblogging website, saying the eight people were \u201ccriticised and educated\u201d rather than being \u201cpunished\u201d. Cue criticism from the public \u2026 The French drugmaker Sanofi has said it is postponing all its events in China and has asked employees to stop all travel to and from Wuhan and Hubei province in China. The company said it had no plans to repatriate French employees from China over the spread of the new coronavirus. Germany\u2019s health ministry has said quarantine plans will be put in place for people returning from China on evacuation flights, according to Reuters. Germany\u2019s health minister says he expects agreement on evacuation within hours. At least four cases have been confirmed in Germany, making it the second European country to report cases after France. Lufthansa is waiting before it follows the example of British Airways in suspending flights to China. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation very closely,\u201d a Lufthansa spokesman told Deutsche Welle. All flights to and from China are running on schedule though the airline said it had observed a \u201cslight reluctance to book\u201d. Britain\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, is facing questions on social media after maintaining a relatively low profile in the media over the past week. His tweet about people returning from China being isolated for 14 days prompted a query from Clare Wenham, an assistant professor in global health policy at the London School of Economics, about the legal implications of the government\u2019s policy. Others informed Hancock that the government\u2019s response was \u201cpathetically slow\u201d and criticised \u201cconfusing messaging\u201d. The FT\u2019s Tom Hancock, in China, contrasts the UK policy to that of the US. Unicef has shipped 6 metric tons of supplies, including respiratory masks and protective suits, to support China\u2019s response to coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis coronavirus is spreading at a breakneck speed and it is important to put all the necessary resources into halting it,\u201d said Unicef\u2019s executive director Henrietta Fore. \u201cWe may not know enough about the virus\u2019s impact on children or how many may be affected, but we do know that close monitoring and prevention are key. Time is not on our side.\u201d Unicef said it was working closely with the Chinese authorities, including the commerce ministry and the National Health Commission, as well as the World Health Organization (WHO). Beijing is normally buzzing with people at this time of year, but fears of a virus outbreak have kept many indoors and at home, AP reports. Cultural landmarks such as the Great Wall and Forbidden City have closed their doors to visitors, while shopping malls have reduced their operating hours and only a handful of restaurants have remained open for customers. British passengers returning from coronavirus-hit Wuhan could be asked to sign a contract before they board the plane saying they agree to being placed in quarantine. Anyone who does not wish to sign could be asked to stay. It is thought at least 200 British citizens want to return. The Foreign Office admitted it could become more difficult for British nationals in other provinces to leave and advised them to \u201cmake decisions based on their own personal circumstances\u201d over whether to evacuate. The British embassy in Beijing warned that transport to get UK citizens out \u201cmay happen quickly and with short notice\u201d. Kazakhstan is suspending all passenger travel to and from neighbouring China, Reuters reports. The Kazakh government said on Wednesday that buses to and from China had already been halted, passenger trains will stop on 1 February and all flights will be suspended from 3 February. The government has also suspended issuing visas to Chinese citizens. Kazakhstan has refused to host the Asian Water Polo Championships next month or serve as a substitute host for the tennis Fed Cup qualifying event that was initially scheduled to take place next week in Dongguan, China. The former Soviet republic of 19 million has not registered any cases of the new virus. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, just tweeted that British nationals will be \u201csafely isolated\u201d for 14 days. Britons returning from coronavirus-hit Wuhan will be placed in quarantine for 14 days, most likely at a facility on a military base, PA Media reports, citing UK government sources. Here\u2019s a a simple explainer on the coronavirus, answering questions on the symptoms caused by the virus, how is it transmitted from person to person, and at what point should someone see a doctor. Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care are advising those who have returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people. Travellers who have returned should call NHS 111 to inform them of their recent travel to the city Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, said: Isolating yourself from other people, like you would with other flu viruses, is in step with the best scientific and expert advice on how to stop the coronavirus from spreading. This means taking simple, common sense steps, such as staying at home and avoiding close contact with other people as much as possible. Virgin Atlantic will continue to operate its flights between Heathrow and Shanghai, the company said. Passengers are able to rebook or obtain a refund free of charge. The airline said in a statement: \u201cWe continue to monitor the situation regarding coronavirus and will always follow guidance as set out by relevant authorities. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is advising against all but essential travel to mainland China, excluding Hong Kong. \u201cFor customers who have booked to travel to China, including Hong Kong, and would like to discuss their travel plans further, we would invite them to contact our customer care team via our SMS messaging system, on +44 (0)7481 339184. The team are happy to assist with any inquiries.\u201d Here\u2019s a report by Guardian reporter Jessica Murray and Michael Standaert on a British family trapped in the centre of the coronavirus outbreak being split up in coronavirus evacuations. A Chinese national has been confirmed to have novel coronavirus in Queensland, Australia. The 44 year old Chinese national, who is currently stable, but isolated in the Gold Coast University Hospital, is from the city of Wuhan. The relevant authority will be releasing more information at a press conference tomorrow. Dr Jeannette Young, the chief health officer in Queensland, has said the authorities are closely with the hotel where the Chinese women\u2019s national football team and their support staff are currently staying. the team were in the city of Wuhan on 22 January. \u201cWe are working closely with the hotel and the 32 individuals concerned \u2013 who are all well and not showing symptoms \u2013 and we have Queensland Heath staff present at the hotel,\u201d Young said. \u201cThe hotel is in the process of alerting other guests and staff and making suitable arrangements.\u201d Young added: \u201cWe want to reassure the public, no one else in this hotel, including staff, is at risk.\u201d The Chinese get creative to beat boredom: As the UK government finalises plans to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, one British man has spoken of his distress at not being able to leave immediately with his Indonesian wife. Nick House, who lives in the city with his Indonesian wife and two British children, told Sky News: \u201cWe would like to be out of here. The man on the other end of the phone said, \u2018Yes, you are on the list, but unfortunately your wife probably won\u2019t be able to get on the plane because she doesn\u2019t have a visa at the moment\u2019. \u201cI won\u2019t leave without my wife, so essentially the government are leaving three British people here for the sake of one seat on a plane.\u201d The US, Japan, and Turkey are evacuating their citizens on Wednesday from Wuhan, which is at the epicentre of the new virus outbreak, as health authorities report the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 5,974. According to a report by AP Media, the Turkish ambassador, Emin Onen, told the broadcaster NTV that Turkey had made the necessary applications to Chinese officials to evacuate 32 citizens, adding that none of them had been diagnosed with the virus. \u201cWe are in touch with all our citizens,\u201d Onen said. \u201cWe will bring them back as soon as possible \u2026 with a medical or similarly equipped plane. There will be certain quarantine conditions when they land in Turkey.\u201d The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday confirmed the first cases in the Middle East of the new coronavirus. Doctors are treating a family that had just come from a city at the epicentre of the outbreak, AP Media reports. The UAE\u2019s state-run WAM news agency made the announcement citing the health and prevention ministry, but did not provide details on where the family lived nor where they were receiving treatment. It also remains unclear how the family left Wuhan and made it to the UAE. China shut down Wuhan\u2019s airport and other transportation in the city last Thursday to stop the spread of the virus. The lockdown has since expanded to include 17 cities with more than 50 million people in all. Emirati officials are taking \u201call the necessary precautions in accordance with the scientific recommendations, conditions and standards approved by the World Health Organization\u201d, the ministry said. \u201cThe general health condition is not a cause for concern.\u201d The UK culture secretary, Baroness Morgan, hopes BA\u2019s decision to suspend all flights to China would give \u201cmore impetus\u201d for the government to make plans to evacuate Britons from the region. Morgan told BBC Breakfast: The Foreign Office will be working with staff on the ground to identify UK nationals. We will get people home as soon as we can, as soon as we can make arrangements. Obviously, today\u2019s decision by British Airways provides more impetus to the government to make other plans and communicate those. The health system is well-prepared. We are not aware of any confirmed cases of the virus here in the UK but we do have the expertise to look after people, to treat and to test should that become necessary. The Chinese women\u2019s national football team has been quarantined in Queensland after arriving on Wednesday morning. The Australian Associated Press reports that the team, who were were in the city of Wuhan on 22 January, will be required to stay at their inner-city hotel until 5 February over fears that members may have the deadly coronavirus. New restrictions being enforced by the state government require anyone returning from Wuhan to self-isolate for a fortnight after leaving the central Chinese city. Britain is finalising plans to evacuate its nationals from the coronavirus-hit Chinese province of Hubei. Flights taking Britons back home could begin as early as Thursday, PA Media reports. The deadline for those in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas to contact the British consulate expressing their wish to leave passed at 3am UK time (11am local time). Flights evacuating Britons could begin as early as Thursday, according to a British teacher in Wuhan city. Morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Ben Doherty. British Airways has suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China, following travel advice from the Foreign Office that warned against all but essential travel to the country due to the coronavirus outbreak. BA.com, the airline\u2019s website, shows no direct flights to China are available in January and February, Reuters reports. \u201cWe apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,\u201d BA said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. \u201cCustomers due to travel to or from China in the coming days can find more information on BA.com.\u201d Indonesia has no cases of coronavirus. But, according to its foreign ministry, 243 Indonesian nationals are in Hubei, about 100 of those in Wuhan. Indonesian students in the city have said they want to get out, but can\u2019t. \u201cThe Indonesian government has to take quick and appropriate measures to ensure the evacuation of Indonesian citizens who are currently in Wuhan,\u201d Golkar party parliamentarian Christina Aryani told the Jakarta Post in a statement. \u201cLeaving our citizens there is just the same as letting them wait their turn to get infected.\u201d As the UK prepares to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, some of the logistical and bureaucratic challenges of extracting people from a city under lockdown are emerging. One Briton in Wuhan, who did not want to be quoted, told the Guardian: We have no way to get through roadblocks to the airport. That has to be applied for through London then getting word back for the OK from local government here. British Airways has suspended bookings on its website for direct flights from London to Beijing and Shanghai until March, after warnings over travel to China due to the coronavirus outbreak. BA.com, the airline\u2019s website, shows no direct flights to China are available in January and February. A spokeswoman for the airline said on Wednesday it was \u201cassessing the situation\u201d. Britain on Tuesday advised against \u201call but essential\u201d travel to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak. The sixth coronavirus case in Australia has been confirmed by Victoria\u2019s chief officer, Dr Brett Sutton. The man in his 60s became unwell on 23 January, having recently travelled to Wuhan. He presented to a doctor and was referred to the Monash Medical Centre, where he was tested for the virus. Sutton said the man had since returned home, where he was in isolation. The man\u2019s family is being monitored. Some have exhibited symptoms, but none has returned a positive test. Australian health officials have stressed that they have not seen any evidence of human-to-human transmission of the 2019-nCoV novel coronavirus in Australia. \u201cThe man was mostly at home and had isolated himself when unwell but he had gone out to a restaurant called The House of Delight for a short period of time,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThat restaurant has been followed up with and those who were there at the same time, whose contact details we have, we are following up with. \u201cBut obviously that restaurant is OK to go to now. People don\u2019t need to avoid that area or indeed anywhere else people have been, even if infectious at the time.\u201d After a sell-off on Monday and Tuesday, markets in Asia Pacific have bounced back today. The ASX200 benchmark index in Sydney closed 0.5% higher and the Nikkei in Tokyo wound up 0.71% to the good. South Korea, which was battered on Tuesday, was also higher. \u201cStock markets across the Asian region have reclaimed a portion of yesterday\u2019s losses,\u201d Kyle Rodda, at IG Markets in Melbourne, said, \u201cas volatility subsides slightly, on the back of diminishing angst among market participants regarding the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d \u201cThe psychology is simple enough \u2026 markets react most aggressively to brand new information. Of course, this isn\u2019t to say this issue will go away any time soon. \u201cBut the initial shock of needing to price in this new coronavirus risk into markets has certainly subsided, with additional information about the matter now having a diminishing impact.\u201d The flight carrying 240 American citizens from Wuhan has just landed in Anchorage, Alaska, after a journey of nine-and-a-half hours. Those passengers will now fly on to March Air Force Base in California. Tibet, the last place on China\u2019s mainland that had not recorded a case of coronavirus, has now reported its first suspected case. A 34-year-old man who travelled to Tibet by train from Wuhan has been placed in quarantine. A sixth case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Australia. A man in his 60s tested positive Wednesday morning in Melbourne. He had recently travelled to Wuhan. Health officials are monitoring his close contacts. The man\u2019s case is the second in Melbourne, Australia\u2019s second-largest city. The others are in hospitals in Sydney. Hello, Ben Doherty taking over our rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s early in the UK, but there is news for Britons stuck in Hubei and their families. The UK is finalising plans to bring back Britons from Hubei province after advising Britons there to ring dedicated 24-hour helplines before 3am UK time on Wednesday to register their desire to be evacuated. Officials estimate up to 200 citizens currently there will want to return to the UK. Flights taking Britons back home could begin as early as Thursday, according to a British teacher in Wuhan city who said UK citizens were being given details of forthcoming flights. On Tuesday evening the Foreign Office updated its advice to warn against all but essential travel to mainland China following the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIf you\u2019re in this area and able to leave, you should do so,\u201d it said. The UK\u2019s move to evacuate its citizens follows flights chartered by the Japanese government and the US. The flight to Tokyo landed Wednesday morning, with four on board taken to hospital, while the US-government flight is set to land in Alaska in about 20 minutes from now (a little before 6.30am GMT). Australia and New Zealand have announced plans for an evacuation mission, quarantining their citizens on the remote Australian territory of Christmas Island. Other countries, such as France and Indonesia, have also announced their intentions to evacuate their citizens from Hubei. Germany now has four confirmed cases of coronavirus, the second European country to report cases after France. The first case of coronavirus in the United Arab Emirates \u2013 and thus the Middle East region \u2013 has been confirmed by state media, according to Reuters. The state-run news agency WAM announced the case earlier today, citing the UAE health ministry. According to the report, the person had been in Wuhan, but did not provide any further information. Education minister Dan Tehan said some schools and states had \u201cgone further\u201d than the official government advice when deciding how to treat children who have returned from China or from overseas. He said that the official advice, as determined by experts, was still enough and what was recommended. \u201cWe think schools should follow the medical advice. Some schools have decided togo further than that. That is their individual right to be able to do that. Some states have taken a more cautious approach. But our view is we should follow the medical advice provided by our experts here in Australia and internationally. \u201cWe\u2019ve said that we will constantly monitor that advice and provide updates on it on a regular basis. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here doing this afternoon.\u201d Health minister Greg Hunt says the government does not intend to use enforcement powers to make people stay at home in quarantine. He is also asked about the choice of Christmas Island as a quarantine site. \u201cThe choice of the Christmas Island was made on the basis of the ability to establish quickly [and] to provide the capacity to deal with all those who were likely to arrive. \u201cSecondly, one of the things that is very important is that we have full and absolute protection for Christmas Islanders. I\u2019ll leave the circumstances to home affairs and to foreign affairs\u201d. As to whether the evacuated Australians from Wuhan could leave the detention centre, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to home affairs.\u201d He adds that a surgical mask \u2013 not a thicker P2 mask \u2013 is fine for the general public. Surgical masks are \u201cperfectly adequate\u201d even for medical assessment of patients, and P2 masks are only needed for those treating confirmed cases. \u201cThe prevailing advice is surgical masks are perfectly adequate for the clinical assessment of a suspected case and their examination. \u201cWhere P2 masks are important is when you\u2019re collecting the diagnostic specimen and anyone collecting the diagnostic specimen is provided with a P2 mask. The GPs are seeing a lot of people who don\u2019t have this disease and they just need some protection and a surgical mask on the patient and a surgical mask on the GP, and all of our expert advice suggests that\u2019s adequate. \u201cIt\u2019s not adequate if you\u2019re [treating a] proven case in hospital who is coughing and we know they have a virus.\u201d Murphy says that Australia\u2019s Health Protection Principal Committee (HPPC) is aware of a case, in Germany, where somebody without symptoms transmitted the disease. However, he said this was rare. \u201cHPPC still deserves most infections are transmitted by people who have symptomatic disease. That is a very important statement. \u201cThere\u2019s no other real strong evidence of transmission in symptom who is pre-symptomatic but any evidence we need to take action upon. \u201cWe believe that the nature of coronaviruses is they generally are only infectious when symptomatic. That\u2019s what we saw with SARS and MERS. All the evidence from China suggests nearly all of the cases are only infectious when they\u2019re symptomatic.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has announced that all Australians who have had contact with people with coronavirus, or visited Hubei province, should stay at home and be quarantined for 14 days. He says this policy is \u201chighly precautionary\u201d. Health minister Greg Hunt said this was an update to the official advice. \u201cContacts of any confirmed coronavirus cases now must be isolated in their home following exposure,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cReturned travellers who have been in the Hubei province of China must also be isolated in their home for 14 days after leaving Hubei province other than of course seeking medical care. \u201cGiven the substantially lower number of cases in China reported outside of Hubei province, we do not currently recommend self-isolation for travellers from other parts of China or from other countries.\u201d The Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has said he is in talks with China to evacuate Malaysians from Wuhan, Reuters reports. There are 78 Malaysians currently in Wuhan, he said. The mayor of Christmas Island \u2013 the Australian territory in the Indian Ocean where evacuated Australians will be quarantined \u2013 has said the decision will create \u201ca leper colony\u201d. Prime minister Scott Morrison announced earlier today that Australia and New Zealand were trying to organise an evacuation of citizens in Wuhan. If successful, the people will be taken to Christmas Island and potentially quarantined for 14 days. Mayor Gordon Thomson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation this would \u201ccreate a convict settlement for innocent people. Now we\u2019ll be a leper colony. These ideas were abandoned in the mid-20th century.\u201d A family of Tamil asylum seekers from the Queensland town of Biloela are also currently on the island. Priya and Nadesalingam, and their Australian-born children, Kopika and Tharunicaa have been held there since August as they challenge their deportation. Christmas Island has been the site of an Australian immigration detention centre that was closed in September 2018. In February 2019, the government announced it would be re-opened, and then closed, to the cost of $185m. Papua New Guinea has banned all travellers from entering the country from \u201cAsian ports\u201d, according to Agence France-Presse. In a note to airlines and boat operators, the ministry of immigration said \u201call citizens originating from the Asian ports will be refused entry to the country effective today\u201d. The ministry also announced that Papua New Guinea\u2019s only official land border \u2013 with Indonesian-controlled Papua province \u2013 would be shut from Thursday. No cases of coronavirus have been reported in Papua New Guinea, but the country\u2019s health service is already buckling under the weight of underfunding and rampant public health problems. Papua New Guinea is one of only a handful of countries where polio is still endemic, leaving doctors and the United Nations scrambling to revive long-lapsed vaccination programmes. Papua New Guinea residents returning from Asian countries will be held in quarantine for 14 days. \u201cThis is a preventative measure taken to ensure the spread of the coronavirus that is rapidly spreading in the world is minimised,\u201d immigration and border security minister Westly Nukundi Nukundj said. The evacuation flight from Wuhan to the United States has been rerouted to land at a US air force base, rather than an airport. The plane, carrying 240 Americans, left Wuhan this morning. It was scheduled to land at Ontario international airport in southern California, 56km (35 miles) from Los Angeles. But Curt Hagman, the chairman of the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, announced on Twitter it would now be diverted to March Air Force Base, roughly 35 miles east of Ontario. The flight, operated by American cargo airline Kalitta Air, left Wuhan\u2019s Tianhe airport today at 4.54 in the morning local time. It will stop at Anchorage in Alaska for refuelling, and then fly on to California. Passengers will be screened for the virus in Anchorage, and could be quarantined in California for up to two weeks by the US Centers for Disease Control. Ontario had been designed by the US government to receive Americans repatriated in case of an emergency. \u201cWe were prepared, but the state department decided to switch the flight to March Air Force Base,\u201d Hagman said. Data from publicly available flight tracking site Flightaware shows that the flight will land in Anchorage in one hour. In Beijing, Reuters reports that a pharmacist has been fined 3 million yuan (US $434,530) for artificially inflating the price of masks sixfold during the coronavirus outbreak. An administrative penalty notice has been issued to the Beijing Jimin Kangtai Pharmacy for sharply raising the price of N95 masks, the Beijing municipal market regulator said in a statement on its website. The store raised the price of a box of 3M brand masks to 850 yuan while the online price was just 143 yuan, state television said. Since Thursday, the regulator has investigated 31 price violation cases, it said. In Shanghai, the municipal market regulator has ordered the closure of a drug store that sold sub-standard masks, the city government said. The regulator has asked the store to refund buyers and dispose of unsold ones, it said on its official account on the Weibo app. Here\u2019s one of the ambulances carrying a Japanese patient to hospital. Four Japanese citizens who were evacuated from Wuhan have been taken to hospital with a cough and fever, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. Associated Press reports that the patients are a woman in her 50s and three men whose ages range from their 30s to 50s. They were taken to a Tokyo hospital on separate ambulances for treatment and further medical checks. 206 evacuees arrived on Wednesday morning in Tokyo, after they were airlifted out of Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. Earlier, Japanese officials said that no people on board had the virus. Passengers on the flight were wearing masks and underwent temperature checks before boarding and while on the plane. Plans were made for all of the evacuees to be treated and quarantined depending on their test results. In South Australia seven people are awaiting coronavirus tests, but the department of health says the likelihood of them having the disease is \u201clow\u201d. Three people who were previously tested came back with the all-clear. In Melbourne, our reporter Else Kennedy has just been to a media conference with Australian researchers who have recreated the novel coronavirus in a lab \u2013 the first time this has been done outside China. The team at Melbourne\u2019s Peter Doherty Institute worked through the night from the early hours of Saturday morning until Monday to grow and sequence the virus. \u201cThis is one step, a piece in the puzzle that we have contributed,\u201d said virus identification laboratory head Dr Julian Druce. The lab-grown virus was developed from the first infected patient to be identified in Australia, and will be shared with laboratories globally. \u201cHaving the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities,\u201d Druce said on Wednesday. The virus is expected to generate an antibody test, which allows detection of the virus in patients who haven\u2019t displayed symptoms. The institute\u2019s deputy director, Dr Mike Catton, said it would help develop a more realistic picture of how the virus was tracking. \u201cAn antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate,\u201d Catton said. In finance news, the Hong Kong stock market has slumped off the back of coronavirus fears, but the rest of Asia was up. As of an hour ago (02.30am GMT), the Hang Seng was down 2.6%, but Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 was up 0.5%. Chinese markets however, are still closed. Agence France-Presse reports that Hong Kong investors returned from the Lunar New Year break to \u201ca global panic over the deadly coronavirus, though most other Asian markets were lifted by bargain-buying after recent losses\u201d. \u201cHealthy US data reinforced hopes for the global economic outlook and supported a rally across US and European markets, which provided a strong lead for Asia, while a record earnings report from Apple also helped the mood. \u201cAmong the worst-hit sectors on global trading floors are firms linked to travel and tourism, as big-spending Chinese tourists stay at home with Beijing clamping down on people\u2019s movement.\u201d In Hong Kong, the airline Cathay Pacific lost more than 3%, casino operator Galaxy Entertainment lost more than 6% and property giant New World Development lost more than 4%. Some pictures here of Chinese construction workers building an emergency hospital that is urgently being set up in Wuhan. The Huoshenshan hospital is scheduled to open on 3 February. Another, the Leishenshan hospital, is being constructed nearby to a similar schedule. The government is livestreaming the construction of the site. Journalist Rebekah Holt has said she has spoken to the Tamil family from Biloela now detained on Christmas Island. \u201cThey have not been told by staff about centre being used for quarantine purposes. My call was the first they knew of it.\u201d For some background on the case, read here: In Tokyo, passengers from the evacuation from Wuhan have spoken to media. Takeo Aoyama, who works for Nippon Steel Corp, and Takayuki Kato, who works for Intec, said they felt relieved but also exhausted, Associated Press reports. Kato said he was \u201cshocked when all transportation systems were suspended. That\u2019s when the situation drastically changed.\u201d Aoyama said many people who wished to go home to Japan were still in Wuhan, including workers at a Japanese supermarket chain staying open to supply food. The news that Christmas Island will be used to potentially quarantine Australians with the coronavirus has led to renewed calls for the government to release a family of Tamil asylum seekers from Biloela currently detained there. Priya and Nadesalingam, and their Australian-born children, Kopika and Tharunicaa had fled the Sri Lankan civil war, and lived in the Queensland town of Biloela since 2014. The government moved to deport the family in 2018, and they have been held in detention as a court assesses various legal challenges. They have been held on the remote Christmas Island \u2013 a former immigration detention centre \u2013 since August. The petition to bring them Home to Bilo has since received 260,000 signatures. Today it was updated, in light of the plan to use Christmas Island in the Wuhan evacuation. \u201cWe at the Home to Bilo campaign would like to extend our thoughts to those currently caught in the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d the petition says. \u201cWe understand that Christmas Island will be used as a quarantine area for Australians being evacuated from Wuhan and Hubei province. \u201cWe will be monitoring the situation to ensure that Priya, Nades, Kopika and Tharunicaa are not put at risk during this process. \u201cWe have repeatedly called for Priya, Nades, and their two young daughters to be returned to mainland Australia. Their ongoing detention on Christmas Island has isolated and traumatised this young family. This new development confirms that the most appropriate place for them is in their home, Biloela.\u201d Our correspondent Rebecca Ratcliffe has spoken to dual British and American citizen Nick, who is a teacher in Wuhan and who is among up to 200 people waiting to be evacuated. He called the Foreign and Commonwealth Office crisis line earlier this morning and was asked if he would be prepared to leave his wife behind, because she is Indonesian and doesn\u2019t currently have a UK visa. They have two children, aged nine and 12, also in Wuhan. \u201cHe said that she would probably not be able to get on the plane,\u201d said Nick. \u201cI feel like we are being hung out to dry\u201d. Other Britons who have Chinese partners fear their wives or husbands will also be unable to get on the plane. It is not clear how many people will be given a seat on the flight, which is also likely to be carrying consulate staff. Some British people in Wuhan have been receiving calls and told that there will be a flight tomorrow, others are still waiting for news. AFP reports that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in China reached 5,974 on Wednesday, overtaking the number of people infected in the mainland by the Sars epidemic in 2002-3. There were 5,327 confirmed cases in mainland China during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic. That outbreak killed more than 770 people globally, including 349 in mainland China. To recap, so far today: The official death toll in China has risen to 132, with 5,974 cases confirmed 240 American citizens, and 200 Japanese citizens have been airlifted out of Wuhan this morning. The Japanese plane landed in Tokyo two hours ago, with no passengers infected, according to officials. The US plane is scheduled to land in Anchorage, Alaska in 4 hours, and will then fly to Ontario, California. Australia and New Zealand will attempt to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan and the Hubei province. Australia has told citizens to reconsider travel to the entire country of China. Three more people have been infected in Malaysia, taking their total to seven. Australian scientists have become the first in the world, outside of China, to replicate the coronavirus in a lab. Malaysia has confirmed that seven people have the coronovirus, three more than yesterday, according to Reuters. The three new cases are a 4-year-old girl, a 52-year-old man and the mother of two children confirmed infected earlier, the health ministry said in a statement. All seven people are Chinese citizens. Authorities said the mother had initially tested negative and had stayed in Malaysia to take care of her children - grandsons of a 66-year-old man who tested positive in Singapore for the coronavirus last week. Separately, Malaysia\u2019s communications regulator said it has detained one person accused of spreading fake news on the coronavirus. The person was arrested over a Facebook post that contained false information on the outbreak, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said. Malaysia this week imposed a temporary ban on Chinese nationals arriving from Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. In that press conference, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison also announced that the government would distribute 1 million masks around Australia. However, the chief medical officer stressed that the masks are only necessary for people travelling through China, and for doctors and nurses. \u201cThe masks are for patients with the relevant travel history and symptoms and their doctors who are assessing them, we\u2019re not recommending the general Australian public wear masks or take protection,\u201d he said. The masks are being sent to pharmacists via the Primary Health Networks, Morrison said. But \u201cbushfire responses have depleted some of those stocks in various places\u201d. Our correspondent Michael Standaert in Sichuan, writes that there have been no real updates of an evacuation among British citizens in Wuhan. This comes amidst the US and Japanese airlifts this morning, and the announcement of an attempted Australian evacuation a few minutes ago. \u201cThe biggest problem for everyone now is how to get to the airport. They are supposed to provide their own transport and that\u2019s nearly impossible for some since there are no taxis, no ride hailing available, no buses.\u201d The prime minister is asked whether he has been briefed on the virus\u2019s potential economic impact on Australia. \u201cWe share a concern, particularly in the wake of the bushfire crisis, of the impact on our tourism industry and related things. And that is obviously of concern to us. \u201cBut to be honest, right now, my focus is on people\u2019s health and their wellbeing. And these issues will be addressed in time when a clearer picture emerges.\u201d Morrison says that parents should follow the advice of NSW Health and the chief medical officer when it comes to sending kids to school. \u201cMy kids went back to school this week as many other kids have. \u201cI understand the issues and concerns that parents would have. Being one of them myself. And that is why it is important to take the advice, and I think the chief medical officer today has set out the situation very soundly.\u201d Morrison is asked if he can estimate how many people could be evacuated. He says it is too early to know. \u201cAt this stage we are simply saying that we are putting plans in place.\u201d New Zealand \u201chas a much smaller number of people impacted than Australia\u201d, he says. He says some of the Australians in Wuhan may have lived there for some time. \u201cThere are some people who will be there for some time and effectively have been living there for some period of time. We are talking about [evacuating] people who are there not in those circumstances, those who don\u2019t have support structures in that place.\u201d Foreign minister Payne is asked how long it will take for the Chinese government to approve an evacuation. \u201cWe must be prepared to be patient as this process is undertaken. Australia is not the only country seeking diplomatic support and clearances for these activities. But we are seeking permission from the Chinese authorities as I indicated in my opening remarks.\u201d There are 600 Australians in Hubei province who have reached out either for advice or assistance, foreign minister Marise Payne says. The focus of the evacuation is on \u201cisolated and vulnerable Australian citizens\u201d, she says. That means the young and the elderly, Morrison said earlier. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, is now speaking. He stresses that \u201cthere is no evidence of human to human transmission in Australia\u201d. \u201cWe have tested a large number of Australians with a relevant travel history and relevant symptoms and a great majority of those have been negative,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of the 5 cases in Australia are in a stable condition. The World Health Organisation have estimated that only 20% of people with this condition have a severe disease. \u201cThe majority of people have a mild disease and still most of the deaths are in people who are older and the Chinese are reporting them to have comorbidity...And we want to stress that there is no evidence of human to human transmission in Australia\u201d \u201cThe risk is extremely low\u201d. The potential evacuation will be conducted in partnership with New Zealand, Morrison says. \u201cI spoke again to Prime Minister Ardern today.\u201d Qantas has offered to provide the evacuation flight. On Christmas Island, the medical checks, and potential quarantine will be conducted by Ausmat (Australian Medical Assistance Teams). The defence force will also be deployed. \u201cI also want to stress that for Christmas Island, we will be ensuring there will be support provided directly to the Christmas Island community completely separate and quarantined from the support that is being provided in the quarantine zone,\u201d Morrison says. Australia has upgraded its travel advice to reconsider all travel to China \u2013 and will be providing \u201cassisted departures\u201d to elderly and young Australians in Wuhan and Hubei province. Prime minister Scott Morrison has described the coronavirus as \u201ca serious and evolving situation\u201d in a press conference in Canberra. \u201cThe travel advice has been upgraded to reconsider all travel to China \u2013 the entire nation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have taken a decision this morning to prepare a plan for an operation to provide some assisted departures for isolated and vulnerable Australians in Wuhan and the Hubei province.\u201d The evacuated Australians will then be quarantined in Christmas Island for up to 14 days. But that is not for certain, and dependant on the medical advice. \u201cWe cannot give a guarantee that this operation is able to succeed,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I also want to stress very clearly that we may not be in a position if we\u2019re able to do this on one occasion to do it on another occasion.\u201d The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, is now providing an update on the virus, speaking in Canberra. And more detail on that flight. According to public flight tracker FlightRadar24, the plane left Wuhan at 4:47 in the morning local time, and landed at Tokyo Haneda airport at 8:41 in the morning, Tokyo time \u2013 which was roughly one hour ago. A chartered plane carrying about 200 Japanese nationals evacuated from Wuhan arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday morning, according to Japanese media reports. The passengers, who were examined by four medical professionals during the flight, will be asked to stay at home for two weeks and be on the lookout for symptoms, Kyodo news agency said. The Japanese foreign ministry, however, said none of the passengers was infected with the coronavirus, according to Kyodo. A total of about 650 Japanese have asked to be evacuated from Wuhan. A second charter flight bound for Wuhan is expected to leave Tokyo on Wednesday evening, with additional flights to follow. The first plane arrived in Wuhan on Tuesday night carrying emergency relief supplies including 15,000 masks, 50,000 pairs of gloves and 8,000 protective glasses, the foreign ministry said. The death toll in mainland China has now risen to 132 \u2013 per official health commission figures. This morning Australian scientists have become the first in the world, outside of China, to replicate the coronavirus in a lab \u2013 in what they hope could lead to a vaccine. Researchers at Melbourne\u2019s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity recreated the virus from an infected patient. It will be shared with expert laboratories working closely with the World Health Organisation in Europe, along with laboratories across Australia. It will also help assess the effectiveness of trial vaccines. Chinese officials had released the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus which first surfaced in its Hubei province in December. Australian chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said the creation of the live virus was significant, particularly for providing controls for tests and speeding up an antibody test. \u201cIt\u2019s a very significant development and it\u2019s very, very positive,\u201d he told ABC Radio. Five people are being treated in Australian hospitals for the virus, with four of those cases in NSW alone. The death toll in China has now risen to 131 people, according to the updated coronavirus tracker from Tencent News. There are now also 5515 confirmed cases and 6973 suspected cases. And, as the US airlift out of Wuhan continues, Japan today has confirmed it too will evacuate 200 of its citizens. According to the Kyodo news agency, a chartered plane has departed the city early this morning, and is scheduled to arrive at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. In total, around 650 Japanese nationals have requested an airlift out of Wuhan. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to take every possible measure to bring home all people hoping to come back to Japan,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told lawmakers on Tuesday, according to Jiji Press. Officials are aboard the plane to monitor passengers during the return flight, but there are no plans to isolate those arriving from Wuhan. The European Union will fly its citizens out aboard two French planes this week, and South Korea was due to do the same. Several other countries were assessing their options. Canada said 126 of its citizens live in the Wuhan area and it is consulting with allies and considering its options for getting them home. Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the novel coronavirus originating from Wuhan in China. This morning, the US has begun its first evacuation of citizens from Wuhan itself, in the Hubei province, where thousands of people have been affected. The US state department confirmed to the Associated Press that 240 Americans \u2013 including diplomats and other citizens \u2013 have been airlifted out of the city, and will be flown to Anchorage in Alaska, and then to Ontario in California, 56 kilometres (35 miles) from Los Angeles. Data from publicly available flight tracking site Flightaware shows that a flight operated by American cargo airline Kalitta Air left Wuhan\u2019s Tianhe airport today at 4.54 in the morning local time, and is due to touch down in Alaska in 6 hours from now. According to AP, all Americans will be screened for the virus in Anchorage, and could be quarantined in Ontario for up to two weeks by the US Centers for Disease Control. David Wert, a spokesman for the county of San Bernardino, said they were \u201cpreparing for that eventuality just in case\u201d. Wert said that Ontario International Airport was designated a decade ago by the U.S. government to receive repatriated Americans in case of an emergency overseas. Airport personnel have trained for such an occasion but the repatriation from China would be the first time the airport is used for this purpose, he said. In Ontario, the area where passengers will be taken is removed from passenger terminals and other public areas at the airport, the county said.",

Others are likely to reflect China\u2019s handling of the crisis, in spite of the WHO\u2019s praise for Beijing and the dedication of scientists and medical staff. Its response has been a vast improvement on 2003, when the Sars outbreak was covered up for months. But there is little doubt the Wuhan authorities, at least, badly mishandled matters \u2013 encouraging tourism and holding a banquet for 40,000 people days after confirmation of the new coronavirus. Strikingly, the mayor of Wuhan has said he could not disclose information on the virus until authorised to do so by more senior officials. Lack of knowledge facilitated its spread. The outbreak has also exposed the limits of a health system struggling to cope under normal circumstances, and the weaknesses of a party-state which justifies its existence not through an electoral mandate, but its ability to answer basic needs. Two hospitals in Wuhan are being built from scratch, within days. Yet hospitals have had to issue appeals for masks and protective gowns. Complacency, incompetence and cover-ups are hardly unknown in democracies. But an authoritarian political culture which punishes rather than rewards transparency prevents accountability and struggles to change course. It also, perversely, encourages rumours internally and externally. Conspiracy theories are spreading, along with discrimination towards people from Wuhan within China, and Chinese people abroad, the latter reflecting old racist tropes about disease and hygiene. Such prejudices do nothing to protect health. Justified scrutiny of the official response is necessary. It must not be conflated with hostility towards people who need and deserve help and sympathy.",

      "bodyText": "As the UK government prepares to airlift hundreds of British nationals out of Wuhan in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Guardian answers five key questions for those stranded in the country. How can British nationals arrange to be evacuated from China? The government has chartered a flight to airlift British nationals out of Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, and there are expected to be about 200 people onboard. The flight was due to depart on Thursday morning, but the evening before it emerged it would be delayed as permission had not yet been granted by Chinese authorities. It is open to all British nationals in the Hubei province, but anyone showing signs of illness will not be allowed to board. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) have advised any British nationals in the area who need assistance to contact their 24/7 helplines on +86 (0) 10 8529 6600 or (+44) (0)207 008 1500. Although a deadline for registering for evacuation was in place for 11am on Wednesday, the FCO is urging any nationals still looking to leave the country to get in touch. Will those with dual nationality, or family members of British nationals, be allowed to evacuate? Under Chinese restrictions, only British passport holders who do not hold Chinese nationality are permitted to leave through the evacuation. China does not recognise dual citizenship, and official government advice states that if you are British and Chinese, you are likely to be considered a Chinese citizen by the Chinese authorities. The FCO said the British Embassy in Beijing was urgently pressing the Chinese authorities to allow dependents of British nationals and British-Chinese dual nationals to leave. However, Beijing has restated its position and other countries, including the US, have only been allowed to take mono-nationals. What about people in other parts of China? The current plan is for evacuation from Wuhan airport only. Some commercial airlines are still operating out of other airports across China, although British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China. The Foreign Office said it might become more difficult for British nationals in other Chinese provinces to leave and said they should \u201cmake decisions based on their own personal circumstances\u201d over whether to evacuate. How can people get to the airport? Many roads in Hubei province are blocked as the Chinese authorities try to control movement and stop the spread of the virus. Some citizens have been told they will need a diplomatic note in order to pass through roads and reach the airport, but the FCO was unable to confirm what support is in place to help people with this. What will happen to people once they arrive back in the UK? All Britons returning from Wuhan will be quarantined for 14 days once they return to the UK. They will be placed in isolation units with medical care, which government sources said could potentially be a military base. Those who have already returned from Wuhan have been advised to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people, and to call NHS 111 to inform them if they have recently travelled to the city.",

The public inquiry was set up by Theresa May in its immediate aftermath to get to the truth of what happened and why.</p> \n<p>Survivors fear the request could dent the likelihood of successful criminal prosecutions, which are a top priority for many.

      "bodyText": "Witnesses in the Grenfell inquiry who were involved in the tower\u2019s refurbishment have threatened to withhold evidence unless they receive an assurance that their testimony will not be used to mount criminal prosecutions that could land them in jail. Lawyers for the architects, builders and the client on the works threw the inquiry into confusion on Wednesday when they wrote to its chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, arguing that their clients could claim a privilege against self-incrimination as a reason for not answering questions. They said they would speak openly only if the attorney general gave an undertaking that nothing they said would be used to further a prosecution against them. The Metropolitan police are conducting a parallel investigation into possible manslaughter and corporate manslaughter charges and a number of witnesses have already been interviewed under caution by detectives. Lawyers for the architects Studio E, current and former staff at the main contractor, Rydon, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (TMO) and Harley Facades, which erected the cladding, argued: \u201cThe scope of self-incrimination is broad and extends not only to refusing to answer questions or give information that may directly incriminate the witness but also to answer or provide information which \u2018might lead to a line of inquiry which would or might form a significant step in the chain of evidence required for a prosecution\u2019.\u201d Without an undertaking \u201cwitnesses will legitimately and reasonably be entitled to refuse to answer questions,\u201d the lawyers said. There were groans from the bereaved and survivors in the inquiry when the threat emerged, and proceedings were halted for 70 minutes. \u201cThe timing of this application \u2026 is highly reprehensible and highly questionable coming on the eve of evidence,\u201d said Michael Mansfield QC, on behalf of hundreds of bereaved and survivors. \u201cIt has caused immense anxiety, distress and anger.\u201d He said the Grenfell community had been waiting to \u201cget to the point of accountability\u201d and the move had made them feel \u201calmost thwarted at the doors of the court\u201d. The fire on 14 June 2017 killed 72 people. The public inquiry was set up by Theresa May in its immediate aftermath to get to the truth of what happened and why. Survivors fear the request could dent the likelihood of successful criminal prosecutions, which are a top priority for many. The counsel to the inquiry, Richard Millett QC, has already criticised the corporates for engaging in a \u201cmerry-go-round of buck-passing\u201d in their evidence so far. Moore-Bick said the move was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, with cross-examination of witnesses due to begin next week, starting with staff at Studio E. Similar undertakings had been made in the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, the Bloody Sunday inquiry, the Ladbroke Grove inquiry, the Baha Mousa inquiry, the al-Sweady inquiry, the Azelle Rodney inquiry and the undercover policing inquiry, lawyers for the corporates said. Moore-Bick said he would decide whether to request the same from the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, on Monday after hearing representations from the bereaved, survivors and residents. Meanwhile, key parties continued to state their cases. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), which owned the tower, confessed to six mistakes by its building control department and said it apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d.

No cellphones.

And Klobuchar\u2019s daughter, Abigail Bessler, last week kicked off the first in a series of locally hosted \u201cHotdish House Parties\u201d.</p> <p>Less than a week away from the caucuses, the race is bunched so tightly at the top that even the smallest changes could have an impact. Polling shows an unusually large share of Democrats are still uncommitted, overwhelmed by the historically large field and gripped by a fear of nominating a candidate who can\u2019t beat Trump. A recent Monmouth University poll found that nearly half of Iowa voters could change their minds before the caucuses.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/24/andrew-yang-2020-candidate-robots-machines\">Andrew Yang</a>, a tech entrepreneur and dark horse presidential candidate, joked at a Bloomberg News reporter roundtable in Des Moines on Wednesday that campaigning in Iowa \u201cevery weekday for the two weeks before the caucuses\u201d should be the \u201cdecisive criterion\u201d for support.</p> <p>Striking a more serious tone, Yang said his rivals clearly faced a \u201cdisadvantage\u201d by not being in the state.</p> <p>\u201cImagine knowing you want to be in Iowa talking to voters, furthering this campaign that you\u2019ve been working towards in many cases for years or decades, and you\u2019re not here,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel terrible for them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b7cc8d2dece99fc877cba2f114c408b8681d4b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b7cc8d2dece99fc877cba2f114c408b8681d4b5/0_88_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bailey, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s golden retriever, is led by her husband, Bruce Mann, and son Alex in Waterloo, Iowa, on 29 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bailey the golden retriever is led by her husband, Bruce Mann, and son, Alex, in Waterloo, Iowa, on 29 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even before the trial began last week, it was transforming the race in other ways. </p> <p>At the heart of the trial are revelations that Trump solicited help from Ukrainian officials to damage Biden, the Democratic frontrunner. Trump and his legal team have repeatedly accused the former vice-president without evidence of seeking to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a natural gas company that employed his son Hunter Biden while he was in office.</p> <p>Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa, told reporters after a presentation by Trump\u2019s defense team that centered on Hunter Biden that she was \u201creally interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWill they be supporting Vice-President Biden at this point?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>At his events this week in Iowa, voters said the allegations \u2013 which most believed to be baseless \u2013 would not dissuade them from voting for Biden. But there were some who voiced concern that the accusations could cast a cloud over Biden\u2019s candidacy the way the email scandal hurt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016</a>.</p> <p>Biden, who has highlighted his electability as an asset against Trump in a general election, cited Ernst\u2019s as proof that the president fears running against him.</p> <p>\u201cShe spilled the beans,\u201d he told voters at a campaign stop in Muscatine on Tuesday. \u201cThe whole impeachment trial for Trump is just a political hit job to try to smear me because he is scared to death to run against me.

      "bodyText": "By 4am on Monday morning Amy Klobuchar was headed to the airport to catch a flight from Iowa, where she packed a dizzying six campaign events into a 36-hour window, back to Washington DC, where her presence was required at the US Capitol for day six of the Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump. As soon as the proceedings in the Senate finished for the day, shortly after 9pm, the Minnesota senator dialed into a \u201ctele-town hall\u201d with Iowa voters. \u201cI never thought that I wouldn\u2019t be there with all of you,\u201d she said on the conference call. \u201cI hope you understand that.\u201d Such is the life of a US senator running for president while on jury duty for an impeachment trial, only the third in American history. Instead of barnstorming Iowa\u2019s 99 counties in the final days before the caucuses on 3 February, she is locked up in a room for hours on end with 99 other senators \u2013 three of whom are also running for president. For the next several days and possibly weeks, as the Senate grapples with the thorny question of whether to call witnesses, and ultimately moves to a vote on whether to remove the president from office, Klobuchar and her colleagues Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael Bennet of Colorado must continue to balance their \u201cconstitutional duty\u201d with their responsibilities as a presidential candidate at a critical moment before voting begins. The rules of the trial effectively prohibit double-duty: senators must be in their seats six days a week. No cellphones. And absolutely no talking, archaically but loosely enforced on \u201cpain of imprisonment\u201d. The situation has forced the Democrats to get creative about how they campaign from hundreds of miles away, in a state where voters famously like to meet their candidates before making a decision. While the senators are holding town halls by phone and video, dashing to TV hits during trial breaks and chartering last-minute flights timed to the crack of the gavel concluding the day\u2019s session, two of their top rivals, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, crisscross Iowa on dueling bus tours. \u201cEven though this race has been going on for some time and voters know the candidates by now, there is still nothing like having the candidate there to rally the troops in that last week,\u201d said David Redlawsk, a political scientist and author of Why Iowa: How Caucuses and Sequential Elections Improve the Presidential Nominating Process. In their stead, the senators have dispatched a range of high-profile supporters such as the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Sanders) and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro (Warren) as well as lesser-known family members, local officials, activists and even an Olympic curling coach (Klobuchar). This week, Warren\u2019s husband, Bruce Mann, will travel across Iowa on her behalf with their golden retriever, Bailey, while Sanders\u2019 wife, Jane, will stand in for him at a rally and concert. And Klobuchar\u2019s daughter, Abigail Bessler, last week kicked off the first in a series of locally hosted \u201cHotdish House Parties\u201d. Less than a week away from the caucuses, the race is bunched so tightly at the top that even the smallest changes could have an impact. Polling shows an unusually large share of Democrats are still uncommitted, overwhelmed by the historically large field and gripped by a fear of nominating a candidate who can\u2019t beat Trump. A recent Monmouth University poll found that nearly half of Iowa voters could change their minds before the caucuses. Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur and dark horse presidential candidate, joked at a Bloomberg News reporter roundtable in Des Moines on Wednesday that campaigning in Iowa \u201cevery weekday for the two weeks before the caucuses\u201d should be the \u201cdecisive criterion\u201d for support. Striking a more serious tone, Yang said his rivals clearly faced a \u201cdisadvantage\u201d by not being in the state. \u201cImagine knowing you want to be in Iowa talking to voters, furthering this campaign that you\u2019ve been working towards in many cases for years or decades, and you\u2019re not here,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel terrible for them.\u201d Even before the trial began last week, it was transforming the race in other ways. At the heart of the trial are revelations that Trump solicited help from Ukrainian officials to damage Biden, the Democratic frontrunner. Trump and his legal team have repeatedly accused the former vice-president without evidence of seeking to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a natural gas company that employed his son Hunter Biden while he was in office. Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa, told reporters after a presentation by Trump\u2019s defense team that centered on Hunter Biden that she was \u201creally interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters\u201d. \u201cWill they be supporting Vice-President Biden at this point?\u201d she asked. At his events this week in Iowa, voters said the allegations \u2013 which most believed to be baseless \u2013 would not dissuade them from voting for Biden. But there were some who voiced concern that the accusations could cast a cloud over Biden\u2019s candidacy the way the email scandal hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden, who has highlighted his electability as an asset against Trump in a general election, cited Ernst\u2019s as proof that the president fears running against him. \u201cShe spilled the beans,\u201d he told voters at a campaign stop in Muscatine on Tuesday. \u201cThe whole impeachment trial for Trump is just a political hit job to try to smear me because he is scared to death to run against me. And he has good reason to be concerned.\u201d With the caucuses days away, the senators have stepped up their outreach from afar. The Sanders campaign has leveraged his massive social media following with livestreamed events and a new video published on Tuesday that responds gleefully to the mounting concerns from within the Democratic party that the Vermont senator could actually win the caucuses, if not the nomination. Warren on Tuesday hosted a tele-town hall. More than 20,000 Iowans participated, according to her campaign. The timing is especially inconvenient for Klobuchar, who has staked her campaign on a strong performance in Iowa. Though she lacks the financial firepower or national prominence of Sanders and Warren, her campaign has showed signs of strength in recent weeks, earning a handful of high-profile endorsements from regional and national editorial boards and is climbing in some recent polls. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of momentum for our campaign just when I can\u2019t be there,\u201d Klobuchar said to the more than 11,000 people who dialed in to the call, according to her campaign. Before signing off for the night, she implored them that an upset in Iowa was within her grasp. \u201cEvery sign is that I can,\u201d she said. \u201cI just need you to help me make that extra, extra, extra push.\u201d But Klobuchar was leaving nothing to chance. After an unexpectedly early close to Tuesday\u2019s proceedings, Klobuchar slipped out of the Capitol and on to a flight bound for Council Bluffs.",

The SNP case was strengthened by team discipline (various MPs making the same point). These were moments when Johnson faced forceful challenge.</p> \n  <p>He is also facing an acute dilemma over HS2.

He has been a member of the parliament since 1999. In an interview on the Today programme this morning he made two valedictory claims - both of which are highly questionable.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage claimed that Brexit would mark the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d for the EU. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think, two years down the road, there\u2019ll be a big debate going on in many other countries about what kind of Europe do people want.</p> \n   <p>Do they want a Europe of trading co-operation or a Europe run by these institutions in Brussels, and I think the UK\u2019s departure really will mark the beginning of the end of this European project.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This claim is dubious because polling evidence suggests that support for EU membership remains very high - <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brexit-eu-survey-italy-ireland-portugal-eurosceptic-poll-a8888126.html\">it\u2019s over 80% in most member states </a>- and that pro-EU sentiment on the continent has actually gone up since the UK voted to leave in 2016. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/08/brexit-pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-to-tell-eu-chief-at-first-meeting-that-trade-deal-wont-be-based-on-alignment-live-news?page=with:block-5e15db3a8f087e8308e6ab0d#block-5e15db3a8f087e8308e6ab0d\">In a recent speech in London</a> <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, the European commission president, said Brexit had strengthened unity amongst the EU27. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One consequence of the Brexit vote has been to strengthen the unity and the faith in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> as a project for the common good. The truth is that Brexit has highlighted the value of being together in today\u2019s ever more unsettled world.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When Farage was asked in his interview about polling showing that support for EU membership had risen across Europe since Brexit, he said that was just because people had seen the UK \u201cmake such a Horlicks\u201d of leaving.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage claimed the UK would get a good trade deal from the UK because it was in \u201can enormously powerful position\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think we\u2019re in an enormously powerful position.</p> \n   <p>There is now genuine fear in this building I\u2019m in this morning [Farage was speaking to Today from Brussels] about Brexit and here\u2019s what the fear is, particularly coming from the Germans - they\u2019re very scared that we will become more competitive than they are.</p> \n   <p>The whole single market is based on this premise of a level playing field - it is actually anti-competitive by its very nature, and I think that is a very strong card for us to play because, after all, we still buy an awful lot of German motor cars.</p> \n   <p>I think the truth of it is, if we negotiate tough in this next round, we will come out at the end of the year with something pretty reasonable.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is just the latest iteration of the long-running claim that pressure from German BMW manufacturers and Italian Prosecco producers will ensure the EU offers the UK easy access to the single market after Brexit. So far it has turned out to be a poor guide to EU negotiating behaviour because EU leaders have been more interested in protecting the integrity of the single market than in featherbedding BMW.

The government announced yesterday that it plans to legislate to ensure that \u201chigh risk vendors\u201d (ie, Huawei) can only run 35% of the 5G network. Legislation means votes, and voting means backbenchers have leverage (because the main opposition parties, Labour and the SNP, are also very critical of this decision on national security grounds). On Newsnight last night <strong>Sir Iain Duncan Smith</strong>, the former Conservative party leader, said that there would have to be \u201cmodification\u201d to the government\u2019s plans and that the 35% threshold was too high.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1222294363100848130\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced, and everyone thinks so too, that China is a direct threat in cyberspace.\u201d<br><br>MPs have criticised the government\u2019s decision to allow Huawei involvement in the UK's 5G network.<br><br>Tory MP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MPIainDS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MPIainDS</a> says he wants to see the firm \"out of the system\"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Newsnight?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Newsnight</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qH87uz1LOf\">pic.twitter.com/qH87uz1LOf</a></p>\u2014 BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1222294363100848130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And on the Today programme this morning <strong>Damian Green</strong>, the former first secretary of state, also said that he wanted to see the 35% figure driven down in a future vote. Asked how much support the rebels might have from Tory backbenchers for such a plan, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, one of the things that that frankly surprised me was the breadth of the opposition to the current stance of the government on the Conservative back benches. </p> \n   <p>We don\u2019t know yet, when push comes to shove and votes happen, how many people will actually put their heads above the parapet. But certainly it\u2019s very widespread.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The government has a majority of 80, and Green conceded that that meant roughly 40 MPs would need to rebel for the government to be at risk of defeat. But he did not rule this out.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There did appear to be very widespread opposition from members old and new, on the left and right of the party, so there\u2019s there was very widespread, strong unease about the way the government is going on this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Green\u2019s intervention confirmed the very point he was making. While Duncan Smith is on the right of the party, Green himself is firmly on the Tory left. New MPs may be more reluctant to rebel than old ones, of course, and the government could make concessions over the 35% target to appease its critics, but it can\u2019t go too far without driving Huawei out of the 5G market, which would defeat the point of the announcement made yesterday.

      "bodyText": "MEPs have voted overwhelmingly to approve the withdrawal agreement, clearing one of the last remaining hurdles in the process that will see the UK leave the EU on Friday night. The outcome of the vote was never in doubt, but the debate was nevertheless at times passionate and moving. Nigel Farage was reprimanded by the chair after he and fellow Brexit party MEPs waved mini union jacks after his speech, in which he denounced the EU as anti-democratic, before some of them left en masse for the bar. But most British MEPs who spoke expressed deep sadness about Brexit, with many of them predicting that one day the UK would decide to return. (See 4.37pm, 5.01pm, 5.04pm, 5.09pm and 5.16pm for some examples.) This marks a contrast with Westminster, where there is almost no one arguing publicly that Brexit will be reversed. Jess Phillips floated this idea briefly, stepped back within 24 hours, and is now out of the Labour leadership contest for good. Boris Johnson has said he will celebrate Brexit on Friday in a \u201crespectful\u201d way. Speaking during his \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook, in response to a question about he would mark Brexit on Friday, he said: What I will be doing is, in common with everybody else, I will be making a dignified exit from the European Union.I will be celebrating in a way that I hope is respectful of the scale of the event, that does justice to the astonishing feat that Britain has accomplished but also is mindful of everybody\u2019s feelings about what we are doing. It is a great moment for our country, it is a moment of hope and opportunity but it is also, I think, a moment for us to come together in a spirit of confidence. Rebecca Long-Bailey has received the third union nomination she needs to be guaranteed a place on the final ballot of members for the Labour leadership. (See 5.24pm.) The final nomination came from the Fire Brigades Union. The Scottish government has narrowly won a vote to keep the EU flag flying over the Edinburgh parliament building after Brexit, despite being accused of undermining the impartial status of Holyrood\u2019s governing body. Boris Johnson has lavished praise on Donald Trump\u2019s vision for Middle East peace, after Jeremy Corbyn criticised the plan for failing to gain the support of any Palestinians. Boris Johnson is facing a possible rebellion over his decision to allow China\u2019s Huawei to build part of Britain\u2019s 5G infrastructure. The British government is urgently pressing Beijing to allow dual nationals to leave China after public outcry over families being split up during the coronavirus evacuations. The future of the privatised rail system was thrown into further doubt on Wednesday as the government announced the renationalisation of the struggling Northern rail franchise. That\u2019s all from me for today. And for the rest of the week, I\u2019m afraid, because I\u2019m away for the next two days. Thanks for the comments. Here are some quotes from the European parliament debate. From Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator What is in fact threatening Britain\u2019s sovereignty most - the rules of our single market or the fact that tomorrow they may be planting Chinese 5G masts in the British islands? ... It is sad to see a country leaving that twice liberated us, has twice given its blood to liberate Europe ... In the last couple of days I have received hundreds of mails from British citizens saying they desperately want to stay or return ... So this vote is not an adieu, this vote, in my opinion, is only an au revoir. From Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission No new partnership will bring back the benefits of being part of the same union but we have the duty to seek the best for the British and for the European people in a post-Brexit world. To our British friends and many - perhaps not all - but many of our British MEPs here in the room, I want to use the words of the famous British poet George Eliot. She said, \u2018Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depth of love\u2019. We will always love you and we will never be far, long live Europe. From Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader I\u2019m hoping this begins the end of this project. It\u2019s a bad project, it isn\u2019t just undemocratic it\u2019s anti-democratic ... There is a historic battle going on now across the West - in Europe, America and elsewhere. It is globalism against populism. And you may loathe populism, but I\u2019ll tell you a funny thing - it\u2019s becoming very popular. And it has great benefits. No more financial contributions, no more European Court of Justice, no more common fisheries policy, no more being talked down to, no more being bullied, no more Guy Verhofstadt. From Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator We are going to continue in the year that comes, this current year with the same spirit, the same objectivity, without any aggression by firmly, however, defending the interests of the union and its member states. Going beyond Brexit the UK will remain there. It will remain a close partner when it comes to the economy. It will be an ally as it always has been and it will be a friend. Here is video of MEPs signing Auld Lang Syne. This week\u2019s Guardian Politics Weekly podcast is out. Heather Stewart rings in the end of an era as Brexit seems all but done. She chats to Jennifer Rankin, Andrew Fisher and James Kirkup about what Britain will look like after 31 January. Plus, the panel discuss whether the Labour leadership candidates are focusing on the right issues. From the BBC\u2019s Scotland editor, Sarah Smith From Jaume Duch, spokesperson for the European parliament David Sassoli, president of the parliament, says MEPs have voted to approve the withdrawal agreement. Now the European council must conclude the formalities tomorrow. He quotes Jo Cox, the Labour MP murdered by a far-right terrorist during the referendum campaign. There is more that united us than divides us, he says. MEPs have approved the withdrawal agreement by 621 votes to 49. Now MEPs are singing Auld Lang Syne. MEPs are now taking the vote. Barnier has switched to English for his final comment. He says, at this moment of new beginning, he would like to wish the UK well. Barnier says it is possible to be a European over and above being a patriot. That can give additional force to national patriotism, he says. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is concluding the debate. He says it has been a moving debate. The EU respected the UK vote to leave, he says. He thanks the contribution made by British MEPs. Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy, a French MEP in the EPP group, says friendship with the UK should continue after Brexit. But Brexit is also a warning, he says. He says the EU must show that it serves all its citizens. Back in the European parliament Martin Horwood, a Lib Dem MEP, says, in various European languages, before ending in English, \u201cwe will be back.\u201d Turning away from the debate in the European parliament for a moment, Rebecca Long-Bailey has now secured the third nomination she needs from a Labour affiliate organisation to ensure that she will be on the final ballot for party members. The final nomination came from the Fire Brigades Union. That means she, Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy are now all guaranteed a place on the final ballot. Emily Thornberry is still struggling to get the nominations she needs. In a statement Long-Bailey said: I am absolutely delighted to be nominated for leader by the FBU. Heroic firefighters put themselves at risk to protect us every day, and their union embodies the values of our movement. The FBU has been critical to the development of our key policies. We\u2019ve worked closely together on public ownership, and they were crucial to securing the manifesto commitment to repealing anti-trade union laws. Vangelis Meimarakis, a Greek MEP, says the EU must ensure that this does not become a historic mistake for the EU. It must learn from what caused Brexit. Theresa Griffin, a Labour MEP, says young people should \u201ckeep the faith that one day we will come back\u201d. Esther de Lange, a Dutch MEP and member of the EPP group, says Boris Johnson did not really care what happened with Brexit. But she says the vote is an example of what happens when the media does not tell the truth. She says democracy needs defending; that is the lesson that needs to be taken from Brexit. Laura Huhtasaari, a Finnish MEP, says Friday will be a great moment. It will strike a blow against corporate elites. She ends by telling the Brexit party MEPs: \u201cI love you guys.\u201d Aileen McLeod, an SNP MEP, says she will vote against the withdrawal agreement, in accordance with the wishes of the Scottish people. She ends by saying she hopes the parliament will \u201cleave a light on for Scotland\u201d. Luisa Porritt, a Lib Dem MEP, says she will vote against the withdrawal agreement on behalf of hyer London constituents who voted remain. She says the only person celebrating this outside the UK are people who want to damage the country. She says young Brits will one day lead the campaign to rejoin. Anthea McIntyre, a Conservative, says she speaks as the proud daughter of a solider who fought at D-Day. The UK may be leaving the EU, but we remain Europeans, she says. Molly Scott Cato, the Green party MEP, starts her speech by saying that she feels she is about to cry. Now is not the time to campaign to return to rejoin the EU, she says. But she says it is important to keep the hope alive. She ends: I hold in my heart the knowledge that one day I will be back in this chamber, celebrating our return to Europe. As she finishes she gets emotional and tearful. She gets a loud and long standing ovation. It is a moving moment. Back in the European parliament Naomi Long, the Alliance MEP from Northern Ireland, says she will vote against the withdrawal agreement. That is to express her constituents\u2019 opposition to Brexit. She says she will never agree with this \u201cinsular, isolationist and reckless course of action\u201d. But she says she wants to thank Michel Barnier for ensuring that the withdrawal does not involve a hard Brexit. She ends by saying she expects Brexit to be reversed. \u201cGoodbye for now,\u201d she says. Fishing communities fear they will be \u201csold out\u201d in Brexit negotiations and do not believe government promises that the UK will take back control of British waters, representatives of coastal communities have said. Many believe the sector will be used as leverage in the upcoming talks and are concerned that Boris Johnson\u2019s government will buckle under pressure to make a trade off for other sectors including financial services. \u201cThere is a real genuine danger that they will be sold out and are facing into this with a fair degree of scepticism,\u201d said Luke Pollard the shadow environment secretary at a parliamentary event organised by the fishing industry this afternoon. They have every right to be afraid, there is a real risk they will be sold out and the promises made by the government will not be delivered. He was speaking a day after the government vowed that the automatic right of EU vessels to fish in British waters would be ended under proposals for a new fishing law. Matt Carthy, a Sinn Fein, says much work remains to be done to in the trade talks. He says Sinn Fein will protect Ireland\u2019s interests, which could be best served by Irish reunification. He says the Conservatives do not have a mandate to speak for any part of the island of Ireland. Antonia Maria Rinaldi, an Italian MEP from the rightwing League, says Michel Barnier has been the worst negotiator ever. Bill Newton Dunn, a Lib Dem MEP, says the main parties in Westminster have not told the public the truth about the country. The truth is that the UK is a European country, not a superpower. He says some UK politicians claimed the EU was only about free trade. But it was not, he says. It was always about more than that. He ends by calling for the establishment of a European FBI. The vice president of the parliament chairing this afternoon\u2019s session Mairead McGuinness, not Martina Anderson, as I wrongly stated earlier. I\u2019m sorry about that. Geoffrey Van Orden, the leader of Conservative MEPs, says it is in the interests of both sides to get a good trade deal. After Brexit the UK will still be a leading power in Europe. He says he wants the UK and the EU to have friendly relationship. He ends by thanking European parliament staff. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Jill Evans says, despite her best efforts, she has failed to get Welsh accepted as an official language in the parliament. She addresses MEPs in Welsh for a bit. Returning to English, she says the UK is leaving now. \u201cBut we will be back,\u201d she says. Caroline Voaden, leader of the Lib Dems in the European parliament, says Brexit is the result of a divide in one of the UK\u2019s older political parties. The Conservatives should have split years ago, she says, but could not because of the political system. One advantage of Brexit is that it might focus attention on the system\u2019s flaws. Labour\u2019s Richard Corbett says more than half of voters at the UK general election voted for parties promising a second referendum on Brexit. He predicts that public opinion will continue to move against Brexit. And he says the catchphrase in British public opinion next year will be \u201cBrexit isn\u2019t working.\u201d Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is speaking now. He says he is not particularly happy with the withdrawal agreement. But Boris Johnson has promised that there will be no level playing field, he claims. (Actually, it is more complicated than that. Ministers say they will not commit to remaining aligned with the EU. But they have refused to say to what extent they may decide to remain aligned voluntarily.) Farage says the EU has been very good at getting people to vote again. But the UK is too big to bully, he says. He says he became an outright opponent of the EU project. Both in Ukip, and the Brexit party, we love Europe. We just hate the European Union. He says the EU is not just undemocratic. It is anti-democratic. It is run by people who cannot be held to account by the electorate. He says the debate in the world is one between globalism and populism. He says populism is becoming popular. He says Brexit party MEPs will wave their flags. Farage and his Brexit party MEPs wave small union jacks. Mairead McGuinness, vice president of the parliament who is in the chair, asks them to put them away. (Waving flags is against the rule.) A few of them do three cheers. McGuinness tells the Brexit party MEPs to take their flags with them as they go. Some of them seem to be leaving now. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected this post because originally it named the vice president in the chair as Martina Anderson, not Mairead McGuinness. Martin Schirdewan, from the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, says the UK might not be the last country to leave the EU. He says the EU must put people first. Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP, says after the 1975 vote Eurosceptics in the UK accepted the decision to stay in the EU. But after Maastricht the mood changed. It became clear that the EU was turning into a quasi-state, with a flag and a president etc. If at any point the UK had been able to have a trade-only association, it would have stayed. He says if David Cameron had got any repatriation of power in February 2016, the UK would have stayed. The EU is \u201closing a bad tenant, but gaining a good neighbour\u201d, he says. Philippe Lamberts, co-head of the Green group in the parliament, says there is a reason why people have turned against the EU. It is because too many policies serve the interests of the few, not the many. The EU must fix this if it wants to avoid another Brexit, he says. It should ensure that all policies serve the interests of the vulnerable. And policies should respect nature too, he says. Nathalie Loiseau, a representative of the Renew group in the European parliament (and the former French Europe minister), is speaking now. She says she is speaking in English because she wants to address the British. She says they will be missed. The European parliament will ensure that citizens\u2019 rights are respected, she says. Addressing Brexiters, she says now they will have no one to blame but themselves. They won\u2019t be able to blame Brussels. But if they think Brexit will weaken the EU, they are wrong, she says. Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, head of the socialist group in the European parliament, is speaking now. She says, if the British people ever decide to return, the EU arms will always be open to them. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin Manfred Weber, head of the centre-right European People\u2019s party group, is speaking now. He says he regrets the fact Brexit is happening. He says it was the UK\u2019s decision to rule out an extension to the post-Brexit transition. He implies this is a mistake. We want to have the best agreement, not the quickest one. He also says that MEPs will not allow any cherry picking in the trade deal. Von der Leyen says she wants to achieve the best for young students who want to study abroad. She ends by quoting George Eliot. \u201cOnly in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love.\u201d We will always love you and we will never be far. Long live Europe. Von der Leyen says the EU is considering a zero tariff, zero quota free trade agrement. But for this to happen there must be a level playing field, she says. She says the EU will not expose its companies to unfair competition. She says the trade off is simple: the closer the UK stays to EU rules, the better the access to the single market will be. She says British car firms recently asked the UK government to stay aligned to EU rules. This is in both sides\u2019 interests, she says. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, is speaking now. She pays tribute to contribution made by Britons to the EU, in the commission and in the parliament. She says the EU will be vigilant in monitoring power-sharing in Northern Ireland. She says she wants to be very clear; she wants the EU and the UK to remain good friends and good partners. They have a lot in common, she says. They both believe climate change must be tackled as a matter of urgency. Verhofstadt says he has had hundreds of citizens from Britons wanting to stay in the EU. He says he is not sure what to say to them. But he says what the EU must do is ensure that when the UK returns to the EU, as he is sure it will, it must return to an effective union. He says: This vote is not an adieu. This vote is only, in my opinion, an au revoir. Verhofstadt says some people blame the EU because it did not offer enough to David Cameron in his renegotiation. But he says his view is that the Brexit process started many years ago, when it started offering countries opt-outs. He says that led to countries only accepting the advantages of the union, not the disadvantages too. Verhofstadt says MEPs have to consider the causes of Brexit. He says the UK voted for Brexit to get sovereignty. But it has to consider what sovereignty it will have if it has to plant Chinese telecommunications equipment all over the country. Verhofstadt says today is not a vote in favour of the principle of Brexit. It is a vote against a hard Brexit, and against a disorderly Brexit, he says. If he could vote on Brexit, he would vote against. He says what is happening is that \u201ca country that liberated us\u201d twice is leaving. MEPs in Brussels have finally started the debate on the EU withdrawal agreement. Originally the debate was meant to start at 2pm, but various other items came up first. Guy Verhofstadt, who has been the parliament\u2019s lead spokesman on Brexit, is speaking now. He says he wants to pay tribute to British MEPs - at last, the majorithy of them. They have broad wit, charm, intelligence - at least some of them, he says. And they have brought stubbornness too, he says. MEPs applaud. From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will chair a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee at 4.30pm, Downing Street said. In the European parliament the debate on the withdrawal agreement has not quite started yet. We\u2019ve had various procedural interventions first. The government has lost a legal challenge against high court rulings that it unlawfully discriminated against severely disabled people who were moved on to universal credit (UC), the Press Association reports. In a unanimous judgment, the court of appeal upheld two earlier rulings that people who previously received disability benefits had been less favourably treated as a result of moving on to the controversial benefits scheme. Two severely disabled men who had to apply for UC when they moved to a different local authority area won a declaration that they had been unlawfully discriminated against in June 2018. Here is Richard Burgon, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, has posted this on Twitter about President Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin The European parliament is now debating the EU withdrawal agreement. There is a live feed here. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has posted this on Twitter ahead of his speech. Rebecca Long-Bailey, another Labour leadership candidate, did not take part when there was a Commons vote on building a third runway at Heathrow in June 2018. But today she has posted this on Twitter, signalling her clear opposition to the plan. Sir Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry, the other three remaining leadership candidates, all voted against Heathrow expansion in 2018. Jess Phillips, who was in the contest before withdrawing last week, voted in favour. Sir Keir Starmer, another Labour leadership candidate, says he would only nominate people to sit in the House of Lords if they were prepared to sign a declaration promising to vote for its abolition. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary and Labour leadership candidate, has issued her own statement about President Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan. She says it is an abomination. Ian Murray, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, has received endorsements of sorts from both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Brown formally says is is backing Murray. The Blair statement does not go quite that far, although that may be an acknowledgement of the fact that, given Blair\u2019s standing with Labour party members (62% of them have an unfavourable view of him), a proper Blair endorsement would be a mixed blessing. This is from the Tony Blair Institute. And here is a statement from Brown. He said: It is a privilege to be patron of Scientists for Labour. I know Ian Murray to have been committed to and directly involved in supporting investment in science in our country, not least because of his association with Edinburgh University and in particular its science campus at King\u2019s Buildings. I think that as a candidate whom I support for the deputy leadership he can ensure that the next Labour manifesto will give the priority to science and innovation that scientists deserve and is the best way forward for our country. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has told reporters that the US is still considering whether or not to restrict intelligence sharing with the UK in the light of the Huawei decision. Speaking to reporters on his flight to the UK, he also suggested that Washington is still hoping that the UK might change its mind. These are from the Washington Post\u2019s John Hudson. This is what Pompeo said when asked about the prospect of Washington reducing intelligence sharing. He said: We\u2019ll have to see what they actually do and importantly how they implement what they\u2019ve laid out. We\u2019ve had a chance to review what they\u2019ve said about it, so for now we have to see what that means from an execution and implementation perspective. It\u2019s pretty complex. There is also a chance for the United Kingdom to relook at this as implementation moves forward. In the European parliament the debate on the withdrawal agreement has not started yet. MEPs are marking the Holocaust Remembrance Day first. MEPs are about to start debating the EU withdrawal agreement. There is a live feed here. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels Boris Johnson claimed that the Scottish government\u2019s plan for Edinburgh to be able to decide immigration policy for Scotland was \u201cfanciful and deranged\u201d. This is what he said when asked Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, asked about this at PMQs. Johnson said: I think the idea of having a Scottish-only visa with a border at Berwick and ... inspection posts, I think this is absolutely fanciful and deranged. Blackford replied: Nobody\u2019s suggesting such a thing and that just confirms the prime minister doesn\u2019t have a clue. Unlike the prime minister, experts back the Scottish government\u2019s proposals. The Scottish government\u2019s proposals will boost Scotland\u2019s population, grow our economy and protect public services. The UK\u2019s government\u2019s policies threaten to plunge our working age population into decline. We were told we would have the most powerful devolved parliament in the world, we were told we would be an equal partner in the family of nations. Will the prime minister now read the Scottish Government\u2019s proposal, listen to the evidence and deliver a tailored migration policy for Scotland? From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg UPDATE: Subsequently Downing Street said the decision would not come tomorrow. The Northern rail franchise is to be renationalised, the government has announced, with the state operator of last resort taking over the running of the struggling network from 1 March, my colleagues Gwyn Topham and Lucy Campbell report. Here are some lines from the post-PMQs briefing from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman. Boris Johnson\u2019s line at PMQs about the Scottish parliament not debating education for two years sounded very effective when he made it. (See 1.10pm.) But, according to the SNP\u2019s Ross Colquhoun, it wasn\u2019t quite true. Scotland has not broken apart from the UK yet, but the faultline seems to be getting bigger and in the Commons every week that crack is on display at PMQs. Boris Johnson seems to give more thought to countering Ian Blackford\u2019s arguments than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, and today he scored a good hit with a point about the Scottish parliament not debating education (where the SNP\u2019s record has been poor) for the last two years. But his jibe only served to highlight the fact that on the substance - Scotland being disadvantaged by not being able to set its own immigration policy, despite its immigration needs being quite different to England\u2019s - Blackford was right. The SNP case was strengthened by team discipline (various MPs making the same point). These were moments when Johnson faced forceful challenge. He is also facing an acute dilemma over HS2. At least three MPs asked about it, and he fobbed them off each time with a reply about the government announcement about HS2 being made very soon. But it was clear from the commotion in the Commons that Conservative MPs are split over this, and not afraid to say so. By contrast, Johnson is not facing much challenge at the moment from Corbyn. That is partly because Corbyn\u2019s own MPs are indifferent to what he is saying, and partly because Corbyn seems to have even less interest than he ever used to in mastering the theatrics of PMQs. That is not to say he wasn\u2019t talking sense; he was, and it was clear from listening to him that he is better informed about the Middle East and international human rights (a lifelong passion for him) than Johnson is (despite Johnson being a former foreign secretary). Corbyn was also right to expose the government announcement last week about no longer funding coal projects abroad with aid money as essentially cosmetic (because funding for oil and gas projects continues). But Caroline Lucas made this point with more passion and punch (see 12.21pm), and on the Middle East, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, Corbyn may have been right, but he did not inspire the house. That is not to say these issues aren\u2019t important; it is just that if you feel they are important, you should find a way of conveying that. It\u2019s not easy, but effective politics never is. UPDATE: The Johnson claim about the Scottish parliament and education may have sounded like an effective jibe, but the SNP has pointed out that it is not actually true. See 1.21pm. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, is making an announcement. He says he is setting up a new system. If he takes a decision against the strong advice of clerks, the clerk will have the right to place a copy of his advice in the Commons library. This system is modelled on the \u201cministerial direction\u201d system that allows civil servants, if they feel they are being ordered to go ahead with a spending plan that cannot be justified, to insist on being given a written \u201cministerial direction\u201d. It does not stop ministers doing what they want, but it serves as an incentive against rogue decision making. Hoyle\u2019s announcement is a response to the controversy generated by John Bercow when he over-ruled advice from his clerk, and effectively tore up the Commons rulebook, to allow a vote on an amendment opposed by Brexiters. Speaker announces plan to reduce prospect of officials\u2019 advice being ignored on procedural rulings. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s leader at Westminster, says many people are not happy about Brexit. Will Johnson meet Plaid Cymru to discuss Wales\u2019 prospects after Brexit. Johnson says he agrees on the need for unity, but Wales voted for Brexit. Johnson repeats the point about the HS2 announcement coming shortly. An MP asks if the BBC is a mortal enemy of the Conservative party, or a much-prized national institution. That is a reference to what Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, used to say about the BBC. Johnson says the BBC is a much-prized institution. It is not a mortal enemy, he says. The SNP\u2019s Richard Thomson asks if Johnson will commit to keeping the UK in the Erasmus+ student exchange programme after Brexit. Johnson says nothing in Brexit will stop students being able to pursue their hopes and dreams around the EU. Labour\u2019s Meg Hillier asks what Johnson is going to do now to ensure there are more GPs. She says just training more is not good enough, because that takes years. Johnson says the government is training 6,000 more GPs. The SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan asks Johnson if he agrees that protecting Scotland\u2019s care sector with tailor-made immigration policies are more important than his ideological obsession with cutting immigration. Johnson claims existing plans take into account Scotland\u2019s needs. The DUP\u2019s Gregory Campbell asks if Johnson backs plans for pensions for innocent victims of violence in Northern Ireland. Johnson says the principle that victims must not be to blame for what happened must be maintained in these negotiations. Andy Carter, a Conservative, asks if the government will hire more doctors. Johnson says it will. This is the party of delivery and decision and democracy, he says. Labour\u2019s Karl Turner says seafarers are expected to work for less than the minimum wage. Will Johnson meet MPs to discuss this? Johnson says he accepts this is a serious issue, and he is happy to take this up. He says the transport secretary will convene a meeting. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, asks Johnson if he agrees the government should avoid hypocrisy. She says the government is putting \u00a32bn into fossil fuel programmes abroad. Johnson says spending on climate change projects has been doubled, and the government is not spending a penny more on coal projects. The SNP\u2019s Angela Crawley says Scotland should have the power to decide its own immigration policy. Johnson says he has the highest respect for Scotland and its people. But he has less respect for the SNP, he says. Johnson says the government is considering whether and how to proceed with HS2. An announcement will be made \u201cvery shortly\u201d. Labour\u2019s Sarah Champion asks if Johnson will make paying for sex illegal. Johnson says he is willing to look at this idea. Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative, says in Yorkshire Brexiters will be celebrating Brexit on Friday. Johnson says he wishes them well in at the Brexit bash. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, says Michael Gove once said Scotland would be able to decide its immigration policy after Brexit. On Monday the Scottish government published immigration plans. He asks Johnson why he objects to model three in the plan. Johnson says the idea of having a Scotland-only visa is \u201cfanciful\u201d. Whatever the document says on the page Blackford referred it, it won\u2019t say who would pay for it, he says. Blackford says the Scottish plans have wide support. They would boost Scotland\u2019s population, improve its economy and protect public services. Scotland was told it would be an equal partner. Will Johnson accept this plan? Johnson says his points-based immigration system will help the whole of the UK. He says the Scottish parliament has not had a debate on education for two years. Yet today it is debating flying the EU flag, he says. Sally-Ann Hart, a Conservative, asks for an asssurance that Hastings and Rye, her constituency, will not be overlooked in the PM\u2019s levelling up programme. Johnson says Hastings will benefit from the government\u2019s infrastructure programme. Corbyn says 100,000 people died in Yemen last year alone. When the PM goes to Saudia Arabia later this year, will he make it clear that any trade deal will be dependent on improvements in human rights? Johnson says Corbyn is a supporter of the Iranian regime, which has exacerbated the situation in Yemen he claims. He says the government will continue to support human rights. Corbyn says he has defended human rights around the world, including in Iran and Russia. He says prisoners in Saudia Arabia are being tortured. Britain is at a crossroads, he says. He says the signs are that Johnson wants to sell out this country, and the NHS, in a trade deal with President Trump. When will Johnson stand up for the fight against climate change, and promote peace? Johnson says Corbyn stood up for Tehran, and for President Putin when he poisoned people in Britain. Corbyn wants to abolish the armed forces, he says. And he does not support Nato, he says. He says his government is standing up for efforts to educate girls around the world. Corbyn says Johnson voted against action on climate change on every occasion before be became PM. He says President Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan is not a peace plan. When Johnson meets Mike Pompeo, will he call for a genuine peace plan? Johnson says this problem has bedevilled the world for years. He says this plan is a genuine peace plan, and it could lead to a two-state solution. Corbyn says he has met Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinian authority many times. He asks if Johnson will stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia while the crisis in Yemen continues. Johnson says Corbyn should be supporting the British negotiator trying to bring both sides together. Jeremy Corbyn starts with a tribute to a solider who died this week, and to Nicholas Parsons. He says COP26 will be one of the biggest tests for the UK after Brexit. Should the UK be financing oil and gas projects across the world? Johnson says the UK will continue to compaign against carbon emissions around the world. The government has just banned the use of aid money for coal projects. Corbyn says the government is still financing other carbon projects. The government is currently on track to meet the net zero carbon target by 2099, he says. Johnson says the UK has reduced CO2 emissions by 42%, while the economy has grown. Johnson says he wants to assure people that the UK will have the access to the best technology available. But it won\u2019t do anything to imperil intelligence cooperation with the US either. The SNP\u2019s Carol Monaghan says the UK was a beacon of hope during the second world war for Jews. But when the government rejected the Dubs amendment, the beacon dimmed. Will the government devolve power over immigration to Scotland? Boris Johnson says the UK can be proud of its record on refugees. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Boris Johnson is due to hold another \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook this afternoon at 5pm. For a taste of what to expect, it is worth watching this video he posted on Twitter yesterday. Newsnight\u2019s Lewis Goodall posted a good thread on Twitter factchecking Johnson\u2019s comments. It starts here. As British MEPs arrived in the European parliament in Brussels this morning, they were greeted by a sign above the chamber could be seen reading: \u201cIt\u2019s not goodbye, it\u2019s au revoir.\u201d As the Press Association reports, the message had been put up by the S&amp;D, a coalition of socialist parties. Here are the main points from Lisa Nandy\u2019s LBC phone-in. Nandy said Twitter had created \u201creal problems\u201d for the left because it gave activists a misleading view of what the public thought. She said that she had taken Twitter off her phone. She explained: I\u2019ve taken it off my phone, which means I\u2019m slightly clueless about some of the things that people keep asking me about in the Westminster bubble. But it is a lovely place to be [ie, off Twitter]. To be honest, if you start thinking that all of that is real [ie, Twitter], that\u2019s where you get into real problems. And that has been a bit of a problem for the left in recent years. We spent a lot of time in this sort of hothouse of social media, particularly Twitter, when most of the country, if they are on social media, seem to be on Facebook. And we talk among ourselves. And we think that we are doing well when we\u2019re not. And we think we\u2019re doing badly when we\u2019re not. And we just haven\u2019t learnt how to understand the public. And we should be out there amongst the public if we really want to understand what\u2019s happening. She said that the government\u2019s support for President Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. She said that, as someone who had been vice chair and then chair of Labour Friends of Palestine, she was \u201chorrified\u201d by the plan because it could end any prospect of a two-state solution. Referring to a Foreign Office statement describing the plan as \u201ca serious proposal\u201d, she said that was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. She went on: As the UK government, we have a history in the Middle East, we had a role to play in creating these problems in the first place. And to not stand up now, when we can see the implications of what the Trump administration is doing, is really, really disgraceful. Britain has got to find its voice again. Q: People are calling Nandy blue Labour. Why is that? Nandy says the only time she has rebelled recently in the Commons was when the party was backing tax cuts for the wealthy. So in that regard she is to the left of Jeremy Corbyn, she says. Q: What is your view of Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan? Nandy says she is \u201chorrified\u201d by it. It closes of any hope of a two-state solution, she says. She says that is bad for Israel. She says Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said the Trump plan should be taken seriously. \u201cThat is disgraceful,\u201d she says. And that\u2019s it. The phone-in is over. Q: Which part of the party does the rancour come from most? Nandy says she has friends in every part of the Labour party. It is family to her. There are people in parliament she is good friends with, despite not agreeing with them much on policy. Q: Can you get Momentum and centrists dads to march alongside each other? Yes, says Nandy. She says the two groups did work together during the election campaign. She says if people in the Labour party are \u201cjust anti\u201d, that will kill the Labour party. Q: I find your comment about Catalonia offensive. Why did you say what you said? Nandy says she did not say that the Spanish government was taking the right approach to Catalonia, as the caller claims. She says her words were wilfully distorted by the SNP. She says the point she was making was that Labour had not been able to counter arguments made by Scottish nationalists. She says she was talking about the peaceful struggle for social justice in Catalonia. Of course she was not defending the police treatment of separatists in Catalonia, she says. She says her remark was distorted by the SNP. The SNP have done this over and over again, she says. They exploit the politics of grievance. She claims that that is because the SNP do not want to talk about her record. O\u2019Brien asks the caller where he got the idea that Nandy had endorsed violence. He says he cannot see how anyone got that idea from what she said in her Andrew Neil interview, unless they were told that by the SNP. The caller says he is not claiming that Nandy endorsed violence. Nandy says Labour supported the idea of having a Brexit referendum. But it had not made the case for EU membership before the campaign began. The campaign was lost before it started, she says. The FT\u2019s Jim Pickard has tweeted these about his Labour story. (See 10.13am.) And here\u2019s an extract from his story (paywall). Labour\u2019s official report into its worst electoral defeat for 80 years has exonerated leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying it would be \u201cunrealistic\u201d not to blame the result on Brexit. The report was written by election co-ordinators Andrew Gwynne and Ian Lavery and was circulated on Tuesday at a meeting of Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC). The document concluded there was \u201cno easy way for Labour to address the Brexit issue\u201d given how it divided voters, according to party officials who have seen it. The authors briefly considered the possibility that Mr Corbyn\u2019s leadership and radical manifesto could have played a role in the epic defeat. But they said this was not the case, arguing neither had been a problem in the 2017 general election, when the party made large electoral gains. \u201cIt is unlikely that radicalism per se was the problem in a country looking for change,\u201d the report said. Mr Corbyn, far from being a weak or divisive leader, was instead the victim of four years of unrelenting attacks on his character, they wrote. This was an \u201cassault without precedent in modern politics\u201d, they said. Q: Jim Pickard in the FT today says the Labour report into the election says Jeremy Corbyn can be exonerated for what happened. Do you agree? Nandy says no one can be exonerated for what happened. Lisa Nandy, a Labour leadership candidate, is holding a phone-in on LBC now. James O\u2019Brien is presenting. Nandy says she has not been planning this for years. She did not want to be Labour leader from the age of nine. And she has not been planning a bid for the last two years. But she did enter the contest to win, she says. She says she is not here just to broaden the debate. You can do that as an MP. Q: Why did Labour lose? Nandy says the two factors mentioned most were Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn. But, beyond that, there are other reasons why Labour has been losing working class support for years. Q: But why did people feel that the Conservative party instead? Nandy says the \u201cnastiness and divisions and infighting\u201d did not help. But she says most people are not on Twitter. Q: And you are off it now? Nandy says she has taken if off her phone. She says that is lovely. She says she thinks Twitter has become a problem for the left, because it gives a misleading view of what people think. She says it is not even representative of social media, because there are more people on Facebook. Nandy says Twitter has become a problem for the left, because it gives activists a misleading view of what people think. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has been holding a press conference in Brussels. Here are some of the highlights, from my colleague Jennifer Rankin, the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp, LBC\u2019s Christian Mitchell and Sky\u2019s Adam Parsons. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, will attend his last debate in the European parliament as an MEP this afternoon. He has been a member of the parliament since 1999. In an interview on the Today programme this morning he made two valedictory claims - both of which are highly questionable. Farage claimed that Brexit would mark the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d for the EU. He said: I think, two years down the road, there\u2019ll be a big debate going on in many other countries about what kind of Europe do people want. Do they want a Europe of trading co-operation or a Europe run by these institutions in Brussels, and I think the UK\u2019s departure really will mark the beginning of the end of this European project. This claim is dubious because polling evidence suggests that support for EU membership remains very high - it\u2019s over 80% in most member states - and that pro-EU sentiment on the continent has actually gone up since the UK voted to leave in 2016. In a recent speech in London Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said Brexit had strengthened unity amongst the EU27. She said: One consequence of the Brexit vote has been to strengthen the unity and the faith in Europe as a project for the common good. The truth is that Brexit has highlighted the value of being together in today\u2019s ever more unsettled world. When Farage was asked in his interview about polling showing that support for EU membership had risen across Europe since Brexit, he said that was just because people had seen the UK \u201cmake such a Horlicks\u201d of leaving. Farage claimed the UK would get a good trade deal from the UK because it was in \u201can enormously powerful position\u201d. He said: I think we\u2019re in an enormously powerful position. There is now genuine fear in this building I\u2019m in this morning [Farage was speaking to Today from Brussels] about Brexit and here\u2019s what the fear is, particularly coming from the Germans - they\u2019re very scared that we will become more competitive than they are. The whole single market is based on this premise of a level playing field - it is actually anti-competitive by its very nature, and I think that is a very strong card for us to play because, after all, we still buy an awful lot of German motor cars. I think the truth of it is, if we negotiate tough in this next round, we will come out at the end of the year with something pretty reasonable. This is just the latest iteration of the long-running claim that pressure from German BMW manufacturers and Italian Prosecco producers will ensure the EU offers the UK easy access to the single market after Brexit. So far it has turned out to be a poor guide to EU negotiating behaviour because EU leaders have been more interested in protecting the integrity of the single market than in featherbedding BMW. In an interview broadcast on Monday Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM) said he thought the UK was in a relatively weak position in the trade talks in comparison with the EU. Brexit is getting closer and closer, and now the instrument of ratification - the document that legally formalises the UK\u2019s withdrawal - has been signed and deposited with the EU. Here is Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, signing it. And here is Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU, handing it in. Boris Johnson is now facing the threat of his first Commons rebellion since the general election, over his decision to let the Chinese firm Huawei play a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. Conservative MPs expressed their concerns in the Commons yesterday and, although they were not quite as outspoken as some were when the same topic was discussed on Monday, talk of a revolt is firming up. The government announced yesterday that it plans to legislate to ensure that \u201chigh risk vendors\u201d (ie, Huawei) can only run 35% of the 5G network. Legislation means votes, and voting means backbenchers have leverage (because the main opposition parties, Labour and the SNP, are also very critical of this decision on national security grounds). On Newsnight last night Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader, said that there would have to be \u201cmodification\u201d to the government\u2019s plans and that the 35% threshold was too high. And on the Today programme this morning Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, also said that he wanted to see the 35% figure driven down in a future vote. Asked how much support the rebels might have from Tory backbenchers for such a plan, he said: Well, one of the things that that frankly surprised me was the breadth of the opposition to the current stance of the government on the Conservative back benches. We don\u2019t know yet, when push comes to shove and votes happen, how many people will actually put their heads above the parapet. But certainly it\u2019s very widespread. The government has a majority of 80, and Green conceded that that meant roughly 40 MPs would need to rebel for the government to be at risk of defeat. But he did not rule this out. There did appear to be very widespread opposition from members old and new, on the left and right of the party, so there\u2019s there was very widespread, strong unease about the way the government is going on this. Green\u2019s intervention confirmed the very point he was making. While Duncan Smith is on the right of the party, Green himself is firmly on the Tory left. New MPs may be more reluctant to rebel than old ones, of course, and the government could make concessions over the 35% target to appease its critics, but it can\u2019t go too far without driving Huawei out of the 5G market, which would defeat the point of the announcement made yesterday. This is definitely one for the chief whip\u2019s \u201cproblems\u201d folder. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Lisa Nandy, a candidate for the Labour leadership, holds a phone-in on LBC. 10am: MPs start voting in elections for select committee chairs. The ballot closes at 4pm, and the results will be announced at some point after that. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2pm (UK time): MEPs debate the EU withdrawal agreement. The vote will come at 5pm. 2pm: The National Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Organisations (NFFO) and the Scottish Fishermen\u2019s Federation hold an event in parliament to lobby MPs. Around 5pm: Johnson is expected to hold a \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook. Afternoon: Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, arrives in London for talks with Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, today, and with Johnson tomorrow. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

The group will shut 31 Lloyds, 10 Halifax and 15 Bank of Scotland branches between April and October this year. Many of the big banks have been slashing their networks on the grounds that customers are spurning traditional branch counter service in favour of doing their banking online and via mobile phones. However, the consumer organisation Which? said: \u201cThe loss of yet more branches to an already devastated network will hit communities across the UK hard, as there is still a clear demand for access to traditional banking services and cash.\u201d It is understood the Lloyds group has closed a net 655 branches since 2010. A bank spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to having the largest branch network in the UK and, in addition to our branches, all our customers can also use the Post Office to access their banking locally, alongside our mobile branches which visit many rural communities.\u201d The bank said the latest cuts were in response to \u201cchanging customer behaviours and the reduced number of transactions being made in branches\u201d. The bank said it would aim to avoid compulsory redundancies by seeking redeployment in the first instance and then offering voluntary redundancy. In recent years, Lloyds Banking Group has been reorganising its branch network. It has shrunk some of its existing high street outlets and turned them into \u201cmicro-branches\u201d that do not have traditional counters. At the same it has unveiled large flagship branches with facilities such as an in-house coffee shop and dedicated business hub.",

      "body": "<p>As ever the excellent John Harris provides much food for thought about the challenge ahead for the Labour party to regain power (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/labour-party-leadership-keir-starmer-rebecca-long-bailey\" title=\"\">Labour is stuck in the past. Its rivals have sped on to the future</a>, 27 January). I\u2019m not sure the Tories are speeding into the future by regressing back to a 19th-century nation state in an era of transnational blocs, but he is right to point to the difficulty to persuade lost Labour voters about the positive role of the state, especially after 10 years of austerity which has severely reduced the role of local government and particularly in the depressed towns that turned from red to blue last December.</p> <p>During canvassing in the general election I observed that talk of inequality did not cut it with voters on the doorstep. However, talking about fairness does get through and can provide a narrative to engage our lost voters. New Labour believed in the enabling state through the creation of Sure Start, investment in education and spending on the NHS in line with the European average.</p> <p>This narrative needs to be rediscovered in the 2020s by spelling out in more detail how investment in education can improve the skills and prospects for young people and attract high-skill employers to the post-industrial towns. How reinvesting in local community services with input from local people can give communities a better sense of place, and how investing in housing and a green new deal can enable people to feel more optimistic about the future. Beyond Brexit, Boris Johnson offers crumbs to the new Conservative voters who left Labour. Now is the opportunity to win them back, but more listening and new thinking is needed.<br><strong>Steve Flatley</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto sought to address the huge challenges facing the country following the faltering recovery from the 2008 economic crisis, the 10 years of austerity imposed by the Tories and the Lib Dems, and the existential threat of climate change.</p> <p>John Harris implies that Labour is clinging on to some old remedies for modern problems. However, the manifesto shows not only that the plans were designed to address these challenges, but included a shift from top-down state initiatives to a combination of much-needed investment through national and regional investment banks and involvement of local initiatives. The manifesto said: \u201cAs well as large-scale national and regional projects, smaller loans will be available through our new Post Bank based in Post Office branches, enabling thousands of bottom-up transformational changes by startups, small businesses, local cooperatives and community projects in towns and villages up and down the country.\u201d</p> <p>These plans were developed through wide consultation and endorsed by many economists. They were considered in detail in the book Economics for the Many, published in 2018. It is difficult to see how any of the proposals in this book or in the Manifesto are \u201cstuck in the past\u201d. To suggest Johnson, by comparison, is \u201cspeeding into the future\u201d is nothing short of bizarre.<br><strong>Prof Nick Spencer</strong><br><em>Leamington Spa, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 While I agree with much of John\u2019s interesting and perceptive article, it should be remembered that Labour has been soundly beaten by a party which has almost none of the features suggested as improvements for Labour. The Conservative party has been responsible for most of the ills visited on the very people who have now given it a majority, with few links to the wider community, especially in \u201cred wall\u201d towns, and it is led by an out-of-touch, old Etonian, Bullingdon boy who probably had to be shown where Stoke-on-Trent is on a map.</p> <p>If this is what John means by Labour\u2019s adversaries \u201cspeeding on to the future\u201d then it is a future where avoiding scrutiny, dog-whistling, overt racism and lying is electorally rewarded. While, obviously, Labour has made a huge number of errors, the mendacity and manipulations of the political and media campaign it has had to face over the last few years should not be discounted. <br><strong>Dr Paul Cope</strong><br><em>Halesworth, Suffolk </em></p> <p>\u2022 It may well be true that the Labour party is harking back to earlier times, but the Conservative party of today is hardly a beacon of modernity. Once again, as in the early part of the last century, there is a preponderance of rich, over-privileged men who have had an expensive private education and regard running the country as a pastime for their middle years rather than a heavy responsibility. Not exactly \u201cspeeding on to the future\u201d. <br><strong>Cherry Weston</strong><br><em>Wolverhampton</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris\u2019s analysis of the changes Labour should make to win an election contains a couple of obvious flaws. </p> <p>Harris says that in \u201cthe internet age \u2026 people now have a voice, and don\u2019t like being told what to do, or who to be\u201d. He implies this is bad for Labour, but a majority of the \u201conline generation\u201d (over 50% of the under-30s) voted for Jeremy Corbyn. Harris also dismisses \u201cselling the idea of big government\u201d to an electorate sick of \u201can unresponsive public sector\u201d, but he doesn\u2019t explain that a decade of Tory austerity is overwhelmingly to blame for destroying decent levels of services.</p> <p>More seriously, Harris completely omits to mention the media\u2019s role in Labour\u2019s defeat. The Loughborough University independent news audit already makes it clear that, after the close-run elections of 2017, the press wasn\u2019t going to take any more chances \u2013 with editorial negativity towards Labour in 2019 doubling from the previous election. Harris needs to step down off his journalistic high horse and get more personally involved in backing whoever is the next Labour leader.<br><strong>Joe McCarthy</strong><br><em>Dublin, Ireland</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "As ever the excellent John Harris provides much food for thought about the challenge ahead for the Labour party to regain power (Labour is stuck in the past. Its rivals have sped on to the future, 27 January). I\u2019m not sure the Tories are speeding into the future by regressing back to a 19th-century nation state in an era of transnational blocs, but he is right to point to the difficulty to persuade lost Labour voters about the positive role of the state, especially after 10 years of austerity which has severely reduced the role of local government and particularly in the depressed towns that turned from red to blue last December. During canvassing in the general election I observed that talk of inequality did not cut it with voters on the doorstep. However, talking about fairness does get through and can provide a narrative to engage our lost voters. New Labour believed in the enabling state through the creation of Sure Start, investment in education and spending on the NHS in line with the European average. This narrative needs to be rediscovered in the 2020s by spelling out in more detail how investment in education can improve the skills and prospects for young people and attract high-skill employers to the post-industrial towns. How reinvesting in local community services with input from local people can give communities a better sense of place, and how investing in housing and a green new deal can enable people to feel more optimistic about the future. Beyond Brexit, Boris Johnson offers crumbs to the new Conservative voters who left Labour. Now is the opportunity to win them back, but more listening and new thinking is needed. Steve Flatley York \u2022 Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto sought to address the huge challenges facing the country following the faltering recovery from the 2008 economic crisis, the 10 years of austerity imposed by the Tories and the Lib Dems, and the existential threat of climate change. John Harris implies that Labour is clinging on to some old remedies for modern problems. However, the manifesto shows not only that the plans were designed to address these challenges, but included a shift from top-down state initiatives to a combination of much-needed investment through national and regional investment banks and involvement of local initiatives. The manifesto said: \u201cAs well as large-scale national and regional projects, smaller loans will be available through our new Post Bank based in Post Office branches, enabling thousands of bottom-up transformational changes by startups, small businesses, local cooperatives and community projects in towns and villages up and down the country.\u201d These plans were developed through wide consultation and endorsed by many economists. They were considered in detail in the book Economics for the Many, published in 2018. It is difficult to see how any of the proposals in this book or in the Manifesto are \u201cstuck in the past\u201d. To suggest Johnson, by comparison, is \u201cspeeding into the future\u201d is nothing short of bizarre. Prof Nick Spencer Leamington Spa, Warwickshire \u2022 While I agree with much of John\u2019s interesting and perceptive article, it should be remembered that Labour has been soundly beaten by a party which has almost none of the features suggested as improvements for Labour. The Conservative party has been responsible for most of the ills visited on the very people who have now given it a majority, with few links to the wider community, especially in \u201cred wall\u201d towns, and it is led by an out-of-touch, old Etonian, Bullingdon boy who probably had to be shown where Stoke-on-Trent is on a map. If this is what John means by Labour\u2019s adversaries \u201cspeeding on to the future\u201d then it is a future where avoiding scrutiny, dog-whistling, overt racism and lying is electorally rewarded. While, obviously, Labour has made a huge number of errors, the mendacity and manipulations of the political and media campaign it has had to face over the last few years should not be discounted. Dr Paul Cope Halesworth, Suffolk \u2022 It may well be true that the Labour party is harking back to earlier times, but the Conservative party of today is hardly a beacon of modernity. Once again, as in the early part of the last century, there is a preponderance of rich, over-privileged men who have had an expensive private education and regard running the country as a pastime for their middle years rather than a heavy responsibility. Not exactly \u201cspeeding on to the future\u201d. Cherry Weston Wolverhampton \u2022 John Harris\u2019s analysis of the changes Labour should make to win an election contains a couple of obvious flaws. Harris says that in \u201cthe internet age \u2026 people now have a voice, and don\u2019t like being told what to do, or who to be\u201d. He implies this is bad for Labour, but a majority of the \u201conline generation\u201d (over 50% of the under-30s) voted for Jeremy Corbyn. Harris also dismisses \u201cselling the idea of big government\u201d to an electorate sick of \u201can unresponsive public sector\u201d, but he doesn\u2019t explain that a decade of Tory austerity is overwhelmingly to blame for destroying decent levels of services. More seriously, Harris completely omits to mention the media\u2019s role in Labour\u2019s defeat. The Loughborough University independent news audit already makes it clear that, after the close-run elections of 2017, the press wasn\u2019t going to take any more chances \u2013 with editorial negativity towards Labour in 2019 doubling from the previous election. Harris needs to step down off his journalistic high horse and get more personally involved in backing whoever is the next Labour leader.

      "bodyText": "Lecturers, librarians, technicians and other academic staff at 74 UK universities could walk out on strike this term after a series of re-ballots, as their dispute over pensions, pay and conditions continues. More than 40,000 staff at 60 universities went out on strike for eight days late last year in pursuit of their demands, with the threat of further industrial action in the new year. Staff at a further 14 universities have now voted in favour of industrial action after being re-balloted by the University and College Union (UCU), taking the total number of institutions up to 74. The results of the re-ballot, announced on Wednesday, will be a significant boost to the UCU, particularly as the 14 institutions include influential players such as King\u2019s College London and Imperial College London. Union leaders are due to meet on Thursday to discuss the re-ballots and next steps in the dispute, which centres on changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) as well as demands over pay, equality, casualisation and workloads. Talks have been under way between the parties. The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: \u201cWe have been clear from the outset that we are prepared to take serious and sustained action to defend pay and conditions, as well as our pensions, and these latest ballot results show that members are just as determined as ever.\u201d The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which is representing employers in the dispute over pay and conditions, made a new offer on Tuesday evening, which Grady described as \u201ca big step forward\u201d though it was still some distance from fulfilling all the UCU\u2019s demands. In the latest ballots, which required a 50% turnout to reach the legal threshold, 80% of members backed strikes over pensions, while 76% voted for strike action over pay and conditions. The latest universities to vote in favour of industrial action also include Bath Spa, Birkbeck, Keele, the Royal College of Art, Huddersfield, Winchester, East London, Leeds Trinity, the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), De Montfort and the University of the Arts London. Members at Birkbeck and Soas backed action in both disputes; a further nine universities supported strikes over pay and conditions and three more institutions back action over pensions. Responding to the results, a spokesperson for Universities UK, which represents USS employers in the dispute, said there had been good progress in pension talks, which were due to continue until at least March. \u201cWhile we understand that some additional UCU branches have now backed industrial action following re-ballots, we hope that further strikes can be avoided and that our constructive discussions on the future of the scheme can continue.\u201d A UCEA spokesperson said employers hoped their latest proposals would be seen as a positive outcome by UCU members so that all parties could move constructively on to the imminent 2020-21 pay negotiating round. About a million students were affected by the industrial action in November and December last year, with lectures and seminars cancelled. Many came out in support of their lecturers and other university staff on picket lines and there were a number of student occupations of university buildings.",

Rising columns of plasma, superheated to almost 6,000C (10,800F), show up as bright spots at the centre of each grain \u2013 epicentres for the violent release of heat from the sun\u2019s interior to its surface. As the plasma cools, it descends back below the surface via narrow, shadowy channels between neighbouring granules.</p> \n<p>This intricate level of detail will help improve understanding of the sun\u2019s behaviour and allow its activity cycle to be predicted more accurately.</p> \n<p>The US National Solar Observatory\u2019s $344m (\u00a3265m) telescope features a four-metre mirror \u2013 the world\u2019s largest for a solar telescope \u2013 and is located at the 3,000-metre (10,000ft) summit of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano on the island of Maui.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b321f7ea41a562047588e6b56b504d2d285e6f9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b321f7ea41a562047588e6b56b504d2d285e6f9/0_0_1440_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the sun released by NASA\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The full image</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NSO/AURA/NSF</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Valentin Pillet, the director of the National Solar Observatory, described the telescope, which had been under construction since 2013, as a \u201cformidable technological achievement\u201d. A major challenge was maintaining the telescope\u2019s primary mirror at ambient temperature while it looked directly at the sun \u2013 any temperature deviation causes air turbulence that could ruin the image quality. The heat is intense enough to rapidly melt metal at the mirror\u2019s focal point.</p> \n<p>Each night, a swimming pool\u2019s worth of ice is emptied into eight tanks. During the day, coolant is routed through the ice tanks and distributed through the observatory by 7.5 miles (12km) of piping. More than 100 air jets are also positioned behind the main mirror.</p> \n<p>Incoming light from the sun is deflected from the primary mirror into a chamber of mirrors that sits below the observatory\u2019s dome. Here, the light is bounced from mirror to mirror as it is apportioned between spectrometers, polarimeters and other various other instruments. The observatory\u2019s full suite of instruments, which will allow scientists to measure the magnetic field from the sun\u2019s surface up to its outer atmosphere, will come online later this year.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe bright features [in the image] \u2026 are the foothills of magnetic fields that extend all the way up into the corona and beyond,\u201d said Rimmele. \u201cWith the additional instruments that will come online in the next six months, we will be able to measure the magnetic fields from the surface all the way up to 1.5 solar radii.\u201d</p> \n<p>The observations could help resolve longstanding mysteries of the sun, including the counterintuitive feature that the corona \u2013 the sun\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 is heated to millions of degrees when its surface is only 6,000C. Understanding the physics of solar flares and coronal mass ejections could also significantly improve the ability to predict space weather, which can render GPS systems unreliable, take down power grids and knock out communication channels.</p> \n<p>The release of the images comes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/04/nasas-parker-solar-probe-beams-back-first-insights-from-suns-edge\">Nasa\u2019s Parker </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/04/nasas-parker-solar-probe-beams-back-first-insights-from-suns-edge\">solar </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/04/nasas-parker-solar-probe-beams-back-first-insights-from-suns-edge\">probe</a> makes observations from the edge of the sun\u2019s atmosphere, and before the launch of the Solar Orbiter mission, a European Space Agency-Nasa collaboration, next week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The sun\u2019s turbulent surface has been revealed in unprecedented detail in the first observations by the Inouye solar telescope in Hawaii. The striking images reveal a surprising level of structure hidden within the churning plasma exterior, bringing a previously hazy impression of the sun\u2019s patchwork surface sharply into focus for the first time. \u201cThese are the highest resolution images of the solar surface ever taken,\u201d said Thomas Rimmele, the director of the Inouye solar telescope project. \u201cWhat we previously thought looked like a bright point \u2013 one structure \u2013 is now breaking down into many smaller structures.\u201d The telescope\u2019s 30km resolution is more than twice that of the next best solar observatories. The images reveal the sun\u2019s surface to be speckled with granular structures, like nuggets of gold, each about the size of France. Rising columns of plasma, superheated to almost 6,000C (10,800F), show up as bright spots at the centre of each grain \u2013 epicentres for the violent release of heat from the sun\u2019s interior to its surface. As the plasma cools, it descends back below the surface via narrow, shadowy channels between neighbouring granules. This intricate level of detail will help improve understanding of the sun\u2019s behaviour and allow its activity cycle to be predicted more accurately. The US National Solar Observatory\u2019s $344m (\u00a3265m) telescope features a four-metre mirror \u2013 the world\u2019s largest for a solar telescope \u2013 and is located at the 3,000-metre (10,000ft) summit of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano on the island of Maui. Valentin Pillet, the director of the National Solar Observatory, described the telescope, which had been under construction since 2013, as a \u201cformidable technological achievement\u201d. A major challenge was maintaining the telescope\u2019s primary mirror at ambient temperature while it looked directly at the sun \u2013 any temperature deviation causes air turbulence that could ruin the image quality. The heat is intense enough to rapidly melt metal at the mirror\u2019s focal point. Each night, a swimming pool\u2019s worth of ice is emptied into eight tanks. During the day, coolant is routed through the ice tanks and distributed through the observatory by 7.5 miles (12km) of piping. More than 100 air jets are also positioned behind the main mirror. Incoming light from the sun is deflected from the primary mirror into a chamber of mirrors that sits below the observatory\u2019s dome. Here, the light is bounced from mirror to mirror as it is apportioned between spectrometers, polarimeters and other various other instruments. The observatory\u2019s full suite of instruments, which will allow scientists to measure the magnetic field from the sun\u2019s surface up to its outer atmosphere, will come online later this year. \u201cThe bright features [in the image] \u2026 are the foothills of magnetic fields that extend all the way up into the corona and beyond,\u201d said Rimmele. \u201cWith the additional instruments that will come online in the next six months, we will be able to measure the magnetic fields from the surface all the way up to 1.5 solar radii.\u201d The observations could help resolve longstanding mysteries of the sun, including the counterintuitive feature that the corona \u2013 the sun\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 is heated to millions of degrees when its surface is only 6,000C. Understanding the physics of solar flares and coronal mass ejections could also significantly improve the ability to predict space weather, which can render GPS systems unreliable, take down power grids and knock out communication channels. The release of the images comes as Nasa\u2019s Parker solar probe makes observations from the edge of the sun\u2019s atmosphere, and before the launch of the Solar Orbiter mission, a European Space Agency-Nasa collaboration, next week.",

There is a real boldness and sweep to this film, and a very disturbing long shot concerning Azaar\u2019s mother.",

      "bodyText": "The US has deployed its first low-yield Trident nuclear warhead on a submarine that is currently patrolling the Atlantic Ocean, it has been reported, in what arms control advocates warn is a dangerous step towards making a nuclear launch more likely. According to the Federation of American Scientists, the USS Tennessee \u2013 which left port in Georgia at the end of last year \u2013 is the first submarine to go on patrol armed with the W76-2 warhead, commissioned by Donald Trump two years ago. It has an explosive yield of five kilotons, a third of the power of the \u201cLittle Boy\u201d bomb dropped on Hiroshima and considerably lower than the 90- and 455-kiloton warheads on other US submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The Trump administration\u2019s nuclear posture review (NPR) in February 2018, portrays this warhead as a counter to a perceived Russian threat to use its own \u201ctactical\u201d nuclear weapons to win a quick victory on the battlefield. Advocates of W76-2 argued that the US had no effective deterrent against Russian tactical weapons because Moscow assumed Washington would not risk using the overwhelming power of its intercontinental ballistic missiles in response, for fear of escalating from a regional conflict to a civilian-destroying war. Critics of the warhead say it accelerates a drift towards thinking of nuclear weapons as a means to fight and win wars, rather than as purely a deterrent of last resort. And the fielding of a tactical nuclear weapon, they warn, gives US political and military leaders a dangerous new option in confronting adversaries other than Russia. Trump\u2019s NPR says the US could use nuclear weapons in response to \u201csignificant non-nuclear strategic attacks\u201d, including but not limited to \u201cattacks on US, allied or partner civilian population or infrastructure\u201d. The US Navy and Strategic Command did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at FAS, said the report on the arming of the USS Tennessee is based on briefings from officials. \u201cWe have had conversations with people inside, and they\u2019ve been pretty clear that this has happened,\u201d Kristensen said. \u201cThey see a need to talk about it to some extent, because if people don\u2019t know it\u2019s out there, then how can it deter?\u201d \u201cThis is a very rapid mind quick turnaround for a nuclear weapon, and that\u2019s obviously because it was a fairly simple adjustment of an existing warhead,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have argued that this is to deter Russia, but it also has clear implications or potential use against other adversaries, not least North Korea and Iran.\u201d Kristensen said: \u201cCertainly the low-yield collateral effect that would come from this weapon would be very beneficial to a military officer who was going to advise to the president whether we should cross the nuclear threshold.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Things have come a long way since 1999, when the actor Julia Roberts hit headlines globally for wearing a dress that exposed her unshaven armpits. These days, Gen Z pop stars, from Amandla Stenberg to Miley Cyrus, are regularly seen with body hair. Brands are cottoning on, too. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/48061083\" title=\"\">Nike</a> and <a href=\"https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/body-hair-in-adverts\" title=\"\">No7</a> ran advertisements with models showing body hair (underarms and upper lip respectively). Even the ubiquitous advert trope of a woman shaving an already shaven leg was challenged by the razor company Billie, which had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/billie-womens-razors-hair-ad-shaving\" title=\"\">marketing collateral that showed underarm, leg and pubic hair</a>.</p> <p>In real life, however, the sight of a woman in public with body hair remains rare, although norms are slowly changing (almost one in four women under 25 no longer shave their armpits, compared with just one in 20 in 2013, according to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/18/rise-young-women-going-au-naturel-nearly-quarter-now-dont-shave/\" title=\"\">the market analyst Mintel</a>).</p> <p>One campaign that is helping to continue this trend, and normalise body hair on women, is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/januhairy/\" title=\"\">Januhairy</a>, an initiative that encourages women to grow their body hair for the month of January and share images of themselves online. Started by students Laura Jackson and Ruby Jones in 2019, the campaign hashtag has now attracted thousands of posts from women across the world. As the end of this year\u2019s Januhairy approaches, we meet the movement\u2019s founders and others taking part to talk about how embracing their body hair has changed how they feel about themselves and their bodies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c15b5e753459cc6fe66548a8394ffcd0f988af93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c15b5e753459cc6fe66548a8394ffcd0f988af93/0_1_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Jackson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Jackson: \u2018Make sure you\u2019re making the choice for you.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/Januhairy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018When I see my body hair now, it reminds me of my love for myself\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Laura Jackson was a student at Exeter University when she first grew out her body hair. It was May 2018 and she was working on a one-woman stage show she had written and would perform in. \u201cIt was about the pressures put on women to abide by these beauty rules to feel accepted,\u201d she says. \u201cAs part of the show I grew out my body hair for the first time. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I didn\u2019t have that incentive.\u201d</p> <p>Girls are often introduced to depilatory products and techniques by relatives, borrowing razors and trying to imitate their mothers. Jackson recalls a conversation with her older sister: \u201cI was in the back of the car and she saw my hairy legs and said: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s time you start shaving.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She recalls a family holiday shortly after this, when she was in her early teens. \u201cI was with my mum and we were in our swimming costumes and I saw some pubic hairs poking out of her costume. I was so horrified. I thought: \u2018That is disgusting. How dare she not shave?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But for Jackson, growing out her body hair forced her to rethink her relationship to it. Soon she \u201cfelt liberated\u201d and wanted to embrace it. \u201cWhen I see my body hair now, it reminds me of my love for myself.\u201d</p> <p>She is keen to point out that Januhairy is not about shaming women who choose to remove body and facial hair. \u201cShave whenever you want to, but make sure you\u2019re making the choice for you,\u201d she says.\u201cWe have people who support Januhairy and shave, we have men who support us. It\u2019s not just about hair, it\u2019s about building a conversation around the subject.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018This movement has allowed me to reclaim what I was ashamed of as a kid\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Sonia, like many women of south-Asian heritage, has \u201cgrown up conscious of body hair my whole life\u201d. Darker hair is more visible and requires more work to achieve a hairless look.</p> <p>\u201cAnother beauty standard for south-Asian women is the focus on fair skin. I have black hair, so having dark body hair makes my skin look darker. Those two are linked. If you\u2019re fair, you\u2019re beautiful. Just look at Bollywood; all the actresses are fair.\u201d When she was younger, school friends and relatives would often point out her body hair, with comments or offers to remove it. \u201cEven as a baby I was really hairy,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople called me \u2018mouseling\u2019. My mum told me that my grandma performed a treatment on me using atta [a flour-and-water mix used to make chapattis] which she massaged all over my body and then removed to remove the hair. It would have been painful and I would have cried a lot, but it probably has removed a lot of the hair I would have had.</p> <p>\u201cAs a teenager I had really low self-esteem,\u201d she says. \u201cI would spend time at home looking in the mirror, noticing hair in different places, such as my belly. I remember that when I was in year 9 one of the boys asked if I was doing Movember. That hurt because he went out of his way to say it.\u201d</p> <p>This is Sonia\u2019s second year participating in Januhairy. \u201cI\u2019ve come to a point where I\u2019m so much more comfortable in my own skin and in my own natural state,\u201d she says, although she admits she still has her moments. \u201cAfter last year I still wasn\u2019t comfortable with my facial hair. I\u2019m still not, but I\u2019ve been trying to keep up with just growing it out. I found out that some of my boyfriend\u2019s housemates were making comments pitying my boyfriend and saying they feel sorry for him, which was extremely upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this, she says: \u201cThis movement has allowed me to reclaim what I was ashamed of as a kid.\u201d</p> <p>Part of that growing acceptance is the increasing circulation of alternative images of women that campaigns such as Januhairy have helped to encourage. \u201cLast year, most of the pictures were of underarms, but this year we\u2019re seeing pubic regions and chest hair and other parts of the body.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of beauty is something she has been grappling with, though. \u201cThe body hair images we see are often still quite glamorous. And I wonder why is it that for something to be accepted and normalised, it has to be glamorised and made to seem beautiful. But maybe movements like this reframe what is beautiful.\u201d She hopes that in the future women won\u2019t have to toil so much to feel good about themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f1e08d8e605bdeba9fb2a0e2ab738938f5c9f3d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1e08d8e605bdeba9fb2a0e2ab738938f5c9f3d6/0_0_1125_1124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Marchand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crystal Marchand: \u2018I carry the spirit of Januhairy with me throughout the whole year.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Veronique Desaulniers/Instagram/Januhairy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019ve become a lot more comfortable in my body through this process\u2019</strong></h2> <p>This is also Crystal Marchand\u2019s second Januhairy. \u201cThe first campaign made a major impression on me. Now I carry the spirit of Januhairy with me throughout the whole year.\u201d</p> <p>Marchand is a transgender woman living in Montreal. She regularly posts about her journey, \u201cto get visibility for the community and to try to inspire others\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t speak for the trans community,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all speak for ourselves \u2013 but I didn\u2019t see any other trans girls participating. I felt embraced by this campaign and I embraced it right back.\u201d Before her transition, she felt pressured not to remove her body hair to fit into a male world. Transitioning prompted her to think deeply about how she felt about the politics of body hair. \u201cI asked myself: \u2018What do I actually want? What is the social pressure? And do I care? Do I agree with it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For Marchand, as a trans woman, having visible body hair is something that has led to her being abused. \u201cI have been harassed online and in person; people would swear at me, people would call me really derogatory things. People would misgender me: I got taken for male, female, nonbinary, all in one day. So there\u2019s a social pressure to blend in. It can be dangerous. If I get misgendered too much, it can really mess with my moods and my self-image.\u201d</p> <p>Now, she says she has \u201cbecome a lot more comfortable in my body\u201d. Last year, on the last day of Januhairy, \u201cwhen my body hair was the longest and I had facial hair, I went to the community pool. I\u2019m a swimmer, I love to do laps. So I put on my first ever bikini.\u201d She describes the event as \u201canticlimactic \u2026 I just did my laps, came out, everything was fine. The point is, we\u2019re all the odd one out. We\u2019re all different.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the campaign appealed to me; it\u2019s not about saying I have to shave or not. It\u2019s just about becoming more comfortable with your body and to do it with all these other people in solidarity. Everybody\u2019s on their own unique quest and journey of self-discovery. And I think it\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s about self-worth and love\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Boo has been growing out her body hair for several years but this is her first year posting online as part of Januhairy. \u201cI\u2019m an energy healer, and my ethnic background is Indian and West Indian, so I have always been obsessed with tribal cultures.\u201d Her belief is that hair is an extension of the nervous system. \u201cIt\u2019s protecting us. It\u2019s baffling that we remove it.\u201d</p> <p>Boo says she was motivated by a realisation of how body hair removal is ingrained in society and how images circulated through media entrench this. \u201cI believe people will accept what\u2019s presented, but all you see through media and entertainment is one image telling people that\u2019s what they should adhere to,\u201d she says. That\u2019s why she was inspired to join Januhairy and send out alternative images.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying every woman shouldn\u2019t shave. I just want women to make informed decisions and ask themselves why they do it. It\u2019s about self-worth and love. I don\u2019t want there to be women shaving because they think they\u2019re disgusting if they don\u2019t. The fact that we\u2019re making decisions based on toxic ideals really saddens me.\u201d</p> <p>But Boo\u2019s relationship to body hair is also informed by losing her mother to cancer when she was 14, after a six-year battle. \u201cOn a subconscious level, I think another reason I grow out my hair is that I watched my mum lose her hair \u2013 and her eyebrows \u2013 twice. I just thought: \u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got till it\u2019s gone.\u2019</p> <p>Boo\u2019s father, she says, is \u201cthe biggest free spirit I know. He looks like he\u2019s walked straight out of Pirates of the Caribbean. We used to joke about who had the longest head hair and now we joke about the hair under our arms.\u201d Boo says that having this male presence in her life has meant she never frets about the judgment of men about her body hair. \u201cIf I meet a man not as open- or high-minded as my father, I know that\u2019s just that one man\u2019s opinion.\u201d Boo\u2019s boyfriend has also been hugely supportive. \u201cI know women fret about what their partners think, but if your boyfriend doesn\u2019t accept you with hairy armpits, then get a new boyfriend.\u201d</p> <p>Day to day, Boo says she hasn\u2019t had many issues since growing out her hair. The only difference she can tell is that she occasionally catches people staring. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind. I like to make people think.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"03ab5d42b51017f23340920c84dcb5ea00f76d19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03ab5d42b51017f23340920c84dcb5ea00f76d19/0_1033_3840_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruby Jones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruby Jones: \u2018We are programmed to believe that others find body hair disgusting and repulsive.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Theodore Clarke/Instagram/Januhairy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018Now I use my energy on other things that make me happy\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Ruby Jones is the co-founder of Januhairy, and teamed up with Laura Jackson in 2018 after the pair attended a panel talk discussing the politics of body hair.

      "bodyText": "Things have come a long way since 1999, when the actor Julia Roberts hit headlines globally for wearing a dress that exposed her unshaven armpits. These days, Gen Z pop stars, from Amandla Stenberg to Miley Cyrus, are regularly seen with body hair. Brands are cottoning on, too. Last year, Nike and No7 ran advertisements with models showing body hair (underarms and upper lip respectively). Even the ubiquitous advert trope of a woman shaving an already shaven leg was challenged by the razor company Billie, which had marketing collateral that showed underarm, leg and pubic hair. In real life, however, the sight of a woman in public with body hair remains rare, although norms are slowly changing (almost one in four women under 25 no longer shave their armpits, compared with just one in 20 in 2013, according to the market analyst Mintel). One campaign that is helping to continue this trend, and normalise body hair on women, is Januhairy, an initiative that encourages women to grow their body hair for the month of January and share images of themselves online. Started by students Laura Jackson and Ruby Jones in 2019, the campaign hashtag has now attracted thousands of posts from women across the world. As the end of this year\u2019s Januhairy approaches, we meet the movement\u2019s founders and others taking part to talk about how embracing their body hair has changed how they feel about themselves and their bodies. \u2018When I see my body hair now, it reminds me of my love for myself\u2019 Laura Jackson was a student at Exeter University when she first grew out her body hair. It was May 2018 and she was working on a one-woman stage show she had written and would perform in. \u201cIt was about the pressures put on women to abide by these beauty rules to feel accepted,\u201d she says. \u201cAs part of the show I grew out my body hair for the first time. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I didn\u2019t have that incentive.\u201d Girls are often introduced to depilatory products and techniques by relatives, borrowing razors and trying to imitate their mothers. Jackson recalls a conversation with her older sister: \u201cI was in the back of the car and she saw my hairy legs and said: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s time you start shaving.\u2019\u201d She recalls a family holiday shortly after this, when she was in her early teens. \u201cI was with my mum and we were in our swimming costumes and I saw some pubic hairs poking out of her costume. I was so horrified. I thought: \u2018That is disgusting. How dare she not shave?\u2019\u201d But for Jackson, growing out her body hair forced her to rethink her relationship to it. Soon she \u201cfelt liberated\u201d and wanted to embrace it. \u201cWhen I see my body hair now, it reminds me of my love for myself.\u201d She is keen to point out that Januhairy is not about shaming women who choose to remove body and facial hair. \u201cShave whenever you want to, but make sure you\u2019re making the choice for you,\u201d she says.\u201cWe have people who support Januhairy and shave, we have men who support us. It\u2019s not just about hair, it\u2019s about building a conversation around the subject.\u201d \u2018This movement has allowed me to reclaim what I was ashamed of as a kid\u2019 Sonia, like many women of south-Asian heritage, has \u201cgrown up conscious of body hair my whole life\u201d.

The report estimates that up to 1 million wild deer could be roaming Scotland, nearly double some previous estimates, causing significant damage to the landscape and hampering calls to increase tree cover to tackle the climate crisis. Roughly half of those are red deer, a species closely associated with the Scottish Highlands, often roaming in vast herds. Conservationists argue they prevent woodland and shrubs from naturally regenerating. Among nearly 100 recommendations, the report urges Scottish ministers to crack down on uncooperative Highland estates that refuse to control numbers in order to protect their lucrative deer-hunting market, by using legal powers to enforce culls. The deer working group report says Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the government agency that polices deer legislation, should use its enforcement powers, including emergency measures, to cull out-of-control deer herds. It says the maximum average density of deer across Scotland should be capped at 10 per square kilometre, and densities often need to be much lower in some sensitive or over-grazed areas. Some deer estates in areas such as Glen Artney and Strathtay Perthshire have red deer densities above 20 per square kilometre, while numerous parts of Inverness-shire, the Cairngorms, Deeside and Angus have between 15 and 18 per square kilometre. The report endorses SNH\u2019s identification of the need for significant changes in deer management as an important issue in climate crisis mitigation measures, and recommends that it is addressed as a priority. Among a series of proposals that have particularly alarmed landowners and the shooting industry, it has called for the closed season for stags to end, allowing male deer to be shot year-round, and for a much more restricted closed season for hinds, limited to the breeding season. The Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) said the industry was already worried by \u201cdamaging\u201d demands recently for much tighter regulation of grouse shooting in Scotland. Alex Hogg, the SGA\u2019s chairman, called for urgent talks with ministers. \u201cThis sector is getting tired of being kicked from pillar to post and this report, which basically signals a free-for-all on an iconic Scottish species, is a further hammer blow,\u201d he said. Richard Cooke, the chair of the Association of Deer Management Groups, the umbrella body for the voluntary groups that oversee voluntary deer culling efforts, said the report offered some welcome ideas for tidying up the law but was in reality seeking heavy cuts in deer numbers. That \u201cwould have a devastating effect on an important rural industry in the remoter parts of Scotland and there is a real danger if we continue to demonise deer that we overlook the multiple other impacts on our environment\u201d, he said. Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said she needed to reflect and would consult widely before deciding what action the government should take. It was an \u201cimportant and complex issue\u201d, she said. The report says ministers should let stalkers use night sights, to allow for shooting in darker conditions. It proposes banning the use of lead bullets and urges far greater controls on deer herds near major roads, to cope with a rise in collisions with vehicles. The working group, which was first chaired by Simon Pepper, a widely respected conservationist who died before the report was completed, stopped short of putting a number on how many deer needed to be culled in total each year. It said there were significant challenges in pinpointing an accurate figure for Scotland\u2019s overall deer population. One report in 2004 said there were 543,500; another in 2010 estimated between 574,000 and 777,000; and SNH said in 2013 there were between 593,000 and 783,000. Official figures collated by SNH significantly underestimate the number of red, roe, fallow and sika deer living wild, the working group concluded, because they relied heavily on national cull data, which was incomplete. The official data showed that between 100,000 and 130,000 deer were shot each year in Scotland. SNH admitted to the group its national cull data only covered about 90% of red deer shot, 75% of the sika and fallow culls and only 40% of the roe deer cull.

Urging SNH to produce far more accurate deer number data and maps, the group said that although red deer numbers in the Highlands appeared to be static, they were spreading elsewhere in Scotland because of global heating and increased habitat availability.

Assuming my fingers are still capable of gripping a glass. See you all soon! Last, but not least, best overall hack, this is a three way split, for England to win Euro 2020 again, the Guardian Recipes app again, and Fares\u2019s Hey Guardian. Fares takes the prize. Next, the best idea goes to Cloe for the Guardian recipes app! Next up, most entertaining hack. Dom came second in that as well, it was pretty entertaining, but Leigh-Anne wins with her adding pizzazz to self assessments! Next is greenest hack, and that\u2019s for Calvin and Tom for England to win Euro 2020! First, most futuristic hack goes to Dom with Guardian 2037. The votes are in, they\u2019ve been counted up and we\u2019re ready to announce winners. Drum roll please... Okay, that was the last hack, time for a short break before we crown some winners. Apparently it\u2019s reimagining it as a Star Wars opening crawl. Not sure that would go down well with all of our film review fans. It could also offer a \u201cno spoilers\u201d switch and, a way of breaking down articles on a given film or exhibitions by ones best read before during or after the event. Nice idea, but purely conceptual, so don\u2019t expect to see it soon. Now (maybe finally?) we have Watchers and Exhibitionists, from Paul L which is a way to re-imagine our film and art journalism. As what exactly remains to be seen. This is comparing the number of articles on a given topic from various sources in an easy to use bar chart. Next is Lucy M H with a news search and graph tool. Lucy says \u201cThe aim is that you can search for a news topic (using newsapi) and quickly see which news organisations have given it the most coverage in a bar chart.\u201d Please don\u2019t ask me what newsapi is. Phil fixed his laptop, then his presentation went straight over my head. Sorry Phil. This is about a more sociable way of reading news, this means signing in to social media in the Guardian app, so you can share what you are reading with your friends and see what they are reading too. In the meantime, we have Gustavo, Paula H, Ben W, Matthew R plan to engage Gen Z with What Your Friends are Reading. Or he would have done if his laptop hadn\u2019t run out of batteries. He\u2019ll try again in a moment. Phil M has built a way to log you out of our web services automatically. Useful, and fiscally responsible. Apparently the word \u201cregularly\u201d comes up a lot in performance review frameworks. This is a way of setting repeating tasks to ensure that those things that you are supposed to be doing regularly are actually being done regularly. And now he\u2019s going to tidy his room, apparently. Next is Habit Former from Jonny R. He describes this as \u201cThe ones that will help you get promoted!\u201d We\u2019ve seen a few hacks around search, but these are user facing search boxes. We also have to search internally for stories, images etc. for articles. This should improve that process. Next is Sam C with Search Everything, an internal search tool to search all the most detailed bits of information we know about our content. This breaks articles down into individual sections which remembers progress and lets you break news down into easier to digest chunks. Next is Chat Style News from Mohammad H which lets you read news like you do read messages in chat apps. Bubbles is a feature in the latest version of Android which allows us to add a little icon to access the app quickly and easily from anywhere on your phone. And Clippy makes a cameo appearance at the end. Next Max S with Bubbles and a question: \u201cwho doesn\u2019t have fond memories of clippy?\u201d Hmmm. Our current address lookup tool is quite clunky, Rupert plans to make it sleek, modern and more easier to use for our users by using an API which allows immediate lookups in a dropdown menu when you start typing in your address. Next is Rupert B with Address Search, offering better address lookups on our support pages. This builds on the previous hack with steps and timers for when cooking. Jamie W up next, with help from Cloe (again) and Alex B (also again). They have a hack for interactive recipe methods with timers. This is an app entirely for searching the over 10,000(!) recipes we have by site, with a whole load of filters including by dietary requirements and budget, and a way to add ingredients to your shopping list. Cloe takes the stage next with Guardian Recipes App. Another undescribed hack, maybe a bit less mysterious than Adam\u2019s. Adam is wearing a cape (not too surprising if you know Adam) and has come from the future. This is another look at search on the Guardian. This time with added M People. Also not surprising for Adam. Next Adam F with HIY, another hack with no description. Mysterious. Fares has created a method to increase accessibility, particularly for blind and partially-sighted people, which will allow people to speak to the Guardian and have the Guardian read articles. Fares next with Hey Guardian - News for all, not the many. This is described as a very simple app that tries to deliver news with a more human tone and touch to visually impaired people. Using cloud technologies to synthesise news with a neural voice and conversational UX. Rob P is claiming that he will make tag pages great again (MTPGA?). This will add extra information into our tags to make provide greater context, it\u2019s not just the tagged articles, but it also looks at how these stories were promoted. Next is Guardian Tagliatelle from Rob P and Chris M which seems to not have a description, or I\u2019ve deleted it from my spreadsheet. This means that Siri can suggest podcasts to you, and Aoife says that Apple won\u2019t be tracking you when you do so. Next is Aoife with Siri Suggests Guardian Podcasts. This creates a world map with recent articles highlighted by country. It looks extremely slick. Next Niko and Antonio with Mapping the news: A prettier climate tag page. A way to geolocate climate change stories and put them on an interactive map for readers to explore. Next is That one weird trick in the Guardian app from Dana (and bump), described as preview articles, save, and share, using this one weird trick. We do currently use Google search on our site, could we offer some alternatives? Paul seems to think so. Although Twitter search seems like it could be opening a can of worms. Next is Paul B with Searching The Guardian, an alternative set of search boxes for people who don\u2019t want to use Google. This is about making visualisations of web calls from the Guardian website and making them look really quite lovely, like cartoon fireworks. I\u2019ll have to try and get some images at some point to share. Jessica N next with website calls as artwork, which poses the question \u201cwhat do our, and competitor, webpage calls look like as artwork?\u201d This adds a non-scrollable element to the top of our live blogs which we can add useful information into. Next up, Pinhead by Alex B, a concept for pinning live video &amp; data to the top of a live blog. Hey, that could have saved me a lot of work. This would be a way to deliver our lovely Long Reads directly to your Kindle. Don\u2019t know our Long Reads? You should. https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read Next we have the solution to the murder mystery from yesterday in the form of KYLLR from Simone, Vanessa, and Paul R, which actually stands for Kindle Your Love for the Long Read. This is a text learning system which may or may not help us write self-assessments. I\u2019m leaning towards \u201cmay not\u201d based on the examples being shown. Next up, Leigh-Anne M, with a way to add pizzazz to your self assessment. The description for this, and I quote: \u201cPour the wine into the sauce, but even Quorn would work, albeit with less in the Guardian codebase whenever possible, and making improvements, sure, but not against what was covered, or the Scala school doc for concepts 4 and 5.\u201d This is a way of getting help articles which will appear instead of our current FAQs. Apparently people need help with Confit Potatoes. Yusuf F next with Help, a reimagining of The Guardian\u2019s help pages. This adds a popover at the bottom of the app which allows you to continue listening to podcasts while browsing other articles. Looks slick. Ana P next with a method for integrating a podcast player into the Guardian Live app. It\u2019s all gone a bit cyberpunk and post-apocalyptic in here. A physical hack around a device that filters the air in cities, and non-Guardian content from your mind. I don\u2019t know how much of this is currently working... Next up, Dominic K with the Guardian 2037 - Filter Bubble which will apparently keep Guardian users alive in the bleak dystopian future. This doesn\u2019t only filter by London. There\u2019s Leeds and Edinburgh too. Possibly needs a little more refinement. Restaurant reviews by location by Colin K next. You might be shocked to hear that this a hack involving filtering our restaurant reviews by geographical location. You type in keywords and it creates a slightly nonsensical comment based around that. There is a chance that it could be improved with further training on comments, there is also a chance it won\u2019t. Next is Mahesh M with a hack he calls Discussion is Dead, a Guardian discussion comment generator using GPT-2 text generation model. This is a tool for finding you people to go and have coffee with in order to get to meet people outside of your team. Also, Josh potentially has a future as a salesperson. Next up is a hack called Matcha from Josh R-B, Stephen G, Jenny G-J and Reetta V, this is about connecting people who want to meet people. Matcha is a chatbot (for the future!) [the future being one of our themes] that will introduce you to colleagues you\u2019ve never met before, in the Digital department and beyond. This is definitely one of those hacks that looks like it will be super-useful for our other developers, but which to me might as well be written in Greek. Still, did you see our article on the making of Eye of the Tiger? That was good. https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/27/how-we-made-eye-of-the-tiger-rocky-iii-survivor-sylvester-stallone Next we have Alex W with a hack called Rocky which will save our devs from writing cloudformation or doing anything by hand ever again (do they anything by hand as it is?). This is Antonio\u2019s last ever hack day (sniff), and he\u2019s decided to leave us by dealing with an issue that has been sitting in the iOS backlog for quite some time. If we can get this into the app, it will make a lot of our iOS app users very happy indeed. What a way to sign-off. Antonio up next with GLA-1227, a way to allow users of the iOS app to choose which browser to use to open articles and external links. Rhys opens his presentation with \u201cI\u2019m not a dev\u201d, then proceeds to show off a very slick looking Chrome extension. Maybe time for a career change? Rhys (with a lot of unnamed help) has created a Chrome extension that displays the top Guardian stories at the time This is a Trello-based hack to allow us to easily recall things that have been posted to Trello over the past 6 months to help us fill in self-assessments. The live demo is taking a bit longer than I think Jerome was expecting. Rasha gave him a few extra seconds. She\u2019s far too generous. Next Jerome with Rearview about which all he\u2019ll say is \u201cyou will thank me in 6 months\u201d They have visualised the carbon cost for flights for the Euro 2020 tournament. Call me suspicious, but I suspect that this the environmental impact of this is only part of the motivation behind this hack. Next we have England to win Euro 2020 - best for the environment from Tom R and Calvin D. They say that Euro2020 is being held across Europe+ rather than a single host country, so James Dart\u2019s (Sports Editor) hypothesis is that this will be the worst Football Tournament for the environment. We have visualised all flights for the group stages of Euro 2020 and the estimated (best/worst case) carbon emissions. We seem to be loading some of our fonts twice on our web pages, this can be an extra 25kb each time, they have built a way to host fonts to save you using extra data. First up is Font Woffle by Jamie B and Simon A, which is described as a way to consolidate font hosting and loading across web products. Rob P is up making introductions to the presentations. Andrew here, taking over from Rasha so she can keep an eye on the timings while people present. Expect far less well-constructed blog posts over the next hour or two as I do my best to watch and type and think of jokes all at once. Dana comes over to sit across from me. There is silence for a few minutes. Suddenly there is a furious (and I mean tablequake 7.1 magnitude at least) keyboard tapping and the following distressed words: OH MY GOD my tab key is stuck!!!! and PLEASE STOP!!! For about 3 minutes. Please note the capitalisation here is vital. Time to start testing the hacks out for the presentations. T-minus 1 hour and 27 minutes! PHHHWWWWOOOAAAAAR that\u2019s some screen though innit. Just passed by Michael and had a quick check-in on his \u2018stupid\u2019 idea. Oh it\u2019s so bad. I haven\u2019t even submitted it It sounded horrendous to be fair. It could still go for \u2018Most Entertaining\u2019 Michael! Help! My computer has become sentient and has taken over the blog! No not actually. James Cameron please stop calling. Max has just asked me to make a post to help with his hack and said not to ask him why. Well I was happy to oblige. Shame though, the former did sound a bit more exciting. Hello world Ana is working on a podcast player for the articles with audio versions. I confess it did take her quite a few attempts at explanation before I got the gist of the problem she was trying to solve. Visual cues were definitely required. Turns out when you start playing the article audio, when you move away from that article you have no control over the pause/play button. Absolute travesty! Who designed this? Just kidding but this certainly sounds like a good little problem to solve. Go Ana! First stop Amina. She\u2019s rewriting the Guardian in C which apparently I\u2019m told is one of the oldest programming languages in the world. I asked what the oldest was but quickly realised it was very likely to devolve into a very philosophical debate regarding the very nature of programming so I stopped it right there. A discussion for another time methinks. So why do this? Because I want to learn C. Fair enough! It seemed to me a bit like learning Latin these days. Not incredibly practical but kinda sorta pretty cool. Another beautiful day! Welcome to day 2! There will be much continued hacking until the presentations at 3pm. Let\u2019s see how many hackers we can pester in this short time-frame. Knowing me, probably quite a few. Stay tuned! *Pointing to the end of earth\u2019s rotation around the sun* *lamentation relating to my general fatigue* *commenting regarding our continuation in approximately 17 hours* *witty sign off* \u201cJess, tell me everything.\u201d So I was born in 1991-\u201d Too far Jess too far! Let\u2019s try from this morning. There\u2019s about 2 minutes or so of dazzling and profound detailed exposition and I\u2019m listening very intently. My brain hasn\u2019t properly processed a thing. Jess is making colourful bubble art of varying size and number on a computer. That\u2019s the story and I\u2019m sticking to it. Now here\u2019s Jess pointing and Zeek looking concerned. Tom and Calvin are working on a Euro 2020 emissions \u2018thingie\u2019. In short it will show the impact of the teams and fans travelling to the different countries for each game. It\u2019s their belief that this should have longer term implications for any future large scale events (the olympics, music tours etc). Very good serious stuff. With the data they accumulate they\u2019re going to work out all the permutations which they said can lead to such headlines as \u201c England Winning Best for the Environment\u201d. I was amused but then realised that was a very specific headline. I asked how often England had won and the answer was never. .... *suspicious squint* Quick prod of Colin next for his bright idea. He tells me very nonchalantly. Get this, filtering out restaurant reviews by location on the Guardian website. ARGH ! I LOVE IT! It\u2019s a winner. Hack Day OVER! No I\u2019m not biased I just really really love food. But actually why wasn\u2019t this already a thing? It makes so much sense! Paul has a conceptual hack. He wants you to be able to have a before, during and after commentary experience with the films you love. Alex, a most fabulous designer, is helping him achieve his vision. I\u2019ve had a sneak peek but with a strict \u2018no photography\u2019 rule. At least I can reveal Paul\u2019s \u2018ooaooaaffffff yeah\u2019 (a noise not so easy to spell admittedly) indicates he\u2019s happy with the progress. As I\u2019m prowling I spot two heads secretly hidden away from the rest of the crowd. Gareth and Nic are enjoying the partial quiet solitude until I make my grand entrance. Sorry! They are working on rebuilding the commenting UI for the Guardian. A couple of very confident fellas who seem pretty passionate about comments. Or at least Nic does as he used to work tirelessly on the moderation tools. When I prodded Gareth for his reasons I got 3 solemn yet powerful words. I like Nic Flattery will get you everywhere Gareth. Unfortunately though this was shortly followed by his downfall. Actually I couldn\u2019t think of my own idea That ought to have been heavily moderated before publication mate! We\u2019re back! I\u2019ve just come across my first group who have somewhat gleefully announced they\u2019re the killers! I was instantly disturbed but before I could reach for my phone (because no way they were the musical virtuosos that birthed us Mr. Brightside - no offence guys) they were quick to spell it out for me. Apparently it\u2019s K-Y-L-L-R and I\u2019m not allowed to know anything about it. I love a good murder mystery but I\u2019m glad in this case it\u2019s a little less of column A and a little more of column B. Lunch break! What\u2019s that sound? Hello? Excuse me but no one mentioned there would be building works in the room today. Oh no it\u2019s just Dominic trying make a respirator for the future to save our precious Guardian readers from the plague. How\u2019s it going? Nervous laughter. Don\u2019t know Me: Aha! Dana! My beacon in the dark. I\u2019ve found her as tradition now demands. What\u2019s the big idea then? Small, easy and practical. No she\u2019s not just describing me, she\u2019s working on a context menu to help preview articles and share them with more ease. Nifty! Moving on! I arrive at a table with 4 very studious looking hackers that are actually so well fashion coordinated they look to be just a few colours short of a rainbow. Jerome is working on a Trello \u2018power-up\u2019. According to him it won\u2019t be ...the greatest achievement in 2 days I agreed. No of course I didn\u2019t! Come on Jerome have a little more faith in yourself! Fares wants to learn how to use an AWS service that reads texts in a more human voice. He\u2019s using his time to develop his knowledge and skills in order to - and I\u2019d love to finish this sentence but Fares needs to clarify exactly what his end goal is in his head before he makes mine explode. I\u2019ve overheard someone saying they have a stupid idea. I turn to find out who it was for I must know all. It\u2019s Michael so I know this\u2019ll be good. He\u2019s totally focused on Today in Focus, our daily podcast. Is it a captivating look at the headlines that lends the listener a deeper and more profound understanding of the news? Maybe but apparently that\u2019s not enough for Michael. He\u2019d love to give the listeners the opportunity to add a little musicality to their day. The aim of the game, the listener plays a tune through their device and the hosts must sing it. He got a lot of grilling from me on how that would work exactly but really this timeless quote explained it all. It\u2019s shockingly easy to do really stupid audio things Andrew just sat next to me. He\u2019s not feeling particularly inspired. He reckon\u2019s he\u2019ll step outside. A bitterly hot coffee and a blast of arctic air might just shock him into inspiration. Or freeze him to the pavement. Similarly, Zeek is also not off to great start. He\u2019s come to me looking for the charging station. His laptop is dead. A promising start to the day methinks! Good morning Hackers! What better way to start the new year than with a darned good idea, eh? Today we\u2019re at the beautiful #SamsungKX and it\u2019s an equally beautiful day. Get your sunnies out there are no curtains covering that lovely view. Join me, the resident village layman as I find out who\u2019s changing the world. No pressure.",

Naloxone, a drug which reverses the breathing difficulties that are the main life-threatening effect of an opioid overdose, will be given in a take-home kit to those treated by paramedics for a non-fatal overdose but who don\u2019t want to go to hospital. The three-month trial is funded by Scotland\u2019s Drug Deaths Taskforce, which was established last July by the Scottish government to tackle the country\u2019s soaring rate of drug-related fatalities. Scotland led the way in the distribution of naloxone when it became the first country in the world to freely supply kits to people who use drugs for peer administration in 2011, and later made them available to drug users\u2019 friends and family and to practitioners working in the field. Initially highly effective, the programme has since stalled, with slow uptake of peer distribution beyond Glasgow.

What tosh. But on reflection, I wonder if she may have a point. I know a lot of women who are mad on football, but the data is clear: women are less into it than men. And I doubt it is only women feeling left out; there are men who aren\u2019t into football or cricket, too. Hard to believe, I know, but true.</p> <p>I feel sorry for people who aren\u2019t into sport. Where do they go for their extreme, explosive joy, to scream and hug strangers? I think they miss out there, but also in the sense that Francke is getting at.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/28/its-not-gender-specific-readers-on-workplace-sports-banter\">'It's not gender specific': readers on workplace sports banter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For many years, I presented a programme called Working Lunch with Adam Shaw. Adam is a brilliant broadcaster who has done all sorts of amazing stuff in the business, and in the real world, too. However, he isn\u2019t, possibly to his detriment, into football. I took him with me to the away end at Fulham once. I think the word he used to describe the whole experience was \u201cawful\u201d. That is absolutely fair enough: there is a lot that is awful about it. But he nevertheless said he envied me my \u201cfootballness\u201d. We would go together to many events and filming locations and whatnot, often involving tricky social situations with people we didn\u2019t know. Invariably, I would soon be engaged in animated conversation with groups of blokes (and it was mostly blokes) about sport. Poor Adam \u2013 a much cleverer and funnier man than me \u2013 would be left shifting from foot to foot, trying to pull the right faces and make the right noises. He got a bit fed up with it, and I don\u2019t blame him.</p> <p>Once, sitting in the cafe at Television Centre, we were approached by a man who turned out to be Mark Byford, then the BBC\u2019s deputy director general. Unbidden, he rattled off the entire West Brom 1968 FA Cup-winning team. \u201cWhat on earth was that about?\u201d asked Adam. \u201cJust football,\u201d I shrugged. Now, I doubt this football bond I seemed to have with one of the big cheeses ever really advanced my career, but neither did it do me any harm.</p> <p>I can\u2019t think of a single other subject area so useful for starting a conversation and establishing a bit of mutual ground. It can be on any level \u2013 trivial, technical or emotionally profound \u2013 and it can happen between people of any age, class, gender and social status. Ahead of Gordon Brown appearing on The One Show when he was prime minister, I was asked to go to No 10 to speak to him. I was left to wait in a small room, frightened and alone. But then he marched in, asking how West Brom\u2019s then manager Tony Mowbray was doing. He named a few of our players, too. All was well; we were on a level.</p> <p>This all makes sport, and football particularly, an incredibly valuable thing, in and out of the workplace.

      "bodyText": "When I heard Ann Francke, the head of the Chartered Management Institute, complain about blokes talking football in the workplace, I was initially furious. \u201cA lot of women, in particular, feel left out,\u201d she said. What tosh. But on reflection, I wonder if she may have a point. I know a lot of women who are mad on football, but the data is clear: women are less into it than men. And I doubt it is only women feeling left out; there are men who aren\u2019t into football or cricket, too. Hard to believe, I know, but true. I feel sorry for people who aren\u2019t into sport. Where do they go for their extreme, explosive joy, to scream and hug strangers? I think they miss out there, but also in the sense that Francke is getting at. For many years, I presented a programme called Working Lunch with Adam Shaw. Adam is a brilliant broadcaster who has done all sorts of amazing stuff in the business, and in the real world, too. However, he isn\u2019t, possibly to his detriment, into football. I took him with me to the away end at Fulham once. I think the word he used to describe the whole experience was \u201cawful\u201d. That is absolutely fair enough: there is a lot that is awful about it. But he nevertheless said he envied me my \u201cfootballness\u201d. We would go together to many events and filming locations and whatnot, often involving tricky social situations with people we didn\u2019t know. Invariably, I would soon be engaged in animated conversation with groups of blokes (and it was mostly blokes) about sport. Poor Adam \u2013 a much cleverer and funnier man than me \u2013 would be left shifting from foot to foot, trying to pull the right faces and make the right noises. He got a bit fed up with it, and I don\u2019t blame him. Once, sitting in the cafe at Television Centre, we were approached by a man who turned out to be Mark Byford, then the BBC\u2019s deputy director general. Unbidden, he rattled off the entire West Brom 1968 FA Cup-winning team. \u201cWhat on earth was that about?\u201d asked Adam. \u201cJust football,\u201d I shrugged. Now, I doubt this football bond I seemed to have with one of the big cheeses ever really advanced my career, but neither did it do me any harm. I can\u2019t think of a single other subject area so useful for starting a conversation and establishing a bit of mutual ground. It can be on any level \u2013 trivial, technical or emotionally profound \u2013 and it can happen between people of any age, class, gender and social status. Ahead of Gordon Brown appearing on The One Show when he was prime minister, I was asked to go to No 10 to speak to him. I was left to wait in a small room, frightened and alone. But then he marched in, asking how West Brom\u2019s then manager Tony Mowbray was doing. He named a few of our players, too. All was well; we were on a level. This all makes sport, and football particularly, an incredibly valuable thing, in and out of the workplace. I suspect society gains more from it on the swings than it loses on the roundabouts. But I do get that if you\u2019re outside this giant clique it must all be very annoying, as well as exquisitely boring. A bit like football, actually, from time to time. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster and writer",

      "bodyText": "The European parliament sets the seal on Britain\u2019s departure from the EU on Friday by formally voting to ratify the withdrawal agreement paving the way for the UK to leave the bloc after 47 tumultuous years. A sad day for many, a moment for celebration for others. Here, we look back at some of the highs and lows of the UK\u2019s membership. 1972 \u2013 Ted Heath signs UK in Sir Edward Heath, the then prime minister, signs the accession treaty to the European Economic Community, which takes effect on 1 January 1973. \u201cWhat dictators have failed to do by force, democracies are undertaking by peaceful consent \u2026 and the voice of European civilisation so muted since the second world war will be able to speak in a united way,\u201d said the British commissioner, George Thomson. 1975 \u2013 Margaret Thatcher says \u2018yes\u2019 Margaret Thatcher urges the UK to vote yes to stay in Europe in referendum \u2026 before saying \u201cno, no, no\u201d to the European commission president Jacques Delors in 1990 over plans to extend Europe\u2019s powers and competence into national political matters. The seeds of Euroscepticism had been sown years earlier when the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand, as she had put it earlier, \u201cour money back\u201d from the European community. 1999 \u2013 Nigel Farage\u2019s maiden speech \u201cOur interests are best served by not being a member of this club,\u201d Farage says. \u201cThe level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.\u201d 2010 \u2013 Farage fined The leader of Ukip was fined 10 days\u2019 MEP allowances \u2013 about \u00a32,700 \u2013 after refusing to apologise to the the Belgian president of the European parliament, Herman Van Rompuy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude, but you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low grade bank clerk,\u201d said Farage. 2017 \u2013 Farage branded a liar in parliament MEP Seb Dance holds up placard that reads: \u201cHe\u2019s lying to you,\u201d behind Nigel Farage as the then Ukip leader defends Trump\u2019s ban on Muslims entering the US. 2019 SNP MEP \u2013 \u2018Please leave a light on for Scotland\u2019 In what he thought could have been his last speech, two days before the original Brexit day, on 27 March, Alyn Smith apologised for some of his colleagues\u2019 behaviour over the years, and said: \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to solve our domestic discussions. I am asking you to leave a light on so that we can find our way home.\u201d June 2019 \u2013 Brexit party snubs opening of parliament Brexit party MEPs turn their backs as the European anthem, Ode to Joy, is played after being elected in a European election they thought would never happen. And finally \u2026 The classic BBC TV comedy Yes Minister had it right all along. Minister: \u201cSurely you are committed to the European ideal?\u201c Sir Humphrey: \u201cReaaaaaally minister, ha, ha, ha. We had to break the whole thing up, so we had to get inside. We tried to break it up from the outside, but that wouldn\u2019t work. Now that we are inside we can make a complete pig\u2019s breakfast of the whole thing again.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>ED DEVILS</h2> \n<p>There is so much stuff to be righteously angry about these days. That thing someone somewhere said online that doesn\u2019t exactly chime with your worldview. The colour of your passport that the evil EU has always allowed us to change if we could be bothered. Or the disdainful manner with which big clubs like Liverpool treat the FA Cup, while lower-league purists like Brentford make eight changes in order to prepare for a do-or-die clash with Nottingham Forest that if, say, they lost 1-0, would leave them in fifth place in the Championship, exactly where they were when they started. Ooh, the sheer arrogance of that Klopp/EU mandarin/guy on internet forum. Fume!</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/28/fans-attack-home-ed-woodward-manchester-united\">Police investigating after fans attack home of Manchester United's Ed Woodward</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But just imagine supporting a club that hasn\u2019t won a major European trophy for 979 days, is one match away from the Milk Cup final, is still in with a shout of winning both the FA Cup and Big Vase and is suffering such a bad season they\u2019ve plummeted as low as fifth in the Premier League, a competition they\u2019ve won 13 times in its first 27 seasons? Yes, we\u2019d be parping hot steam from both lugs too. Though whether The Fiver would go so far as the \u201clarge group\u201d of Manchester United fans who popped round Ed Woodward\u2019s house and hoyed a flare over his gate while chanting he\u2019s \u201cgoing to die\u201d is another matter altogether. For a start, we\u2019d already changed into our jim-jams and made a nice mug of Horlicks. Nah, not going out.</p> \n<p>Setting aside the fairly clear moral boundaries of this story, the timing of the attack seems a little odd to The Fiver. For a start, in Bruno Fernandes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/29/transfer-latest-bruno-fernandes-manchester-united-medical-steven-bergwijn-signs-spurs\">they\u2019re extremely close to signing</a> their first decent midfielder since Roy Keane left for the pundit\u2019s chair on MUTV all those years ago, while Woodward seems to have got shot of Marcos Rojo, bound for Estudiantes, which has surely got to count for something. Then later on, it\u2019s quite feasible that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side could win at Manchester City like they did last month, force a penalty shootout, and make their first domestic cup final since the sepia-toned misty memories of May 2018. Because when all\u2019s said and done, it\u2019s a Manchester derby and City are still City.</p> \n<p>Having said all that, there\u2019s also a chance that City could run up a cricket score, like they threatened to do at Old Trafford in the first leg. In which case we advise fuming United fans to go straight home, change into their favourite onesies, and stay in for the rest of the night. Read about Brexit, log on to Twitter, do anything that\u2019ll keep yourself relatively calm.</p> \n<h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live\">Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Manchester City 3-1 Manchester United (agg: 6-2) in the Milk Cup</a>.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cI showed them the video of me playing and they said they didn\u2019t realise that at this age you can display such skills, movement and flexibility\u201d \u2013 meet Eez Eldin Bahder, 74, the world\u2019s oldest professional footballer \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/jan/29/meet-eez-eldin-bahder-74-worlds-oldest-professional-footballer-video-report\">and you can watch his moves here in this video montage of his skills</a>.

Not for buying the book \u2013 thanks! \u2013 but for backing my underdog writer status against \u2018lit\u2019 behemoth, Mr Cribbins. It\u2019s the magic of the cup, lads!\u201d \u2013 Robi Polgar.</p> \n<p>\u201cRe: Robi Polgar \u2013 I bought one, too.

The crowd went nuts (it\u2019s spelt \u2018Dre\u2019 \u2013 Fiver hip-hop Ed)\u201d \u2013 Tim Cole.</p> \n<p>\u201cI fully sympathise with your readers who avoid saying \u2018squirrel\u2019. As a Bristolian ex-pat who has spent the last 35 years trying to suppress my accent to avoid ridicule, this is one of the words I avoid at all costs as it\u2019s impossible for me to say it without sounding like Adge Cutler.

      "bodyText": "ED DEVILS There is so much stuff to be righteously angry about these days. That thing someone somewhere said online that doesn\u2019t exactly chime with your worldview. The colour of your passport that the evil EU has always allowed us to change if we could be bothered. Or the disdainful manner with which big clubs like Liverpool treat the FA Cup, while lower-league purists like Brentford make eight changes in order to prepare for a do-or-die clash with Nottingham Forest that if, say, they lost 1-0, would leave them in fifth place in the Championship, exactly where they were when they started. Ooh, the sheer arrogance of that Klopp/EU mandarin/guy on internet forum. Fume! But just imagine supporting a club that hasn\u2019t won a major European trophy for 979 days, is one match away from the Milk Cup final, is still in with a shout of winning both the FA Cup and Big Vase and is suffering such a bad season they\u2019ve plummeted as low as fifth in the Premier League, a competition they\u2019ve won 13 times in its first 27 seasons? Yes, we\u2019d be parping hot steam from both lugs too. Though whether The Fiver would go so far as the \u201clarge group\u201d of Manchester United fans who popped round Ed Woodward\u2019s house and hoyed a flare over his gate while chanting he\u2019s \u201cgoing to die\u201d is another matter altogether. For a start, we\u2019d already changed into our jim-jams and made a nice mug of Horlicks. Nah, not going out. Setting aside the fairly clear moral boundaries of this story, the timing of the attack seems a little odd to The Fiver. For a start, in Bruno Fernandes they\u2019re extremely close to signing their first decent midfielder since Roy Keane left for the pundit\u2019s chair on MUTV all those years ago, while Woodward seems to have got shot of Marcos Rojo, bound for Estudiantes, which has surely got to count for something. Then later on, it\u2019s quite feasible that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side could win at Manchester City like they did last month, force a penalty shootout, and make their first domestic cup final since the sepia-toned misty memories of May 2018. Because when all\u2019s said and done, it\u2019s a Manchester derby and City are still City. Having said all that, there\u2019s also a chance that City could run up a cricket score, like they threatened to do at Old Trafford in the first leg. In which case we advise fuming United fans to go straight home, change into their favourite onesies, and stay in for the rest of the night.

Not for buying the book \u2013 thanks! \u2013 but for backing my underdog writer status against \u2018lit\u2019 behemoth, Mr Cribbins. It\u2019s the magic of the cup, lads!\u201d \u2013 Robi Polgar. \u201cRe: Robi Polgar \u2013 I bought one, too. You keep it up!\u201d \u2013 Hanif Khan. \u201cRecent Fiver letters reminded me of when I used to watch the mighty, sadly defunct, Formby FC in their North West Counties home matches at Victoria Park. Nicknamed \u2018The Squirrels\u2019, what music did the team come out to? Anything by Dr Drey. The crowd went nuts (it\u2019s spelt \u2018Dre\u2019 \u2013 Fiver hip-hop Ed)\u201d \u2013 Tim Cole. \u201cI fully sympathise with your readers who avoid saying \u2018squirrel\u2019. As a Bristolian ex-pat who has spent the last 35 years trying to suppress my accent to avoid ridicule, this is one of the words I avoid at all costs as it\u2019s impossible for me to say it without sounding like Adge Cutler. See also, \u2018world\u2019 and \u2018burglary\u2019\u201d \u2013 Bill Gallagher. \u201cAs an old git, I can confirm that GLC (Tuesday\u2019s Fiver) stands for Greater London Council. On the plus side, Menace have already done an anthem for when it all goes wrong for the poor lad\u201d \u2013 Louise Wright. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

      "body": "<p>One spring day in 1948, two children were sitting at their school desks in Poland when the tannoy crackled into life to announce that their father had just been executed as an enemy of the state. Andrzej and Zofia Pilecki knew nothing about the mission that had taken their father away from them for most of their childhood. It was only when they were in their 60s, as the iron curtain fell, that the details of Witold Pilecki\u2019s extraordinary second world war mission began to emerge.</p> <p>Then, in 2011, a British war correspondent who was looking for a new subject after covering wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, stumbled across the story. He discovered that Pilecki, a former cavalry officer, had become a leading member of the Polish resistance \u2013 and deliberately got himself interned in Auschwitz so that he could send intelligence to London. He survived that ordeal only to fall into the hands of the Soviet regime, who took possession of Poland in the postwar carve-up of Europe.</p> <p>Jack Fairweather was in his late 30s and the father of two young children when he began work on the book. When The Volunteer was crowned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/22/the-volunteer-jack-fairweather-review\">Costa book of the year this week</a>, Fairweather paid an emotional tribute to Andrzej and Zofia, who were among hundreds of survivors who helped him piece together their father\u2019s story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6aefc43c5939b1c413637842a2ef7a8c4e5c3247\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6aefc43c5939b1c413637842a2ef7a8c4e5c3247/22_43_1477_886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Witold Pilecki at a show trial in Poland in 1948.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Witold Pilecki at a show trial in Poland in 1948.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Narodowe Archiwum Cyfrowe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In undertaking the task, Fairweather knew he would have to honour Pilecki\u2019s own insistence that \u201cany falsehood would profane the memory of my fallen colleagues\u201d. Every word of the book is either from Pilecki\u2019s own writing, from interviews Fairweather conducted, or from first-hand accounts by people who lived alongside Pilecki, drawn from the many thousands of testimonies held in the Auschwitz museum.</p> <p>Sitting in his publisher\u2019s office the day after his win, Fairweather sums up the five years he spent on the book: \u201cYears of always chasing your quarry and looking for a glimpse \u2013 for one of those very special moments when you suddenly see the full man. It can be a story detail or a snippet you find in the archive.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pilecki eventually escaped from Auschwitz by using a duplicate key made by a metalworker friend</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One such nugget popped up when he took Pilecki\u2019s octogenarian nephew back to the Warsaw flat the nephew\u2019s family had lived in when he was a toddler. The nephew was just three the night his uncle was taken away. He remembered that his teddy bear had just fallen out of his cot. Pilecki, writes Fairweather, \u201cquickly picks up the bear and hands it to the boy and the mother lets the Germans in. \u2018See you soon,\u2019 he whispers to the child. Then, against every instinct he must have had, he steps into captivity.\u201d</p> <p>The story must have become a family anecdote, Fairweather says. \u201cFor me, it really spoke of one of his great characteristics: at times of greatest stress, when you\u2019d expect him to be thinking of himself, he was always able to reach out and engage with other people.\u201d Part of the puzzle, adds the 41-year-old author, lay in working out what drove \u201cthis apparently ordinary man, with no great record of service, to expand his empathy, his moral capacity, to piece together the Nazis\u2019 greatest crimes when others looked away\u201d.</p> <p>Pilecki managed to get 10 reports smuggled out of the death camp during his two and a half years there, but they fell on deaf ears and were forgotten. Their significance only began to emerge in the early 90s, when Polish archives \u2013 sealed by the Soviets \u2013 were opened to Polish historians. But one important piece of the jigsaw was missing: the testimony Pilecki was known to have written during a spell in Italy after he escaped from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/12/auschwitz-gates-hell-75-years-on\">Auschwitz</a> by using a duplicate key made by a metalworker friend in the camp.</p> <p>\u201cThe goosebumps moment,\u201d says Fairweather, \u201cwas when my researcher phoned me from the Polish Underground Study Trust in London saying it had been found.\u201d The document \u2013 entrusted to a colleague when Pilecki made the fatal decision to return to his homeland under the Soviets \u2013 had been handed over to the Polish government in exile in the 60s, but had been kept secret for fear of reprisals against people it named. \u201cThere it was in his loopy blue handwriting,\u201d says Fairweather, \u201cstill in a little beige folder.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc94f4ae42915fa23ffb215be87ae2a84bfefc76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc94f4ae42915fa23ffb215be87ae2a84bfefc76/84_91_1789_1139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Witold and Maria Pilecki in 1944.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Witold and Maria Pilecki in 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the Pilecki family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the most poignant discoveries for Fairweather was that the second world war didn\u2019t end in May 1945 for Poland and a lot of Europe. \u201cFor us, it was victory parades and celebrations. But for them, it marked the transition to the brutality of Stalin, when more than 80,000 people who had resisted the Nazis were arrested and tortured. Hundreds were shot and thousands more deported to the gulag.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up in Wales, the eldest of four children born to teacher parents, Fairweather was steeped in a war history that made little mention of the Polish resistance. \u201cWe always think of the French,\u201d he says, \u201cbut Polish intelligence was much bigger and more sophisticated.\u201d</p> <p>Pilecki survived in the camp by using his underground contacts to wangle the relatively easy jobs of carpenter and hospital block handyman, though they did not shield him from witnessing Auschwitz\u2019s horrors. \u201cOne day while scratching in the frozen earth for roots,\u201d writes Fairweather, \u201che had the grim thought that they\u2019d be better off if the British simply bombed the camp and brought an end to the suffering.\u201d Pilecki developed this thought in one of his reports, reasoning that nobody would die in vain if Auschwitz was obliterated, because it would expose what was going on, while ending the \u201cmonstrous suffering\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9874ab3663293382fa8e213b1c3f2c5e26b83820\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9874ab3663293382fa8e213b1c3f2c5e26b83820/0_0_1610_2513/641.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"641\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Fairweather arrived at the book via an Oxford degree followed by a career as a war correspondent, which began when his tutor suggested him for a job at a Kolkata newspaper. While working there as a copy editor on the letters page, he took himself off to report on the 2002 terrorist attack on the US cultural centre in the city, selling it to the Daily Telegraph in the UK \u201cfor three months of my salary at the paper\u201d. He was given a break as a stringer in Kuwait where, \u201cby a bizarre coincidence\u201d, a former schoolfriend of his mother\u2019s turned out to be a member of the Kuwaiti royal family and head of the civil service. His first big scoop was an interview in which, contrary to official briefings, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said the country would be happy to be the launchpad for an attack on Iraq aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>Stints in Afghanistan and Iraq followed, resulting in two books.

      "bodyText": "One spring day in 1948, two children were sitting at their school desks in Poland when the tannoy crackled into life to announce that their father had just been executed as an enemy of the state. Andrzej and Zofia Pilecki knew nothing about the mission that had taken their father away from them for most of their childhood. It was only when they were in their 60s, as the iron curtain fell, that the details of Witold Pilecki\u2019s extraordinary second world war mission began to emerge. Then, in 2011, a British war correspondent who was looking for a new subject after covering wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, stumbled across the story. He discovered that Pilecki, a former cavalry officer, had become a leading member of the Polish resistance \u2013 and deliberately got himself interned in Auschwitz so that he could send intelligence to London. He survived that ordeal only to fall into the hands of the Soviet regime, who took possession of Poland in the postwar carve-up of Europe. Jack Fairweather was in his late 30s and the father of two young children when he began work on the book. When The Volunteer was crowned Costa book of the year this week, Fairweather paid an emotional tribute to Andrzej and Zofia, who were among hundreds of survivors who helped him piece together their father\u2019s story. In undertaking the task, Fairweather knew he would have to honour Pilecki\u2019s own insistence that \u201cany falsehood would profane the memory of my fallen colleagues\u201d. Every word of the book is either from Pilecki\u2019s own writing, from interviews Fairweather conducted, or from first-hand accounts by people who lived alongside Pilecki, drawn from the many thousands of testimonies held in the Auschwitz museum. Sitting in his publisher\u2019s office the day after his win, Fairweather sums up the five years he spent on the book: \u201cYears of always chasing your quarry and looking for a glimpse \u2013 for one of those very special moments when you suddenly see the full man. It can be a story detail or a snippet you find in the archive.\u201d One such nugget popped up when he took Pilecki\u2019s octogenarian nephew back to the Warsaw flat the nephew\u2019s family had lived in when he was a toddler. The nephew was just three the night his uncle was taken away. He remembered that his teddy bear had just fallen out of his cot. Pilecki, writes Fairweather, \u201cquickly picks up the bear and hands it to the boy and the mother lets the Germans in. \u2018See you soon,\u2019 he whispers to the child. Then, against every instinct he must have had, he steps into captivity.\u201d The story must have become a family anecdote, Fairweather says. \u201cFor me, it really spoke of one of his great characteristics: at times of greatest stress, when you\u2019d expect him to be thinking of himself, he was always able to reach out and engage with other people.\u201d Part of the puzzle, adds the 41-year-old author, lay in working out what drove \u201cthis apparently ordinary man, with no great record of service, to expand his empathy, his moral capacity, to piece together the Nazis\u2019 greatest crimes when others looked away\u201d. Pilecki managed to get 10 reports smuggled out of the death camp during his two and a half years there, but they fell on deaf ears and were forgotten. Their significance only began to emerge in the early 90s, when Polish archives \u2013 sealed by the Soviets \u2013 were opened to Polish historians. But one important piece of the jigsaw was missing: the testimony Pilecki was known to have written during a spell in Italy after he escaped from Auschwitz by using a duplicate key made by a metalworker friend in the camp. \u201cThe goosebumps moment,\u201d says Fairweather, \u201cwas when my researcher phoned me from the Polish Underground Study Trust in London saying it had been found.\u201d The document \u2013 entrusted to a colleague when Pilecki made the fatal decision to return to his homeland under the Soviets \u2013 had been handed over to the Polish government in exile in the 60s, but had been kept secret for fear of reprisals against people it named. \u201cThere it was in his loopy blue handwriting,\u201d says Fairweather, \u201cstill in a little beige folder.\u201d One of the most poignant discoveries for Fairweather was that the second world war didn\u2019t end in May 1945 for Poland and a lot of Europe. \u201cFor us, it was victory parades and celebrations. But for them, it marked the transition to the brutality of Stalin, when more than 80,000 people who had resisted the Nazis were arrested and tortured. Hundreds were shot and thousands more deported to the gulag.\u201d Growing up in Wales, the eldest of four children born to teacher parents, Fairweather was steeped in a war history that made little mention of the Polish resistance. \u201cWe always think of the French,\u201d he says, \u201cbut Polish intelligence was much bigger and more sophisticated.\u201d Pilecki survived in the camp by using his underground contacts to wangle the relatively easy jobs of carpenter and hospital block handyman, though they did not shield him from witnessing Auschwitz\u2019s horrors. \u201cOne day while scratching in the frozen earth for roots,\u201d writes Fairweather, \u201che had the grim thought that they\u2019d be better off if the British simply bombed the camp and brought an end to the suffering.\u201d Pilecki developed this thought in one of his reports, reasoning that nobody would die in vain if Auschwitz was obliterated, because it would expose what was going on, while ending the \u201cmonstrous suffering\u201d. Fairweather arrived at the book via an Oxford degree followed by a career as a war correspondent, which began when his tutor suggested him for a job at a Kolkata newspaper. While working there as a copy editor on the letters page, he took himself off to report on the 2002 terrorist attack on the US cultural centre in the city, selling it to the Daily Telegraph in the UK \u201cfor three months of my salary at the paper\u201d. He was given a break as a stringer in Kuwait where, \u201cby a bizarre coincidence\u201d, a former schoolfriend of his mother\u2019s turned out to be a member of the Kuwaiti royal family and head of the civil service. His first big scoop was an interview in which, contrary to official briefings, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said the country would be happy to be the launchpad for an attack on Iraq aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein. Stints in Afghanistan and Iraq followed, resulting in two books. He talks of \u201cthe heroism of ordinary people\u201d \u2013 in particular, the Iraqi driver who, with Fairweather typing out the story of an attempted suicide bombing in the back seat, managed to outrun a Shia squad who had been sent to kidnap him. \u201cWe were bouncing all over the place for 45 minutes. I was saying, \u2018Please drive more carefully. I\u2019m trying to write a piece.\u201d Only when they\u2019d arrived back in Baghdad and he had filed his story did his driver tell him exactly what had been going on.

      "bodyText": "For decades they have been part of the collection of the British Museum, appreciated for their individual significance but in many cases shorn of much of their context owing to the circumstances of their discovery and retrieval during the buccaneering period of early archaeology. Now dozens of important artefacts that were removed from Iraq in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are being brought back into focus in an exhibition drawing on groundbreaking discoveries made by Iraqi archaeologists amid the turbulence of the country\u2019s recent history. Among the objects on display is a small dolerite statue dating to around 2130BC, purchased by the museum in the 1930s. It depicts a king called Gudea, who ruled the ancient city of Girsu, one of the world\u2019s first urban civilisations, on the site of modern-day Tello in southern Iraq. The statue shows him in a position of prayer, as do many others of him, according to Sebastien Rey, a curator of ancient Mesopotamia at the museum. But while experts knew from written sources that Gudea constructed a temple in his city, no trace of it had been found. That changed thanks to a discovery made through the Iraq emergency heritage scheme, set up by the British Museum in 2015 to train local archaeologists in heritage protection at a time when many of the country\u2019s historical sites were under threat from destruction by Islamists. By revisiting the site after decades, Rey and a team of local trainee archaeologists discovered not only the site of the king\u2019s 4,000-year-old temple, but also a bakery attached to the temple where huge quantities of bread would have been produced as offerings to the gods. It is believed to be the first example of this kind of set-up in history, ranking it as an \u201cabsolutely 10/10 and beyond\u201d discovery, Rey said. The purpose of other museum-owned items that have puzzled experts for decades has also become clear as a result of the heritage scheme digs. For example, a collection of inscribed cones: similar items were found inside the temple\u2019s walls as talismanic deposits. Iraqi law forbids archaeological discoveries from being removed from the country, so the new finds will be represented in photographs, reconstructions and video alongside the museum\u2019s own collection. The exhibition, titled Ancient Iraq: New Discoveries, will visit the Great North Museum in Newcastle and the University of Nottingham Museum between March and December.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s reliance on temporary migration is creating a new economic underclass that risks having a \u201ccorrosive\u201d effect on the nation\u2019s society, Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, says. In a major speech to the Curtin institute on Thursday night, Keneally will step up Labor\u2019s attack on the government for its reliance on temporary migration, saying current trends could see as many as 3 million people \u2013 or 12% of the population \u2013 living in Australia on a temporary basis. Pointing to figures that show the number of temporary migrants has doubled since 2007 to 1 million people, or 4% of the population, Keneally says the trend will continue, despite the government\u2019s focus on cuts to the permanent migration program. Before the May election, Morrison announced the government would cut the permanent migration program from 190,000 places to 160,000 places, saying the government wanted to address concerns about rapid population growth in congested cities. But Keneally said the move belied the fact that Australia\u2019s population would continue to grow strongly on the back of temporary migration numbers. \u201cSo this is the Morrison wink and nod \u2013 tell Australians that you are capping permanent migration, make Australians feel like the government is doing something to address their concerns about congested roads and crowded cities,\u201d a draft copy of Keneally\u2019s speech says. \u201cBut, in fact, this is just another ad man\u2019s trick from the ultimate ad man, Scott Morrison [and] what the PM will never admit is his cap on permanent migration cap sits alongside a significant surge in uncapped, temporary migration. \u201cThere are going to be more people, but the big difference is, these people won\u2019t be here permanently \u2013 we are not inviting them to stay. \u201cThat will change who we are as a nation, and not for the better.\u201d According to the 2019-20 budget, the rate of total overseas migration shows a 17% increase, despite the permanent visa reduction compared to the previous year, ranging between 260,000 and 270,000 a year over the forward estimates. Keneally said the government was \u201cdesperate\u201d to appear to be cutting the migration intake, but couldn\u2019t risk disappointing the business community, \u201cwhich always wants increased migration to support economic growth\u201d. She points to findings from the OECD that show Australia is home to the second largest temporary migrant workforce in the world, behind only the US, and an international student cohort that, if measured as a share of the working population, is the largest in the world. She says that, according to OECD estimates, temporary workers in Australia account for the equivalent of 200,350 full-time jobs, or 1.6% of our total workforce. The number of migrants \u2013 including New Zealanders \u2013 on temporary visas has jumped from 1.8 million to 2.2 million in the past four years. She says there are estimates that suggest temporary migrants now make up 10% of the younger-aged workforce, and that 4% of Australia\u2019s work force is made up of \u201clow-skilled, young, temporary migrants\u201d. Keneally says the \u201csignificant surge\u201d in temporary migration risks a \u201cnew and damaging form of social and economic exclusion\u201d, with temporary workers often exploited through labour hire firms and targeted by international people smuggling rings. She also argues that the influx has led to stagnating wages across the country more broadly, with the demand for a temporary workforce being driven by large business interests. \u201cMany people believe the Australian migration system is highly skilled and has nothing to do with the underemployment or minimum wages. In the past this was true, but it is changing \u2013 and changing quickly all because of the reliance on temporary migration this government is exacerbating,\u201d Keneally says. The New South Wales senator says Australia will be \u201cfundamentally different\u201d if 3 million people living in Australia \u201chave no stake and no say in the future of our country\u201d, comparing it to the country\u2019s historical success as a cohesive multicultural nation. \u201cIn the name of lower wages and cheap labour, this government is risking a new and damaging form of social and economic exclusion,\u201d Keneally says. \u201cA new instrument of division, a new sense of who is in and who is out, who belongs and who doesn\u2019t. It will diminish our sense of unity \u2013 and community. It will create a two-tiered labour market; it will undercut wages and conditions, and I fear it will give new weight and new prominence to anti-immigrant sentiment, resentment, racism and xenophobia.\u201d Keneally says while the government has been fixated on asylum seekers arriving by boat, people smugglers were now having \u201cstunning success\u201d by shifting their business model to the air, with over 100,000 airplane arrivals in recent years. \u201cUnder this government, the people exploitation business is booming. It\u2019s booming because there are dodgy labour hire companies and unscrupulous employers who see exploitation as a cost-cutting tool. \u201cAnd it\u2019s booming because Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton care more about the rhetoric of strong borders than they do about the reality of a temporary visa system in crisis.\u201d She said Labor strongly believed in a nation \u201cmade great by permanent migration\u201d, and it needed to be defended amid the rise in temporary migration. \u201cThis is about asking our fellow Australians if we want to create \u2013 and profit from \u2013 an economic underclass. \u201cThis is about whether we want to stop people working in Australia from putting down roots, raising a family, starting a business, creating ties with their neighbours through sport, volunteering, church or community?\u201d",

Citing new analysis of the wage index between 2016 and 2018, the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) will reveal on Thursday that it is now calling for a $95 boost to the $279.50 weekly payment, up from a previous demand of $75 a week. The proposal, contained in Acoss\u2019 federal budget submission, aims to address the widening gap between the combined rate of Newstart and rent assistance and what the organisation says a single unemployed person needs to afford essentials such as food and shelter. The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said the government must be willing to jettison the surplus to fund a Newstart increase, likening the situation to the prime minister\u2019s recent pledge that the bushfire recovery would not be influenced by concerns about the budget bottom line. \u201cIt\u2019s effectively senseless cruelty to continue to ignore what is so widely understood to be one of the key causes of the level of poverty in Australia,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. Pointing to the organisation\u2019s own research showing more than 80% of Newstart recipients skipped meals to make ends meet, Goldie also warned the government against a targeted boost to the incomes of a select group of Newstart recipients, as some Nationals MPs have proposed. \u201cWe challenge the government to say which of those people are less deserving of needing to feed themselves and keep a roof over the head,\u201d she said.

However, critics point to figures showing the average amount of time people spend on the payment has ballooned out to more than three years, while policy changes mean those relying on Newstart are increasingly likely to be sick or disabled. At the Senate inquiry into the payment\u2019s adequacy, which is still ongoing, Coalition senators last year demanded that campaigners identify \u201cnew taxes\u201d that would fund a boost to the unemployment benefit.

Just up the hill from the main beach at Coogee, away from the surfers and backpackers rolling in the waves, sits a small gate. Steps lead down the cliff into the pool, framed by lush plants that stretch out from the steep rock. Here you could plunge into salty water, surrounded by blue sky and open ocean, protected by a low concrete wall that tamed the surf. Small crabs ducked in and out from the rock and fish swam below.

Most of them are still free. Ocean pools are not just monuments to ingenuity and and the beauty of Australia\u2019s coast, but to different ways of thinking about public space than we frequently do now.</p> <p>Last weekend I joined some friends who wanted to swim at North Bondi and found myself performing the same old clumsy ritual, edging slowly out towards the surf as my mates ploughed in. Battered by waves and tired of dodging kids learning to surf I made a familiar, quick retreat.</p> <p>But instead of returning straight to my towel I stopped to loll in the shallows of the Wally Weekes pool, the tiny bathing area surrounded by rocks that sits at the beach\u2019s northernmost tip. For a moment I had it entirely to myself, and I lay back in the water, in the sea but out of it, where I felt like I belonged.</p> <p><br></p>",

We live in inland suburbs rendered more remote from the beach by terrible public transport and even worse city traffic. From here, surf culture can feel foreign and exclusive. For many, finding confidence in the ocean can be a hard-won and dangerous battle. I blame my own clumsiness and anxiety in the open ocean on a childhood spent in the safety of suburban council pools in Sydney\u2019s inner west. My parents had no interest in long, hot drives to the beach, so virtually all my swimming as a kid was done in these oases of concrete and chlorine, all neat lines and smooth surfaces. There, the only real risk you contended with was another kid bombing in from overhead when the lifeguard\u2019s back was turned. But as an adult I\u2019ve come to love being by the sea. And discovering Sydney\u2019s ocean pools was something of a revelation. I remember the first trip to McIver\u2019s Ladies Baths in my early 20s. Just up the hill from the main beach at Coogee, away from the surfers and backpackers rolling in the waves, sits a small gate. Steps lead down the cliff into the pool, framed by lush plants that stretch out from the steep rock. Here you could plunge into salty water, surrounded by blue sky and open ocean, protected by a low concrete wall that tamed the surf. Small crabs ducked in and out from the rock and fish swam below. That the women-only space has the vibe of a secret, mermaid coven was a bonus. After all the internal battles between wanting to be in the sea and being afraid of it, I had finally found a perfect detente. Discovering more ocean pools over the years has opened up the city and the surrounding regions for a beach novice like myself. I have done laps in the wild, deserted pools along the Illawarra coast, with the looming escarpment on one side and the pounding Pacific on the other. I have whiled away weekends at Bondi Icebergs, observing loving Instagram-boyfriends patiently strive for an acceptable shot of their girlfriends in one of the most picturesque spots in the world. Best of all though, ocean pools have made intimidating beaches like Bronte truly enjoyable for the first time. Providing places to cool off and swim safe from sharks, riptides and waves, especially for a growing population unfamiliar with the surf, was of course a primary purpose of New South Wales\u2019 abundant ocean pools when they were built throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Another purpose was providing work during the Depression \u2013 many of Sydney\u2019s pools were funded by unemployment relief schemes. How lucky we are that past governments faced worrisome economic times by investing in infrastructure projects like this \u2013 spaces whose value lies in their ability to foster community for generations and generate enjoyment, rather than profit. Most of them are still free. Ocean pools are not just monuments to ingenuity and and the beauty of Australia\u2019s coast, but to different ways of thinking about public space than we frequently do now. Last weekend I joined some friends who wanted to swim at North Bondi and found myself performing the same old clumsy ritual, edging slowly out towards the surf as my mates ploughed in. Battered by waves and tired of dodging kids learning to surf I made a familiar, quick retreat. But instead of returning straight to my towel I stopped to loll in the shallows of the Wally Weekes pool, the tiny bathing area surrounded by rocks that sits at the beach\u2019s northernmost tip. For a moment I had it entirely to myself, and I lay back in the water, in the sea but out of it, where I felt like I belonged.",

The critical success of the Korean horror movie Parasite has brought me as close to orgasm as any awards ceremony could ever hope to, and Awkwafina\u2019s star turn in The Farewell made me wild with both jealousy and pride. In Australia, my 15-year old kid asked, unprompted, if we could binge-watch Benjamin Law\u2019s series The Family Law. Que Minh Luu\u2019s show The Heights \u2013 featuring among others a Vietnamese mother-son combo, a high schooler with cerebral palsy and Indigenous talent onscreen and off \u2013 has been renewed for a second season. And while I\u2019ve known Brown for about 15 years, I\u2019ve never seen him this busy. He is in rehearsals for Law\u2019s new play Torch the Place, which features an all-Asian cast. The premiere season at Melbourne Theatre Company has already sold out. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I think my acting has gotten better,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s just that there\u2019s more work for people like me.\u201d \u2022 Yumi Stynes is a TV presenter, podcast host and author",

Scientists found levels of the chemicals in the tissues of snubfin dolphins and humpback dolphins had tripled and, in some cases, risen even higher between 2010 and 2015. One tissue sample taken from a female humpback dolphin had concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) \u2013 banned in Australia since 1975 \u2013 that were among the highest recorded in the scientific literature.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan could make the creation of a viable Palestinian state much less likely, despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/donald-trump-middle-east-peace-plan-israel-netanyahu-palestinians\">US president heralding it as a \u201crealistic two-state solution\u201d</a>, diplomats, analysts and aid organisations have warned.</p> \n<p>But even before the ink was dry on a plan largely credited to Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, analysts from both right and left in Israel, as well as elsewhere, were questioning both the workability of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/trumps-middle-east-peace-plan-key-points-at-a-glance\">practical proposals </a>and whether what it described amounted to any kind of Palestinian sovereignty, let alone a viable state.</p> \n<p>The immediate official response of many governments were guarded statements, like that issued by France\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which noted that France would \u201ccarefully study\u201d the US proposals<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, was perhaps the most enthusiastic of European leaders, with his official spokesman saying: \u201cWhat the PM has said, and the foreign secretary as well, is that they are serious proposals for peace and that they therefore deserve a fair hearing.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"513a4797-1622-462b-830b-61d387ea62a6\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Donald Trump has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/donald-trump-middle-east-peace-plan-israel-netanyahu-palestinians\">unveiled his much-touted Middle East peace plan</a>, tweeting a map showing his vision for an even further depleted Palestinian state than that envisioned by the Oslo peace agreement in 1993.</p>\n    <p>The key points of the proposed plan are:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Establish Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s \u201cundivided\u201d capital, with a potential Palestinian capital to the east and north of the city.</li>\n     <li>Recognise the vast majority of Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territory as part of the country. A Palestinian state would receive territory, mostly desert, near Gaza to compensate for the loss of about 30% of the West Bank. Gaza and the West Bank would be linked by high speed rail.</li>\n     <li>Recognise the Jordan valley, which makes up about a third of the occupied West Bank, as part of Israel.</li>\n     <li>Offer a path to some form of Palestinian statehood but with no army, and overarching Israeli security control in some areas, including over the sea. The plan also sets a series of conditions the Palestinians have to meet before receiving independence including the \u201ccomplete dismantling of Hamas\u201d, which governs Gaza.</li>\n     <li>The possibility of stripping Israeli citizenship from tens of thousands of Arab Israelis who live in 10 border towns, with those towns and their residents being included into any future state of Palestine.</li>\n     <li>Recognise sections of the desert bordering Egypt as part of any future Palestinian state.</li>\n     <li>Refuse Palestinian refugees the \u201cright of return\u201d to homes lost to Israel in previous conflicts.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Behind the scenes, EU countries were also concerned over how to react should Israel take the plan as a green light to annex illegal settlements on the West Bank which Trump has suggested should be recognised as under Israeli sovereignty.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is an EU position we have expressed previously stressing opposition to annexation and consequences if they do so,\u201d one European diplomat said. \u201cBut it is fair to say there is no consensus on what those consequences could be.\u201d</p> \n<p>For his part, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, issued a terse but polite rejection, that echoed the French statement pointing out that while he had \u201cseen the announcement \u2026 the position of the United Nations on the two-state solution has been defined, throughout the years, by relevant security council and general assembly resolutions by which the secretariat is bound.\u201d</p> \n<p>More heated language, was used by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan who described the plan as \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d ignoring Palestinians\u2019 rights while \u201clegitimising Israel\u2019s occupation\u201d. \u201cThe plan outlined,\u201d he added, \u201cwill not serve peace or bring about a solution.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many Arab countries, in contrast, have tried to hedge their bets despite reservations, anxious not to alienate Trump.</p> \n<p>Ahmed Abd Rabou, a visiting assistant professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver, described the responses of Riyadh and Cairo as \u201cvery conservative\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey simply didn\u2019t want to upset Trump whom they ally with, but they can\u2019t upset the general public as well, so they decided to go for a middle-ground solution,\u201d he said, adding that the statements implied they disagree with many parts of the plan.</p> \n<p>Hugh Lovatt, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, offered a scathing analysis.</p> \n<p>\u201cDespite its appropriation of the two-state label, the United States is not offering Israelis and Palestinians a viable and peaceful future in their own states. Instead, its proposal would cement a one-state reality of open-ended occupation and unequal rights for Palestinians.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe plan leaves Palestinians with an atrophied entity made up of disconnected Bantustans in the West Bank and Gaza \u2026 devoid of meaningful sovereignty, lacking any control over its borders, airspace, territorial waters, and the bulk of its natural resources \u2013 and with no capital in East Jerusalem. Essentially, the deal represents a worsening of the current situation, with a US presidential seal of approval.\u201d</p> \n<p>Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group, was not alone in seeing the \u201cvision for peace\u201d as a call for Palestinian surrender rather than realistic talks.</p> \n<p> \u201cStrip away the domestic and Israeli political considerations that determined the timing of the plan\u2019s release,\u201d he said \u201cand the message to the Palestinians, boiled down to its essence, is: \u2019you\u2019ve lost, get over it\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>A joint statement from British NGOs, including Cafod, Christian Aid and War on Want, also questioned whether the plan, which Trump suggested could release $50bn in economic assistance to Palestinians, could have the reverse effect.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is a major risk that the so-called \u2018peace plan\u2019, set to be released imminently, will lead to the formal annexation of Palestinian land, perpetual Israeli occupation, and the negation of Palestinians\u2019 collective right to self-determination. Such an outcome will only deepen poverty and polarisation.</p> \n<p>\u201cFormal annexation would also seriously breach a foundational principle of the post-second world war international legal order, with implications far beyond the Israel-Palestine context.</p> \n<p>\u201cPalestinians are already losing their land with creeping de-facto annexation of the West Bank, forcing them to become perpetually aid-dependent despite abundant natural resources.\u201d</p> \n<p>Israeli commentators from both left and right homed in on the many practical concerns raised by the Trump proposal. Writing in the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Amir Tibon said the deal would not bring about a Palestinian state in a meaningful sense.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis future [Palestinian] state will have none of the actual characteristics of a state. The streets of all of its cities, towns and villages, as well as the roads connecting them, will be under the full control of the military of another state \u2013 Israel. It will have no control over its borders, which will also be controlled by Israel.\u201d</p> \n<p>Others, like the Jerusalem Post, focused on what the plan would mean in practical terms including Israel\u2019s security.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough the concept foresees a contiguous Palestinian state, it is contiguity in name only. No other state in the world looks so gerrymandered. It is a state without an airport or real ports. It is a state that is inside another state and whose borders are basically controlled by Israel.\u201d</p> \n<p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan could make the creation of a viable Palestinian state much less likely, despite the US president heralding it as a \u201crealistic two-state solution\u201d, diplomats, analysts and aid organisations have warned. But even before the ink was dry on a plan largely credited to Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, analysts from both right and left in Israel, as well as elsewhere, were questioning both the workability of its practical proposals and whether what it described amounted to any kind of Palestinian sovereignty, let alone a viable state. The immediate official response of many governments were guarded statements, like that issued by France\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which noted that France would \u201ccarefully study\u201d the US proposals. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, was perhaps the most enthusiastic of European leaders, with his official spokesman saying: \u201cWhat the PM has said, and the foreign secretary as well, is that they are serious proposals for peace and that they therefore deserve a fair hearing.\u201d Behind the scenes, EU countries were also concerned over how to react should Israel take the plan as a green light to annex illegal settlements on the West Bank which Trump has suggested should be recognised as under Israeli sovereignty. \u201cThere is an EU position we have expressed previously stressing opposition to annexation and consequences if they do so,\u201d one European diplomat said. \u201cBut it is fair to say there is no consensus on what those consequences could be.\u201d For his part, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, issued a terse but polite rejection, that echoed the French statement pointing out that while he had \u201cseen the announcement \u2026 the position of the United Nations on the two-state solution has been defined, throughout the years, by relevant security council and general assembly resolutions by which the secretariat is bound.\u201d More heated language, was used by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan who described the plan as \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d ignoring Palestinians\u2019 rights while \u201clegitimising Israel\u2019s occupation\u201d. \u201cThe plan outlined,\u201d he added, \u201cwill not serve peace or bring about a solution.\u201d Many Arab countries, in contrast, have tried to hedge their bets despite reservations, anxious not to alienate Trump. Ahmed Abd Rabou, a visiting assistant professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver, described the responses of Riyadh and Cairo as \u201cvery conservative\u201d. \u201cThey simply didn\u2019t want to upset Trump whom they ally with, but they can\u2019t upset the general public as well, so they decided to go for a middle-ground solution,\u201d he said, adding that the statements implied they disagree with many parts of the plan. Hugh Lovatt, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, offered a scathing analysis. \u201cDespite its appropriation of the two-state label, the United States is not offering Israelis and Palestinians a viable and peaceful future in their own states. Instead, its proposal would cement a one-state reality of open-ended occupation and unequal rights for Palestinians. \u201cThe plan leaves Palestinians with an atrophied entity made up of disconnected Bantustans in the West Bank and Gaza \u2026 devoid of meaningful sovereignty, lacking any control over its borders, airspace, territorial waters, and the bulk of its natural resources \u2013 and with no capital in East Jerusalem. Essentially, the deal represents a worsening of the current situation, with a US presidential seal of approval.\u201d Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group, was not alone in seeing the \u201cvision for peace\u201d as a call for Palestinian surrender rather than realistic talks. \u201cStrip away the domestic and Israeli political considerations that determined the timing of the plan\u2019s release,\u201d he said \u201cand the message to the Palestinians, boiled down to its essence, is: \u2019you\u2019ve lost, get over it\u2019.\u201d A joint statement from British NGOs, including Cafod, Christian Aid and War on Want, also questioned whether the plan, which Trump suggested could release $50bn in economic assistance to Palestinians, could have the reverse effect. \u201cThere is a major risk that the so-called \u2018peace plan\u2019, set to be released imminently, will lead to the formal annexation of Palestinian land, perpetual Israeli occupation, and the negation of Palestinians\u2019 collective right to self-determination. Such an outcome will only deepen poverty and polarisation. \u201cFormal annexation would also seriously breach a foundational principle of the post-second world war international legal order, with implications far beyond the Israel-Palestine context. \u201cPalestinians are already losing their land with creeping de-facto annexation of the West Bank, forcing them to become perpetually aid-dependent despite abundant natural resources.\u201d Israeli commentators from both left and right homed in on the many practical concerns raised by the Trump proposal. Writing in the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Amir Tibon said the deal would not bring about a Palestinian state in a meaningful sense. \u201cThis future [Palestinian] state will have none of the actual characteristics of a state. The streets of all of its cities, towns and villages, as well as the roads connecting them, will be under the full control of the military of another state \u2013 Israel. It will have no control over its borders, which will also be controlled by Israel.\u201d Others, like the Jerusalem Post, focused on what the plan would mean in practical terms including Israel\u2019s security. \u201cAlthough the concept foresees a contiguous Palestinian state, it is contiguity in name only. No other state in the world looks so gerrymandered. It is a state without an airport or real ports. It is a state that is inside another state and whose borders are basically controlled by Israel.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Families have spoken out about the prospect of being split up during the evacuation process.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after Mississippi\u2019s newly elected governor vowed to close parts of the state\u2019s most notorious prison, officials announced on Tuesday night that another inmate had died in the system \u2013 marking the 13th state prisoner death since late December. Mississippi\u2019s ageing and underfunded network of prisons has come under renewed scrutiny in recent weeks after a spate of unrest over the new year led to multiple stabbing deaths and a statewide lockdown. Most of these deaths have occurred at the notorious Parchman penitentiary, a sprawling prison farm complex constructed in the Jim Crow era and modelled on an antebellum slave plantation, situated in the north of the state. Much of the unrest occurred in the prison\u2019s most dilapidated and violent quarters, unit 29, where state health inspections combined with contraband cellphone images have documented numerous instances of decay including vermin, mould, overflowing toilets and broken bathroom installations. During his first state address on Monday, Mississippi\u2019s governor, Tate Reeves, pledged to move towards closing the unit after he toured the facility last week. \u201cWe have to turn the page. This is the first step, and I have asked the department [of corrections] to begin the preparations to make it happen safely, justly and quickly,\u201d Reeves said. He added: \u201cWe will do better. We will right the wrongs of the past, and we will do everything in our power to protect the dignity of every Mississippi life.\u201d As governor\u2019s annual state speeches are usually focused on economic and legislative priorities, Reeves\u2019s focus on the prison system highlighted just how deep the current crisis has become. Just a day after the announcement, corrections department officials confirmed that 28-year-old Limarion Reaves, an inmate at Kemper-Neshoba regional correctional facility, a medium-security prison and jail in the east of the state, had collapsed and died on Tuesday. The prison\u2019s warden, Johnny Crockett said the inmate, who was serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault, had been talking on the phone to a relative when he fell ill in the early afternoon. An autopsy was set to determine the cause and manner of death. Like other facilities in the Mississippi prison system, Kemper-Neshoba has been accused of prisoner neglect on multiple occasions. In October 2019 a lawsuit was filed against the warden and jail staff members by the family of Robert Wayne Johnson, who killed himself at the facility in 2018. The family claim jail staff ignored clear evidence that Johnson, who had a long history of mental health problems intended to kill himself. Mississippi is in the midst of a prison funding and staffing crisis, as widespread shortages of corrections officers have led to extended lockdowns in multiple prisons, with proposed funding cuts likely to make the situation worse. Although Reeves has pledged to close unit 29 at Parchman, questions remain about where those inmates will go. The state has the third highest rate of incarceration in the US, and disproportionately imprisons African Americans.",

      "body": "<p>A couple of years ago a small group of us were invited into parliament to discuss Labour\u2019s plans for democratic reform. When we arrived we were handed a document containing the policies the shadow cabinet office team had managed to steer through the party machine. I read it carefully, then gave my honest response: \u201cThis is less radical than Blair in 1997.\u201d</p> <p>So it transpired. While Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto offered bold solutions to the economic and environmental crises, it had notably little to say about the deep democratic alienation felt across the country \u2013 the sense that politics is broken, driving so many to vote to \u201ctake back control\u201d. A sense that was justified.</p> <p>Travelling around the country before the election, it became clear that this constitutional conservatism was disastrous. Again and again, people would rail against elite rule. They would say \u201cthey\u2019re all liars\u201d, and \u201cI don\u2019t trust any of them\u201d. But rather than voting Labour for a new politics, many were voting Tory to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, to get politics out of the way.</p> <p>Had Labour articulated this yearning for change by raging against elite rule and giving people the chance to vote against the hated political system, it could have won. Instead, the party promised to use politics to improve our lives \u2013 and millions simply didn\u2019t believe it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a federal UK, sovereignty would lie not with the 'crown in parliament' but with the citizens of the country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In many ways they were right not to. Britain is the least democratic democracy in the western world. We have the most centralised government in Europe; a quasi-feudal voting system; a civil service that\u2019s increasingly outsourced to the Big Four accountancy firms; and a network of overseas territories and crown dependencies that, along with the constitutionally absurd City of London, forms the plumbing of the world\u2019s money laundry.</p> <p>And that\u2019s before I mention the embarrassment of the House of Lords, our mostly oligarch-owned media, the dark money shaping public debate, or the lack of a democratic codified constitution \u2013 a rare absence that puts us in the distinguished company of Saudi Arabia and Israel.</p> <p>Where normal democracies recognise that sovereignty lies with the people, Britain has always located it in \u201cthe crown in parliament\u201d, a magician\u2019s flourish that allows the ruling class to quietly get on with the business of ruling over us.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s leadership hopefuls seem to agree that the party needs to up its democratic game. Having been rent asunder by Scottish independence and Brexit, only fools continue to chant the old Labourist mantra that people aren\u2019t interested in the distribution of political power.</p> <p>Clive Lewis went <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/19/clive-lewis-joins-race-to-be-labour-leader-pledging-to-unleash-party\" title=\"\">first and furthest</a>, backing proportional representation, Scotland\u2019s right to self-determination and a referendum on the future of the monarchy. He didn\u2019t make it through the first round \u2013 partly because fellow MPs didn\u2019t like his suggestion that they should face more democratic accountability, too \u2013 but he did set the tone. Lisa Nandy launched her campaign by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/03/lisa-nandy-enters-labour-leadership-race-with-call-for-change\" title=\"\">calling for</a> devolution of decision-making to \u201cevery town, city, region and nation in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>Next was Rebecca Long-Bailey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/16/power-people-labour-party-voters-democratic-revolution\" title=\"\">calling for</a> \u201ca democratic revolution to take power out of the hands of unaccountable elites\u201d. \u201cThe British state needs a seismic shock,\u201d she wrote in the Guardian, \u201cto prise it open at all levels to the people \u2013 their knowledge, their skills, their demands.\u201d</p> <p>Then it was Keir Starmer\u2019s turn to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/KeirStarmerLabour/posts/\" title=\"\">lament</a> our broken political system: \u201cWe need to end the monopoly of power in Westminster \u2026 We need a new constitutional settlement: a large-scale devolution of power and resources.

Whereas Victorian Britons proudly lauded our uncodified constitution, these days we pretend that we don\u2019t have one, imagining it\u2019s only Americans who do.</p> <p>To work out what the contenders are saying, we must start with a simple question: are they trying to keep the show on the road? Or are they genuinely trying to democratise the UK? Are they proposing changes because they want to bend our ancient system to fit the modern age, demonstrating the centuries-old adaptability of the British ruling class? Or are they trying to actually end the elite rule at the core of our system?</p> <p>Specific policies \u2013 on the Lords, or local government, or the right to self-determination, or proportional representation \u2013 are important. But the way to sort the democrats from the technocrats is to look at how the respective candidates understand power.</p> <p>Each of the candidates has only given us a peek at their thoughts about democracy so far, and it will be interesting to watch the conversation unfurl. But there are some things we can learn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/nicola-sturgeon-to-publish-independence-referendum-blueprint\">Scottish independence vote a 'democratic right', says Sturgeon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her comments, Nandy talks about \u201cdevolution\u201d \u2013 which means lending power from above. \u201cPower devolved is power retained,\u201d as Tony Blair said, quoting Enoch Powell. Nandy refers to power \u201ccascading down\u201d, as though democracy starts at the centre.</p> <p>This is really just an extension of the hodge-podge approach started by Blair in 1997 and continued by George Osborne when he created new mayoralties. As Margaret Thatcher showed when she abolished the Greater London Council, such constitutional tinkering can usually be undone from the top. \u201cMore devolution\u201d isn\u2019t a constitutional revolution, it\u2019s another adaptation in the gradual evolution of a system that goes back to 1660. Nandy\u2019s team tell me that they are currently debating how far her soon-to-be-released manifesto should go on this very question. If she really hears the rage against the political machine, she\u2019ll go a lot further.</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s comments so far are more specific yet more confused. He talks both about devolution and \u201cthe principle of federalism\u201d. But these are not different words for the same thing. They are fundamentally opposing principles.</p> <p>Where devolution sees power lent out from the centre, federalism sees it rising up from the peoples. And so in a federal UK, sovereignty would lie not with the \u201ccrown in parliament\u201d but with the citizens of the country. As such, it would have to be codified in a written constitution.</p> <p>Long-Bailey hints at another approach. In her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/16/power-people-labour-party-voters-democratic-revolution\" title=\"\">Guardian </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/16/power-people-labour-party-voters-democratic-revolution\" title=\"\">article</a>, she said: \u201cPoliticians themselves will never upend the political system in the interests of the many not the few, but our movement can help the people of Britain make that change.\u201d</p> <p>She supports the right of the Scottish people to decide our constitutional future and has argued that the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly should be \u201con an equal footing\u201d with Westminster \u2013 which means ending the principle of Westminster sovereignty, so unravelling much of our broken system.</p> <p>A member of her team explained the broad approach. \u201cConstitutional reform must be anti-establishment, not technocratic. [It] must speak to people\u2019s lack of trust in the political system and the ability of politicians to deliver.\u201d</p> <p>Whether she will follow the logic from there to a fundamental rewriting of the rules of British democracy with a new democratic constitution fit for the modern era we will find out as Labour\u2019s leadership election splashes along.</p> <p>What should such a constitution include? That should be up to a constitutional convention to hammer out. But it shouldn\u2019t preclude Labour proposing ideas. Rather than cronies in the House of Lords marking the Commons\u2019 homework, why not appoint a jury of citizens to oversee each bill? Why not look to our European neighbours and enshrine power at the local level, making democratic participation part of our everyday lives, rather than a spectator sport?

      "bodyText": "A couple of years ago a small group of us were invited into parliament to discuss Labour\u2019s plans for democratic reform. When we arrived we were handed a document containing the policies the shadow cabinet office team had managed to steer through the party machine. I read it carefully, then gave my honest response: \u201cThis is less radical than Blair in 1997.\u201d So it transpired. While Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto offered bold solutions to the economic and environmental crises, it had notably little to say about the deep democratic alienation felt across the country \u2013 the sense that politics is broken, driving so many to vote to \u201ctake back control\u201d. A sense that was justified. Travelling around the country before the election, it became clear that this constitutional conservatism was disastrous. Again and again, people would rail against elite rule. They would say \u201cthey\u2019re all liars\u201d, and \u201cI don\u2019t trust any of them\u201d. But rather than voting Labour for a new politics, many were voting Tory to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, to get politics out of the way. Had Labour articulated this yearning for change by raging against elite rule and giving people the chance to vote against the hated political system, it could have won. Instead, the party promised to use politics to improve our lives \u2013 and millions simply didn\u2019t believe it. In many ways they were right not to. Britain is the least democratic democracy in the western world. We have the most centralised government in Europe; a quasi-feudal voting system; a civil service that\u2019s increasingly outsourced to the Big Four accountancy firms; and a network of overseas territories and crown dependencies that, along with the constitutionally absurd City of London, forms the plumbing of the world\u2019s money laundry. And that\u2019s before I mention the embarrassment of the House of Lords, our mostly oligarch-owned media, the dark money shaping public debate, or the lack of a democratic codified constitution \u2013 a rare absence that puts us in the distinguished company of Saudi Arabia and Israel. Where normal democracies recognise that sovereignty lies with the people, Britain has always located it in \u201cthe crown in parliament\u201d, a magician\u2019s flourish that allows the ruling class to quietly get on with the business of ruling over us. Labour\u2019s leadership hopefuls seem to agree that the party needs to up its democratic game. Having been rent asunder by Scottish independence and Brexit, only fools continue to chant the old Labourist mantra that people aren\u2019t interested in the distribution of political power. Clive Lewis went first and furthest, backing proportional representation, Scotland\u2019s right to self-determination and a referendum on the future of the monarchy. He didn\u2019t make it through the first round \u2013 partly because fellow MPs didn\u2019t like his suggestion that they should face more democratic accountability, too \u2013 but he did set the tone. Lisa Nandy launched her campaign by calling for devolution of decision-making to \u201cevery town, city, region and nation in the UK\u201d. Next was Rebecca Long-Bailey, calling for \u201ca democratic revolution to take power out of the hands of unaccountable elites\u201d. \u201cThe British state needs a seismic shock,\u201d she wrote in the Guardian, \u201cto prise it open at all levels to the people \u2013 their knowledge, their skills, their demands.\u201d Then it was Keir Starmer\u2019s turn to lament our broken political system: \u201cWe need to end the monopoly of power in Westminster \u2026 We need a new constitutional settlement: a large-scale devolution of power and resources. This will involve building a new long-term political and constitutional consensus. I believe that could best be built on the principle of federalism.\u201d With a broad consensus that Corbyn\u2019s economic proposals were mighty popular and with little difference emerging between the candidates on climate breakdown, it seems that any serious policy debate in this leadership election will be about the other great crisis we face: the death of democracy. We\u2019re not very good at this conversation in the UK. Whereas Victorian Britons proudly lauded our uncodified constitution, these days we pretend that we don\u2019t have one, imagining it\u2019s only Americans who do. To work out what the contenders are saying, we must start with a simple question: are they trying to keep the show on the road? Or are they genuinely trying to democratise the UK? Are they proposing changes because they want to bend our ancient system to fit the modern age, demonstrating the centuries-old adaptability of the British ruling class? Or are they trying to actually end the elite rule at the core of our system? Specific policies \u2013 on the Lords, or local government, or the right to self-determination, or proportional representation \u2013 are important. But the way to sort the democrats from the technocrats is to look at how the respective candidates understand power. Each of the candidates has only given us a peek at their thoughts about democracy so far, and it will be interesting to watch the conversation unfurl. But there are some things we can learn. In her comments, Nandy talks about \u201cdevolution\u201d \u2013 which means lending power from above. \u201cPower devolved is power retained,\u201d as Tony Blair said, quoting Enoch Powell. Nandy refers to power \u201ccascading down\u201d, as though democracy starts at the centre. This is really just an extension of the hodge-podge approach started by Blair in 1997 and continued by George Osborne when he created new mayoralties. As Margaret Thatcher showed when she abolished the Greater London Council, such constitutional tinkering can usually be undone from the top. \u201cMore devolution\u201d isn\u2019t a constitutional revolution, it\u2019s another adaptation in the gradual evolution of a system that goes back to 1660. Nandy\u2019s team tell me that they are currently debating how far her soon-to-be-released manifesto should go on this very question. If she really hears the rage against the political machine, she\u2019ll go a lot further. Starmer\u2019s comments so far are more specific yet more confused. He talks both about devolution and \u201cthe principle of federalism\u201d. But these are not different words for the same thing. They are fundamentally opposing principles. Where devolution sees power lent out from the centre, federalism sees it rising up from the peoples. And so in a federal UK, sovereignty would lie not with the \u201ccrown in parliament\u201d but with the citizens of the country. As such, it would have to be codified in a written constitution. Long-Bailey hints at another approach. In her Guardian article, she said: \u201cPoliticians themselves will never upend the political system in the interests of the many not the few, but our movement can help the people of Britain make that change.\u201d She supports the right of the Scottish people to decide our constitutional future and has argued that the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly should be \u201con an equal footing\u201d with Westminster \u2013 which means ending the principle of Westminster sovereignty, so unravelling much of our broken system. A member of her team explained the broad approach. \u201cConstitutional reform must be anti-establishment, not technocratic. [It] must speak to people\u2019s lack of trust in the political system and the ability of politicians to deliver.\u201d Whether she will follow the logic from there to a fundamental rewriting of the rules of British democracy with a new democratic constitution fit for the modern era we will find out as Labour\u2019s leadership election splashes along. What should such a constitution include? That should be up to a constitutional convention to hammer out. But it shouldn\u2019t preclude Labour proposing ideas. Rather than cronies in the House of Lords marking the Commons\u2019 homework, why not appoint a jury of citizens to oversee each bill? Why not look to our European neighbours and enshrine power at the local level, making democratic participation part of our everyday lives, rather than a spectator sport? Why not learn from the successful experiments with participatory budgeting in Latin America, and allow citizens to decide how their city budgets are spent? How can the UK justify refusing Scotland\u2019s right to self-determination? Surely a union that is not a voluntary association cannot truly think of itself as democratic? If Brexit was a howl of unvoiced Englishness, why not let them have a parliament, and let them see how wonderfully diverse they are? The Cayman Islands became a British territory under the treaty of Madrid in 1670, and remains a British tax haven to this day. Why not force it \u2013 and the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar and Bermuda \u2013 to accept UK corporation tax and transparency laws, or relinquish our military and diplomatic protection and become independent? The UK could follow the examples of the world\u2019s newer constitutions, such as those of Namibia and Bolivia, and enshrine the rights of our ecosystems. Or recognise the threats posed by mass surveillance and develop digital rights. How can we justify an electoral system that usually produces rightwing governments in a country where most people usually vote left or liberal? If we built a political system from the bottom up today, it would look nothing like Britain\u2019s. If Labour wants to look like a party of the future, it needs to start having this debate. Perhaps, though, this is the wrong question. The next Labour leader has five years of opposition ahead of them. As the SNP says, they won\u2019t even be able to deliver a pizza. What they will have power over is their own party. In the recent election Boris Johnson was seen to break the rules of a fusty institution to deliver the change people voted for. He prorogued parliament, dismissed MPs powerful in the previous regime, and demonstrated his will to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.

If the next Labour leader wants to demonstrate a commitment to democracy, then they should ensure their party embodies the change it says it wishes to see in the world. \u2022 Adam Ramsay is co-editor of openDemocracy.net UK and author of 42 Reasons to Support Scottish Independence",

It is still so shocking to us that we have had to fight so long and so hard just to get the government to see that their policy is unfair.\u201d</p> <p>Tessa Gregory from the law firm Leigh Day, which represented AR and TP, said the ruling was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the DWP.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope that the government will waste no more time or resources fighting this legal case and will instead get on with what it should have been doing in the first place: protecting this acutely vulnerable cohort of claimants and overhauling universal credit to make it fit for purpose.\u201d</p> <p>The DWP has seven days to decide whether to continue its attempt to overturn the two judgments by applying to the supreme court. A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cWe will continue to make transitional payments to those previously receiving the severe disability premium where eligible, and have already paid \u00a351.5m to more than 15,000 people. We are carefully considering this judgment.\u201d</p> <p>The court ruled in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/14/disabled-men-on-universal-credit-discriminated-against-high-court-rules\">first case in June 2018</a> that the cut was unlawful because claimants who had moved to a different local authority area where universal credit was in operation had been treated differently to those who had moved within their home borough where the new benefit had not yet arrived. TP and AR were awarded compensation plus continuing \u00a3180-a-month payments to meet their benefit shortfall.</p> <p>The government subsequently proposed new regulations to prevent other severely disabled people moving on to universal credit and to compensate those who already had done so. But it decided those who had moved on to the new system before 19 January 2019 would get just \u00a380 a month in compensation.</p> <p>TP and AR launched another legal challenge to this decision and in May 2019 the high court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/03/universal-credit-discrepancies-ruled-unlawful-by-high-court\">ruled this was unlawful</a>, as the estimated 10,000 people who moved before 19 January would receive significantly less in compensation than those who moved afterwards, despite their needs being the same.</p> <p>While appealing against both judgments in July, the government increased the proposed top-up payments to \u00a3120 a month, and a third legal challenge to this is pending, depending on whether the DWP decides to appeal the case further.</p> <p>Michael Bates from Central England Law Centre, which represented a third claimant in the second case, said: \u201cThere is no justification for the way these vulnerable claimants have been discriminated against and they [the government] should think very carefully about how to properly protect people in the transition to universal credit.\u201d</p> <p>Severe disability premium and the enhanced disability premium are benefit supplements specifically aimed at meeting the additional care needs and costs of severely disabled people living alone with no carer.

The cases were brought by two disabled individuals, known as TP and AR, who had sought justice after their benefit income was reduced by \u00a3180 a month when they were required to claim universal credit after moving house into a different local authority area. Responding to Wednesday\u2019s decision, AR said: \u201cWe hope that the court of appeal ruling will finally bring an end to our fight for severely disabled people not to be disadvantaged by universal credit. It is still so shocking to us that we have had to fight so long and so hard just to get the government to see that their policy is unfair.\u201d Tessa Gregory from the law firm Leigh Day, which represented AR and TP, said the ruling was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the DWP. \u201cWe hope that the government will waste no more time or resources fighting this legal case and will instead get on with what it should have been doing in the first place: protecting this acutely vulnerable cohort of claimants and overhauling universal credit to make it fit for purpose.\u201d The DWP has seven days to decide whether to continue its attempt to overturn the two judgments by applying to the supreme court. A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cWe will continue to make transitional payments to those previously receiving the severe disability premium where eligible, and have already paid \u00a351.5m to more than 15,000 people. We are carefully considering this judgment.\u201d The court ruled in the first case in June 2018 that the cut was unlawful because claimants who had moved to a different local authority area where universal credit was in operation had been treated differently to those who had moved within their home borough where the new benefit had not yet arrived. TP and AR were awarded compensation plus continuing \u00a3180-a-month payments to meet their benefit shortfall. The government subsequently proposed new regulations to prevent other severely disabled people moving on to universal credit and to compensate those who already had done so. But it decided those who had moved on to the new system before 19 January 2019 would get just \u00a380 a month in compensation. TP and AR launched another legal challenge to this decision and in May 2019 the high court ruled this was unlawful, as the estimated 10,000 people who moved before 19 January would receive significantly less in compensation than those who moved afterwards, despite their needs being the same. While appealing against both judgments in July, the government increased the proposed top-up payments to \u00a3120 a month, and a third legal challenge to this is pending, depending on whether the DWP decides to appeal the case further. Michael Bates from Central England Law Centre, which represented a third claimant in the second case, said: \u201cThere is no justification for the way these vulnerable claimants have been discriminated against and they [the government] should think very carefully about how to properly protect people in the transition to universal credit.\u201d Severe disability premium and the enhanced disability premium are benefit supplements specifically aimed at meeting the additional care needs and costs of severely disabled people living alone with no carer. They were scrapped under universal credit.",

Or will we move into a new era, in which global Britain will benefit from skills and talent from all over the world, rather than simply sucking in cheap labour from the rest of Europe?</p> <p>The answer is likely to be somewhere in between. What is certain is that these proposals are far more liberal than anything we could have expected from Theresa May. Immigration-bashers and nativists in the Conservative party and beyond will find this uncomfortable \u2013 particularly the resulting increase in immigration from outside the EU. But immigration is a less salient issue among the electorate than it was in 2016, and public perceptions of the economic and social impact of immigration on the UK are far more positive than they were at the time of the referendum. For some people, at least, ending freedom of movement - and hence restoring \u201ccontrol\u201d over immigration - may be more important than guaranteeing lower numbers of migrants.</p> <p>So there are grounds for at least cautious optimism. Contrary to the hopes and fears of many, Brexit looks less like it will make a decisive turn towards restricting immigration. Instead, consistent with the more benign aspects of our history, it may signal a different form of openness.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London, and is a senior fellow at UK in a Changing Europe</p>",

There will need to be consultation, particularly with employers, if not on the big decisions then on a host of second-order questions; and then there will need to be time for business to get used to the new system, which will be considerably more costly and burdensome than freedom of movement. For many employers that depend on immigrant workers from the EU, and therefore don\u2019t need to interact with the immigration system at all under the current arrangements, this is not simply a matter of extending and tweaking existing processes and procedures. Businesses (particularly small ones) will suddenly find there are Home Office forms to fill in, fees to pay, and time-consuming bureaucracy to navigate. Time is short \u2013 by the summer, employers will want to know what to say when making job offers to EU nationals. The most important immediate impact of Brexit for business will be lots more red tape. So will post-Brexit Britain, without free movement, become closed to all except the \u201cbrightest and best\u201d, vindicating Brexiteers who voted to restrict immigration and slow the pace of demographic and social change? Or will we move into a new era, in which global Britain will benefit from skills and talent from all over the world, rather than simply sucking in cheap labour from the rest of Europe? The answer is likely to be somewhere in between. What is certain is that these proposals are far more liberal than anything we could have expected from Theresa May. Immigration-bashers and nativists in the Conservative party and beyond will find this uncomfortable \u2013 particularly the resulting increase in immigration from outside the EU. But immigration is a less salient issue among the electorate than it was in 2016, and public perceptions of the economic and social impact of immigration on the UK are far more positive than they were at the time of the referendum. For some people, at least, ending freedom of movement - and hence restoring \u201ccontrol\u201d over immigration - may be more important than guaranteeing lower numbers of migrants. So there are grounds for at least cautious optimism. Contrary to the hopes and fears of many, Brexit looks less like it will make a decisive turn towards restricting immigration. Instead, consistent with the more benign aspects of our history, it may signal a different form of openness. \u2022 Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London, and is a senior fellow at UK in a Changing Europe",

      "body": "<p>The future of the privatised rail system was thrown into further doubt on Wednesday as the government announced the renationalisation of the struggling Northern rail franchise.</p> <p>The decision to end Arriva\u2019s contract was welcomed by many in the north of England, with the mayors of Manchester and Liverpool branding it a \u201cvictory for passengers\u201d after years of widespread train cancellations and delays. The state operator of last resort will take over running of the services from 1 March.</p> <p>The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: \u201cThis is a new beginning but it is only a beginning. Northern\u2019s network is huge and complex and some of the things that are wrong are not going to be quick or easy to put right. But I am determined that Northern passengers see real and tangible improvements across the network as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the current privatised model was not working, saying: \u201cWe know change is needed and change is coming.\u201d</p> <p>Unions and campaigners welcomed the move but said it should be followed by broader nationalisation, while the rail industry demanded the urgent publication of a government review spelling out plans for reform.</p> <p>The Northern franchise has been run by Arriva, a subsidiary of Germany\u2019s state-owned Deutsche Bahn, since 2016 but the operator\u2019s ambitious plans to modernise and expand train services gave way to a grim reality of worsening punctuality and reliability, and a failure to achieve promised improvements.</p> <p>Northern is the biggest franchise in England by the length of its route network and serves more than 500 stations north of Derby. It also receives the biggest state subsidy for its operations, running at \u00a3763m last year, including indirect funding for track access.</p> <p>In a written ministerial statement, Shapps said a cross-industry rail taskforce would be set up to help north-west England\u2019s railways recover, while the new state operator would produce a masterplan of local infrastructure improvements needed to help services run smoothly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/28/northern-rail-passengers-uk-franchise\">Northern rail passengers least satisfied in the UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The transport secretary had announced earlier in January that Northern\u2019s finances meant that the current franchise arrangement could only last months. Shapps eventually decided against accepting proposals from Arriva for a short-term management contract, which northern transport authorities had described as a \u201creward for failure\u201d.</p> <p>Arriva said many of the problems were unprecedented and out of its control, such as postponed infrastructure upgrades that affected the rollout of more electric trains, leading to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/01/northern-rail-criticised-pacers-to-run-until-2020-despite-pledge-to-retire\">prolonged retention of the infamous Pacer trains</a>. Meanwhile, a long-running dispute with the RMT union led to widespread strikes.</p> <p>Chris Burchell, Arriva\u2019s managing director for UK Trains, said: \u201cWe had a clear vision for the Northern franchise that would better connect the cities of the north with more frequent, reliable and modern services and unlock economic growth. It was clear however that, largely because of external factors, the franchise plan had become undeliverable.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognise however that overall service improvements have not come quickly enough, and passengers deserve better.

      "bodyText": "The future of the privatised rail system was thrown into further doubt on Wednesday as the government announced the renationalisation of the struggling Northern rail franchise. The decision to end Arriva\u2019s contract was welcomed by many in the north of England, with the mayors of Manchester and Liverpool branding it a \u201cvictory for passengers\u201d after years of widespread train cancellations and delays. The state operator of last resort will take over running of the services from 1 March. The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: \u201cThis is a new beginning but it is only a beginning. Northern\u2019s network is huge and complex and some of the things that are wrong are not going to be quick or easy to put right. But I am determined that Northern passengers see real and tangible improvements across the network as soon as possible.\u201d He added that the current privatised model was not working, saying: \u201cWe know change is needed and change is coming.\u201d Unions and campaigners welcomed the move but said it should be followed by broader nationalisation, while the rail industry demanded the urgent publication of a government review spelling out plans for reform. The Northern franchise has been run by Arriva, a subsidiary of Germany\u2019s state-owned Deutsche Bahn, since 2016 but the operator\u2019s ambitious plans to modernise and expand train services gave way to a grim reality of worsening punctuality and reliability, and a failure to achieve promised improvements. Northern is the biggest franchise in England by the length of its route network and serves more than 500 stations north of Derby. It also receives the biggest state subsidy for its operations, running at \u00a3763m last year, including indirect funding for track access. In a written ministerial statement, Shapps said a cross-industry rail taskforce would be set up to help north-west England\u2019s railways recover, while the new state operator would produce a masterplan of local infrastructure improvements needed to help services run smoothly. The transport secretary had announced earlier in January that Northern\u2019s finances meant that the current franchise arrangement could only last months. Shapps eventually decided against accepting proposals from Arriva for a short-term management contract, which northern transport authorities had described as a \u201creward for failure\u201d. Arriva said many of the problems were unprecedented and out of its control, such as postponed infrastructure upgrades that affected the rollout of more electric trains, leading to the prolonged retention of the infamous Pacer trains. Meanwhile, a long-running dispute with the RMT union led to widespread strikes. Chris Burchell, Arriva\u2019s managing director for UK Trains, said: \u201cWe had a clear vision for the Northern franchise that would better connect the cities of the north with more frequent, reliable and modern services and unlock economic growth. It was clear however that, largely because of external factors, the franchise plan had become undeliverable. \u201cWe recognise however that overall service improvements have not come quickly enough, and passengers deserve better. For that, we wholeheartedly apologise.\u201d The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and the Liverpool mayor, Steve Rotheram, welcomed the news, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s news is a victory for passengers who have had to endure almost two years of misery and mayhem on Northern rail.\u201d But they said it was \u201conly the start of fixing the north\u2019s railways\u201d, calling on the government to commit to investing in modern rail infrastructure required. The decision means the Conservatives have nationalised two major rail franchises in less than two years, after taking over the east coast line in June 2018, now run as LNER after the collapse of Virgin Trains East Coast. Shapps last week said that the future of another, South West Railway, was in doubt, after the First Group-MTR joint-venture said it was running out of cash. Questions also hang over the TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains franchises. Unions said Northern would need \u201csignificant investment\u201d to turn it round. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, said: \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s decision because we want the railway in public ownership but let\u2019s do it properly, with a clear, long-term, strategic vision, not just as a short-term response to the years of franchised failure. \u201cThere won\u2019t be an immediate improvement because many of the systemic failures at Northern cannot be remedied overnight.\u201d The RMT union predicted the decision would \u201copen the floodgates\u201d for other franchises to be taken in to the public sector. Mick Cash, the general secretary, said it should not be a short-term fix: \u201cThis has to be a permanent move followed up with the investment and planning needed to deliver the rail services that passengers deserve after years of privatised chaos.\u201d A root-and-branch review of the rail industry, which will recommend replacing the current system of franchising, has been completed by the former British Airways boss Keith Williams but is yet to be published by the Department for Transport. The industry body the Rail Delivery Group said that Northern had been \u201chamstrung by a flawed industry structure\u201d. Their chief executive, Paul Plummer, said: \u201cThe industry\u2019s proposals to the review set out a radical alternative to the status quo. This review must be published urgently.\u201d Passengers in Manchester had few good words to say for Northern but were mixed in their view of whether nationalisation would help. Simon Kendall, 45, a freelance IT consultant, said his 30-minute commute from Littleborough to Salford Central was often \u201cnothing but appalling\u201d, with trains often delayed, cancelled or overcrowded, with fewer carriages than usual. \u201cI was on a train last year and rain was coming in through the roof, and newspapers were used to mop up the water.\u201d However, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether public ownership will work unless they decide to invest in the infrastructure.

      "bodyText": "Members of the Muslim community in Rotherham are launching a neighbourhood protection group with more than 100 volunteers after three mosques were targeted by the far-right. The new body, which will be styled on the Shomrim group in Jewish communities, said it would aim to provide reassurance and possibly self-defence training for imams in light of the security concerns. The far-right group Britain First has carried out what it described as a \u201cmajor operation\u201d in the South Yorkshire town over the past week, distributing leaflets and visiting mosques, taxi ranks and hotels to warn about grooming of young girls for sex. The attempt to inflame tensions followed a newspaper report this month about a police watchdog investigation into an unidentified officer who apparently told a grooming victim\u2019s father that the police could do nothing about the abuse \u201cbecause of racial tensions\u201d if it became public. A damning report in 2014 found that failures in political and police leadership had contributed to the abuse of more than 1,400 children, largely by men of Pakistani heritage, over a 16-year period. Similar patterns of abuse \u2013 and failures in civic leadership \u2013 have since emerged in towns and cities across England but the issue remains particularly sensitive in Rotherham. There were 14 far-right demonstrations and an 81-year-old Muslim man was killed in a racially motivated attack in the year after the report. Muhbeen Hussain, the Rotherham-born founder of British Muslim Youth who is setting up the new group, with the Rotherham Muslim Community Forum, said members of the Muslim community were fearful that Britain First could reignite tensions with its latest campaign. He said more than 100 people had already volunteered for the new body, which will be called Muhafiz (\u201cguardian\u201d), and that its first priority would be coordinating between mosques and South Yorkshire police. Britain First \u201cwere able to visit three mosques and nobody was aware, there was no coordination\u201d, he said. He said one man had been approached and threatened outside a taxi rank last week and was told: \u201cBritain First are here now \u2013 you better get ready and watch what we do to you.\u201d South Yorkshire police said they had received no reports of offences having taken place but had been carrying out extra patrols around the mosques this week. \u201cAfter what happened in New Zealand people were saying: \u2018Thank God nothing serious happened,\u2019\u201d said Hussain, referring to the terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year that left 51 people dead and dozens more injured.",

The Polish-born director fled from the US to France in 1978 after admitting the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl and he has been a fugitive from the US justice system ever since, despite repeated attempts to have him extradited. His film, An Officer and a Spy, about the persecution of a French Jewish army officer, Alfred Dreyfus, is in contention for 12 C\u00e9sars, the French equivalent of Oscars, including best film and best director. Just before its November release, a French photographer, Valentine Monnier, accused Polanski of raping her in a Swiss ski resort when she was a teenager. Monnier said Polanski tried to give her a pill and beat her \u201cinto submission\u201d at his chalet in Gstaad when she was an 18-year-old model and actor. The accusations sparked a backlash against the film, publicity was curtailed and some screenings were cancelled after feminist protesters invaded or blockaded cinemas. Despite this, the film did well at the box office in France, with more than 1.5m ticket sales. The campaign group Osez Le F\u00e9minisme said the nominations brought shame on the C\u00e9sars and showed that France was out of step with the #MeToo movement. It said acclaiming him was equivalent to \u201csilencing victims\u201d. It noted that another nominee, Ad\u00e8le Haenel, who is up for best female actor for her role in Portrait of a Lady on Fire, claimed that she was sexually harassed and assaulted from the age of 12 by the French director Christophe Ruggia on her first film.

Polanski sparked an uproar at the Venice film festival last summer by comparing his \u201chounding\u201d to the antisemitic persecution of Dreyfus, the army officer at the centre of his new film. An Officer and a Spy received no Oscar nominations, while another French film, Les Mis\u00e9rables, was shortlisted in the best foreign film category. Les Mis\u00e9rables has been nominated for 11 C\u00e9sars, just behind the Polanski film\u2019s 12.",

More than 80 case studies clearly showing such links were uncovered as part of the research.</p> <p>Gender-based violence includes domestic violence, sexual assault and rape, forced prostitution, forced marriage and child marriage, as well as other forms of the exploitation of women. The report found human trafficking rises in areas where the natural environment is under stress, and links between gender-based violence and environmental crimes such as wildlife poaching and illegal resource extraction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/activists-protest-un-climate-talks\">Activists protest at \u2018sidelining of social justice\u2019 at UN climate talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cGender-based violence is one of the most pervasive but least talked-about barriers that face us in conservation and climate work,\u201d said Owern. \u201cWe need to take the blinders off, and pay this concerted attention.\u201d</p> <p>Owren found abundant examples of the close links between gender-based violence and the exploitation of women and girls, and the competition for resources engendered by the impacts of global heating and our destruction of the natural environment. For instance, sexual abuse was found in the illegal fishing industry in south-east Asia, and in eastern and southern Africa fishermen reportedly refused to sell fish to women if they did not engage in sex. The illegal logging and charcoal trade in the Democratic Republic of Congo is linked to sexual exploitation, and in Colombia and Peru illegal mines are strongly associated with an increase in sex trafficking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9b8fb3c377b5e6c92d1099992911e8162bc0bc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9b8fb3c377b5e6c92d1099992911e8162bc0bc9/0_109_4153_2492/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colombian miner search for gold near a gold mine that collapsed in San Antonio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The report found a strong link between illegal mining in Colombia and an increase in sex trafficking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have also been numerous examples of gender-based violence directed against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-defenders\">environmental defenders and activists</a>, who try to stop the destruction or degradation of their land, natural resources and communities. Sexual violence is used to suppress them, undermine their status within the community and discourage others from coming forward.</p> <p>Yet few projects that are aimed at conservation and improving the environment, or tackling the climate crisis, display any recognition of these issues, according to the report. </p> <p>Global heating puts pressure on resources, as extreme weather, including heatwaves, droughts, floods and fiercer storms, grows more frequent and devastating. In most parts of the world, women are already disadvantaged and lack land rights and legal rights, so are vulnerable to exploitation. When the additional stresses caused by the climate crises bite, they are the first to be targeted. For instance, in some communities, young girls are married off as early as possible when the family faces hardship exacerbated by the climate. Globally, about 12 million more young girls are thought to have been married off after increasing natural disasters, and weather related disasters have been shown to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/dec/13/slavery-climate-change-poverty\">increase sexual trafficking</a> by 20-30%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/charity-wont-fix-inequality-only-structural-change-will\">Charity won't fix inequality.

This study shows that the damage humanity is inflicting on nature is also fuelling violence against women around the world \u2013 a link that has so far been largely overlooked.\u201d</p> <p>At the UN climate conference in Madrid last December, governments were criticised by campaigners for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/activists-protest-un-climate-talks\">ignoring the plight of women and children and the threats they face</a>. </p> <p>Some governments are moving to put action for women and girls into their climate and development policies, and the UN in Madrid moved to include a gender action plan as part of the climate negotiations.

A spokesperson said: \u201cWomen and girls can be disproportionately affected by climate change. This is why we\u2019re spending UK aid on helping to promote gender equality, as well as leading the fight against climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in writing the report, said: \u201cThis report highlights the complex but clear link between growing climate change impacts and violence against women and girls. </p> <p>He pointed to the role that female campaigners were playing in bringing the world\u2019s attention to the problems. \u201cWhen we see the inspiring leadership of female activists like Greta Thunberg, we should recognise that the lives and livelihoods of women and girls around the world are particularly threatened by climate change,\u201d said Ward. \u201cThe empowerment of women and girls and their protection from the direct and indirect consequences of climate change must lie at the heart of the just transition to zero-carbon and climate-resilient societies.\u201d</p> <p>The report also provided a timely reminder that \u201cconcerted action to tackle inequality can unlock new opportunities for climate action and women\u2019s empowerment\u201d, added Mary Robinson, chair of The Elders. \u201cWe need to recognise the unequal effects of the climate crisis on women, but also that women\u2019s participation brings with it creative and sustainable solutions to both the climate emergency and social injustices. Tackling climate change and environmental degradation without the full inclusion of women will not succeed: gender equality is a prerequisite to the collective effort needed to address the climate emergency.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Climate breakdown and the global crisis of environmental degradation are increasing violence against women and girls, while gender-based exploitation is in turn hampering our ability to tackle the crises, a major report has concluded. Attempts to repair environmental degradation and adapt to climate breakdown, particularly in poorer countries, are failing, and resources are being wasted because they do not take gender inequality and the effects on women and girls into account. Campaigners called for governments and institutions to take note, saying that the impacts on women and girls must be at the heart of any viable strategies on the climate and ecology. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) carried out what is understood to be the biggest and most comprehensive study yet of the issue, taking two years and involving more than 1,000 sources of research. \u201cWe found gender-based violence to be pervasive, and there is enough clear evidence to suggest that climate change is increasing gender-based violence,\u201d said Cate Owren, a lead author of the report, published on Wednesday. \u201cAs environmental degradation and stress on ecosystems increases, that in turn creates scarcity and stress for people, and the evidence shows that, where environmental pressures increase, gender-based violence increases.\u201d Six in 10 respondents to a survey by IUCN, with more than 300 responses from organisations around the world, said they had observed gender-based violence among female environmental rights defenders, environmental migrants and refugees, and in areas where environmental crimes and environmental degradation were taking place. More than 80 case studies clearly showing such links were uncovered as part of the research. Gender-based violence includes domestic violence, sexual assault and rape, forced prostitution, forced marriage and child marriage, as well as other forms of the exploitation of women. The report found human trafficking rises in areas where the natural environment is under stress, and links between gender-based violence and environmental crimes such as wildlife poaching and illegal resource extraction. \u201cGender-based violence is one of the most pervasive but least talked-about barriers that face us in conservation and climate work,\u201d said Owern. \u201cWe need to take the blinders off, and pay this concerted attention.\u201d Owren found abundant examples of the close links between gender-based violence and the exploitation of women and girls, and the competition for resources engendered by the impacts of global heating and our destruction of the natural environment. For instance, sexual abuse was found in the illegal fishing industry in south-east Asia, and in eastern and southern Africa fishermen reportedly refused to sell fish to women if they did not engage in sex. The illegal logging and charcoal trade in the Democratic Republic of Congo is linked to sexual exploitation, and in Colombia and Peru illegal mines are strongly associated with an increase in sex trafficking. There have also been numerous examples of gender-based violence directed against environmental defenders and activists, who try to stop the destruction or degradation of their land, natural resources and communities. Sexual violence is used to suppress them, undermine their status within the community and discourage others from coming forward. Yet few projects that are aimed at conservation and improving the environment, or tackling the climate crisis, display any recognition of these issues, according to the report. Global heating puts pressure on resources, as extreme weather, including heatwaves, droughts, floods and fiercer storms, grows more frequent and devastating. In most parts of the world, women are already disadvantaged and lack land rights and legal rights, so are vulnerable to exploitation. When the additional stresses caused by the climate crises bite, they are the first to be targeted. For instance, in some communities, young girls are married off as early as possible when the family faces hardship exacerbated by the climate. Globally, about 12 million more young girls are thought to have been married off after increasing natural disasters, and weather related disasters have been shown to increase sexual trafficking by 20-30%. Women and girls are also burdened with tasks such as drawing water and finding firewood, which are becoming more scarce in many areas under the ecological impact of our scramble for resources, and which expose them to further dangers of violence. Grethel Aguilar, acting director-general of the IUCN, said: \u201cEnvironmental degradation now affects our lives in ways that are becoming impossible to ignore, from food to jobs to security. This study shows that the damage humanity is inflicting on nature is also fuelling violence against women around the world \u2013 a link that has so far been largely overlooked.\u201d At the UN climate conference in Madrid last December, governments were criticised by campaigners for ignoring the plight of women and children and the threats they face. Some governments are moving to put action for women and girls into their climate and development policies, and the UN in Madrid moved to include a gender action plan as part of the climate negotiations. Campaigners and some countries are hoping for even greater focus on the issue at the crunch UN climate talks in November, to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow. The UK\u2019s department for international development said it was already factoring in gender issues in climate change funding, including a large-scale study on violence against women and girls during the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, where about three quarters of women and girls who had been in a relationship experienced violence at the hands of their partner. A spokesperson said: \u201cWomen and girls can be disproportionately affected by climate change. This is why we\u2019re spending UK aid on helping to promote gender equality, as well as leading the fight against climate change.\u201d Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in writing the report, said: \u201cThis report highlights the complex but clear link between growing climate change impacts and violence against women and girls. He pointed to the role that female campaigners were playing in bringing the world\u2019s attention to the problems. \u201cWhen we see the inspiring leadership of female activists like Greta Thunberg, we should recognise that the lives and livelihoods of women and girls around the world are particularly threatened by climate change,\u201d said Ward. \u201cThe empowerment of women and girls and their protection from the direct and indirect consequences of climate change must lie at the heart of the just transition to zero-carbon and climate-resilient societies.\u201d The report also provided a timely reminder that \u201cconcerted action to tackle inequality can unlock new opportunities for climate action and women\u2019s empowerment\u201d, added Mary Robinson, chair of The Elders. \u201cWe need to recognise the unequal effects of the climate crisis on women, but also that women\u2019s participation brings with it creative and sustainable solutions to both the climate emergency and social injustices. Tackling climate change and environmental degradation without the full inclusion of women will not succeed: gender equality is a prerequisite to the collective effort needed to address the climate emergency.\u201d",

Had the sans serifs risen up against their pointy overlords and Tipp-Exed them out? No. The author Sean Richardson had asked the internet to \u201creveal the deepest part of yourself: Which font and which size do you write in?\u201d, little realising he was about to open a Pandora\u2019s box of preference and prejudice. Arial 12 pt, replied Poirot novelist and bestselling crime author Sophie Hannah. For Hugo-winning American science fiction author John Scalzi, it\u2019s Georgia, 12-point, single-spaced, and \u201cwhen I\u2019m done, I double-space the entire document and put it into Courier, again 12pt\u201d.

Since then the skies have cleared and events on court have proceeded in an orderly fashion. </p> <p>In the men\u2019s draw, of the five men left standing only one - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/05/after-the-fall-can-alexander-zverev-bounce-back-to-tennis-stardom\">Alexander Zverev</a> - is not ranked among the top five, but even he is still seeded seven, and arrived at last year\u2019s event ranked fourth. The pair of favourites, Nadal and Novak Djokovic, have dropped just one set apiece. </p> <p>Fortunately Roger Federer has been on hand to provide enough drama to make this a memorable championship. If tonight\u2019s match is half as engrossing as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/28/roger-federer-performs-great-escape-in-five-set-thriller-against-tennys-sandgren\">Federer\u2019s miraculous escape from the clutches of Tennys Sandgren</a> yesterday then we are in for a treat.</p> <p>Nadal has grown into his Australian summer after looking below par during the ATP Cup. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/nick-kyrgios-shows-resilience-but-cannot-halt-defeat-to-rafael-nadal\">trademark steely determination </a>was on display against Nick Kyrgios in round four. </p> <p>Thiem was taken the distance by wildcard Alex Bolt in round two. Since then he has hit his straps and looked particularly impressive last time out against the dangerous Gael Monfils. This is the furthest the Austrian has even journeyed at this event.</p> <p>Both men are at home on clay, not hard courts, so expect plenty of long baseline exchanges. The Australian sun has shone brightly today so any war of attrition suits Zverev, who awaits in the semi-final after he overcame a sluggish start to down Stan Wawrinka earlier. </p> <p>This is always more fun if you join in, so feel free to share your thoughts via email <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com</a> or Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">@JPHowcroft</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ecb95e30049d1bb8a086ab6e05a11fb72058c01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ecb95e30049d1bb8a086ab6e05a11fb72058c01/0_0_1611_1754/918.jpg\" alt=\"Rafael Nadal\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafael Nadal is bidding for only his second Australian Open title.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chine Nouvelle/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T08:04:16.004Z\">at 8.04am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Time to sign off here after an enthralling four sets. I\u2019ll leave you with another snippet from Thiem post-match, as he prepares to take on Alexander Zverev in two days\u2019 time: \u201cI think it\u2019s the first time I am playing a Grand Slam semi-final and I am the older player.\u201d Thanks to Jonathan and Tom for doing the hard yards earlier, and huge thanks as always for reading. Here\u2019s our report on the match. Bye! Tumaini Carayol of this parish reminds us of some of the backroom shenanigans in the Thiem camp. He has just dropped Thomas Muster, a former world No 1 and French Open champion, after a short spell working together. Speaking to the media after the match, Nadal said: I don\u2019t give up one moment during the match. I gave myself an opportunity until the last moment, so I\u2019m happy for that, because my level of concentration and tennis was better I think. My tennis was not bad at all \u2013 it was difficult to play against him. I\u2019m happy \u2026 [I could have had] a little bit more determination in some moments, true.\u201d Nadal fan Renata asks: \u201cHey, I was wondering if you know whether Rafa shook hands with the umpire after the match? Btw I\u2019m not surprised by the result. Anyone who watches the clay court season knows Dominic was always going to do this to Rafa in time. He is younger. It amazes me how hard he hits it given his size. I assume it must be timing. Go Thiem.\u201d Looks like a handshake happens just before just after the 8secs point in this clip \u2026 I get the sense that Nadal was infinitely more frustrated by the occasionally forgiving nature of the net cord than the umpire on this occasion. Here\u2019s an early report from the match \u2026 Some more post-match comments from the Austrian: I think all the match was on a very good level, I think we were both on great form. We already had this epic match in New York two years ago. Today I was really feeling I was lucky in the right situations. The net cord was really on my side. He\u2019s one of the biggest legends this sport\u2019s ever had so you need some luck to beat him. I\u2019m full of adrenaline, full of happy moments.\u201d Some of the key stats from a gripping quarter-final \u2026 Aces Nadal 11, Thiem 14 Double faults Nadal 3, Thiem 4 1st serve in % Nadal 70, Thiem 59 Win 1st serve % Nadal 69, Thiem 78 Win second serve % Nadal 52, Thiem 49 Break points won Nadal 4/9, Thiem 3/8 Winners Nadal 49, Thiem 65 Unforced errors Nadal 33, Thiem 49 Fastest serve Nadal 124mph, Thiem 127mph Courtside with Jim Courier, discussing the topsy-turvy fourth set, Thiem said: I just wanted to stay in the match. It was a special situation for me, serving for the match against Rafa. It\u2019s such a mentally tough situation \u2013 I couldn\u2019t handle it! But I turned it around in the tie-breaker. It\u2019s a little bit \u2018demons in the head\u2019, as Roger has said. I was just rushing too much \u2026 changing my tactics. You have to deal with these situations almost every single game.\u201d Cheers Tom, and blimey. Once again serial lunch-delayer Nadal made a two-set deficit look like the merest of blips, but Thiem managed to overcome some late-fourth-set jitters to see it out. Did anyone really think that was going to be a straight-sets victory for the world No 5? If anything it\u2019s more of a surprise that it didn\u2019t go to a fifth. Still, the Austrian progresses to a first Melbourne semi-final where he will face Alexander Zverev. Phew. That was quite the absorbing encounter, at which point I\u2019ll pass the baton over to Stuart Goodwin to gauge some reaction and post-match analysis. Thanks. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6 Thiem A fantastic crosscourt backhand pass from Thiem flicks the netcord again, but he deserved it for the shot\u2019s stylish audacity. It\u2019s another match point \u2013 and this time he\u2019s got it, forced wide by Nadal\u2019s return but keeping him pinned to the back of the court, and the Spaniard dumps it into the net to seal a superb win for Thiem. Rafa\u2019s Melbourne angst goes on. What a display of steel and, at times, style this has been from the Austrian. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6 Thiem Thiem loses his footing during another absorbing rally, but recovers swiftly and eventually has the point when Nadal pushes a backhand wide. Nadal makes no mistake next point to pull it back to 5-3, and prevails in another punishing rally to reduce the deficit to only one. A brilliant first serve from Thiem is then netted to give him two match points. But he chokes again! Thumping what his mind was doubtless telling him was a historic forehand winner into the net. He\u2019s lost the mini-break. Then, strangeness, as Thiem\u2019s lob is called in, Nadal half-heartedly challenges, and is vindicated, as it is indeed out. The Spaniard stays in the championship. Ah man, this is absurdly tense. Can Thiem regroup again? Nadal 6-6 Thiem Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6 Thiem They have to replay the point when the line judge is caught in two minds about a Thiem shot that initially looked heading out but wasn\u2019t. And it continues to go against serve as Thiem\u2019s aggressive tenacity induces an overhit forehand from Nadal. He then nets needlessly to put Thiem in the box seat again at 3-2. Can he make the next point count? He can, following one of the rallies of the match, settled with a low backhand volley that\u2019s too good for his opponent. Nadal 2-4 Thiem* Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6 Thiem First blood in the tie-break to Thiem, forcing an error from the back of the court from Nadal to gain a mini-break, but he squanders the advantage by netting a lame angled drop shot, a wild backhand then gives Nadal the advantage. Nadal* 2-1 Thiem Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-6 Thiem ( *denotes next server) If Thiem wins this match from here, it\u2019ll reflect very well on his temperament. Rafa\u2019s temparament, we know rather more about. And his talent of course, which manifests itself here in a stunning backhand volley on the stretch at the net for 0-15. Thiem responds well with a couple of fine first serves, and then gets some more net-cord fortune with a diagonal forehand that just plops over the net with Rafa beached. An effortlessly wonderful forehand down the line from Nadal makes it 40-30, but he overhits a return next point. Rafa\u2019s what-the-hell challenge is ruled out and it\u2019s a tie-break. Again. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 6-5 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Nadal, bit between teeth now, races to a 30-0 lead on his serve, though an overhit backhand grants Thiem the next point. The Spaniard then nudges Thiem around the court to induce a lame return to the net, but his opponent\u2019s response is good, a steely forehand volley at the net taking it back to 40-30. But it can\u2019t stop Nadal wrapping up the game with another strong wide first serve. Now Thiem must serve to save this set. Fourth set: Nadal* 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 5-5 Thiem ( *denotes next server) And Rafa roars back. Thiem begins confidently, bullying a bouncing forehand down the middle past Nadal, but then the yips strike. The Austrian overhits a low return next point. Then, a horrible double-fault that can only be attributed to jitters \u2013 the second was a metre or so too long \u2013 and a cramped forehand into the net then hands Nadal two break points. A nerveless first serve saves the first of them, but not the second, Thiem overhitting a cross-court forehand. Nadal is back back back in this match. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 4-5 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Nadal cruises to 30-0 as if he hasn\u2019t a care in the world, but then pushes a long forehand too wide following a brief rally. A slanting ace was never going to be reached by Thiem, who responds well by pressuring from the net on the next point and forcing the error for 40-30. But Nadal serves well and keeps the pressure on Thiem as he prepares to serve for the match and a fifth grand slam semi-final place. Fourth set: Nadal* 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 3-5 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Thiem begins with an ace but Nadal skilfully outlasts the Austrian in the next, very lengthy, point, eventually being offered an easy forehand pass at the net. A wonderful whipped forehand to the corner is Thiem\u2019s response before Nadal nets a spinning backhand for 40-15. Thiem loses another challenge, when he erroneously queries a first serve out. He challenges on the next point too following a fine forehand down the line. And this proves to be a vital challenge, which he could easily have bottled. It\u2019s in! He\u2019s one game away from the semi-finals. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 3-4 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) The luck is with Thiem as one of those gruelling, nerveless rallies is more or less settled when a slight net-cord deflects the Austrian\u2019s winner past a motionless Nadal, who then dumps a low forehand on the half-volley into the net for 0-30. An uncompromising serve wins Nadal the next point, and a forehand into the net from Thiemn then brings parity. Another decent serve from Nadal is returned out by his opponent, and the No 1 seed goes on to hold. He might not be broken again, so Thiem\u2019s got to make his next two service games count. Fourth set: Nadal* 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 2-4 Thiem ( *denotes next server) A lovely raking Thiem forehand is unanswerable at the back of the court for Nadal, but the Austrian overhits his next attempt at an expansive winger, pushing his diagonal forehand too wide. No matter, a glorious low forehand winner down the linen makes it 30-15, and a miscued return is then sent skyward by Nadal. Which is as good a time as any to send an ace down the middle to put Thiem two games away from a semi against Zverev. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 2-3 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Brilliant from Thiem, as - unperturbed by a potentially deceptive net-cord he manages to crown a brilliant rally with a lovely diagonal backhand that Nadal can\u2019t handle. Strong serving and that trusty forehand swiftly take Rafa to 40-15 before a rare double fault, and a particularly poor one, but Nadal prevails following a nerveless long back-court rally to hold. This is still going to be a hell of a challenge for Thiem. Fourth set: Nadal* 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 1-3 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Confident serve-volleying gets Thiem underway on his serve, and he eventually forces an overhit from Nadal during a long rally to take the next point too. Nadal pulls back to 30-15 before a booming, bouncing serve from Thiem is scooped off court by Nadal and beautifully caught one-handed by the umpire, Rafa\u2019s mate. As easy a hold as Thiem has had for a while. Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 1-2 Thiem * ( *denotes next server) The importance of that previous hold is underlined as Thiem breaks! Earlier, he gets his challenge in to a line call earlier in the game rather quicker than Nadal did in the previous one, but it\u2019s the wrong call. Nadal\u2019s ace down the middle for 30-15 was in, unlike the crosscourt backhand in the next rally that gets Thiem back to 30-30. Thiem then outpoints Nadal around the back of the court to induce a mistake that gives him a break point, which he converts, Nadal slicing a whipped forehand too high and out of court. Is the top seed on his way out now? Fourth set: Nadal * 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 1-1 Thiem ( *denotes next server) A vital hold for Thiem, saving three break points. Thiem larrups a forehand drive-volley at the net past Nadal at the corner of the court to get underway, but a fine return makes it 15-15. An unforced error from Thiem ensues, and Nadal has two break points when the Austrian\u2019s horribly soppy drop shot gives Nadal the initiative in the rally, which he consolidates on his next visit to the net with a volleyed winner. A better drop shot from Thiem saves the first break point while a much better first serve gives him the advantage in the rally that he smashes home the net for deuce. But then \u2013 agh! - he dumps another wayward forehand into the net to give Nadal another break point. It\u2019s saved with a fearless diagonal forehand just inside the line. An ace down the line is challenged by Nadal, but too late. More grumpiness ensues, as do boos from the paying punters. A slugfest of a rally is then edged by Thiem to seal the game. How important might this be? Fourth set: Nadal 6-7, 6-7, 6-4, 1-0 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) The old Nadal comes out now, as he begins the set with a remorseless grinding back-court rally that he never looks like losing; it\u2019s 30-0 when Thiem\u2019s admirably ambitious top-spun passing shot goes out at the back of the court, but the Austrian\u2019s flair is rewarded when he follows up an acrobatic return of serve with a glorious backhand crosscourt winner. Nadal\u2019s strong first serve lands him the next point, before Thiem\u2019s strong first return induces a miscued scoop from Nadal for 40-30. An overhit forehand from Thiem hands Nadal the game. You have to say Nadal looks the stronger of the two players now, but not by much. Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 6-4 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Suddenly Nadal looks to be more sprightly around the court, taking advantage of Thiem\u2019s first-serve woes to boss an aggressive rally that ends with Thiem\u2019s backhand straying over the line. Another fierce whipped forehand induces an error that takes Nadal to 0-30. Thiem responds with a timely ace. But Nadal continues to have the upper hand and earns two set points, the first of which is squandered with an overhit return of serve but the second \u2013 following another poor first serve \u2013 is not, and Nadal digs in during a lengthy rally to ensure that Thiem blinks first, sending a tame return into the net to reduce the deficit. It\u2019s two sets to one. Is another big comeback by one of the big guns on the cards here? Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 5-4 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Nadal\u2019s best service game for a bit nonetheless begins badly wh en he clatters a forehand into the net following a medium-length back-of-court rally before Thiem errs when hitting his forehand return too far wide, perhaps deceived by the bounce. Nadal finally gets a rally he control that ends with his opponent netting from miles back. A slightly wayward return makes it 40-15 before Nadal bosses another rally to wrap up the game. We\u2019re at a big pressure point now, for both players. And it\u2019s a big test of Thiem\u2019s cool, with the prize so near yet seeming so far. Third set: Nadal* 6-7, 6-7, 4-4 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Thiem\u2019s easiest service game of this set begins when a lovely crosscourt forehand is whizzed past Nadal to get Thiem\u2019s service game underway, and it\u2019s followed by an easy smash for 30-0. Thiem serve-and-volleys effortlessly for 40-0, pushing Nadal back and around the court, and a scuffed forehand out of the lines by Nadal gives Thiem the game. Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 4-3 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Thiem misjudges an inviting back hand opportunity down the line to get Nadal underway in his fourth service game of the set, which the Spaniard follows up with a booming serve for 30-0, but Thiem wins the next point after pushing Nadal to the back of the court and inducing a backhand error. Other than that, Nadal\u2019s serve is too strong \u2013 it\u2019s the part of his game that\u2019s looking strongest at present \u2013 and he wraps up another fairly, but not totally, comfortable hold. Third set: Nadal* 6-7 6-7, 3-3 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Nadal slashes his forehand return to start Thiem\u2019s service game, but the Austrian then serves up a third double-fault. Again, his first-serving is a little awry, as is his volleying, when he ends a long rally by approaching the net and overhitting a too-tricky low volley. A couple of forceful first serves make amends to put him 40-30 up before a gruelling rally finally ends with Nadal slightly overhitting down the line to seal the game. Excellent defensive focus from Thiem. \u201cNadal is giving the ball girls an unbelievably bad time,\u201d writes Christine Herbert. \u201cSeems to have been on at them all match. Shockingly out of his usual behaviour. Think descriptions don\u2019t convey that... this is more than tetchy or fidgety, it is downright rude bullying, and the umpire should pull him up for it.\u201d Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 3-2 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) \u201cThis match feels like at least a semifinal match or even a FINAL match,\u201d says Lela in the US. \u201cImpressive games played by both players that I haven\u2019t caught any moment of sleep but glued to the television. Regardless of who wins this, they should both be proud and walk out with their head held high. I have to add though that in the past two sets, Thiem\u2019s past experience with Nadal in the French Open Final might have helped here in reading Nadal\u2019s shots.\u201d Nadal races to 40-0 in no time, then seals the game with a diagonal ace. Suddenly, that was very easy for the No 1 seed. Third set: Nadal* 6-7 6-7, 2-2 Thiem ( *denotes next server) Thiem finds this one tougher, struggling to land his first serve, but he toughs it out. He starts by erring after a long rally, miscuing an awkward backhand volley at the net out, but he hits back to end a long exchange of back-court slugging with a wrongfooting forehand to make it 15-15. More smart court-manouevring sets up Thiem for a crosscourt forehand winner but Nadal hits back when Thiem mishits a forehand that comes onto him quicker than expected. A beautiful under-pressure backhand down the line is Thiem\u2019s wonderful response, and that sets him up to hold. Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 2-1 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Another hold that was never in doubt. Nadal cruises to 30-0 before lazily dumping a volley into the net. Forceful serve and volley action lands Nadal the next point before he steers Thiem all around the back of the court in a lengthy rally that eventually induces an error and wraps up another comfortable hold. But there\u2019s more fidgety agitation and chatter from Nadal at the changeover; he\u2019s apparently unhappy with the air flow inside the arena. Third set: Nadal* 6-7 6-7, 1-1 Thiem ( *denotes next server) The win predictor tech boffins give Thiem an 86% chance of victory from hereon in, and he seeks to prove them right with a flawless service game, which starts with a fierce ace down the middle, his sixth. A brilliant raking backhand to the back line following a challenging rally takes Thiem to 30-0, a seventh and eighth ace follow. Ruthless stuff. Third set: Nadal 6-7 6-7, 1-0 Thiem* ( *denotes next server) Thanks Jonathan. It\u2019s tense here, even with Thiem two sets up and deservedly so, and Nadal tetchier than usual. The Spaniard duly starts the third set with an unremarkable and comfortable service hold to 15. Ok, to see you through the remainder of the match it\u2019s Tom Davies. Second set: Nadal 6-7 6-7 Thiem (* denotes server) Nadal tries to drop but the execution has way too much height and a man as rapid as Thiem has no problem gobbling it up for two set points. He only needs one! A net cord lands his way meaning Nadal can only pat a gentle backhand in Thiem\u2019s direction. The Austrian has time to pick his spot and power home in exuberant fashion. Tiebreak 4-7 Second set: Nadal 6-7 6-6 Thiem (* denotes server) After the change of ends a good first serve from Nadal brings him back to just one point behind, then Thiem hits wide mid-rally under no pressure - and we\u2019re back on level terms! If the Austrian is feeling the occasion he hits his way out of his anxiety with that glorious inside-out forehand to inch ahead once again, but we\u2019re back on serve. Tiebreak 4-5 Second set: Nadal 6-7 6-6 Thiem (* denotes server) Thiem has a clear mind, coming in behind another first serve to move up 4-0 at the net. Nadal scrambles tenaciously to claw back one of those mini-breaks then his opponent loses focus, ripping a forehand into the net way before he needed to pull the trigger. Tiebreak 2-4 Second set: Nadal 6-7 6-6 Thiem (* denotes server) Thiem gets on the board quick as a flash - he\u2019s won 94% of points on first serve this set. Then Nadal gets way too cute with a backhand volley at the net \u201che makes that 99 times out of 100\u201d Jim Courier laments on TV. Thiem rams home the mistake with some ferocious hitting, landing blow after blow, making even the great Nadal defence look vulnerable. Tiebreak 0-3 Second set: Nadal* 6-7 6-6 Thiem (* denotes server) Nadal is edgy. He doesn\u2019t commit to the opening point then he\u2019s too conservative at 0-15 and Thiem\u2019s Matrix-like shot pre-emption makes him pay both times. He claws back a point then goes for the money shot, pounding a forehand into the corner from a deep Thiem backhand. Thiem responds in kind though, hustling the Spaniard then mugging him with a backhand on the run into unguarded territory. The crowd lifts. And Nadal follows, saving set point with a one-two serve-forehand combo that\u2019s too hot even for Thiem\u2019s astonishing pace. Deuce doesn\u2019t last long then Nadal holds, improbably, with a backhand clipping the outside of the line after Nadal asked for a review. To another tiebreak we go. Second set: Nadal 6-7 5-6 Thiem* (* denotes server) While Nadal is fighting his demons Thiem is quietly returning to his form of the opening set and eases up 30-0 with some blistering groundstrokes. Nadal pins a point back in possibly the point of the match - heck, maybe even the point of the tournament - full of amazing court coverage, shot selection, power, and precision. You can tell by the sound sometime, the venomous pop off the racket followed by squeaks from the sneakers on the court. But that\u2019s as good as it gets for Rafa, Thiem lands a couple of first serves and he\u2019s guaranteed at least another tiebreak. Second set: Nadal* 6-7 5-5 Thiem (* denotes server) \u201c12 points to five in favour of Dominic Thiem since the time violation\u201d Lleyton Hewitt says on TV. That quickly becomes 12-7 when the No 1 seed nails a couple of serves but he hands both points back soon after when he slaps consecutive forehands wide. 30-30 feels tense; the crowd hushed but Rafa does enough to provoke a backhand error from Thiem, then thunders down his second ace of the game for a very valuable hold. \u201cRegarding the watch,\u201d emails Shervin Abdolhamidi, \u201che\u2019s been wearing that for the past 5-6 years at least. He gets paid a tremendous amount of money for it, but it weighs next to nothing, which is why it doesn\u2019t seem to bother him. But I was surpirsed when he started wearing it as well.\u201d Nadal is blowing up on the changeover. This time it\u2019s about the aircon unit at his chair not working properly. Second set: Nadal 6-7 4-5 Thiem* (* denotes server) Energised by Nadal\u2019s gift giving Thiem puts his pedal to the metal and scorches to 40-0, showcasing a return to serving form. Nadal then pushes a backhand wide to drop the game and he stomps off to his chair wrestling a few demons. Huge service game coming up for the Spaniard. Second set: Nadal* 6-7 4-4 Thiem (* denotes server) Here we go. Thiem streaks to 0-30 with a couple of winners - the first ending a powerful point, the second a fortunate stretch that just lands inside the baseline. Nadal then dumps a sloppy forehand into the net to face three break points. And he gives it up with a double fault! That was a poor double too, his second serve hitting midway up the net. Nadal is rattled. He engages the match referee, perhaps still bothered about the earlier time violation. Second set: Nadal 6-7 4-3 Thiem* (* denotes server) Thiem holds a scrappy game to 30. \u201cI notice Nadal is wearing a wristwatch - while playing a major quarterfinal!\u201d emails an incredulous Robin Prior. \u201cHow much do you think he\u2019s getting paid to do that, or is he wearing it by choice?\u201d Nadal is so meticulous it\u2019s impossible to believe he would do anything that was not in accordance with what he believes is in the best interests of his game. However, a quick Google suggests he sports a timepiece that retails at $725,000. So probably a little column a, a little column b. Second set: Nadal* 6-7 4-2 Thiem (* denotes server) The first long exchange in some time arrives at 15-15, and it ends Thiem\u2019s way, the Austrian repelling some massive topspinning forehands from Nadal before edging into court and fizzing that majestic backhand down the line. Another scintillating rally follows, bang, bang, bang, like a shooting range, from one corner to the other, each man giving his all to hang in the point until Nadal finds the winner. \u201cYou don\u2019t like good tennis\u201d Nadal bemoans to the umpire after he receives a time violation. He\u2019s been on thin ice all night, but that one feels a tough harsh considering the exertion of the previous couple of points. Perhaps with a bit more spite in his action, Nadal serves well to set up a hold to 30. Break consolidated. Second set: Nadal 6-7 3-2 Thiem* (* denotes server) Thiem\u2019s first double fault of the night is followed quickly by a Nadal crosscourt backhand that is way too hot for the onrushing Austrian, and for the second service game in a row the No 1 seed has 0-30 to build on. This time he converts it into 0-40 when Thiem\u2019s stone-handed volley allows Rafa plenty of time to come in and pick his spot. Wow! Another double fault and Thiem is broken to love. No first serves at all that game and his percentage is down to just 33% for the set. When Nadal broke in the opening set Thiem hit back immediately, can he repeat the trick? Second set: Nadal* 6-7 2-2 Thiem (* denotes server) Thiem is playing superbly but one area he could improve on is throttling back the attempted return winners and just settle for engaging Rafa in open court. The Austrian throws away the opening point with an ambitious swipe then overhits a second serve return before an ace and a deadly wide swinging first serve complete a routine love hold for Nadal. Second set: Nadal 6-7 1-2 Thiem* (* denotes server) Nadal picks up the tempo at the start of game three of this second set, stepping in and firing backhands behind Thiem, catching him off guard to move up 0-30. An ace steadies the Austrian\u2019s nerves then he comes out on top of a rollercoaster rally full of net cords, lobs and reflex tennis. 30-30 quickly becomes a secure hold and Nadal\u2019s window of opportunity closes. Second set: Nadal* 6-7 1-1 Thiem (* denotes server) Rafa responds with a speedy hold to love. Second set: Nadal 6-7 0-1 Thiem* (* denotes server) Thiem holds to 15 in a comparatively scruffy game to open the second set. What was notable was the Austrian\u2019s continued intent. He is not allowing Nadal to dictate terms tonight and so long as he continues to hit his marks he is deep into this contest. We could be in for a loooooong night. Little to separate this pair in a high quality opening set either on the scoreboard or on the stats sheet. A brief delay between sets while both men change from their sweat drenched outfits. First set: Nadal 6-7 Thiem (* denotes server) Nadal needs to respond to Thiem\u2019s run of points - and he does. The Austrian tries to drill a backhand down the line but it bounces nicely into Nadal\u2019s hitting zone and he monsters a forehand from corner to corner with ferocious power. He tries again the following rally but this time he misses the mark. Worse is yet to come when Thiem somehow nails a clean return winner after Nadal declined to play a shot to a fizzing forehand that was just good enough. Three set points - but the fifth seed only needs one of them, hanging tough in a baseline exchange then running around to whip a forehand, Federer-style, into the corner. Thiem gets his nose in front. Tiebreak 3-7 First set: Nadal 6-6 Thiem (* denotes server) Brilliant speed and power from Thiem to earn the mini-break back, then he moves up in the tiebreak when Nadal tightens on a forehand. A second error in a row from the Spaniard gives his opponent daylight. Tiebreak 2-4 First set: Nadal 6-6 Thiem (* denotes server) Rafa whips out a surprise drop shot to catch Thiem off guard well behind the baseline to hold his opening serve. Both men then trade topspin heavy blows from the back of the court before Nadal sets up the one-two punch perfectly, putting away the volley at the net for the first mini-break. Thiem gets on the board in neat fashion, watching a half-volley onto his racket off a net cord before dropping it delicately over the net. Tiebreak 2-1 First set: Nadal 6-6 Thiem* (* denotes server) Thiem drops the opening point but then sends down four thundering first serves, including two aces, all wide to Rafa\u2019s forehand. We\u2019re off to a tiebreak. First set: Nadal* 6-5 Thiem (* denotes server) Nadal looks to be cruising to 30-0 but he can\u2019t put away about half-a-dozen winner opportunities, most at the net, with Thiem scrambling haphazardly until he frames a lob that floats as if to land long before dropping like a stone, much to Nadal\u2019s disappointment. The world No 1 gets in powerfully behind a couple of second serves to regain the ascendancy then benefits from Thiem missing the mark with a Hollywood return. Nadal wins to 15 despite landing just one first serve that game. First set: Nadal 5-5 Thiem* (* denotes server) This is a high quality tennis match. A 13-shot rally could go either way but Thiem spots a forehand into the corner to steal a 40-15 lead. A Thiem error then a Nadal winner takes the game to deuce but the Austrian pulls out two of his best shots off the tee so far to hold. Between games Nadal was complaining that the serve clock is against him because he\u2019s sweating so profusely in the heat that he requires more time to dry himself down. Hmmmm, I\u2019m not sure such a notoriously slow server will find much sympathy. First set: Nadal* 5-4 Thiem (* denotes server) Thiem rips a forehand winner that bruises the line then Nadal ties himself in knots trying to half-volley off his toes on a rare foray to the net. He doesn\u2019t lose his cool though and digs into the game, earning 30-all at which juncture the point is replayed after Thiem catches the back eighth of the line with a shot called out. Nadal\u2019s response? An ace, to hand him his first set point. And Nadal takes an age to get into it, letting his first serve, missing his second, then dawdling over his third. Thiem retains his composure with some forceful tennis, drive-volleying a forehand that Nadal cannot deal with. Deuce is a study in power hitting from both men and it ends with a backhand from Thiem the likes of which you have never seen before. Fierce doesn\u2019t even come close to doing it justice. That was beautiful violence. Nadal serves his way back to deuce but Thiem\u2019s backhand earns him his second break point. Nadal lands a wide swinging first serve to save but hands the initiative back to his opponent with a loose forehand early in an exchange. And Thiem doesn\u2019t miss out a third time, nailing his 12th winner of the set to earn the immediate break back. First set: Nadal 5-3 Thiem* (* denotes server) Ooh. Two unlikely errors from Thiem open the first service game with new balls. The first was an overcooked forehand, the second a ricochet of a backhand. Nadal senses blood and pounces, sending a high bouncing ball crosscourt, giving him time to accelerate forward in prime position to drill a backhand into the open court. Three break points - but Rafa needs only one - defending superbly and ending the game with a pair of lobs, the first a running forehand, the second an inch perfect backhand that the onrushing Thiem could do nothing with. Despite Thiem looking the likelier of the two in these early exchanges, Nadal has the crucial break. First set: Nadal* 4-3 Thiem (* denotes server) Nadal\u2019s most comprehensive service game of the night. He requires just seven shots to hold to love. First set: Nadal 3-3 Thiem* (* denotes server) Thiem is out-hitting Nadal by about 10 kph on both wings. It means the match looks like it\u2019s on the Austrian\u2019s racket with the fifth seed working Nadal a long way behind the baseline. But this is not Nadal\u2019s first rodeo and a power gap does not mean a power deficiency for the muscular lefty and he reminds Thiem who he\u2019s dealing with when he spanks a forehand winner with masses of topspin. At 15-30 the game is alive and the latest in a long line of gorgeous points unfolds with both men hitting beautiful shots one way then the next before Thiem drills another forehand winner. The game soon follows. Three service holds, just one point conceded for Thiem so far. First set: Nadal* 3-2 Thiem (* denotes server) Thiem hits a brace of pure forehands to test Nadal at 15-30. The first was a clean winner with a hint of inside-out, the second a punishing drive to Nadal\u2019s forehand corner from the centre of the baseline with serious force. The Spaniard responds well initially but then fumbles a forehand to offer the first break point of the night. A fine 198 kph first serve closes that door. Deuce doesn\u2019t last long because Thiem overhits on both flanks, the second time by a matter of inches after unfurling his trademark backhand piledriver that looked a winner off the racket. First set: Nadal 2-2 Thiem* (* denotes server) Thiem holds to love again. Nadal still yet to land a blow on the Austrian\u2019s serve. Thiem has talked of his extra aggression on hard courts to win shorter points and he demonstrates that intent with a Djokovic-like point to move up 30-0, pushing Nadal one way then the other before scampering to the net to put away the backhand volley. That variety makes Thiem a much more dangerous proposition. First set: Nadal* 2-1 Thiem (* denotes server) A 25-shot rally opens the third game of the night, both men working a variety of angles and spins before Thiem finds the net with a forehand down the line. Point three is even better, with scrambling defence on both sides of the net curtailed by Thiem pinging a forehand winner. Nadal eventually holds to 15 with some solid serving. Jonas Canizares has emailed in about the courts. \u201cAO has said goodbye to the rebound ace surface and started to use green set this year. I\u2019m actually wondering why the courts are playing slow given that green set is also used by Basel, the Paris Masters, and the WTF, among others.\u201d Sam Groth suggested yesterday it\u2019s a consequence of the cooler conditions in Melbourne this tournament. We should see more pace over the next couple of days. First set: Nadal 1-1 Thiem* (* denotes server) Thiem holds to love in a nice confidence building start to his evening. First set: Nadal* 1-0 Thiem (* denotes server) Nadal serves first and he begins in fine style, punching a forehand winner, then an ace, before Thiem demonstrates his howitzer single-handed backhand, ending a crisp ten-shot rally with a crosscourt winner that puts Nadal on notice. Another fine rally unfolds but Thiem overhits a fraction despite acting as aggressor behind Nadal\u2019s second serve. A double fault follows but it doesn\u2019t prevent a hold to 30. The players are hitting up. Thiem, 26, right-handed, in a natty Adidas get-up that\u2019s predominately duck egg blue. Nadal, 33, left-handed, filling out a hot pink sleeveless top that bears his bull logo. Frenchwoman Aurelie Tourte is the chair umpire. This being Australia, sporting schedules are at the mercy of broadcast partners, so we\u2019re running a few minutes late. The two protagonists are on their way down into Rod Laver Arena now though, and we should be underway shortly. If any stylists are watching tonight, there\u2019s a couple of wealthy young men who could do with some tonsorial guidance. Thiem is rocking some questionable blonde streaks this fortnight like a 90s Europop backing dancer. \u201cI had one day off in Miami, I went to the hairdresser and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said preseason. \u201cI really love the hairstyle now, even though many people around me don\u2019t.\u201d Meanwhile it\u2019s surely time Rafa embraced the clippers - or some expensive plugs - before he enters Bobby Charlton territory. In case you\u2019re a neutral looking for a reason to barrack for someone, Dominic Thiem is a massive Chelsea fan. Nadal supports Real Madrid, despite his uncle Miguel Angel Nadal (AKA The Beast of Barcelona) appearing over 200 times for Barca. Nadal has a 9-6 win-loss record against top-ten opponents in the past year but Thiem\u2019s record is near identical at 9-5, suggesting he is at home on the big stage. Thiem is ranked fifth in the world across all surfaces, but on hard courts over the past 52 weeks that rating drops to eight, Nadal is No 1 overall as well as on tonight\u2019s picturesque blue. Thiem\u2019s record may make him look like a clay court specialist but his performances on hard courts are on the improve. He won his first Masters title at Indian Wells last year, and finished runner-up at the ATP Finals in London, knocking off Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer in the process. He is learning to become more aggressive and use more of the court, instead of trading blows from the baseline. Head-to-Head: Nadal leads the duel 9-4, a record that includes consecutive French Open final victories. Curiously, they\u2019ve only met once on a hard court (12 of their 13 matches have been on clay) and that was a classic five-setter in the 2018 US Open quarter-finals. Also, if you missed this from yesterday, it\u2019s a heck of a story. Before we get stuck in, a quick look at what happened earlier in the women\u2019s singles. It\u2019s been a typically open tournament but two of the top four seeds remain while three of the semi-finalists have grand slam winning pedigree. Weather: It\u2019s been the hottest day of the tournament so far and temperatures remain in the low 30s C although as night falls they will drop steadily towards the low 20s. But be warned, today was a warm-up (pun intended). Tomorrow will push the high 30s for the first time this fortnight while Friday will likely hit an ugly 40, accompanied by roaring northerly winds. Unpleasant. A bit of everything is in store for Saturday, meaning the women\u2019s singles final will likely be under cover. Then, because Melbourne is ridiculous, the men\u2019s final on Sunday will be a chilly affair, with temperatures in the teens, kept down by blowy south-westerlies. Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of the last quarter-final of the men\u2019s singles draw of this Australian Open. World No 1 Rafael Nadal takes on fifth seed Dominic Thiem at 7.30pm local time (8.30am GMT). When Australia\u2019s apocalyptic skies dominated the news cycle on the eve of the year\u2019s first grand slam there was a sense of foreboding around Melbourne Park. Since then the skies have cleared and events on court have proceeded in an orderly fashion. In the men\u2019s draw, of the five men left standing only one - Alexander Zverev - is not ranked among the top five, but even he is still seeded seven, and arrived at last year\u2019s event ranked fourth. The pair of favourites, Nadal and Novak Djokovic, have dropped just one set apiece. Fortunately Roger Federer has been on hand to provide enough drama to make this a memorable championship. If tonight\u2019s match is half as engrossing as Federer\u2019s miraculous escape from the clutches of Tennys Sandgren yesterday then we are in for a treat. Nadal has grown into his Australian summer after looking below par during the ATP Cup. His trademark steely determination was on display against Nick Kyrgios in round four. Thiem was taken the distance by wildcard Alex Bolt in round two. Since then he has hit his straps and looked particularly impressive last time out against the dangerous Gael Monfils. This is the furthest the Austrian has even journeyed at this event. Both men are at home on clay, not hard courts, so expect plenty of long baseline exchanges. The Australian sun has shone brightly today so any war of attrition suits Zverev, who awaits in the semi-final after he overcame a sluggish start to down Stan Wawrinka earlier.

Its white belly gleams clean and sleek against the rusty hull of the ship as it is hauled out of the ocean, thrashing about trying to escape. They kill it by severing its spine with a knife. For a generation, the film Jaws was the source of an irrational fear of sharks, which has probably made it harder for many to connect to their plight. People see it almost as a kill or be killed response. On the high seas, however, it\u2019s clear who the real predators are. Sharks are under attack all over the world. The statistics are grim: 100 million sharks are killed every year. Here I was, face to face with one of them, as it was hauled out of the water and cut to pieces. In September, Greenpeace took its ship the Arctic Sunrise on to the high seas of the South Atlantic to expose the fishing vessels emptying our oceans and to draw attention to why we want a Global Ocean Treaty that can create huge sanctuaries free from this kind of pillaging. Here, ships operate out of sight and out of mind: a system enabled by the fragmented governance of our global oceans \u2013 a space bigger than every continent combined but managed by a patchwork of regional bodies dominated by industrial fishing interests. It\u2019s a peculiar system for the \u201cblue planet\u201d, almost half of which is covered by ocean beyond national borders that by rights belongs to us all. Some vessels even hide from what little regulation there is by turning off satellite tracking systems, \u201cgoing dark\u201d. Some offload cargo to refrigerated ships (or \u201creefers\u201d) allowing them to remain at sea for months at a time. This \u201ctransshipment\u201d has been linked to some of the worst environmental and labour abuses. Using innovative reconnaissance techniques, Greenpeace set out to find these ships and document the damage they are doing to our oceans. We spent more than a month at sea between Senegal and the tip of South Africa, observing a dozen longliners in the South Atlantic. Longliners use a single long line that can extend 100 nautical miles and carry thousands of hooks. The Atlantic longline fleet officially targets tuna and swordfish, but time and time again the bulk of their catch is sharks.

Bryant died on Sunday in a helicopter crash in California, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others. Bryant won an Oscar for best animated short film in 2018 for Dear Basketball, adapted from a poem he published in 2015 on his retirement from the sport. The Oscar ceremony traditionally includes an In Memoriam section, which lists significant entertainment industry figures who have died in the previous year; it is not known yet if the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) will incorporate its Bryant tribute as part of this section, or as a standalone segment. Tributes were paid to Bryant at the Grammy awards on Sunday, and by a string of sports figures. A game between Bryant\u2019s LA Lakers and the LA Clippers due to take place on Tuesday was postponed. AMPAS has also announced further details of the Oscar ceremony, including additional presenters for the \u201chostless\u201d event. Will Ferrell, Gal Gadot, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Kelly Marie Tran are among those who will appear, alongside previously announced participants including Mahershala Ali, Olivia Colman, Regina King and Rami Malek, who were last year\u2019s acting award winners. Show producers Lynette Howell Taylor and Stephanie Allain have also confirmed that Elton John and Cynthia Erivo will perform during the ceremony. They are each nominated in the best original song category, for Rocketman and Harriet, respectively. Erivo turned down an invitation to perform at the Baftas after being overlooked for an acting nomination.

South African game farmers have increasingly been breeding novel trophy animals, including some freakishly-coloured varieties such as the black impala, golden wildebeest or pure-white springboks. Some hunters pay more to bag unusual trophies, but now the South African government is under fire for permitting further gene manipulation ventures that scientists say could have a damaging effect on the continent\u2019s wildlife. Writing in the latest issue of the South African Journal of Science, a group of 10 senior wildlife scientists and researchers have criticised the government for quietly amending the country\u2019s Animal Improvement Act last year to allow for the domestication and \u201cgenetic improvement\u201d of at least 24 indigenous wildlife species \u2013 including rare and endangered animals such as rhino, cheetah, lion, buffalo and several antelope species. The researchers warn that: \u201cA logical endpoint of this legislation is that we will have two populations of each species: one wild and one domesticated \u2026 domesticated varieties of wildlife will represent a novel, genetic pollution threat to South Africa\u2019s indigenous wildlife that will be virtually impossible to prevent or reverse.\u201d Lead author Prof Michael Somers, a senior researcher at the Mammal Research Institute at the University of Pretoria, says the government should scrap the controversial law amendment which lumps together rare and endangered species such as rhinos with rabbits and domesticated dog breeds. Somers and his colleagues say the act typically provides for domesticated species to be bred and \u201cgenetically improved\u201d to obtain \u201csuperior domesticated animals with enhanced production and performance\u201d. These animals \u201ccan also be used for genetic manipulation, embryo harvesting, in-vitro fertilisation and embryo transfers,\u201d say the scientists. They argue that the law will not improve the genetics of the affected wildlife species but rather will pose ecological and economic risks as it will be expensive and almost impossible to maintain a clear distinction between wild and domesticated species. Somers and his colleagues say the government did not appear to have consulted either scientists, government wildlife agencies or the general public about the controversial move. Last year, in response to concerns that the legal amendment would remove the listed species from the ambit of conservation legislation, the government\u2019s environment department issued a statement to emphasise that that game breeders would still have to comply with the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act and regulations concerning threatened or protected species. But Somers and his co-authors remain concerned, saying that in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, where there is close cooperation between game breeders and the provincial conservation organisation, the authorities still had difficulty keeping track of what happens on game farms and in enforcing legislation. \u201cThis new law will add to this difficulty, and will likely be less controlled in some other provinces,\u201d they said, adding that the genetic consequences of intensive or semi-intensive breeding of wildlife species were \u201cnegative and considerable\u201d. \u201cIntensive breeding through artificial (non random) selection of individuals for commercially valuable traits (eg horn size/shape, coat colour) represents humans taking over this natural process.

The prime minister said Trump\u2019s plan \u201chas the merits of a two state solution\u201d, even though it has been criticised for offering Israel a wishlist of its long-held demands while promising Palestinians a potential \u201cstate\u201d with severe restrictions. At prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons on Wednesday, the outgoing Labour leader called on Johnson to stand up to the US and tell Trump \u201cfrankly and candidly that on this you are wrong\u201d. He said: \u201cIt will annex Palestinian territory, lock in illegal Israeli colonisation, transfer Palestinian citizens of Israel and deny Palestinian people their fundamental rights. \u201cWhen the government meets with the US secretary of state later today, will he make it clear that the British government will stand for a genuine, internationally backed peace plan rather than this stuff proposed by Trump yesterday?\u201d Johnson rejected Corbyn\u2019s assessment, telling him: \u201cNo peace plan is perfect, but this has the merit of a two-state solution. It would ensure Jerusalem is both the capital of Israel and the Palestinian people. \u201cI would urge him rather than being so characteristically negative to reach out to his friend, my friend, our friends in the Palestinian authority, to Mahmoud Abbas \u2013 for whom I have the highest respect \u2013 and urge him for once to engage, to get talking rather than to leave a political vacuum.\u201d Corbyn hit back that Trump\u2019s plan \u201cwill not bring any move towards peace, has no support from any Palestinian anywhere in the world\u201d. Trump unveiled his vision for Middle East peace in a White House launch on Tuesday, standing next to a smiling Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The US president announced details of the 181-page plan to cheers and applause but Palestinian leaders were absent from the launch, having rejected his proposal. The plan, released by the White House, said the proposal intended to: Establish Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s undivided capital, with a potential Palestinian capital to the east and north of the city. Recognise the vast majority of Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territory as part of the country. A Palestinian state would receive territory, mostly desert, near Gaza to compensate for the loss of about 30% of the West Bank. Gaza and the West Bank would be linked by high-speed rail. Recognise the Jordan valley, which makes up about a third of the occupied West Bank, as part of Israel. Offer a path to some form of Palestinian statehood but with no army, and overarching Israeli security control in some areas, including over the sea. The plan also sets a series of conditions the Palestinians have to meet before receiving independence including the \u201ccomplete dismantling of Hamas\u201d, which governs Gaza. Abbas, the Palestinian president, criticised the deal as a conspiracy that \u201cwill not pass\u201d, while in Gaza, the Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhr described the document as worthless. \u201cPalestine will prevail, and Trump and the deal will go to the dustbin of history,\u201d he said.",

The Sars outbreak killed more than 770 people globally, including 349 in mainland China. The death rate from Sars, caused by a more virulent member of the coronavirus family than the Wuhan strain appears to be, was more than 10%. So far, the death rate among confirmed cases of coronavirus is 2%, and may be less if there are many mild cases that do not end up in hospital, as experts believe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

A government-chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo from Wuhan on Wednesday morning. Two showed symptoms of pneumonia following scans, but a coronavirus diagnosis has not been confirmed, hospital representatives said. Two more have been admitted to hospital. Seven others with symptoms such as coughs and fever will undergo tests. The rest of the passengers were sent home with instructions to stay in and not mix with people for 14 days.

The metre-gauge local railway from Martigny to Chamonix skirts the north side of the Mont Blanc massif and so connects standard-gauge lines on either side of the border. Climbing up from Martigny, there are tantalising glimpses of the ravine cut by the River Trient. The train passes great cliffs, twisting and turning with a feast of panoramic views. After crossing the French border at Vallorcine, look out for the Argenti\u00e8re glacier to the left.<br>\u2022 <em>From \u20ac28.50 one-way,</em> <em>22 miles, 90 minutes, hourly, <a href=\"https://www.mont-blanc-express.ch/en/\" title=\"\">mont-blanc-express.ch</a></em></p> <h2>Porto to Vigo, Portugal-Spain</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40c1830459050d60613236a63e754cb224ab7167\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40c1830459050d60613236a63e754cb224ab7167/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Campanha station, Porto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campanha station, Porto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Dunn/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The facade of Campanh\u00e3 station in Porto, with its Romanesque windows and imposing station clock, has a quiet authority. It is the starting point for the cross-border run to Vigo in Spain. The fortunes of this route have ebbed and flowed over the past 50 years. Rescued from closure, it offers a much-improved service these days. Leaving Porto, the train turns its back on the sea, heading north through hills towards the Minho region. Only an hour after leaving Porto is there a first glimpse of the Atlantic as the train crosses the Lima River to reach Viana do Castelo. There is drama about the final approach into Vigo, as the trains pass under the Ponte de Rande (which carries the Atlantic Highway over the Ria de Vigo) and runs along the waterfront into the city.<br>\u2022 <em>\u20ac14.95 one-way,</em> <em>109 miles, 2 hours 20 minutes, </em><em>twice daily</em></p> <h2>Nice to Tende, France</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d7aae13a9a1113bcc91a66fb5edc17e7c9be5efa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7aae13a9a1113bcc91a66fb5edc17e7c9be5efa/0_0_5315_3190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The narrow gauge railway between Nice and Tende.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The narrow gauge railway between Nice and Tende.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The main Riviera coastal rail route is always fun but the French d\u00e9partement of Alpes-Maritimes has an intriguing branch line that offers a back-door route into Italy\u2019s Piemonte region. So take that line from Nice to Tende, from where there are occasional onward trains to Cuneo in Italy. Skirting Nice\u2019s smart suburbs, the train cuts through a long tunnel to reach the B\u00e9v\u00e9ra valley and the town of Sospel.

If you are minded to break your journey, Clervaux is a good place to stop. But why not just ride all the way to Troisvierges and back?

      "bodyText": "Martigny to Chamonix, France-Switzerland This cross-border line linking Switzerland\u2019s Valais region with Haute-Savoie in France is a tiddler among international rail routes and has never been used by grand expresses (even though it\u2019s called the Mont-Blanc Express). The metre-gauge local railway from Martigny to Chamonix skirts the north side of the Mont Blanc massif and so connects standard-gauge lines on either side of the border. Climbing up from Martigny, there are tantalising glimpses of the ravine cut by the River Trient. The train passes great cliffs, twisting and turning with a feast of panoramic views. After crossing the French border at Vallorcine, look out for the Argenti\u00e8re glacier to the left. \u2022 From \u20ac28.50 one-way, 22 miles, 90 minutes, hourly, mont-blanc-express.ch Porto to Vigo, Portugal-Spain The facade of Campanh\u00e3 station in Porto, with its Romanesque windows and imposing station clock, has a quiet authority. It is the starting point for the cross-border run to Vigo in Spain. The fortunes of this route have ebbed and flowed over the past 50 years. Rescued from closure, it offers a much-improved service these days. Leaving Porto, the train turns its back on the sea, heading north through hills towards the Minho region. Only an hour after leaving Porto is there a first glimpse of the Atlantic as the train crosses the Lima River to reach Viana do Castelo. There is drama about the final approach into Vigo, as the trains pass under the Ponte de Rande (which carries the Atlantic Highway over the Ria de Vigo) and runs along the waterfront into the city. \u2022 \u20ac14.95 one-way, 109 miles, 2 hours 20 minutes, twice daily Nice to Tende, France The main Riviera coastal rail route is always fun but the French d\u00e9partement of Alpes-Maritimes has an intriguing branch line that offers a back-door route into Italy\u2019s Piemonte region. So take that line from Nice to Tende, from where there are occasional onward trains to Cuneo in Italy. Skirting Nice\u2019s smart suburbs, the train cuts through a long tunnel to reach the B\u00e9v\u00e9ra valley and the town of Sospel. Then the route tracks north with fine views of the Gorges de Bergue to reach the mountainside town of Tende. \u2022 \u20ac14.10 one-way, 44 miles, 2 hours 10 minutes, 3 daily, tendemerveilles.com Ardennes Railway, Luxembourg Start in Luxembourg City for this run north up the Alzette valley into the hilly Ardennes. This ride to Troisvierges has a feast of fine scenery. Leaving Luxembourg over a series of impressive viaducts, the railway climbs gently amid a medley of gorges, castles and forests. If you are minded to break your journey, Clervaux is a good place to stop. But why not just ride all the way to Troisvierges and back? It\u2019s the perfect summer evening excursion and all the better from March 2020 when you can travel for free, as Luxembourg will have scrapped all public transport charges. \u2022 \u20ac2 single until 1 March, 44 miles, 70 minutes, hourly Limerick Junction to Waterford, Ireland Travel by train around Ireland and you\u2019ll eventually end up changing trains at Limerick Junction.

In one of the most powerful scenes, the aged Priam, king of Troy, crosses the battle lines to ask Achilles for the body of his son, Hector, whom Achilles has killed. The first time I read the moment when Priam bends to kiss Achilles\u2019 hand, I physically recoiled from that anguished display of love and humility. Achilles cries, seeing in old Priam an image of his own father, who will soon be grieving the loss of his son, too. The scene sets out war\u2019s cycle of grief, revenge and love: these are the energies that raise this from a simple war story into a profound epic.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/SimoneWeilAndThePoemOfForce/Simone%20Weil.%20HOMER.%20The%20Poem%20of%20Force_djvu.txt\">The Iliad or the Poem of Force by Simone Weil</a><br></strong>Only 24 pages, but this is packed with ideas that use Homer to illuminate modern questions about violence, and where moments of grace may exist. Written in 1939-40 during the fall of France to the Nazis, Weil\u2019s essay asks us to look beyond Homer\u2019s leading characters and focus instead on the real central figure in the epic. Force, she says, taken to its extreme, turns a human being into a corpse. It makes a <em>thing</em> out of him, worthless after it has died. But she also extends that thought to include the ways that those who inflict force are themselves dehumanised. The questions Weil asks have led me to more questions about what remains after a life is lost.

      "bodyText": "Remember the good old days, when Manchester United supporters used to be characterised by their uncomplaining politeness and fondness for prawn sandwiches? There were clear signs that attitudes had hardened last week, when many fans left Old Trafford early and others used the Burnley defeat as an opportunity to hope dire fates might befall the unpopular Glazer family and their representative in the north-west of England, though it is still a shocking progression to go from chanting nasty things about Ed Woodward inside a football ground to finding out where he lives and attacking his home. The club have quite properly responded to the attempt to put the frighteners on United\u2019s executive vice-chairman with a pledge to ban for life anyone found responsible. One would expect nothing less, yet it is entirely possible that those who turned up at Woodward\u2019s home with flares and fireworks are not regular attendees at Old Trafford anyway. Far from being representative of the prawn sandwich brigade they are more likely to be people disenfranchised by either the price of season tickets or the difficulty of gaining admission to mainstream games nowadays. The level of dissatisfaction around Manchester United at the moment runs a lot deeper than a few poor results or Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s stewardship of the first team and, while personal attacks on board members are clearly beyond the pale, it is possible to view direct action as a reply to the executive inaction that has plagued the club for years. No one wanted the Glazer takeover in the first place, no one wanted a thriving club to be saddled with enormous levels of debt as a result, no one wanted an accountant to be placed in charge of football matters and most of all no one wanted the sort of smothering indifference to the club\u2019s fortunes that emanates almost palpably from the complacent American owners. Overseas investment in English football clubs is now a fact of life, though compared with, say, Manchester City or Liverpool \u2013 where inspired executive decision\u2011making and a great deal of money have breathed new life into the operations \u2013 United have been unlucky with their owners. The club fails a little more every year and nothing is ever done about it. The drift since the club\u2019s most successful manager Sir Alex Ferguson departed has been unmistakeable, the direction offered by Woodward has been consistently disappointing, and though United supporters can see the club is being poorly run there is nothing they can do about it except make their feelings known in one way or another and prepare to be ignored all over again. Solskj\u00e6r said last week that he understands the fans\u2019 frustration, adding that it goes with the territory at a club the size of United if results are not up to scratch. That is partly true, though the present situation \u2013 with Liverpool and City miles in the distance, the Glazers apparently happy with mediocrity and Woodward scared to make another managerial U-turn for fear of making his own position look ridiculous \u2013 is not something anyone has encountered in the past. The club have seen irresponsible attacks on directors\u2019 property before \u2013 Maurice Watkins\u2019s home came under attack in 2004 when it was revealed he had sold shares to the Glazers \u2013 though few would have imagined the same fight would be going on 16 years later. Using that term rather glamourises the actions of those responsible for the latest outrage, making them sound like freedom fighters or outlaws with tacit approval when they are no such thing.

With any other famous athlete, this would have been an opportunity to earn some easy goodwill: here was this living legend, who had won five NBA championships and two Olympic gold medals and was the all-time scorer for the Los Angeles Lakers, in his new rule as a youth coach.

You could say I dared people to be their best selves.\u201d It was not a trait that led himself to any popularity contest, he was a <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1706064-what-its-like-to-play-with-kobe-bryant-through-the-eyes-of-past-teammates\">notoriously difficult teammate</a> during his playing years. His former head coach Phil Jackson once wrote a book where he called Bryant \u201cuncoachable\u201d. Bryant didn\u2019t exactly <a href=\"https://www.lakersnation.com/kobe-bryant-agrees-with-phil-jacksons-criticism-of-being-un-coachable/2016/04/21/\">argue the point</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet, he was phenomenally successful, because as much as he demanded from you when you were on the same side, he subjected his opponents to much worse. Bryant would be the first to admit <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2705916-the-ghost-of-the-goat-why-there-isnt-a-next-michael-jordan-anymore\">that he took after Michael Jordan</a>, as did every single NBA player of his generation. In his playing style, he took Jordan\u2019s legendary competitive nature to its logical endpoint. Where Jordan hid his sociopathic approach to the game behind a bland, genial persona manufactured by Madison Avenue, Bryant took the opposite approach and played it up, practically being fueled by the boos. When you\u2019ve named yourself after a poisonous snake, you\u2019ve decided that you\u2019re not going to be the smiling protagonist of a Warner Bros cartoon. \u201cI always aimed to kill the opposition,\u201d Bryant wrote in the Mamba Mentality.</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s not forget the reason why he took on the Black Mamba identity in the first place. As the Washington Post\u2019s Kent Babb paraphrased in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/sports/kobe-bryant-hollywood-revisionist/\">a revealing piece on the shooting guard</a>, Bryant felt that playing this role was \u201cthe only way he could move beyond the events of Colorado\u201d. Those \u201cevents\u201d, of course, led to a 2003 sexual assault charge and subsequent trial. The criminal case against him was dismissed after the accuser declined to testify and a civil suit was later settled out of court. In Bryant\u2019s own words <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/kobe-bryant-death-legacy-nba-basketball-sexual-assault-allegations\">after the case was dismissed</a>: \u201cI now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Daily Beast\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/kobe-bryants-brilliant-flawed-maddeningly-driven-genius\">Robert Silverman makes a strong case</a> that Bryant used the fact that a large segment of the population believed he was a rapist as his own personal motivation on the court. In what is an all too common story in sports, a story that begun as one about violence against women was gradually rewritten into a narrative about an athlete <em>overcoming adversity</em>.</p> \n<p>In the end, the strategy paid off for Bryant. Throughout the rest of his career, Bryant was determined to be a one-man wrecking crew on the court, a Terminator programmed to get buckets. It was this iteration of Bryant that scored 81 points in a 2006 game against the Toronto Raptors, the second-highest total in NBA history. It was this Bryant who won his final two rings without the beyond the formidable shadow of Shaq. Towards the end of his career, as the league was becoming more and more obsessed with shot efficiency, Bryant even <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-wont-be-another-kobe-bryant/\">stubbornly raged against</a> the changing wisdom of the era. He would become infamous for his high-volume shooting nights, taking and often making low-value shots at a frequency that was almost in defiance of basic math. It was extremely fitting that in his last game in the NBA he scored 60 points on a whopping 50 shot attempts.</p> \n<p>It would have been an absurd for a lesser player to attempt, but Bryant was so good that it didn\u2019t matter. Yes, he ended up being the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/28/kobe-bryant-missed-more-shots-nba\">all-time leader in missed shots</a>, but he also ended up as fourth on the <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/article/2020/01/25/lebron-james-passes-kobe-bryant-career-points\">all-time scoring leaderboard</a>. LeBron James, currently with the Lakers himself, passed him on the list just a day before his death. James\u2019s accomplishment ended up being the subject of Bryant\u2019s final tweet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kobebryant/status/1221276426164269056\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Continuing to move the game forward <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@KingJames</a>.

Perhaps, as <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/kobe-bryant-and-us\">some have suggested</a>, Bryant was starting to evolve past the Mamba mentality towards the end of his career and into his retirement. Into what exactly, well, we\u2019ll never get a chance to know.</p>",

In the end, the strategy paid off for Bryant. Throughout the rest of his career, Bryant was determined to be a one-man wrecking crew on the court, a Terminator programmed to get buckets. It was this iteration of Bryant that scored 81 points in a 2006 game against the Toronto Raptors, the second-highest total in NBA history. It was this Bryant who won his final two rings without the beyond the formidable shadow of Shaq. Towards the end of his career, as the league was becoming more and more obsessed with shot efficiency, Bryant even stubbornly raged against the changing wisdom of the era. He would become infamous for his high-volume shooting nights, taking and often making low-value shots at a frequency that was almost in defiance of basic math. It was extremely fitting that in his last game in the NBA he scored 60 points on a whopping 50 shot attempts. It would have been an absurd for a lesser player to attempt, but Bryant was so good that it didn\u2019t matter. Yes, he ended up being the all-time leader in missed shots, but he also ended up as fourth on the all-time scoring leaderboard. LeBron James, currently with the Lakers himself, passed him on the list just a day before his death. James\u2019s accomplishment ended up being the subject of Bryant\u2019s final tweet. It was an uncharacteristically selfless final message, an admission that his time had come and gone. Perhaps, as some have suggested, Bryant was starting to evolve past the Mamba mentality towards the end of his career and into his retirement. Into what exactly, well, we\u2019ll never get a chance to know.",

Sales of print newspapers continue to decline, and the dominance of gigantic digital platforms which absorb the vast majority of advertising spend on the web makes it harder for publishers to be rewarded for the journalism they produce. We have made huge efforts to rebalance the Guardian\u2019s finances over the past four years, and thanks to the generosity and support of readers - and advertisers - we have begun to restore the Guardian to a healthier financial state. The truth is that we will continue to rely on both types of support for many years to come as high quality media continues to be battered on many sides, both financially and politically, around the world. The advertising landscape is shifting fast, and many businesses and advertisers are waking up to the climate crisis themselves. We believe many brands will agree with our stance, and might be persuaded to choose to work with us more as a result. The future of advertising lies in building trust with consumers, and demonstrating a real commitment to values and purpose. The funding model for the Guardian - like most high quality media companies - is going to remain precarious over the next few years and we\u2019ll be more reliant than ever on the support of our readers. It\u2019s true that rejecting some adverts might make our lives a tiny bit tougher in the very short term. Nonetheless, we believe building a more purposeful organisation and remaining financially sustainable have to go hand in hand.",

      "body": "<p>I was put off rice pudding for life at school, but recanted in India when I tasted kheer: sweet, creamy proof that I\u2019d simply never eaten a good one. Consider the recipe below my attempt at short-grain evangelism. Deliciously rich and subtly spiced, I hope it will win this supremely comforting dessert a few more righteous converts.</p> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>2 hr </strong><br>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>50g butter</strong><br><strong>\u00bd vanilla pod</strong><br><strong>50g soft light brown sugar</strong><br><strong>1 bay leaf</strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp freshly grated nutmeg</strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong>100g pudding rice</strong> <strong>(short-grain) </strong>\u2013 see step 4<br><strong>1 litre full-cream milk</strong><br><strong>Finely grated zest of \u00bd lemon</strong><br><strong>1 pinch salt<br>150ml double cream</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp sweet sherry</strong>, preferably Pedro Xim\u00e9nez (optional)</p> <h2><strong>1 Oven or hob?</strong></h2> <p>Heat the oven to 160C (140 fan)/320F/gas 2\u00bd. If you prefer, you can make the pudding on the stove top in a heavy-based pan, partially covering the pan and cooking it over a very gentle heat, but I find it easier to keep a constant temperature in the oven. It also means you can leave it to do its own thing.</p> <h2><strong>2 Choose your pot and melt the butter</strong></h2> <p>However you\u2019re ultimately cooking the pudding, you\u2019ll need to start proceedings on the hob. If you have a medium pie dish that\u2019s flameproof, start by melting the butter in that over a low heat, otherwise use a large pan. Meanwhile, slit the vanilla pod down its length and scrape out most of the seeds, setting both aside with the other spices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"178f14dc5db0bc9a5ee3e4811bd6b8ea852ed810\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/178f14dc5db0bc9a5ee3e4811bd6b8ea852ed810/673_424_6352_6352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rice Pudding 3 Melt the butter, stir in the sugar to dissolve, then add the bay, vanilla and spices, before stirring in the rice to coat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melt the butter, stir in the sugar to dissolve, then add the bay, vanilla and spices, before stirring in the rice to coat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3 Add the flavourings</strong></h2> <p>Once the butter has melted, stir in the sugar and cook for a minute or so, until it dissolves, then add the bay leaf, vanilla pod and seeds, ground nutmeg and cinnamon, and toast for 30 seconds or so. Pour in the rice, and stir until the grains are well coated with butter and have become slightly translucent and started to swell.</p> <h2><strong>4 A note on the rice</strong></h2> <p>If you don\u2019t have pudding rice, you can make this with risotto rice (arborio, carnaroli, vialone nano) or, at a pinch, even long-grain varieties, such as the pleasantly fragrant basmati, but they will absorb the milk at a different rate, which will alter the consistency of the finished dish, so check on the pudding at regular intervals and add more liquid as necessary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5834bd23f0b19e3d6d59dcd519f5b94da9e0fb63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5834bd23f0b19e3d6d59dcd519f5b94da9e0fb63/84_0_7762_7760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rice Pudding 04. 5 Pour in the milk, then add grated lemon zest, a pinch of salt, cream and sherry, and bring up to simmering point.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pour in the milk, then add grated lemon zest, a pinch of salt, the cream and sherry, and bring up to simmering point.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5 Add the dairy, booze and lemon</h2> <p>Pour the milk into the pan, stirring as you do so to dislodge any clumps of rice or sugar that have formed on the bottom. Add the lemon zest, then stir in a pinch of salt, the cream and sherry, if using, and bring to just below a simmer.

      "bodyText": "I was put off rice pudding for life at school, but recanted in India when I tasted kheer: sweet, creamy proof that I\u2019d simply never eaten a good one. Consider the recipe below my attempt at short-grain evangelism. Deliciously rich and subtly spiced, I hope it will win this supremely comforting dessert a few more righteous converts. Prep 15 min Cook 2 hr Serves 4 50g butter \u00bd vanilla pod 50g soft light brown sugar 1 bay leaf \u00bc tsp freshly grated nutmeg \u00bc tsp ground cinnamon 100g pudding rice (short-grain) \u2013 see step 4 1 litre full-cream milk Finely grated zest of \u00bd lemon 1 pinch salt 150ml double cream 2 tbsp sweet sherry, preferably Pedro Xim\u00e9nez (optional) 1 Oven or hob? Heat the oven to 160C (140 fan)/320F/gas 2\u00bd. If you prefer, you can make the pudding on the stove top in a heavy-based pan, partially covering the pan and cooking it over a very gentle heat, but I find it easier to keep a constant temperature in the oven. It also means you can leave it to do its own thing. 2 Choose your pot and melt the butter However you\u2019re ultimately cooking the pudding, you\u2019ll need to start proceedings on the hob. If you have a medium pie dish that\u2019s flameproof, start by melting the butter in that over a low heat, otherwise use a large pan. Meanwhile, slit the vanilla pod down its length and scrape out most of the seeds, setting both aside with the other spices. 3 Add the flavourings Once the butter has melted, stir in the sugar and cook for a minute or so, until it dissolves, then add the bay leaf, vanilla pod and seeds, ground nutmeg and cinnamon, and toast for 30 seconds or so. Pour in the rice, and stir until the grains are well coated with butter and have become slightly translucent and started to swell. 4 A note on the rice If you don\u2019t have pudding rice, you can make this with risotto rice (arborio, carnaroli, vialone nano) or, at a pinch, even long-grain varieties, such as the pleasantly fragrant basmati, but they will absorb the milk at a different rate, which will alter the consistency of the finished dish, so check on the pudding at regular intervals and add more liquid as necessary. 5 Add the dairy, booze and lemon Pour the milk into the pan, stirring as you do so to dislodge any clumps of rice or sugar that have formed on the bottom. Add the lemon zest, then stir in a pinch of salt, the cream and sherry, if using, and bring to just below a simmer. (If you don\u2019t have sherry, but want to add some alcohol, see step 7.) 6 Bake the pudding Put the pot or pie dish into the hot oven (or transfer the rice pudding mix to an ovenproof dish, if you need to), and bake for about two hours, until it has just set on top, but is still slightly wobbly when shaken. It may well need longer, but check on it regularly, because in this instance, too runny is better than too dry. And leave it to cool down to warm before tucking in. 7 Variations on the theme This recipe is for a very basic rice pudding, and is easily adapted to other flavour combinations. The alcohol, for example, could be madeira, rum or whisky, or indeed any liqueur you fancy, from Irish cream to amaretto, though personally I\u2019d steer clear of creme de menthe as a general rule, as well as in this pudding. 8 Fruit or no fruit? I often serve rice pudding with stewed fruit \u2013 this one goes particularly well with apples \u2013 but you can also add a handful of dried fruit to the mixture at the same time as the lemon zest; if you like, soak it in warm sherry, rum, etc, for an hour or so beforehand. Others might well prefer chocolate chips, in which case I\u2019d recommend swapping the lemon zest for orange. 9 Alternative flavourings The spices are also up to you: substitute crushed cardamom pods and saffron for a more Indian note, add a dash of rose or orange blossom water for a taste of the Middle East (a scattering of roughly chopped pistachios or cashews would be good with either of those), or leave the spices out altogether if you prefer a plainer dessert, or if you want to serve the pudding with a highly flavoured jam or compote.",

The New York state attorney, Geoffrey Berman, has accused Prince Andrew of \u201czero cooperation\u201d and not responding to requests by the FBI and US lawyers for an interview over his friendship with the disgraced financier. Andrew is \u201cmore than happy to talk [but] hasn\u2019t been approached by them yet,\u201d sources insisted. Buckingham Palace refused to comment on Berman\u2019s claims, made at a news conference in New York on Monday, saying the matter was being dealt with by the prince\u2019s legal team. According to sources, Andrew is \u201ccommitted to the legal process\u201d. One reportedly said: \u201cHe is angry about the way this is being portrayed and bewildered as to why this was said in New York.\u201d Andrew stepped down from royal duties in November after his disastrous interview on BBC\u2019s Newsnight over his relationship with Epstein. He was criticised for failing to show any regret over his friendship with the financier, who took his own life in prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein, has alleged she was instructed to have sex with Andrew on three occasion from the age of 17. The prince categorically denies he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. At the time Andrew stood down, he insisted: \u201cI am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency.\u201d Berman, who is overseeing the investigation, told reporters outside Epstein\u2019s New York mansion that \u201cto date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation\u201d. The US investigation is looking at possible \u201cconspirators\u201d who worked with Epstein.

US investigators could interview him in the UK.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

      "bodyText": "Britons returning from coronavirus-hit Wuhan will be placed in quarantine for 14 days. Officials are considering taking passengers to a military base once they arrive home, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Advice from Public Health England published on Tuesday told UK citizens returning from Wuhan to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people, as is the advice with other flu viruses, and to call NHS 111 to inform them if they have recently travelled to the city. Flights taking Britons back home from the coronavirus-hit Chinese province of Hubei could begin on Thursday as urgent plans for a major evacuation were put in place. Passengers may be asked to sign a contract before they board the plane saying they agree to being placed in quarantine, the DHSC said. Anyone who does not wish to sign could be asked to stay. The health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted: \u201cWe are working hard to get British nationals back from Wuhan. Public safety is the top priority. Anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.\u201d Ministry of Defence sources said the option of quaranteening returnees at a military facility was under consideration if politicians deemed it was necessary. No facility had selected yet, they added, although conversations were ongoing between the Department of Health, the Foreign Office and the ministry. The advantage of using a base is that Britons returning from China could be flown in by a charter to a secure location where appropriate medical staff would be on hand, possibly to transfer people to specialist hospitals if needed. But such a drastic option would be most likely be deployed only in the last resort. The Foreign Office is warning against all but essential travel to the country because of the outbreak of the disease, and British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China with immediate effect. Britons in the city of Wuhan had until 11am (3am GMT) to contact the UK consulate telling them if they wished to leave \u2013 it is thought at least 200 British citizens want to return. A British teacher in Wuhan said UK citizens were being given details of forthcoming flights and that a number of Britons had arranged to return home, with some scheduled on a flight at 7am on Thursday. The Foreign Office said it might become more difficult for British nationals in other provinces to leave and advised them to \u201cmake decisions based on their own personal circumstances\u201d over whether to evacuate. The British embassy in Beijing warned that transport to get UK citizens out \u201cmay happen quickly and with short notice\u201d. The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: \u201c[Officials are] working urgently to finalise arrangements for an assisted departure from Hubei province for British nationals this week, and are in contact with people in Hubei to ensure they register their interest and that we can keep them updated.\u201d He added: \u201cDue to the increasing travel restrictions and the public health situation, we now advise against all but essential travel to China.\u201d The death toll in China has risen to 132, with confirmed infections up to nearly 6,000. France was the first European country to report a case, while four cases have been confirmed in Germany. The United Arab Emirates has also confirmed its first cases of the virus, in a family who recently returned to the country from Wuhan. Australian officials announced plans to evacuate some of its nationals from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, with plans to quarantine them in the Christmas Island immigration detention centre for up to 14 days \u2013 the incubation period for the virus. In the UK, the DHSC has given the all-clear to 97 people but scientists predict the virus may have entered the country. More than 1,400 people have returned from Wuhan since 10 January.

As a longtime LGBTQ+ celebrity and sole LGBTQ+ member of congress, Wyllys had endured constant death threats and even bullying from fellow members of congress.

It's true | David Miranda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That Wyllys was replaced by another LGBTQ+ congress member provoked a contentious exchange between David and Bolsonaro that went viral on Twitter. David\u2019s substantially increased visibility as the new LGBTQ+ member of congress provoked countless and highly detailed death threats from the Bolsonaro movement toward our family. That David, in 2016, had become the first-ever elected LGBTQ+ member of the Rio city council already had made him a target of much animus in a city <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdd61718-4b10-11e9-bbc9-6917dce3dc62\">dominated by paramilitary gangs</a> and rightwing evangelical groups.</p> <p>But his new status as the only openly LGBTQ+ member of the lower house of the federal congress made him a prime target of the vitriolic anti-LGBTQ+ Bolsonaro movement. That primal animus was enhanced by the fact that our public 15-year marriage and our two children serve as a living refutation of the false and toxic depiction of LGBTQ+ life as barren, unhappy, sickly and solitary, an anti-LGBTQ+ demonization campaign that is central to the Bolsonaro movement\u2019s political identity.</p> <p>A massive new wave of media coverage about our family was triggered when Glenn and the Intercept began their <a href=\"https://apnews.com/0e998ebedbd64f6d868a3fa570ed1f6c\">series of explosive expos\u00e9</a><a href=\"https://apnews.com/0e998ebedbd64f6d868a3fa570ed1f6c\">s last June</a> about rampant corruption at the highest levels of the Bolsonaro government, provoking a wave of violent threats, official acts of reprisal and a powerful fake news machine erected by the Bolsonaro movement against their enemies. All of those seemingly endless multipronged attacks culminated last week in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-case-against-glenn-greenwald-an-outrage-in-brazil-and-beyond\">criminal charges brought</a> against Glenn by a far-right prosecutor that have been widely condemned domestically and internationally <a href=\"https://freedom.press/news/more-than-40-press-freedom-and-civil-liberties-groups-denounce-brazils-charges-against-glenn-greenwald/\">as legally frivolous</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-case-against-glenn-greenwald-an-outrage-in-brazil-and-beyond\">blatant assault on a free press</a>.</p> <p>But the sense of danger and political violence in our lives, and for many others in Brazil, began almost two years ago. On 14 March 2018, Marielle Franco \u2013 the LGBTQ+, black, favela-raised city councilwoman from Rio de Janeiro \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/marielle-franco-shot-dead-targeted-killing-rio\">was gunned down</a> while riding in her car on the streets of Rio at roughly 9pm in a brutal political assassination. Franco was one of our family\u2019s best friends as well as a rising political star, a vessel of hope to so many people marginalized for decades and who had no voice. The loss was a major trauma, still unhealed, for both the country and for our lives.</p> <p>Franco was a member of David\u2019s party, the leftwing Socialism and Liberty party (PSOL). David \u2013 also black, LGBTQ+ and raised in a violent favela as an orphan \u2013 was as unlikely as Franco to occupy political power in a country long plagued by severe inequality, racial inequities and discrimination of all types. Because they shared the same causes of combating lethal police violence and inequality, they sat next to one another in the city council chamber. Her politically motivated murder at the age of 37 brought political violence into our lives as a lurking, terrorizing reality which has only intensified since then.</p> <p>The end of that year saw the election of Bolsonaro as president despite his decades-long advocacy of a return to the US/UK-supported military dictatorship. That regime brutally ruled the country with torture and murder until 1985, torturing and killing dissidents, journalists and anyone who opposed them. Along with his long-taboo praise for the dictatorship (except when he criticized it for being insufficiently violent and repressive), Bolsonaro, though relegated to the fringes of political life as a congressman for 30 years, gained media attention through a slew of shockingly bigoted comments against the nation\u2019s racial minorities, its indigenous population in the Amazon and especially against LGBTQ+ people.</p> <p>But in the 2018 election, it was not only Bolsonaro but also his far-right Social Liberal party (PSL), which barely existed the year before, that enjoyed a stunning rise to power. Virtually overnight, PSL, filled with previously obscure and fanatically anti-democratic figures, became the second most represented party in congress, just a few seats behind the center-left Workers\u2019 party that had governed the country since 2002. Among its elected members were two police candidates who, days before the election, had <a href=\"https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/eleicoes/2018/noticias/2018/10/04/placa-de-marielle-foi-quebrada-para-restaurar-a-ordem-diz-flavio-bolsonaro.htm\">destroyed a street sign</a> erected in homage to Franco with their fists raised in the air.</p> <p>Just weeks after Bolsonaro\u2019s election, a terrifying scandal <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/18/jair-bolsonaro-family-militias-gangs-brazil/\">was revealed</a> in which Bolsonaro\u2019s eldest son, Fl\u00e1vio, who had been elected to the federal senate in the 2018 election, was found to have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-crime/son-of-brazil-president-faces-fresh-question-about-rio-aides-idUSKCN1PG2Q7\">employed in his cabinet</a> as a state representative for a full decade both the wife and mother of the chief of Rio\u2019s most violent and feared paramilitary gang. Composed largely of police and military officers, the militia specialized in abusing their law enforcement expertise to carry out highly skilled pay-for-hire assassinations, including \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-crime/son-of-brazil-president-faces-fresh-question-about-rio-aides-idUSKCN1PG2Q7\">police believed </a>\u2013 the assassination of Franco.</p> <p>A police operation carried out as part of the investigation into Franco\u2019s murder succeeded in apprehending five of the top six militia leaders, but the sixth, who fled and is now a fugitive, was the top leader \u2013 the one whose wife and mother were disturbingly employed for 10 years by Bolsonaro\u2019s son. This shocking link of the now all-powerful Bolsonaro family to the most terrifying paramilitary gang of Rio has since been strengthened by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/13/jair-bolsonaro-paramilitaries-marielle-franco-suspects\">newly discovered connections</a>, including photos of Bolsonaro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/03/jair-bolsonaro-photo-marielle-franco-murder-accused\">with both of the killers</a>, that one of the ex-police officers arrested for having pulled the trigger that killed Franco was a neighbor of Bolsonaro\u2019s in his gated community, while the other police officer, who was the driver of the car, has a daughter who dated Bolsonaro\u2019s youngest son.</p> <p>In early 2019, David\u2019s replacement of Wyllys in congress became a much-publicized and dramatic story in a country where anti-LGBTQ+ animus had become a major force in Brazil\u2019s political life and where very few LGBTQ+ candidates ever occupy high office. The acrimonious <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidmirandario/status/1088518648283783175?lang=en\">Twitter exchange</a> between Bolsonaro and David instantly converted David into a new prime enemy of that movement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The last nine months of our lives, since the beginning of those reports, have been filled with attacks of every kind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That Glenn had co-founded a growing and increasingly vocal Brazilian bureau of the Intercept in 2016 that was highly critical of the Bolsonaro campaign and then his presidency made us both visible adversaries of this newly empowered far-right movement. That we are a gay, interracial couple in a country governed by a virulently anti-LGBTQ+ movement made each of us separately, but especially together, a particularly reviled yet visible target of their wrath. In sum, the bulk of the hatred devoted to Wyllys quickly transferred to David, to our marriage and to our family. As a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-greenwald.html\">New York Times article</a> in July put it: \u201cThe two men find themselves on the front lines of the country\u2019s increasingly bitter political divide.\u201d</p> <p>Since entering congress a little more than a year ago, David has not left the house without armed security and an armored vehicle of the kind that would have stopped the 11 bullets pumped into Franco\u2019s car. We significantly escalated security measures at our home, and our two newly adopted sons had to be driven back and forth to school by security agents.</p> <p>All of that was the context for the reporting Glenn and his Intercept colleagues began on 9 June 2019, and which has continued through to this day. It is hard to overstate the political impact of this journalism. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/brazil-glenn-greenwald-investigation-outcry-bar-association-journalists\">the Guardian reported</a> last July, the reports \u201chave had an explosive impact on Brazilian politics and dominated headlines for weeks\u201d.</p> <p>The last nine months of our lives, since the beginning of those reports, have been filled with attacks of every kind. We have received detailed death threats containing personal, non-public data available only to the state. Many have been directed at our two sons, sometimes with gruesome detail. A month after our reporting began, a news site notorious for being a dumping ground for leaks by S\u00e9rgio Moro announced that an agency under his command had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/brazil-glenn-greenwald-investigation-outcry-bar-association-journalists\">initiated an investigation</a> into Glenn\u2019s personal finances, one <a href=\"https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-21121-supreme-court-minister-prohibits-investigation-journalist-and-guarantees-source-confid\">stopped by the </a><a href=\"https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-21121-supreme-court-minister-prohibits-investigation-journalist-and-guarantees-source-confid\">supreme </a><a href=\"https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-21121-supreme-court-minister-prohibits-investigation-journalist-and-guarantees-source-confid\">court</a> on the ground that it was clearly retaliatory and thus a violation of the constitutional guarantee of a free press. We learned in September that the same federal agency had also initiated an investigation into David\u2019s personal finances, one launched two days after the Intercept\u2019s reporting began.</p> <p>With this reporting, the death threats intensified to an entirely new level. Now, in addition to David, Glenn also has not been able to leave home for any reason without a team of armed security and an armored vehicle since last June. The same is true of the Intercept\u2019s Brazil editor, Leandro Demori, who has been the target of horrific threats aimed at his family. The exterior of our house now resembles a fortified prison, and its interior is filled with cameras and guards.</p> <p>In November, Glenn appeared on a popular rightwing radio and YouTube program alongside a pro-Bolsonaro journalist who had, a month earlier, called on a children\u2019s judge to investigate whether we are sufficiently taking care of our children \u2013 on the ground that David works as a congressman and Glenn works on these expos\u00e9s. When Glenn confronted him on air about having used our children in this manner, the journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/07/glenn-greenwald-brazil-augusto-nunes-radio-show\">physically assaulted him</a>. The more significant part of the episode occurred afterwards: many of Bolsonaro\u2019s closest allies, including his politician sons and the \u201cguru\u201d of his movement, not only cheered the assault but said their only regret was that the attack on Glenn was not more violent.</p> <p>It is sometimes hard for citizens of centuries-old western democracies to appreciate how much easier it is for a young democracy like Brazil to easily slip back into full-scale tyranny, or to be violently brought back to it. That Brazil now has a president and is dominated by a political movement that openly seeks such a regression makes the threat all the more acute. In politics, they crave violence and civil conflict in lieu of dialogue and elections because they view those as the necessary conditions to justify a return of dictatorship-era repression. That is why they rely on threats, violence, attacks, intimidation and abuse of state power: they need civil upheaval and institutional conflict as a pretext for the repression they openly support.</p> <p>When news broke last week that Glenn had been criminally charged, many wondered how that could have happened given that the federal police just weeks earlier had closed its comprehensive investigation into the hacking of Brazilian authorities and <a href=\"https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/justica/spoofing-pf-buscou-crimes-em-conduta-de-glenn-mas-nao-encontrou\">concluded that he was involved in no wrongdoing</a> (to the contrary, the report emphasized that Glenn had exercised extreme caution in carrying out his work as a journalist). That the supreme court in July had barred any investigation into Glenn provoked the obvious question: if the high court had barred investigation of Glenn in connection with this journalism, how could they indict him for it?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Brazil is the country we love and we intend to fight this repression, not flee from it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The answer is that the Bolsonaro movement seeks to prove that they are not limited by law or anything else. To prove that, they will defy court orders, ignore police investigations, ride roughshod over all other institutions \u2013 just as the military dictatorship did by decree, using violence, torture and murder of dissidents, ignoring of supreme court orders and summary removal of congress members who even minimally opposed them. The playbook they are using is as dark and horrifying as it is familiar and obvious.</p> <p>Because Glenn is a US citizen with a valid US passport, we could leave Brazil at any time. David and our sons would be entitled to automatic US citizenship. But we have not done that and we never will. Brazil is the country we love and we intend to fight this repression, not flee from it. Brazil is an extraordinary country, unique in so many ways, and is easily worth fighting for. We could never in good conscience exploit the privileges we have to leave behind a country we love and the millions of people who are not able to leave.</p> <p>When you live in a country where roughly half the population endured life under a military tyranny, you end up meeting many who risked so much to fight against it and fight for democracy. Brazil re-democratized in 1985 only after two decades of profoundly difficult struggle, protest, organizing and resistance. We personally know many people who were imprisoned or exiled for years for their fight against the dictatorship. Many of their friends and comrades were murdered by the military regime while they fought for the cause of Brazilian democracy.</p> <p>Courage is contagious. Those are the people who inspire us and so many like us in Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil who are confronting state repression to defend the democracy that so many people suffered so much to bring about. Demagogues and despots like Bolsonaro are a dime a dozen. They centrally rely on intimidation, fear and the use of state repression to consolidate power. A refusal to give into that fear, but instead to join hands with those who intend to fight against it, is always the antidote to this toxin.</p> <ul> <li><p>Glenn Greenwald is a co-founding editor of the Intercept.

To prove that, they will defy court orders, ignore police investigations, ride roughshod over all other institutions \u2013 just as the military dictatorship did by decree, using violence, torture and murder of dissidents, ignoring of supreme court orders and summary removal of congress members who even minimally opposed them. The playbook they are using is as dark and horrifying as it is familiar and obvious. Because Glenn is a US citizen with a valid US passport, we could leave Brazil at any time. David and our sons would be entitled to automatic US citizenship. But we have not done that and we never will. Brazil is the country we love and we intend to fight this repression, not flee from it. Brazil is an extraordinary country, unique in so many ways, and is easily worth fighting for. We could never in good conscience exploit the privileges we have to leave behind a country we love and the millions of people who are not able to leave. When you live in a country where roughly half the population endured life under a military tyranny, you end up meeting many who risked so much to fight against it and fight for democracy. Brazil re-democratized in 1985 only after two decades of profoundly difficult struggle, protest, organizing and resistance. We personally know many people who were imprisoned or exiled for years for their fight against the dictatorship. Many of their friends and comrades were murdered by the military regime while they fought for the cause of Brazilian democracy. Courage is contagious. Those are the people who inspire us and so many like us in Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil who are confronting state repression to defend the democracy that so many people suffered so much to bring about. Demagogues and despots like Bolsonaro are a dime a dozen. They centrally rely on intimidation, fear and the use of state repression to consolidate power. A refusal to give into that fear, but instead to join hands with those who intend to fight against it, is always the antidote to this toxin. Glenn Greenwald is a co-founding editor of the Intercept. He is also a former Guardian columnist. David Miranda is a member of the Brazilian congress for the Socialism and Liberty party and a Guardian US columnist. They are married",

      "body": "<p>According to the Italian art critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/28/in-praise-of-giorgio-vasari\">Giorgio Vasari</a>, writing hundreds of miles away and more than a century later, the Flemish painter Jan van Eyck \u201cdelighted in alchemy\u201d. As he mixed up compounds by candlelight in a workshop by a canal in Bruges, he hit on the secret of oil painting. There\u2019s no proof of any of this \u2013 but as you look at his uncannily perfect paintings in the epochal new survey of his genius at Ghent\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts, it\u2019s easy to believe he dabbled in magic.</p> <p>The proof twinkles between the thumb and index finger of Jan de Leeuw, in Van Eyck\u2019s 1436 portrait of this fellow craftsman. De Leeuw was a leading Bruges goldsmith and, as he fixes a sharp, clear gaze straight at you, he holds a ring he has made. It\u2019s as much rivalry as homage. The jeweller\u2019s art is intricate, but painting is something else. The ring glints in dazzles of yellow, catching a beam of light. The goldsmith made a reflective object, but Van Eyck has made the light itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"996ac6873e15a0c12265d4d06798cf7e571d7443\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/996ac6873e15a0c12265d4d06798cf7e571d7443/0_538_8686_5211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alchemy \u2026 a close-up view of the Portrait of Jan de Leeuw, 1436.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alchemy \u2026 a close-up view of the Portrait of Jan de Leeuw, 1436.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Making gold from base metal was the alchemist\u2019s dream.

      "bodyText": "According to the Italian art critic Giorgio Vasari, writing hundreds of miles away and more than a century later, the Flemish painter Jan van Eyck \u201cdelighted in alchemy\u201d. As he mixed up compounds by candlelight in a workshop by a canal in Bruges, he hit on the secret of oil painting. There\u2019s no proof of any of this \u2013 but as you look at his uncannily perfect paintings in the epochal new survey of his genius at Ghent\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts, it\u2019s easy to believe he dabbled in magic. The proof twinkles between the thumb and index finger of Jan de Leeuw, in Van Eyck\u2019s 1436 portrait of this fellow craftsman. De Leeuw was a leading Bruges goldsmith and, as he fixes a sharp, clear gaze straight at you, he holds a ring he has made. It\u2019s as much rivalry as homage. The jeweller\u2019s art is intricate, but painting is something else. The ring glints in dazzles of yellow, catching a beam of light.

The tiny club can\u2019t match the fees paid by bigger places, but its reputation for a feverish crowd and warm atmosphere draws heavyweight names. That\u2019s how Villalobos became an annual fixture at Masquerade. (Closer\u2019s cultural standing has been strengthened thanks to its two summer festivals, Strichka and Brave! Factory, which are the biggest of their kind in Ukraine.)</p> <p>Saturday nights such as this often have an open-ended finish, with the DJs encouraged to go as long as the vibe holds. \u201cBut we never finish when it\u2019s empty,\u201d says Basha. \u201cIf we finish on a high, people say, \u2018We want a bit more\u2019, and we say \u2018OK, come next time.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Closing duties at the extended nights are usually handled by one of the residents, a group of 13 Ukrainian artists who have collectively shaped the club\u2019s musical identity. For regulars, these locals are as much of a draw as the stars that fly over for the weekend. It\u2019s a close-knit group that\u2019s steadily built over the years. At first, says Closer co-founder Sergey Yatsenko, they only had four DJs: Basha, Vova Klk, Bambu, and Shakolin. \u201cThen every three or four months we added someone, because we heard some interesting Ukrainian artists.\u201d</p> <p>Basha and Vova Klk spun at the first Closer party in a disused restaurant in January 2012, which wasn\u2019t much more than a small gathering for friends: 80 people came, and entrance was free to anyone who clicked \u201cattending\u201d on Facebook. After a few more successful nights, they found an old ribbon factory in Podil, where they\u2019ve stayed for the last seven years. \u201cRenting was quite cheap as nothing was here,\u201d says Basha. \u201cNo heating, no proper windows, no proper floor, no proper walls. It was absolutely unusable. We had to do everything. This is one of our favourite things to do: to come to an open space and invent the idea.\u201d</p> <p>Today, the sprawling building encompasses an all-hours gallery, a clothing shop, a tea garden, and a vegan and vegetarian restaurant where guests refuel on the cheese-filled bread khachapuri, smoothies in hand. Leaving the party gets even harder in the summer, when house DJs lay down subtle grooves on Lesnoy Prichal, a sunny outdoor terrace primed for tireless after-hours sessions.</p> <p>The rest of the ecosystem comes alive during the week. While a team of artists prepares handmade installations for the parties, vinyl geeks dig in the record shop run by Shakolin. There\u2019s also a furniture shop, live music venue, theatre, tattoo studio and radio station, while the club room doubles up as a space for jazz concerts, exhibitions and lectures. \u201cWe tell people who come to the concerts about the parties, so they can get acquainted with electronic music,\u201d Basha says. \u201cAnd we tell people who come to the parties about the concerts, so they can get acquainted with jazz. It\u2019s an educational process. It\u2019s not a club \u2013 this is a cultural centre.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26a34fa2df617cdbb916603e9770154fc69eb5e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26a34fa2df617cdbb916603e9770154fc69eb5e1/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If I feel that you\u2019re a nice person and your heart is open, I\u2019ll always invite you in.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If I feel that you\u2019re a nice person and your heart is open, I\u2019ll always invite you in.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Ptaag</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the club is inclusive, it maintains strict standards on who can enter.

      "bodyText": "You get the feeling you\u2019re in for a big night as soon as you exit the taxi outside Closer. Climbing the graffitied staircase that leads to the Kyiv club evokes a childlike sense of adventure; not least at tonight\u2019s Masquerade, an annual marathon session where everyone hides behind a face mask in celebration of the crew\u2019s eighth birthday. Many of the mystery figures inside will stay glued to the wooden dancefloor from Saturday night until the final glimmers of the party on Sunday evening. It\u2019s not entirely an endurance test: while the main room is all whistles and whooping, the cushion-filled ambient floor has a similarly meditative vibe to Glastonbury\u2019s Green Fields. Closer is the most celebrated nightclub in eastern Europe\u2019s feted scene, and Masquerade is one of its most anticipated nights of the year. By mid-morning, the music downstairs becomes a kaleidoscope of 90s US house, timeless Detroit techno and head-twisting acid via ultra-intricate, psychedelic minimal house \u2013 styles that Closer helped popularise in the Ukrainian capital. Foraging through a crate of records by the front row of dancers are Ricardo Villalobos and Zip, who influenced the team behind the club long before its inception. Closer art director and resident DJ Timur Basha sums up what they taught them: \u201cNothing is important. No philosophy, and everybody is welcome.\u201d Tonight, Zip hands over to Basha to close things around 17 hours into the party. Other recent guests include Laurent Garnier, Helena Hauff, and Moodymann. The tiny club can\u2019t match the fees paid by bigger places, but its reputation for a feverish crowd and warm atmosphere draws heavyweight names. That\u2019s how Villalobos became an annual fixture at Masquerade. (Closer\u2019s cultural standing has been strengthened thanks to its two summer festivals, Strichka and Brave! Factory, which are the biggest of their kind in Ukraine.) Saturday nights such as this often have an open-ended finish, with the DJs encouraged to go as long as the vibe holds. \u201cBut we never finish when it\u2019s empty,\u201d says Basha. \u201cIf we finish on a high, people say, \u2018We want a bit more\u2019, and we say \u2018OK, come next time.\u2019\u201d Closing duties at the extended nights are usually handled by one of the residents, a group of 13 Ukrainian artists who have collectively shaped the club\u2019s musical identity. For regulars, these locals are as much of a draw as the stars that fly over for the weekend. It\u2019s a close-knit group that\u2019s steadily built over the years. At first, says Closer co-founder Sergey Yatsenko, they only had four DJs: Basha, Vova Klk, Bambu, and Shakolin. \u201cThen every three or four months we added someone, because we heard some interesting Ukrainian artists.\u201d Basha and Vova Klk spun at the first Closer party in a disused restaurant in January 2012, which wasn\u2019t much more than a small gathering for friends: 80 people came, and entrance was free to anyone who clicked \u201cattending\u201d on Facebook. After a few more successful nights, they found an old ribbon factory in Podil, where they\u2019ve stayed for the last seven years. \u201cRenting was quite cheap as nothing was here,\u201d says Basha. \u201cNo heating, no proper windows, no proper floor, no proper walls. It was absolutely unusable. We had to do everything. This is one of our favourite things to do: to come to an open space and invent the idea.\u201d Today, the sprawling building encompasses an all-hours gallery, a clothing shop, a tea garden, and a vegan and vegetarian restaurant where guests refuel on the cheese-filled bread khachapuri, smoothies in hand. Leaving the party gets even harder in the summer, when house DJs lay down subtle grooves on Lesnoy Prichal, a sunny outdoor terrace primed for tireless after-hours sessions. The rest of the ecosystem comes alive during the week. While a team of artists prepares handmade installations for the parties, vinyl geeks dig in the record shop run by Shakolin. There\u2019s also a furniture shop, live music venue, theatre, tattoo studio and radio station, while the club room doubles up as a space for jazz concerts, exhibitions and lectures. \u201cWe tell people who come to the concerts about the parties, so they can get acquainted with electronic music,\u201d Basha says. \u201cAnd we tell people who come to the parties about the concerts, so they can get acquainted with jazz. It\u2019s an educational process. It\u2019s not a club \u2013 this is a cultural centre.\u201d While the club is inclusive, it maintains strict standards on who can enter. Long-term staffer Inna Shchupko greets every guest as they reach the top of that staircase. As the door manager, it\u2019s her job to decide who gets in. Inside, she can be seen reprimanding anyone who defies the photo ban, an anti-Instagram stance that\u2019s commonplace in many of the world\u2019s best dancing spots. Some have described these protective measures as elitist, but Shchupko argues that they\u2019re essential for maintaining the right atmosphere. \u201cWe\u2019re all friends here,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I see someone for the first time, I need to understand why they\u2019re here. It\u2019s not about dress code or music education \u2013 if I feel that you\u2019re a nice person and your heart is open, I\u2019ll always invite you in.\u201d Like many other scene-defining nightclubs, Closer has endured unwelcome attention from more than just the odd boozed-up tourist. When a series of armed police raids targeting the venue found some guests in possession of personal quantities of amphetamines and cannabis in 2015, a court hearing ruled that the club was enabling drug trafficking and dealing. A protest rave followed, akin to one in Tbilisi in 2018 when interior ministry special police units carrying automatic weapons raided Bassiani and Cafe Gallery. Closer appealed and the decision to close the venue was overturned in a higher court. Nevertheless, Kyiv\u2019s electronic scene is thriving. \u201cFive to seven years ago, I could name you every [electronic] artist in Ukraine,\u201d Basha says. \u201cNow there are so many, and the scene keeps growing.

Although students can now access postgraduate loans that cover fees and living costs, universities are also hiking tuition fees.

You\u2019ll find the most comprehensive list of these in the Grants Register, published every year \u2013 it contains information on 1,200 awarding bodies in 58 countries. If you\u2019re doing a master\u2019s in a particular subject or sector, identify the main trusts and foundations that operate in that field and have serious money to give away, such as the Wellcome Trust for health-related issues.</p> <p>Research councils such as the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) or the Medical Research Council (MRC) are another potential source of funding, again depending on your chosen subject. Scholarships, grants and bursaries may also be available. Check on sites such as <a href=\"https://www.thescholarshiphub.org.uk/\">Thescholarshiphub</a> or with your course provider.</p> <p>Rosemary Proctor used three scholarships to fund her graduate diploma in law (GDL) and bar professional training course (BPTC) where she\u2019s currently studying at BPP University Law School Manchester. She holds an advocacy scholarship from BPP, and a Lord Brougham GDL scholarship and a Lord Denning BPTC scholarship from Lincoln\u2019s Inn. \u201cGoogle was my best friend when I was applying, as I discovered that my course providers had a selection of awards,\u201d she says. \u201cEligibility for some of these is means-based, and I\u2019m unaware of any award that would cover the entirety of anyone\u2019s course fees and living expenses for the GDL or BPTC \u2013 but course provider awards are still a great supplement and can make all the difference.\u201d</p> <p>However, she also used her own money. \u201cWhile recognising that it may simply be impossible for many people, I\u2019d advise taking a year out to work in between undergraduate and graduate study. I came away with a decent pot of savings and a bit of work experience.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/10/heres-what-to-ask-yourself-before-taking-a-masters-degree\">Here's what to ask yourself before taking a master's degree</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s also worth considering if the university where you took your undergraduate degree may also offer discounts for returning postgraduates.

The most recent figures from the Complete University Guide\u2019s annual survey shows that the average fee for home and EU students taking a classroom-based taught postgrad course is now \u00a37,400 \u2013 an increase of 8.3%. But if bgoing abroad isn\u2019t practical, how can you fund your master\u2019s in the UK? Many charities have grants of all sizes available for master\u2019s funding. You\u2019ll find the most comprehensive list of these in the Grants Register, published every year \u2013 it contains information on 1,200 awarding bodies in 58 countries. If you\u2019re doing a master\u2019s in a particular subject or sector, identify the main trusts and foundations that operate in that field and have serious money to give away, such as the Wellcome Trust for health-related issues. Research councils such as the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) or the Medical Research Council (MRC) are another potential source of funding, again depending on your chosen subject. Scholarships, grants and bursaries may also be available. Check on sites such as Thescholarshiphub or with your course provider. Rosemary Proctor used three scholarships to fund her graduate diploma in law (GDL) and bar professional training course (BPTC) where she\u2019s currently studying at BPP University Law School Manchester. She holds an advocacy scholarship from BPP, and a Lord Brougham GDL scholarship and a Lord Denning BPTC scholarship from Lincoln\u2019s Inn. \u201cGoogle was my best friend when I was applying, as I discovered that my course providers had a selection of awards,\u201d she says. \u201cEligibility for some of these is means-based, and I\u2019m unaware of any award that would cover the entirety of anyone\u2019s course fees and living expenses for the GDL or BPTC \u2013 but course provider awards are still a great supplement and can make all the difference.\u201d However, she also used her own money. \u201cWhile recognising that it may simply be impossible for many people, I\u2019d advise taking a year out to work in between undergraduate and graduate study. I came away with a decent pot of savings and a bit of work experience.\u201d It\u2019s also worth considering if the university where you took your undergraduate degree may also offer discounts for returning postgraduates. The University of Surrey, for example, is offering 10% off taught master\u2019s fees for alumni, while the University of Westminster offers 15%. And some postgraduates are even turning to crowdfunding \u2013 it\u2019s a particularly popular way of raising money for arts master\u2019s degrees. On GoFundMe, students are currently raising money to fund masters in contemporary dance, theatre directing, and music, along with more traditional subjects such as law. But while many have ambitious targets, few seem to raise more than a couple of hundred pounds, so you may also need to look elsewhere. Download the postgraduate education supplement",

If Saudi officials celebrated, they did so quietly, relieved Suleimani was dead, and even more relieved they didn\u2019t have to do it themselves, but wary of Iranian retaliation. There were calls for quick de-escalation, and within three days the crown prince\u2019s brother and deputy minister of defence, Khalid bin Salman, travelled to Washington DC for <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/07/media/oval-office-meeting-trump-saudi-arabia/index.html\" title=\"\">meetings at the White House</a>.</p> <p>This pattern of clamouring for tough action against Iran and then calling for de-escalation has characterised the Saudi-Iran rivalry since the Iranian revolution of 1979. That year is remembered mostly as the moment when Iran and the US became enemies in the wake of the US embassy hostage crisis in November. But the relationship between Tehran and Riyadh was also transformed. The two countries, once friendly rivals and pillars of US efforts to contain Soviet influence in the region, became enemies when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the ultimate leader of the revolution, began to challenge the Saudis in their role as leaders of the Muslim world and custodians of the two holy sites of Islam, Mecca and Medina.</p> <p>The rivalry has become an intrinsic part of US-Iran enmity over the past 40 years, creating a threesome in which Saudi Arabia plays the role of indispensable counterweight to Tehran. But Saudi Arabia both thrives off this state of affairs and feeds it. As much as the kingdom fears Iran, its status as America\u2019s special friend in the region has become tied to the continuation of the regime in Tehran.</p> <p>This explains why Riyadh was so angry with Barack Obama for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/sep/25/obama-rouhani-iranians-cautiously-optimistic\" title=\"\">pursuing detente with Iran</a>, worried it would undermine its own place in the region. This dependence has become even more important at a time when the US-Saudi relationship is fraught with tensions over the alleged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-jeff-bezos-and-saudi-arabia-with-friends-like-these\" title=\"\">hacking of Amazon president Jeff Bezos\u2019s phone</a> by bin Salman and the killing of the Washington Post columnist and Saudi journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/24/saudi-arabia-planned-to-spy-on-jamal-khashoggi-fiancee-hatice-cengiz-in-uk\" title=\"\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. All of Saudi Arabia\u2019s faults and excesses seem to be excused as long as the Trump administration is focused on pressuring Iran.</p> <p>But Saudi Arabia now finds itself with a conundrum. The kingdom wants Iran beaten up but not broken, and it relies on others to do the job because it is not up to the task \u2013 not militarily and not from a strategic planning perspective. However, Saudi Arabia has found that the Trump administration may be a fickle friend when it comes to defending the kingdom in case of an Iranian attack, as happened in September 2019, when a suspected Iranian drone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/16/saudi-arabia-oil-attacks-everything-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">struck Saudi oil facilities</a>. The US responded with a lot of heat but little fire: there was no US retaliation on behalf of Saudi Arabia. And though the Trump administration has since deployed thousands of additional troops to the kingdom, the Saudis still felt vulnerable. This is why, within a month of the attack on the Saudi Aramco oil processing facilities, the Saudis were exploring <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-talks.html\" title=\"\">indirect talks with Iran</a>, with the help of Iraq and Pakistan, to try to reduce tensions.</p> <p>After the killing of Suleimani, the Saudi calls for de-escalation fit the same pattern. Having watched with alarm as Iran expanded its influence in the region over the past few years, thanks in large parts to Suleimani, the kingdom will now be hoping there\u2019s an opportunity for them: no matter how many of Suleimani\u2019s stratagems have been institutionalised, his successor will not be as efficient.

      "bodyText": "In a video animation released in December 2017 the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, oversees an invasion of Iran after Iranian boats attack a Saudi humanitarian ship. At the end of the video, Saudi troops storm a military compound where a haggard, trembling Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds force, surrenders on his knees. The video, created by an outfit calling itself Saudi Strike Force, was produced in multiple languages including Mandarin and has been viewed more than 1.5m times. In real life, Suleimani is now dead, killed not by the Saudis but in a US strike on 3 January outside Baghdad airport, having just returned from Lebanon and Syria on one of his many missions as the architect of Iran\u2019s regional power base. Saudis on Twitter were gleeful and official Saudi media were jubilant, declaring in al-Riyadh newspaper that a new decade had started for the region as Iran\u2019s dark shadow receded. If Saudi officials celebrated, they did so quietly, relieved Suleimani was dead, and even more relieved they didn\u2019t have to do it themselves, but wary of Iranian retaliation. There were calls for quick de-escalation, and within three days the crown prince\u2019s brother and deputy minister of defence, Khalid bin Salman, travelled to Washington DC for meetings at the White House. This pattern of clamouring for tough action against Iran and then calling for de-escalation has characterised the Saudi-Iran rivalry since the Iranian revolution of 1979. That year is remembered mostly as the moment when Iran and the US became enemies in the wake of the US embassy hostage crisis in November. But the relationship between Tehran and Riyadh was also transformed. The two countries, once friendly rivals and pillars of US efforts to contain Soviet influence in the region, became enemies when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the ultimate leader of the revolution, began to challenge the Saudis in their role as leaders of the Muslim world and custodians of the two holy sites of Islam, Mecca and Medina. The rivalry has become an intrinsic part of US-Iran enmity over the past 40 years, creating a threesome in which Saudi Arabia plays the role of indispensable counterweight to Tehran. But Saudi Arabia both thrives off this state of affairs and feeds it. As much as the kingdom fears Iran, its status as America\u2019s special friend in the region has become tied to the continuation of the regime in Tehran. This explains why Riyadh was so angry with Barack Obama for pursuing detente with Iran, worried it would undermine its own place in the region. This dependence has become even more important at a time when the US-Saudi relationship is fraught with tensions over the alleged hacking of Amazon president Jeff Bezos\u2019s phone by bin Salman and the killing of the Washington Post columnist and Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. All of Saudi Arabia\u2019s faults and excesses seem to be excused as long as the Trump administration is focused on pressuring Iran. But Saudi Arabia now finds itself with a conundrum. The kingdom wants Iran beaten up but not broken, and it relies on others to do the job because it is not up to the task \u2013 not militarily and not from a strategic planning perspective. However, Saudi Arabia has found that the Trump administration may be a fickle friend when it comes to defending the kingdom in case of an Iranian attack, as happened in September 2019, when a suspected Iranian drone struck Saudi oil facilities. The US responded with a lot of heat but little fire: there was no US retaliation on behalf of Saudi Arabia. And though the Trump administration has since deployed thousands of additional troops to the kingdom, the Saudis still felt vulnerable. This is why, within a month of the attack on the Saudi Aramco oil processing facilities, the Saudis were exploring indirect talks with Iran, with the help of Iraq and Pakistan, to try to reduce tensions. After the killing of Suleimani, the Saudi calls for de-escalation fit the same pattern. Having watched with alarm as Iran expanded its influence in the region over the past few years, thanks in large parts to Suleimani, the kingdom will now be hoping there\u2019s an opportunity for them: no matter how many of Suleimani\u2019s stratagems have been institutionalised, his successor will not be as efficient. Is there room to engage with Shia leaders in Iraq who would like to distance themselves from Iran? Is this the moment to squeeze a compromise out of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran\u2019s mostly successful proxy? The Iranian commander had become the young crown prince\u2019s nemesis, one who in all probability inspired some jealousy and admiration for having achieved what bin Salman felt the kingdom has never quite mastered: a regional strategy that inspires both fear and respect with a solid network of loyal proxies and allies. The bombast of the 2017 animation, which showcases Saudi Arabia\u2019s extensive and expensive military arsenal, reflects the fantasy that Prince Mohammed indulged in when he first rose to power between 2015 and 2017, trying his hand at an uncharacteristically muscular Saudi foreign policy as he launched wars and embargoes. The video starts with a sentence from an interview that Prince Mohammed gave to the Saudi state television, al-Ekhbariyya, in May 2017 during which he said: \u201cWe will not wait until the fight is in Saudi Arabia \u2013 we will bring the fight to Iran.\u201d By now, the crown prince has been sobered somewhat by the realisation that his swagger has delivered nothing on the regional front except a devastating war in Yemen and a useless embargo on Qatar. Even worse, it was Iran that brought the war to Saudi Arabia with the Aramco attack. Now that the US is showing its teeth with the killing of Suleimani and more sanctions on Iran, Saudi Arabia may feel reassured, but it cannot be certain whether there is a new, coherent Trump policy or this is a one-off that will leave them exposed again the next time Iran lashes out. As protests continue in Iran and the Trump administration ramps up pressure on Tehran, choking it economically, talk of regime change or collapse is in the air again. Saudis are also watching with trepidation. At the end of the video animation, Saudi forces are welcomed as saviours in Tehran as citizens wave the Saudi flag \u2013 a fantasy if ever there was one. In real life, not only would Saudi troops be unwelcome in Iran, but actually the kingdom needs the current Iranian regime to survive. \u2022 Kim Ghattas is a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of Black Wave",

      "body": "<p>In many people\u2019s minds, Michael Cashman \u2013 actor, activist, MEP, co-founder of Stonewall and member of the House of Lords \u2013 will always be associated with a kiss. In 1985, he had been approached by the creators of EastEnders, Julia Smith and Tony Holland, to play Colin Russell \u2013 the British soap\u2019s first gay character. Cashman was nervous at the thought of the press scrutiny that could follow, but agreed. Even before his character was announced, the Sun ran a story about the role under the headline \u201cEastbenders\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat made it worse,\u201d says Cashman, now 69 and sitting in his fourth-floor Limehouse apartment overlooking the Thames, \u201cwas the information was leaked from inside.\u201d The Sunday Mirror, meanwhile, claimed that he had had an HIV test in the US and was dying. The News of the World ran a double-page spread, headlined \u201cSecret Gay Love of Aids Scare EastEnder\u201d, which outed his partner and printed the couple\u2019s photos and address.</p> <p>There was even an attempt to orchestrate \u201csinister\u201d stories about him. One afternoon, two teenagers knocked on his front door asking for money; when he declined, they told him they had been given a tenner to do it by two men sitting in a car opposite Cashman\u2019s house.</p> <p>\u201cThey wanted a photograph of me giving money to kids,\u201d says Cashman. \u201cThen you don\u2019t have to write a nasty story. You say: \u2018Why is Colin giving money to young boys?\u2019 That was how we were portrayed then. We were predatory paedophiles. We weren\u2019t in consenting relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty-five years later, he has detailed all this in his memoir, <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/one-of-them-9781526612328/\" title=\"\">One of Them: From Albert Square to Parliament Square</a>. Through his varied, high-profile career and life-changing relationship with his husband, Paul Cottingham (an actor and campaigner who died of cancer in 2014), it tells not just the story of his life, but also the battle for LGBT equality in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7abed69bc7776f4bd148bad7eb8bdb79653feedb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7abed69bc7776f4bd148bad7eb8bdb79653feedb/56_70_3243_1514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"How the Sun covered the story of the EastEnders gay kiss in 1989\" width=\"1000\" height=\"467\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How the Sun covered the story of the EastEnders gay kiss in 1989</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When news broke that Cashman\u2019s character would share the first gay kiss in a British soap (a peck on the forehead), the backlash only intensified. Campaigners such as Mary Whitehouse railed against it; the BBC was besieged by angry letters and phone calls; on more than one occasion a brick was thrown through Cashman\u2019s window. But the kiss went ahead (Cashman says Smith threatened to resign if it was edited out) and the furore died down. By comparison, his next on-screen kiss \u2013 British soap\u2019s first gay kiss on the lips \u2013 passed unremarkably.</p> <p>Was it worth it? Cashman says he is still approached by grateful fans today. \u201cSomebody said to me: \u2018When you were on I used to watch it from behind the sofa because I didn\u2019t want my parents to know I was gay.\u2019 He was 10 years old.\u201d</p> <p>Cashman was born in 1950 in Mile End, east London. His mother was an office cleaner and his father was a docker, and he was one of four brothers. He loved performing and would sing and dance at home, in the local pub and in school shows, to the bafflement of his father. \u201cHe thought: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve got a son, who spends his time getting dressed up in makeup and tights,\u2019\u201d says Cashman, who knew he was \u201cdifferent\u201d from a very young age.</p> <p>Talentspotters saw him perform at school and encouraged him to audition for a role in the musical Oliver!. Aged 12, he got a part as one of Fagin\u2019s gang members and as understudy to Oliver. His father told him the West End was full of queers \u2013 which a closeted Cashman took solace in. \u201cHe certainly didn\u2019t know the comfort that it gave me, that I was going to a world that was full of them,\u201d says Cashman. \u201cMy ears pricked up.\u201d</p> <p>The comfort would be short-lived, however. In rehearsals, he was introduced to a director and manager in his late 20s who wanted Cashman for one of his shows. He convinced Cashman\u2019s parents to let the boy stay overnight with his wife and children the night before the show. But when Cashman met him, there was no wife or children. Instead there was a boarding house, in which the man requested a twin room for him and his \u201cson\u201d. At night, he climbed into Cashman\u2019s bed and sexually assaulted him. It was a pattern of behaviour that would continue for years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9c2ec33fd748caa1d55014a79fabbd109fb83615\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c2ec33fd748caa1d55014a79fabbd109fb83615/10_15_1545_2158/716.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cashman, aged 12, in a publicity shot from 1963\" width=\"716\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cashman, aged 12, in a publicity shot from 1963</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI wanted my mother to rescue me,\u201d Cashman says. \u201cBut when you are being abused, it\u2019s first of all [about] trying to find the words to describe how you feel, then the words that describe what\u2019s being done to you, then the confidence that people will believe you. After the second time, I just found a way of switching myself off, so that I remembered the days when he would take me off to Kew Gardens, the river or the cinema.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the first time Cashman had been abused. When he was eight years old, he was stopped on his way home one evening by a young docker. The man asked him if he wanted to earn a shilling, pinned him down and sexually assaulted him. When Cashman returned home, he told no one about the attack and kept this silence for years.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had to face these demons that I\u2019ve buried, that have played around with me,\u201d he says now. The alley where the docker sexually assaulted him 60 years ago is just streets away. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel I could be loved; I felt I couldn\u2019t belong, I would try and [self-] sabotage,\u201d he says. Writing his memoir has helped him deal with the trauma, he says. \u201cOnce you look back and you own all that happened to you, you\u2019re in control. If you\u2019re honest about what\u2019s happened to you, you grow. If you don\u2019t, then it will own you.\u201d</p> <p>He had similar experiences aged about 14 while filming I\u2019ve Gotta Horse. One night, an older friend took him away to the bedroom of the film\u2019s director, Kenneth Hume. Hume gave Cashman whisky, chatted to him on the bed and then sexually assaulted him. This happened multiple times throughout the film\u2019s production. Cashman dealt with it in the only way he had learned to: by doing what he could to forget it ever happened, by staying silent.</p> <p>\u201cThe abuse I suffered hurt me so much; at one point I thought: \u2018Have I got an invisible sign on my forehead that says: Abuse me, I won\u2019t tell?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou know that if you do [tell someone] you open something that is so terrifying, over which you have no control. So your best way to deal with it is to bury it.\u201d</p> <p>It was the same when he was raped by a man whose advances he rebuffed. In the 60s, going to the police wasn\u2019t really an option for gay men, he says. So he chose to forget about the ordeal and eventually convinced himself he had provoked his rapist.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the narrative that we lived with,\u201d he says. \u201cThat this is what happened to gay men. They got beaten up, they got raped, they asked for it, they deserved it. Growing up in the knowledge that having sex with someone made you a criminal has a psychological impact. When someone mistreats you, your immediate reaction is: \u2018Well, I must have asked for it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet Cashman would later discover that it didn\u2019t have to be this way. After putting on a play in Scarborough in 1982, he was invited to a soiree hosted by Barbara Windsor at the town\u2019s Grand Hotel. It was there he met Cottingham. The attraction was instant. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say in the book is that no matter what happens in life, you can become yourself. And I became that man through my relationship with Paul,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Spending time with Cashman, it is clear that he is still coming to terms with the loss of his husband. Writing his memoir \u2013 and recounting their stirring, tumultuous more-than-three-decades-long relationship \u2013 was part of that process. The first draft, he says, was more of a eulogy. The published version feels more like a waltz. The book is a wonderful portrayal of the complexities, challenges and numerous encounters (including one they shared with the son of a KGB officer during a trip to Kyiv) that comes with navigating an open relationship.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a central part of our relationship,\u201d says Cashman. \u201cOpen relationships that are based on honesty, truth and trust can only do you good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d99e1a2025c35baa1ca6e22c44dbdb06008d55b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d99e1a2025c35baa1ca6e22c44dbdb06008d55b/0_83_2056_1234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Paul Cottingham on a trip to Moscow in 1985\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Paul Cottingham on a trip to Moscow in 1985</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He brought the same honesty and passion to his campaigning. In May 1988, the Thatcher government had brought in the Local Government Act and its notorious section 28, which prohibited the intentional promotion of homosexuality by local authorities and schools. Cashman found himself at the forefront of the fight thanks to his TV profile. While he says the BBC never pressured him to moderate his views, he noticed the number of meaningful scenes he had in EastEnders dwindled, so he left to throw himself fully into the fight for LGBT equality.</p> <p>In 1989, he co-founded Stonewall to lobby the government on repealing section 28 and campaign on issues effecting the LGBT community \u2013 the most pressing being the HIV crisis. \u201cIt was an awful period when there was absolutely no hope, when people just disappeared,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t see them on the scene, it was a sign that they either had Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, which was visible, and didn\u2019t want to be out, or they had started to get that drawn, gaunt look.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I will never forgive the Thatcher government for doing,\u201d he continues. \u201cTo bring in section 28 against a group of people who should have been supported and nurtured and loved. To do that was viciousness beyond imagining.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the 80s and 90s, gay people were often portrayed as predators by media organisations supportive of section 28. Cashman sees similarities in the way the trans community is treated today. And he is concerned that some lesbian, gay and bisexual people are joining in.</p> <p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t stand up for the rights of others, how can my own rights ever be defended?\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that lesbian and gay people are willing to sacrifice trans people \u2026we\u2019re rolling back the clock.\u201d</p> <p>Cashman\u2019s commitment to fighting for LGBT equality has continued throughout his political career. In 1999, he became the country\u2019s first openly gay Labour MEP and went on to be president of the European Parliament\u2019s intergroup on gay and lesbian issues, while also helping convince Tony Blair\u2019s government to introduce same-sex civil partnerships. He was made a Labour peer in 2014 and has championed issues such as compulsory LGBT-inclusive sex and relationships education.</p> <p>Last year, he resigned from the Labour party after endorsing the pro-remain Liberal Democrats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c346899619bab9fdd58e809a11d6ea4edacaec1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c346899619bab9fdd58e809a11d6ea4edacaec1d/336_0_1427_856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At a gay rights march in 1988 with Ian McKellen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a gay rights march in 1988 with Ian McKellen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harold Holborn/Mirrorpix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cashman\u2019s passion for activism helped heal his turbulent relationship with his father too. Initially dismissive when Cashman came out to him, the more Cashman campaigned, the more supportive his father became. And his father\u2019s love of Cottingham also brought them closer.</p> <p>Then, in 1991, Cashman made a documentary about that kiss. The morning after it aired, his father rang to tell him that he had just left the pub where the extremely tightfisted landlord had felt so moved he gave him a free pint. After a brief silence, Cashman knew he had finally become his father\u2019s son.</p> <p>\u201cHe said: \u2018I just want you to know I\u2019m proud of you \u2026 and I want to tell you, I love you.\u2019 I nearly wept, and his voice was quavering. I said: \u2018Yeah, I love you, too.\u2019 And I don\u2019t think he had ever said that to any of us.\u201d</p> <p>Yet for all the success the EastEnders kiss brought him, the one he says that really defined him happened in the crowded station buffet of King\u2019s Cross station.</p> <p>\u201cThat was Paul\u2019s first weekend in London,\u201d says Cashman. He sighs, recalling the memory. \u201cWe were sat waiting for the two o\u2019clock train in that silence \u2013 two men not being able to show emotional connection. And he just leaned forward and kissed me. I was amazed. Then we walked down to the platform and he kissed me again on the lips and turned and off he went.

      "bodyText": "In many people\u2019s minds, Michael Cashman \u2013 actor, activist, MEP, co-founder of Stonewall and member of the House of Lords \u2013 will always be associated with a kiss. In 1985, he had been approached by the creators of EastEnders, Julia Smith and Tony Holland, to play Colin Russell \u2013 the British soap\u2019s first gay character. Cashman was nervous at the thought of the press scrutiny that could follow, but agreed. Even before his character was announced, the Sun ran a story about the role under the headline \u201cEastbenders\u201d. \u201cWhat made it worse,\u201d says Cashman, now 69 and sitting in his fourth-floor Limehouse apartment overlooking the Thames, \u201cwas the information was leaked from inside.\u201d The Sunday Mirror, meanwhile, claimed that he had had an HIV test in the US and was dying. The News of the World ran a double-page spread, headlined \u201cSecret Gay Love of Aids Scare EastEnder\u201d, which outed his partner and printed the couple\u2019s photos and address. There was even an attempt to orchestrate \u201csinister\u201d stories about him. One afternoon, two teenagers knocked on his front door asking for money; when he declined, they told him they had been given a tenner to do it by two men sitting in a car opposite Cashman\u2019s house. \u201cThey wanted a photograph of me giving money to kids,\u201d says Cashman. \u201cThen you don\u2019t have to write a nasty story. You say: \u2018Why is Colin giving money to young boys?\u2019 That was how we were portrayed then. We were predatory paedophiles. We weren\u2019t in consenting relationships.\u201d Thirty-five years later, he has detailed all this in his memoir, One of Them: From Albert Square to Parliament Square. Through his varied, high-profile career and life-changing relationship with his husband, Paul Cottingham (an actor and campaigner who died of cancer in 2014), it tells not just the story of his life, but also the battle for LGBT equality in the UK. When news broke that Cashman\u2019s character would share the first gay kiss in a British soap (a peck on the forehead), the backlash only intensified. Campaigners such as Mary Whitehouse railed against it; the BBC was besieged by angry letters and phone calls; on more than one occasion a brick was thrown through Cashman\u2019s window. But the kiss went ahead (Cashman says Smith threatened to resign if it was edited out) and the furore died down. By comparison, his next on-screen kiss \u2013 British soap\u2019s first gay kiss on the lips \u2013 passed unremarkably. Was it worth it? Cashman says he is still approached by grateful fans today. \u201cSomebody said to me: \u2018When you were on I used to watch it from behind the sofa because I didn\u2019t want my parents to know I was gay.\u2019 He was 10 years old.\u201d Cashman was born in 1950 in Mile End, east London. His mother was an office cleaner and his father was a docker, and he was one of four brothers. He loved performing and would sing and dance at home, in the local pub and in school shows, to the bafflement of his father. \u201cHe thought: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve got a son, who spends his time getting dressed up in makeup and tights,\u2019\u201d says Cashman, who knew he was \u201cdifferent\u201d from a very young age. Talentspotters saw him perform at school and encouraged him to audition for a role in the musical Oliver!. Aged 12, he got a part as one of Fagin\u2019s gang members and as understudy to Oliver. His father told him the West End was full of queers \u2013 which a closeted Cashman took solace in. \u201cHe certainly didn\u2019t know the comfort that it gave me, that I was going to a world that was full of them,\u201d says Cashman. \u201cMy ears pricked up.\u201d The comfort would be short-lived, however. In rehearsals, he was introduced to a director and manager in his late 20s who wanted Cashman for one of his shows. He convinced Cashman\u2019s parents to let the boy stay overnight with his wife and children the night before the show. But when Cashman met him, there was no wife or children. Instead there was a boarding house, in which the man requested a twin room for him and his \u201cson\u201d. At night, he climbed into Cashman\u2019s bed and sexually assaulted him. It was a pattern of behaviour that would continue for years. \u201cI wanted my mother to rescue me,\u201d Cashman says. \u201cBut when you are being abused, it\u2019s first of all [about] trying to find the words to describe how you feel, then the words that describe what\u2019s being done to you, then the confidence that people will believe you. After the second time, I just found a way of switching myself off, so that I remembered the days when he would take me off to Kew Gardens, the river or the cinema.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time Cashman had been abused. When he was eight years old, he was stopped on his way home one evening by a young docker. The man asked him if he wanted to earn a shilling, pinned him down and sexually assaulted him. When Cashman returned home, he told no one about the attack and kept this silence for years. \u201cI\u2019ve had to face these demons that I\u2019ve buried, that have played around with me,\u201d he says now. The alley where the docker sexually assaulted him 60 years ago is just streets away. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel I could be loved; I felt I couldn\u2019t belong, I would try and [self-] sabotage,\u201d he says. Writing his memoir has helped him deal with the trauma, he says. \u201cOnce you look back and you own all that happened to you, you\u2019re in control. If you\u2019re honest about what\u2019s happened to you, you grow. If you don\u2019t, then it will own you.\u201d He had similar experiences aged about 14 while filming I\u2019ve Gotta Horse. One night, an older friend took him away to the bedroom of the film\u2019s director, Kenneth Hume. Hume gave Cashman whisky, chatted to him on the bed and then sexually assaulted him. This happened multiple times throughout the film\u2019s production. Cashman dealt with it in the only way he had learned to: by doing what he could to forget it ever happened, by staying silent. \u201cThe abuse I suffered hurt me so much; at one point I thought: \u2018Have I got an invisible sign on my forehead that says: Abuse me, I won\u2019t tell?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou know that if you do [tell someone] you open something that is so terrifying, over which you have no control. So your best way to deal with it is to bury it.\u201d It was the same when he was raped by a man whose advances he rebuffed. In the 60s, going to the police wasn\u2019t really an option for gay men, he says. So he chose to forget about the ordeal and eventually convinced himself he had provoked his rapist. \u201cIt was the narrative that we lived with,\u201d he says. \u201cThat this is what happened to gay men. They got beaten up, they got raped, they asked for it, they deserved it. Growing up in the knowledge that having sex with someone made you a criminal has a psychological impact. When someone mistreats you, your immediate reaction is: \u2018Well, I must have asked for it.\u2019\u201d Yet Cashman would later discover that it didn\u2019t have to be this way. After putting on a play in Scarborough in 1982, he was invited to a soiree hosted by Barbara Windsor at the town\u2019s Grand Hotel. It was there he met Cottingham. The attraction was instant. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say in the book is that no matter what happens in life, you can become yourself. And I became that man through my relationship with Paul,\u201d he says. Spending time with Cashman, it is clear that he is still coming to terms with the loss of his husband. Writing his memoir \u2013 and recounting their stirring, tumultuous more-than-three-decades-long relationship \u2013 was part of that process. The first draft, he says, was more of a eulogy. The published version feels more like a waltz. The book is a wonderful portrayal of the complexities, challenges and numerous encounters (including one they shared with the son of a KGB officer during a trip to Kyiv) that comes with navigating an open relationship. \u201cIt was a central part of our relationship,\u201d says Cashman. \u201cOpen relationships that are based on honesty, truth and trust can only do you good.\u201d He brought the same honesty and passion to his campaigning. In May 1988, the Thatcher government had brought in the Local Government Act and its notorious section 28, which prohibited the intentional promotion of homosexuality by local authorities and schools. Cashman found himself at the forefront of the fight thanks to his TV profile. While he says the BBC never pressured him to moderate his views, he noticed the number of meaningful scenes he had in EastEnders dwindled, so he left to throw himself fully into the fight for LGBT equality. In 1989, he co-founded Stonewall to lobby the government on repealing section 28 and campaign on issues effecting the LGBT community \u2013 the most pressing being the HIV crisis. \u201cIt was an awful period when there was absolutely no hope, when people just disappeared,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t see them on the scene, it was a sign that they either had Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, which was visible, and didn\u2019t want to be out, or they had started to get that drawn, gaunt look. \u201cIt\u2019s what I will never forgive the Thatcher government for doing,\u201d he continues. \u201cTo bring in section 28 against a group of people who should have been supported and nurtured and loved. To do that was viciousness beyond imagining.\u201d Throughout the 80s and 90s, gay people were often portrayed as predators by media organisations supportive of section 28. Cashman sees similarities in the way the trans community is treated today. And he is concerned that some lesbian, gay and bisexual people are joining in. \u201cIf I don\u2019t stand up for the rights of others, how can my own rights ever be defended?\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that lesbian and gay people are willing to sacrifice trans people \u2026we\u2019re rolling back the clock.\u201d Cashman\u2019s commitment to fighting for LGBT equality has continued throughout his political career. In 1999, he became the country\u2019s first openly gay Labour MEP and went on to be president of the European Parliament\u2019s intergroup on gay and lesbian issues, while also helping convince Tony Blair\u2019s government to introduce same-sex civil partnerships. He was made a Labour peer in 2014 and has championed issues such as compulsory LGBT-inclusive sex and relationships education. Last year, he resigned from the Labour party after endorsing the pro-remain Liberal Democrats. Cashman\u2019s passion for activism helped heal his turbulent relationship with his father too. Initially dismissive when Cashman came out to him, the more Cashman campaigned, the more supportive his father became. And his father\u2019s love of Cottingham also brought them closer. Then, in 1991, Cashman made a documentary about that kiss. The morning after it aired, his father rang to tell him that he had just left the pub where the extremely tightfisted landlord had felt so moved he gave him a free pint. After a brief silence, Cashman knew he had finally become his father\u2019s son. \u201cHe said: \u2018I just want you to know I\u2019m proud of you \u2026 and I want to tell you, I love you.\u2019 I nearly wept, and his voice was quavering. I said: \u2018Yeah, I love you, too.\u2019 And I don\u2019t think he had ever said that to any of us.\u201d Yet for all the success the EastEnders kiss brought him, the one he says that really defined him happened in the crowded station buffet of King\u2019s Cross station. \u201cThat was Paul\u2019s first weekend in London,\u201d says Cashman. He sighs, recalling the memory. \u201cWe were sat waiting for the two o\u2019clock train in that silence \u2013 two men not being able to show emotional connection. And he just leaned forward and kissed me. I was amazed. Then we walked down to the platform and he kissed me again on the lips and turned and off he went. And I just wished he\u2019d come back.\u201d One of Them, by Michael Cashman, is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a318.99 rrp).

Alex Murphy may have witnessed the longest throw ever for a magazine series he worked on in the 1990s</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Shoot! covered the subject as well, but the magazine I worked on as features editor \u2013 Total Football \u2013 had a long-running obsession with long throw-ins,\u201d writes Alex. \u201cOne day we trotted down to St Andrew\u2019s with a photographer and a 50m tape measure and invited Birmingham City and Wales midfielder, Andy Legg, to attempt a new world record. Despite suffering from an ankle knock, and amid complaints about the wet surface, Legg hurled a football the entire width of the pitch.</p> <p>\u201cThe feat was officially witnessed by myself and Blues midfield ace Paul Tait (he of the infamous \u2018Shit on the Villa T-shirt\u2019) and our signed affidavits were accepted by a surprisingly lax and unquestioning Guinness Book of Records. Legg\u2019s feat was duly recorded in the following year\u2019s volume. I recall with shame that our headline on the feature was: \u2018What a tosser!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cA few months later we invited legendary Tranmere Rovers thrower-inner, Dave Challinor to take on Legg\u2019s mark. He did it with ease, and took his place in the next edition of the book. Alas, the carefully chosen headline on this feature announced: \u2018What an even bigger tosser!\u2019 We were young and foolish.\u201d</p> <p>Since then Challinor has lost his world record, which is currently held by American flip-thrower Michael Lewis, who <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-throw-in-(football)/\">hurled a ball 59.17 metres in Frisco, Texas in April 2019</a> (that\u2019s well over the halfway line).

In fact, it was a feat even more extraordinary than Haaland\u2019s. \u201cThere is Reza Ghoochannejhad from Iran,\u201d writes Stephan Wijnen. \u201cLast summer, he was bought by Dutch Eredivisie side PEC Zwolle. Ghoochannejhad made his debut for that club on 15 September 2019, coming on as a substitute in the 56th minute against RKC Waalwijk. RKC were leading 2-1 at that moment. In 32 minutes, he managed to score four goals (60th, 81st, 83rd and 88th minutes).

As Jonathan Wilson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/17/europeanfootball.sport1\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/17/europeanfootball.sport1\">tells it</a>: \u2018He had them top of the table 19 games into his second season when a string of disputes with the board led, once again, to his dismissal. \u201cI have been sacked,\u201d he told a stunned press conference, \u201ceven though I am neither a criminal nor a homosexual. Goodbye.\u201d From then on he insisted on a clause in his contracts that he could not be sacked if his team were top of the table.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Unique trophy lifts (Brian Kilcline edition)</h2> <p><strong>Following on from a question about Jordan Henderson\u2019s signature trophy lift</strong>, Matthew Rudd has been in touch with another player who displayed a distinctive technique when hoisting a shiny pot in the air for thousands of fans to see. \u201cThis is very niche, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the great Brian Kilcline is the only FA Cup-winning skipper who lifted the trophy to the Wembley crowd while holding it round the waist, rather than the handles,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>\u201cA few seconds later, when he got to the end of the Royal Box and the photographers demanded their traditional pose, you can hear one snapper shout \u2018Handles!\u2019 at the Coventry City captain, who duly obliged, but then when he reaches the bottom of the stairs and the Wembley pitch, he is holding it by the waist again. I had the good fortune to interview him many years later when he was playing for Halifax Town, and I asked him about it. He had forgotten doing it, and needed to think, but then remembered how much holding the handles hurt him, as he had suffered a thigh injury during the game while fouling Spurs\u2019 Gary Mabbutt which had required his substitution and the angle his arms were at when he held the Cup round the waist didn\u2019t make him wince, but when he held the handles, it did.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2933e1ae01b69e835dd813edae741d3d6941335\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2933e1ae01b69e835dd813edae741d3d6941335/0_0_3417_2269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Handles!\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Handles!\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Knowledge archive</h2> <p><strong>\u201cPort Vale striker Leon Constantine appears to share his name with the titles of two films.

However, as Andrew Wright points out, when it comes to general films, he isn\u2019t quite on his own. \u201cI may be stretching things a bit here,\u201d he begins ominously. \u201cBut how about ... Rocky Baptiste [formerly of Farnborough, Luton, Stevenage, Margate and Gravesend &amp; Northfleet]?

      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s Knowledge touched on the subject of football magazines recording hard shots, long throws and other niche feats. Alex Murphy may have witnessed the longest throw ever for a magazine series he worked on in the 1990s. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Shoot! covered the subject as well, but the magazine I worked on as features editor \u2013 Total Football \u2013 had a long-running obsession with long throw-ins,\u201d writes Alex. \u201cOne day we trotted down to St Andrew\u2019s with a photographer and a 50m tape measure and invited Birmingham City and Wales midfielder, Andy Legg, to attempt a new world record. Despite suffering from an ankle knock, and amid complaints about the wet surface, Legg hurled a football the entire width of the pitch. \u201cThe feat was officially witnessed by myself and Blues midfield ace Paul Tait (he of the infamous \u2018Shit on the Villa T-shirt\u2019) and our signed affidavits were accepted by a surprisingly lax and unquestioning Guinness Book of Records. Legg\u2019s feat was duly recorded in the following year\u2019s volume. I recall with shame that our headline on the feature was: \u2018What a tosser!\u2019 \u201cA few months later we invited legendary Tranmere Rovers thrower-inner, Dave Challinor to take on Legg\u2019s mark. He did it with ease, and took his place in the next edition of the book. Alas, the carefully chosen headline on this feature announced: \u2018What an even bigger tosser!\u2019 We were young and foolish.\u201d Since then Challinor has lost his world record, which is currently held by American flip-thrower Michael Lewis, who hurled a ball 59.17 metres in Frisco, Texas in April 2019 (that\u2019s well over the halfway line). Here he is showing off his skills in 2015: Hat-trick scoring debutant substitutes \u201cAfter Erling Braut Haaland, has anyone else scored a hat-trick after coming on for their debut as a sub?\u201d asks Wayne Duncan. They certainly have, Wayne. In fact, it was a feat even more extraordinary than Haaland\u2019s. \u201cThere is Reza Ghoochannejhad from Iran,\u201d writes Stephan Wijnen. \u201cLast summer, he was bought by Dutch Eredivisie side PEC Zwolle. Ghoochannejhad made his debut for that club on 15 September 2019, coming on as a substitute in the 56th minute against RKC Waalwijk. RKC were leading 2-1 at that moment. In 32 minutes, he managed to score four goals (60th, 81st, 83rd and 88th minutes). PEC won the match by 6-2.\u201d Beat that Erling! Sacked while top of the league (2) Noble Francis has been in touch with another manager for our collection of table-toppers handed their P45s \u2026 \u201cIn addition to the answers already provided, you can surely add the great Bela Guttmann, who took over Milan in 1953. As Jonathan Wilson tells it: \u2018He had them top of the table 19 games into his second season when a string of disputes with the board led, once again, to his dismissal. \u201cI have been sacked,\u201d he told a stunned press conference, \u201ceven though I am neither a criminal nor a homosexual. Goodbye.\u201d From then on he insisted on a clause in his contracts that he could not be sacked if his team were top of the table.\u2019\u201d Unique trophy lifts (Brian Kilcline edition) Following on from a question about Jordan Henderson\u2019s signature trophy lift, Matthew Rudd has been in touch with another player who displayed a distinctive technique when hoisting a shiny pot in the air for thousands of fans to see. \u201cThis is very niche, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the great Brian Kilcline is the only FA Cup-winning skipper who lifted the trophy to the Wembley crowd while holding it round the waist, rather than the handles,\u201d he writes. \u201cA few seconds later, when he got to the end of the Royal Box and the photographers demanded their traditional pose, you can hear one snapper shout \u2018Handles!\u2019 at the Coventry City captain, who duly obliged, but then when he reaches the bottom of the stairs and the Wembley pitch, he is holding it by the waist again. I had the good fortune to interview him many years later when he was playing for Halifax Town, and I asked him about it. He had forgotten doing it, and needed to think, but then remembered how much holding the handles hurt him, as he had suffered a thigh injury during the game while fouling Spurs\u2019 Gary Mabbutt which had required his substitution and the angle his arms were at when he held the Cup round the waist didn\u2019t make him wince, but when he held the handles, it did.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cPort Vale striker Leon Constantine appears to share his name with the titles of two films. Is he unique in this respect?\u201d pondered Nigel Stubbs in February 2006. Well, Nigel, regarding mainstream movies, he is. However, as Andrew Wright points out, when it comes to general films, he isn\u2019t quite on his own. \u201cI may be stretching things a bit here,\u201d he begins ominously. \u201cBut how about ... Rocky Baptiste [formerly of Farnborough, Luton, Stevenage, Margate and Gravesend &amp; Northfleet]? Obviously, one name comes from the legendary boxing flick, but the other is the name of a little-known 2003 French short film, sketchy details of which can be found here.\u201d And while Paul Jenkins suspiciously claims that both Tommy Jaws and Alfie Schindler\u2019s-List played up front for Motherwell in the 1950s, he does also suggest much-travelled goalkeeper Eric Nixon. \u201cHe counts as there is a 1975 film about terminal illness called Eric,\u201d he explains, although our research suggests it may have just been a television drama. However, special mention must go to Graham Clark, who comes ever so close by putting forward former Queen\u2019s Park defender David Alexander. \u201cAt least I\u2019m presuming he\u2019s known as Dave,\u201d he says. Can you help? \u201cOnce, on a disastrous tour to France with my school team, I played so terribly at right back that I was substituted, in spite of the fact that our only sub was the reserve goalkeeper,\u201d recalls Benjie Goodhart. \u201cHas any outfield player ever played so badly they\u2019ve been similarly embarrassed?\u201d \u201cAll four of Sheffield Wednesday striker Atdhe Nuhiu\u2019s goals this season have come in injury time,\u201d writes Gareth Taylor. \u201cHas there been a player with a longer run of consecutive goals in injury time?\u201d \u201cLincoln City are currently fielding Max Melbourne and Conor Coventry \u2013 their city namesakes being 17,000km apart. Can any other side beat this?\u201d asks Andrew Newton. \u201cWhen. I was growing up in the seventies, I never remember goalkeepers going up for corners and the like in the last minute as a desperate move to get a goal. Nowadays it is pretty normal in a cup match and other similar scenarios. Who was the first to do this? my first memory is Peter Schmeichel? Any others,\u201d asks Peter Briffa.

Even once?</p> <p>Kaepernick is relevant this year, and not just for his activities off the field. He was the 49ers quarterback the last time the team reached the Super Bowl, in 2013, and played a huge part in their success that season \u2013 it stands to reason he would be discussed when we look back at the team\u2019s last title shot. But you\u2019d be smart to emphatically place your money place on Kaepernick not getting a single mention on Sunday. After all, his name wasn\u2019t uttered when 49ers running Raheem Mostert broke Kaepernick\u2019s postseason rushing record during the NFC Championship game earlier this month, a game televised by Fox.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/05/colin-kaepernick-kareem-abdul-jabbar\">Colin Kaepernick is the black Grinch for those who dream of a white America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Super Bowl is supposed to be a national party, a raucous, lighthearted event consumed with family and plenty of food. It\u2019s the league\u2019s biggest opportunity to hide its many stains. Yet despite the NFL\u2019s best effort to erase Kaepernick from the history books on Super Bowl Sunday (and every other day) his treatment both permeates the league and transcends it.</p> <p>It\u2019s been more than three years since Kaepernick last played in the NFL. In August 2016, he was caught on camera sitting during the national anthem, his first rendition of a peaceful protest. After <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/heres-how-nate-boyer-got-colin-kaepernick-to-go-from-sitting-to-kneeling/\">a conversation rooted in mutual respect</a> with former Green Beret turned NFL hopeful, Nate Boyer, Kaepernick quickly reverted to kneeling.</p> <p>Kaepernick\u2019s bold decision to use his platform to give a voice to the voiceless came on the heels of a slew of African Americans, such as Tamir Rice and Michael Brown, being fatally shot by police officers. He had also engaged in a deeper understanding of his own background.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem\">he explained to reporters at the time</a>. \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d</p> <p>To Kaepernick, the national anthem and American flag did not just symbolize military greatness, they also represented a deeply unequal country dripping with racism. To the NFL, the national anthem and American flag mainly represent the armed forces. The star-spangled optics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/nov/05/report-highlights-the-obscene-price-of-nfls-paid-patriotism\">have always been present in NFL stadiums</a> but spiked when the league <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/politics/2015/05/which_nfl_teams_are_getting_your_federal_tax_dolla.html\">collected more than $6m</a> in taxpayer money from the Department of Defense between 2011 and 2014.

      "bodyText": "Nestled among this year\u2019s silly Super Bowl prop bets \u2013 such as whether or not Jennifer Lopez will show butt cleavage during the halftime show \u2013 is a far more interesting one: will the Fox broadcast mention Colin Kaepernick\u2019s name? Even once? Kaepernick is relevant this year, and not just for his activities off the field. He was the 49ers quarterback the last time the team reached the Super Bowl, in 2013, and played a huge part in their success that season \u2013 it stands to reason he would be discussed when we look back at the team\u2019s last title shot. But you\u2019d be smart to emphatically place your money place on Kaepernick not getting a single mention on Sunday. After all, his name wasn\u2019t uttered when 49ers running Raheem Mostert broke Kaepernick\u2019s postseason rushing record during the NFC Championship game earlier this month, a game televised by Fox. The Super Bowl is supposed to be a national party, a raucous, lighthearted event consumed with family and plenty of food. It\u2019s the league\u2019s biggest opportunity to hide its many stains. Yet despite the NFL\u2019s best effort to erase Kaepernick from the history books on Super Bowl Sunday (and every other day) his treatment both permeates the league and transcends it. It\u2019s been more than three years since Kaepernick last played in the NFL. In August 2016, he was caught on camera sitting during the national anthem, his first rendition of a peaceful protest. After a conversation rooted in mutual respect with former Green Beret turned NFL hopeful, Nate Boyer, Kaepernick quickly reverted to kneeling. Kaepernick\u2019s bold decision to use his platform to give a voice to the voiceless came on the heels of a slew of African Americans, such as Tamir Rice and Michael Brown, being fatally shot by police officers. He had also engaged in a deeper understanding of his own background. \u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d he explained to reporters at the time. \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d To Kaepernick, the national anthem and American flag did not just symbolize military greatness, they also represented a deeply unequal country dripping with racism. To the NFL, the national anthem and American flag mainly represent the armed forces. The star-spangled optics have always been present in NFL stadiums but spiked when the league collected more than $6m in taxpayer money from the Department of Defense between 2011 and 2014. The league\u2019s forced patriotism paired well with Donald Trump, who soon entered the fray and attacked Kaepernick with bombastic shots, such as the suggestion that he leave the country. Trump continued to brand Kaepernick and his supporters as un-American and turned protesting NFL players into a hot-button topic. Kaepernick\u2019s protests were driven by a greater sense of purpose. And he knew the career risk. Though only 28, and just a few years removed from playing in the Super Bowl, he opted out of his 49ers contract, hopeful that he would become a prized free-agent. But NFL owners, many of them friendly with Trump, appeared to shut Kaepernick out of the league. At first, Kaepernick\u2019s unemployment seemed strange, considering the need for talented quarterbacks, but as time passed the reality set in. It\u2019s almost as if his opponents thought by banishing Kaepernick, we would somehow forget him. Boy, did they underestimate the fervidity and sheer size of Kaepernick\u2019s supporters. In mid-2018, the NFL chose a new course of action when it entered the social justice space by funding the Players Coalition, a group of activist minded player that once included Kaepernick and his best friend, Panthers safety Eric Reid. The Players Coalition coordinates NFL athletes\u2019 social justice efforts and works on policy issues such as bail reform. How much of the NFL\u2019s funding was to quiet Kaepernick supporters rather than engage in genuine altruism is debatable. But as the I\u2019m With Kap faction grew even stronger, for some the notion of doing any form of business with the NFL while Kaepernick remained unemployed was met with disdain. Kaepernick\u2019s banishment is the reason artists like Cardi B and Rihanna have turned down the Super Bowl halftime show. It\u2019s the reason the NFL\u2019s partnership with Jay-Z, designed to amplify its social justice efforts, was instantly panned. The latest effort to quiet the Kaepernick crowd came in November when the NFL made an unprecedented move to host a workout for Kaepernick. He was finally going to get his big chance \u2026 or not. The workout was fraught with problems \u2013 Kaepernick had virtually no notice, it was to be held on a Saturday, when NFL teams prepare for Sunday games, and no one other than the NFL could film the session. Kaepernick switched locations at the last minute and livestreamed a workout starring a man who looked NFL-ready.

It is intended as a simplified version of the report published today by the NCSC. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/28/labour-says-government-claim-to-be-reversing-beeching-rail-cuts-meaningless-live-news?page=with:block-5e3028ce8f086a28115a0de3#block-5e3028ce8f086a28115a0de3\">12.32pm.)</a></p> <p>In the blog Levy specifically covers the claim that there is no distinction between core and non-core in 5G. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Claim 2. There\u2019s no distinction between core and edge in 5G</p> <p>This is covered in <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/blog-post-security-complexity-and-huawei-protecting-uks-telecoms-networks\">the previous blog</a>, so I\u2019m not going to delve into huge detail here, but it remains untrue. In previous networks, sensitive functions were grouped together in a couple of locations we called \u2018core\u2019. In 5G they are spread out a bit more, but sensitive functions are still sensitive functions and you can put your arms round them \u2013 for example, we list them in the guidance published today. Remember, in 5G you need lots of smaller basestations as well as big ones, and the small ones will be on lampposts, bus shelters and other places that aren\u2019t secure from physical interference by bad guys.</p> <p>So, if your network design means that you need to run really sensitive functions processing really sensitive data (i.e. core functions) on an edge access device on top of a bus stop, your choice of vendor is the least of your worries and you probably shouldn\u2019t be designing critical national infrastructure. The international standards that define what a 5G network actually is allow you to do all sorts of things, and some of those things could lead to security or operational risks that can\u2019t be mitigated. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to do them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T15:03:18.788Z\">at 3.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3044de8f086a28115a0f22\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T14:29:01.146Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from <strong>Sean Spicer</strong>, who was press secretary to President Trump during Trump\u2019s first six months in office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/1222163323535482880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not sure how something like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Huawei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Huawei</a> can have a \u201climited\u201d role in building the next version of the UK\u2019s telecom infrastructure:  U.K. Allows Huawei to Build <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/5G?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#5G</a> Networks, in Break with U.S.<br>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@business</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2q30Hc1pog\">https://t.co/2q30Hc1pog</a></p>&mdash; Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/1222163323535482880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e303d0c8f0811db2faecc32\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T13:58:23.519Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour criticises government for failing to develop 'home-grown alternatives to Huawei'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tracy Brabin</strong>, the shadow culture secretary, has issued this statement on the Huawei decision on behalf of the Labour party.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Tories refused to take our technological sovereignty seriously and failed to invest in home-grown alternatives to Huawei.

This will seek to attract established vendors who are not present in the UK, supporting the emergence of new, disruptive entrants to the supply chain, and promoting the adoption of open, interoperable standards that will reduce barriers to entry.</p> <p>The recommended cap of 35% will be kept under review to determine whether it should be further reduced as the market diversifies.</p> <p>Today\u2019s decision marks a major change in the UK\u2019s approach that will substantially improve the security and resilience of our critical telecoms networks. It will see the government roll out the most stringent set of controls ever \u2013 including new standards with tough underpinning legislation to raise the security and quality of the entire 5G and gigabit-capable networks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T12:23:46.236Z\">at 12.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3023568f08e1332473857e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T12:05:27.189Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson gives green light for Huawei 5G infrastructure role</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong>\u2019s story about the Huawei announcement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/28/boris-johnson-gives-green-light-for-huawei-5g-infrastructure-role\">Boris Johnson gives green light for Huawei 5G infrastructure role</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is how it starts.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Chinese state-owned tech firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/huawei\">Huawei</a> has been designated a \u201chigh-risk vendor\u201d but will be given the opportunity to build non-core elements of Britain\u2019s 5G network, the government has announced.</p> <p>The company will be banned from the \u201ccore\u201d, of the 5G network, and from operating at sensitive sites such as nuclear and military facilities, and its share of the market will be capped at 35%.</p> <p>\u201cWe are clear-eyed about the challenge posed by Huawei, which we today confirm is a high-risk vendor,\u201d said a Whitehall source.</p> <p>But the source insisted a \u201cmarket failure\u201d meant there was little alternative in the short term.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3022d98f0811db2faecac3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T12:03:13.719Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The government Huawei announcement is out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1222127645397344256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING:<br><br>Boris Johnson has given green light to allow Huawei to build non-core parts of 5G network<br><br>* Huawei designated high-risk vendor<br><br>* It faces a market share cap of 35%<br><br>* UK will work with US to encourage alternative providers<br><br>Brace for backlash form US...</p>&mdash; Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1222127645397344256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>More details soon ...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3020728f08e1332473854d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T11:56:43.228Z\">11.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This morning <strong>Christopher Pincher</strong>, a Foreign Office minister, has been attending an EU general affairs council meeting in Brussels.

The Huawei case is actually worse than that, because whereas British or American companies have independent lives of their own, a country like China does not.

      "bodyText": "The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has defended the government\u2019s decision to allow the Chinese tech firm Huawei to build non-core elements of the UK\u2019s 5G network, despite designating it a \u201chigh-risk vendor\u201d. He was speaking in the House of Commons, where many senior Conservatives expressed reservations about the announcement - although with less vehemence than yesterday, when some MPs may have thought they had a still had a chance of getting the government to change its mind. Leading Republicans in Washington have criticised the government\u2019s decision. Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, said it amounted to a \u201cmajor defeat\u201d for the US. (See 12.38pm.) Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, described the decision as like allowing the KGB to build the UK\u2019s telephone network during the cold war. (See 3.29pm.) Administration officials said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the move. (See 1.52pm.) But President Trump has not yet commented on it personally. He has been tweeting today, but not on this. The independent migration advisory committee has rejected a full shift to an Australian points-based system, publishing detailed research which gives a picture of how a reformed immigration system might look after Brexit and the ending of freedom of movement for EU nationals. Negotiations on the UK\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with the EU will start on 3 March, more than a month after the UK\u2019s departure from the bloc, the Guardian can reveal. Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the Labour leadership contest, has said that if the SNP wins next year\u2019s Holyrood elections, they will have a mandate to hold a second independence referendum. He was speaking on a visit to the Scottish parliament where he also said: What I want to do is to make the case going into that election that actually neither the status quo nor independence is the right way forward. And what we need is - whether you call it federalism or much more meaningful devolution - a different constitutional settlement. That\u2019s the argument I want to make. I\u2019m here to discuss that with colleagues. Boris Johnson\u2019s government spent \u00a346m on a \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d campaign in October, but demonstrated little evidence it left the public better prepared, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has found. The Scottish government failed to properly monitor and evaluate billions of pounds\u2019 worth of privately financed contracts to build roads, schools and hospitals, two public spending watchdogs have said. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Mark Warner, the US senator and the ranking Democrat on the senate intelligence committee, has put out this statement about the UK\u2019s Huawei/5G decision. While I am disappointed by the UK\u2019s decision to continue allowing insecure vendors like Huawei into their network, the United States remains committed to working with the UK and other key allies to build more diverse and secure telecommunication options that provide competitive alternatives to Huawei. Working together must be our priority in the coming months. From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From my colleague Heather Stewart Jonathan Djanogly, a Conservative, says if there is a security breach, Huawei should have to pay the cost of having its own equipment replaced. Raab says that in those circumstances a criminal offence would have been committed, not just a breach of contract. Richard Drax, a Conservative, says he is \u201cbaffled\u201d by this decision. He says he does not think there is a distinction between core and periphery in 5G. Raab says he does not agree. He says there is a difference. (That is what the National Cyber Security Centre says too. See 2.58pm.) Raab says there was a risk that banning Huawei could trigger trade retaliation. But that is not why this decision was taken, he says. Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative, says he does not necessarily welcome the decision, but he understands it. He says the government should set up a review to see what lessons can be learnt. Raab says this has been a failure of government, and of Western governments. He says the government has set out plans to ensure that it does not find itself in this position again. President Trump has sent out his first tweets of the day. But he is not saying anything about Huawei (so far). Instead he is complaining about Fox News being biased against him ... Crispin Blunt, another Tory former chair of the foreign affairs committee, says the intelligence and security committee should consider this issue. And he says the government should tell the Chinese they expect reciprocity. Raab says that is an important point about the relationship with China. Tom Tugendhat, the Tory MP who chaired the foreign affairs committee in the last parliament, asks if the 35% cap covers the new market, or the existing market. Raab says the government papers explain how the 35% cap works. It is roughly equivalent to existing market share, he says. Labour\u2019s Barry Sheerman says there are businesses who think their intellectual property is being stolen by the Chinese every time they put it on the internet. Bob Seely, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that MPs will be able to debate on what constitutes a high-risk vendor. And he says non trusted vendors should be built out of the system. Raab says there is already a definition of a high-risk vendor. Liam Fox, the former Tory international trade secretary, asks if the concern in Washington is about the UK\u2019s ability to mitigate the risks of Huawei, or about the UK sending a message to other countries about Huawei being acceptable. Raab says the UK and the US start from a different place. He says the government asked Washington if it could propose an alternative. He says the Americans did not have an answer on that point. This is from Jon Sopel, the BBC\u2019s North America editor, on the Tom Cotton quote. See 3.29pm. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden asks if at any point the US has linked this decision to the chances of the UK getting a trade deal. Raab says the Americans have not done this to his knowledge. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, says he is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by this decision. He says defending in cyber networks is always a matter of catch-up. He says Huawei will always be in the periphery. Does Raab accept that China is a threat? And will the government try to drive Huawei out of the network for good? Raab says it is important to assess the nature of the risk. The government is doing that. He says an outright ban would be a \u201cvery blunt tool\u201d to deal with a very specific problem. Penny Mordaunt, the Conservative former defence secretary, says this decision is \u201cregrettable\u201d. David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary, says Huawei should have been banned from the 5G network. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Ben Riley-Smith. He is quoting Tom Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas. Julian Lewis, a Tory former chair of the defence committee, says Huawei is not independent of the Chinese state. Raab says the relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state has been central to the analysis of the threat it poses. Dominic Raab is responding to John Nicolson. He says an outright ban, of the kind proposed by the SNP, would not remove the firm from the British telecoms network, it would not encourage diversification of supply, and it would increase costs for business. The SNP\u2019s John Nicolson says the government has opted for the \u201ccheapest, least secure option\u201d. He says using Huawei is not safe. Under Chinese law, firms have to cooperate with the state, she says. He says, with 5G, the peripheral network communicates with the core. He says malware can be hard to detect. He says countries like Australia have chosen to block Huawei. That may turn out to be the right choice, he says. He says the UK government has taken the wrong choice. Theresa May, the former PM, says she commends the government for this decision. When she was PM, she was reportedly planning to come to the same decision on Huawei and 5G. She says it is essential that five eyes partners work with the UK to ensure that there is more market diversification, so that in future governments are less reliant on Huawei. Raab commends May for the work on this issue that took place when she was PM. Raab is responding to Thomas-Symonds. He says intelligence sharing will not be put at risk, and never will be. High risk vendors have never been involved in intelligence networks, and never will be, he says. And Andrew Parker, head of MI5, has said that he does not think intelligence sharing with the US will be at risk from this decision. Thomas-Symonds says a rush by the government to throw itself into the arms of President Trump to get a trade deal must not govern everything it does. He says the UK has had to choose between just three 5G vendors. What can be done to ensure more are available, he asks. He says 5G will be transformational. It will shape the economy of the future, he says. But the government first said the UK would be a global leader in this in 2017, he says. He asks Raab to explain how there won\u2019t be a risk to communication channels used for intelligence. He asks for an explanation of the difference between core and periphery in 5G. (See 2.58pm for an answer.) And he asks when the new regulations will be brought to the Commons. Nick Thomas-Symonds, a shadow Home Office minister, is responding for Labour. He says there has been too much \u201cdither and delay\u201d. This decision should have been made earlier, he says. Raab says there will be nothing in the plans that will stop the government sharing highly-classified intelligence, either within the UK or with five eyes intelligence partners (ie, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand). Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is making a Commons statement about the Huawei/5G decision. He says the government will do nothing to undermine UK security, or the security of its allies. He says the UK has conducted the best analysis of what needs to be done to keep 5G secure. And he says it has a better understanding of the threat posed by Huawei than any other country, he says, because it has been monitoring Huawei already for years. Summarising the review published by the National Cyber Security Centre (see 12.32pm and 2.58pm), he says the planning to introduce what will be among the stronger regulations for 5G in the world. He says the government will legislate to limit the role of Huawei in 5G. And it will take steps to ensure that there is more diversity in the market, so that the government in future is not so dependent on Huawei. He sums up some of the factors that will be taken into account when deciding if a 5G suppliers is high risk. Here is a question from BTL (below the line). I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have the technical knowledge to answer that, but Ian Levy, technical director at the National Cyber Security Centre, does understand this stuff and he was written a blog today explaining the risk that \u201chigh-risk vendors\u201d like Huawei pose to the 5G network, and what can be done to mitigate the risk. It is intended as a simplified version of the report published today by the NCSC. (See 12.32pm.) In the blog Levy specifically covers the claim that there is no distinction between core and non-core in 5G. He says: Claim 2. There\u2019s no distinction between core and edge in 5G This is covered in the previous blog, so I\u2019m not going to delve into huge detail here, but it remains untrue. In previous networks, sensitive functions were grouped together in a couple of locations we called \u2018core\u2019. In 5G they are spread out a bit more, but sensitive functions are still sensitive functions and you can put your arms round them \u2013 for example, we list them in the guidance published today. Remember, in 5G you need lots of smaller basestations as well as big ones, and the small ones will be on lampposts, bus shelters and other places that aren\u2019t secure from physical interference by bad guys. So, if your network design means that you need to run really sensitive functions processing really sensitive data (i.e. core functions) on an edge access device on top of a bus stop, your choice of vendor is the least of your worries and you probably shouldn\u2019t be designing critical national infrastructure. The international standards that define what a 5G network actually is allow you to do all sorts of things, and some of those things could lead to security or operational risks that can\u2019t be mitigated. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to do them. This is from Sean Spicer, who was press secretary to President Trump during Trump\u2019s first six months in office. Tracy Brabin, the shadow culture secretary, has issued this statement on the Huawei decision on behalf of the Labour party. The Tories refused to take our technological sovereignty seriously and failed to invest in home-grown alternatives to Huawei. As a result they\u2019re in the ludicrous position of having to choose between the UK\u2019s security concerns and our infrastructure needs. Despite years of dithering, the government still can\u2019t tell us how it will restrict Huawei\u2019s access to sensitive parts of the network. It must now give specific reassurances to workers and businesses that a 35% market cap will not stop 5G becoming widely available by 2027, as planned \u2013 and that it will support communities whose access to 5G will be delayed by this decision. The statement does not say what a Labour government would have done faced with the same dilemma. Instead it makes a version of the time-honoured opposition argument: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have started from here.\u201d From CNN\u2019s national security correspondent Kylie Atwood Here is some more US reaction to the Huawei decision. This is from Elise Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman from New York. Industry leaders have said the salary threshold recommended in the report from the migration advisory committee - \u00a325,600, not \u00a330,000 as previously proposed - is still too high. The Food and Drink Federation, whose members rely heavily on EU citizens to staff food production sites including meat processing factories, unattractive to many British workers, said this was \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but urged the government to \u201cconsider going further still by adopting the \u2018growing rate\u2019 system outlined. EU nationals currently make up a quarter of the 430,000-strong workforce in food and drink manufacturing and many businesses will be recruiting under immigration rules for the first time, said the FDF. London First, which represents some of the capital\u2019s biggest employers, said the MAC could have gone further and proposed a \u00a320,000 threshold, which \u201cwould have ensured we could keep the economy at full strength\u201d, it said. The Federation of Small Businesses said: \u201cFSB research shows that four-in-five small employers that hire staff into jobs classed as mid-skilled do so into roles with salaries less than \u00a330,000. This includes positions in sectors such as engineering and IT.\u201d And Universities UK said it remained concerned about its post-Brexit ability to recruit lab technicians, language assistants and other researchers from the EU even with the proposed salary threshold. \u201cWe are also concerned that standard salary levels in higher education sectors would no longer be recognised, meaning it will be harder to attract international talent into key lecturer roles,\u201d Alistair Jarvis, its chief executive, said. Turning away from Huawei, negotiations on the UK\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with the EU will start on 3 March, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. Here is an analysis of the Huawei decision from Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian defence and security correspondent. Nick Timothy, who was co-chief of staff to Theresa May when she was prime minister until the 2017 general election, has criticised the Huawei decision. From the BBC\u2019s security correspondent Gordon Corera According to a YouGov poll, members of the public are more likely to be against using Huawei to build the 5G infrastructure than in favour by a margin of three to one. But almost half of the public do not have a view, the poll also suggests. And this is from Steve Baker, the Tory backbencher, on the Huawei decision. By \u201cthis seems to be happening\u201d, he means he is commending the government for stressing what it is doing to mitigate the Huawei risk, he says. Tom Tugendhat has now posted an eight-part thread on Twitter explaining some of his concerns about the Huawei decision. And here is his conclusion. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chaired the foreign affairs committee in the last parliament, and Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, were two of the backbenchers most critical of Huawei when MPs debated the issue in the Commons yesterday afternoon. Now the decision has been formally announced, they have restated their opposition to the plan. These are from LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood and ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt. Huawei has welcomed the UK government\u2019s decision. This is from its vice-president, Victor Zhang. Huawei is reassured by the UK government\u2019s confirmation that we can continue working with our customers to keep the 5G roll-out on track. This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future. It gives the UK access to world-leading technology and ensures a competitive market. We have supplied cutting-edge technology to telecoms operators in the UK for more than 15 years. We will build on this strong track record, supporting our customers as they invest in their 5G networks, boosting economic growth and helping the UK continue to compete globally. We agree a diverse vendor market and fair competition are essential for network reliability and innovation, as well as ensuring consumers have access to the best possible technology. Newt Gingrich, a leading Republican and a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s Huawei decision as \u201cmajor defeat\u201d for the US. Jeremy Wright, the former culture secretary, told BBC News that he thought Boris Johnson\u2019s decision on Huawei was a \u201csensible compromise\u201d. Here is the 30-page report (pdf) from the National Cyber Security Centre containing its analysis of security threats to the telecommunications sector. It has been published today alongside the announcement. And here is its conclusion. Our threat analysis highlights that our telecoms sector is potentially vulnerable to a range of cyber-risks. This analysis is backed up by evidence generated from security testing of telecoms networks and by security incidents. In this paper, we have outlined the NCSC\u2019s approach to assessing the cyber risk to the telecoms sector, and our recommendations for reducing and managing this risk. While the risks are complex and interlinked, the NCSC has identified that it is feasible to manage these risks and by doing so, increase confidence in the telecoms services on which the nation relies. Here is a statement from Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, about the Huawei/5G decision. She said: We want world-class connectivity as soon as possible but this must not be at the expense of our national security. High-risk vendors never have been and never will be in our most sensitive networks. The government has reviewed the supply chain for telecoms networks and concluded today it is necessary to have tight restrictions on the presence of high-risk vendors. This is a UK-specific solution for UK-specific reasons and the decision deals with the challenges we face right now. It not only paves the way for secure and resilient networks, with our sovereignty over data protected, but it also builds on our strategy to develop a diversity of suppliers. We can now move forward and seize the huge opportunities of 21st century technology. Here is her news release in full. And here is a written ministerial statement from Morgan to peers giving more details of the government\u2019s plans to legislate to limit the involvement of so-called \u201chigh-risk vendors\u201d like Huawei in the 5G network. Here is an extract from the culture department news release. Ministers today determined that UK operators should put in place additional safeguards and exclude high-risk vendors from parts of the telecoms network that are critical to security. High-risk vendors are those who pose greater security and resilience risks to UK telecoms networks. The prime minister chaired a meeting of the national security council (NSC), where it was agreed that the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) should issue guidance to UK telecoms operators on high-risk vendors following the conclusions of the telecoms supply chain review. This advice is that high-risk vendors should be: \u2022 Excluded from all safety-related and safety-critical networks in critical national infrastructure \u2022 Excluded from security critical \u2018core\u2019 functions, the sensitive part of the network. \u2022 Excluded from sensitive geographic locations, such as nuclear sites and military bases. \u2022 Limited to a minority presence of no more than 35% in the periphery of the network, known as the access network, which connect devices and equipment to mobile phone masts. As part of the review, the NCSC carried out a technical and security analysis that offers the most detailed assessment in the world of what is needed to protect the UK\u2019s digital infrastructure. The guidance sets out the practical steps operators should take to implement the government\u2019s decision on how to best mitigate the risks of high risk vendors in 5G and gigabit-capable networks. The government will now seek to legislate at the earliest opportunity to put in place the powers necessary to implement this tough new telecoms security framework. The government is certain that these measures, taken together, will allow us to mitigate the potential risk posed by the supply chain and to combat the range of threats, whether cyber-criminals, or state-sponsored attacks. The review also highlighted the need for the UK to improve the diversity in the supply of equipment to telecoms networks. The government is now developing an ambitious strategy to help diversify the supply chain. This will seek to attract established vendors who are not present in the UK, supporting the emergence of new, disruptive entrants to the supply chain, and promoting the adoption of open, interoperable standards that will reduce barriers to entry. The recommended cap of 35% will be kept under review to determine whether it should be further reduced as the market diversifies. Today\u2019s decision marks a major change in the UK\u2019s approach that will substantially improve the security and resilience of our critical telecoms networks. It will see the government roll out the most stringent set of controls ever \u2013 including new standards with tough underpinning legislation to raise the security and quality of the entire 5G and gigabit-capable networks. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s story about the Huawei announcement. This is how it starts. The Chinese state-owned tech firm Huawei has been designated a \u201chigh-risk vendor\u201d but will be given the opportunity to build non-core elements of Britain\u2019s 5G network, the government has announced. The company will be banned from the \u201ccore\u201d, of the 5G network, and from operating at sensitive sites such as nuclear and military facilities, and its share of the market will be capped at 35%. \u201cWe are clear-eyed about the challenge posed by Huawei, which we today confirm is a high-risk vendor,\u201d said a Whitehall source. But the source insisted a \u201cmarket failure\u201d meant there was little alternative in the short term. The government Huawei announcement is out. More details soon ... This morning Christopher Pincher, a Foreign Office minister, has been attending an EU general affairs council meeting in Brussels. It is the last scheduled EU meeting that a British minister will be attending while the UK remains a member. As he arrived Pincher said that he would deliver the message that \u201cas we leave the EU we will always be allies, partners and friends\u201d. He said: I\u2019m here to reassert to my EU friends and colleagues that, though we are leaving the EU, we are not leaving Europe. Our shared history, our shared values, our commitment to security and prosperity continue as equals - sovereign equals. Here are some of the more interesting articles and tweets on the Huawei/5G story that I\u2019ve seen this morning. Gordon Corera, the BBC\u2019s security correspondent, explains the dilemma facing the government in a blog. Here\u2019s an extract. The US has taken a hard line because it knows the UK decision has global significance. Many other countries are going through similar debates right now. Like the UK, they would like to use Huawei because it is cheap but fear the security risks and the wrath of the US. If the UK approves the use of Huawei many of them may use that as cover to follow suit. Few others though have the technical experience of monitoring Huawei that the UK has built up. The global perspective goes to one of the wider long-term risks. Some people ask how we have got to a position where we are needing to even consider using Chinese technology. The answer is because Western countries failed to think strategically about protecting or nurturing their own full spectrum telecoms industry over the last two decades. Companies went bust or were taken over. Meanwhile Beijing pursued a focused long-term strategy to become a leader in the technology. Jack Blanchard in his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe includes some good analysis of the Huawei issue. Here is an extract. What No. 10 really thinks: My colleague Annabelle Dickson reports this is ultimately a trade-off that Downing Street is prepared to make. She says today\u2019s big decision on Huawei reflects the new strategic thinking inside No. 10, where senior officials prioritize potentially revolutionary advances in technology over the marginal gains of increased transatlantic trade. \u201cFormer ministers and officials who are familiar with the mind-set of Johnson and his top adviser Dominic Cummings say privately that modern tech infrastructure is much more important to the pair\u2019s vision for the U.K.\u2019s future economy than trade with the U.S., welcome as a quick deal would be,\u201d she reports. Read the quotes: \u201cIf you are Dom and the PM, you know in 10 years we want to be a high-tech Silicon Valley across the whole of the U.K.,\u201d says one government official who has worked closely with both men. \u201cWe need high-speed internet across the country to do that. That is more important than getting slightly cheaper meat.\u201d The official continues: \u201cWhile trade deals are a Tory MP obsession \u2026 Dom would come from the school of thought that the point of trade deals and leaving the EU is to make your own domestic market more dynamic and more responsive.\u201d Charles Moore in the Daily Telegraph (pawyall) says the Huawei virus is more of a threat than the coronavirus. He says: Imagine the situation the other way round. Would China allow a British or American company to get itself near the heart of its secret systems? Of course not. The Huawei case is actually worse than that, because whereas British or American companies have independent lives of their own, a country like China does not. Huawei is an arm of the Chinese state, and Beijing would never allow it otherwise. That state remains, despite all the reforms, a one-party, totalitarian system. Indeed the present condition of the Chinese Communist party seems to be reverting in its leadership cult, its ultra-secrecy and its hostility to exterior powers to the mindset of the Chairman Mao era. The headlines just now are all about the dangers of the coronavirus coming out of China. The Huawei virus will infect us much more widely and far longer if we let it. Mike Butcher, editor-at-large at TechCrunch, has posted a Twitter thread on the story. It starts here. Here are his conclusions. And this is from the BBC\u2019s technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones. Here is the full text of the migration advisory committee\u2019s report (pdf). It runs to 278 page. There is also an annex (pdf) running to 103 pages. According to a survey for ConservativeHome, almost 80% of Conservative party members think the government should ban the Chinese firm Huawei from playing a role in the 5G network. ConservativeHome surveys are normally seen as reliable guide to opinion in the party. Boris Johnson is in such a strong position with his party, having just won the election with a near-landslide, that he can afford to take a decision opposed by almost four out of five of his party members. But it is unusual for a prime minister to have quite so little support from the membership on a major policy decision. It is all very well having political capital in the bank, but once you start using it up, the stock does diminish. Ministers are in Downing Street now for the national security council meeting that will decide whether Huawei can build the UK\u2019s 5G network. Here are some of the arrival pictures. According to the Washington Post, three Republican senators have written to the British national security council urging them not to let Huawei play a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. In their letter Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton and John Cornyn said: This letter represents a genuine plea from one ally to another. We do not want to feed post-Brexit anxieties by threatening a potential US-UK free trade agreement when it comes to congress for approval. Nor would we want to have to review US-UK intelligence sharing. The facts on Huawei are clear. We hope that your government will make the right decision and reject Huawei\u2019s inclusion in its 5G infrastructure. The suggestion that, if the UK refuses to block Huawei, congress may block the proposed UK-US trade deal was also made by the former Trump adviser Tim Morrison in an interview yesterday. But these interventions from Washington do not seem to be working. The NSC is meeting this morning, and it is expected to approve Huawei playing some role in the 5G roll-out. Boris Johnson implied as much yesterday. Here are the latest figures on Labour leadership nominations from @CLPNominations, a respected Twitter account. Here is my colleague Amelia Gentleman\u2019s story about the migration advisory committee\u2019s report. And this is how her story starts. The independent migration advisory committee does not recommend a full shift to an Australian points-based system in research giving the first detailed insight into how a reformed immigration system might look after Brexit and the ending of freedom of movement for EU nationals. In a report published on Tuesday, the independent committee, which provides research-based advice to the government, recommends a mixed system, which would rely on a minimum salary threshold for those people coming to the UK with a job offer, and a points-based system for those coming to the UK without a pre-arranged job. \u201cTalented individuals\u201d would be able to apply for a work visa under the points-based system. Its recommendations would reduce levels of immigration, the size of the UK population and total GDP. \u201cWe expect the changes to very slightly increase GDP per capita, productivity and improve public finances, though these estimates are more uncertain,\u201d the report states. The migration advisory committee is recommending that the post-Brexit immigration salary threshold should be cut from \u00a330,000 (the level proposed by the government when Theresa May was PM) to \u00a325,600, the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith reports. At this stage in the electoral cycle (just after a big election win for the governing party, and with the opposition in the middle of a leadership election), opinion polls don\u2019t count for much. But if you do want to know what the polls are saying, the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley has the latest figures from YouGov. Boris Johnson\u2019s government spent \u00a346m on a \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d campaign in October, but demonstrated little evidence it left the public better prepared, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has found. My colleague Rajeev Syal has the full story here. Boris Johnson and his ministers want to improve regional connectivity, in particular rail travel in the north of England, and today Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is announcing outline proposals to reopen two rail lines: the Ashington-Blyth-Tyne Line in Northumberland, and the the Fleetwood line in Lancashire. As with the government plans for \u201c40 new hospitals\u201d, there is no firm commitment to go ahead with the work; just a seed-funding commitment to explore the idea. My colleague Gwyn Topham\u2019s story about the plan is here. As a relatively minor transport announcement, that\u2019s fine, but Shapps is facing criticism today because he is presenting this as part of a plan, first announced during the general election campaign, to reverse the 1960s Beeching cuts that closed more than 4,000 miles of track and more than 2,000 stations (in the era when mass car ownership was taking off, making rail less competitive). Shapps first floated this idea during the general election campaign. In a highly crowded field, this was seen as one of the most misleading tweets of the general election, because it implied that the Beeching cuts might to totally or largely reversed, when in fact \u00a3500m would only pay for a few miles of new track. The government is still giving that impression today. The press release from the Department for Transport says Shapps is making an announcement that \u201cwill that will drive forward the reversal of the controversial Beeching cuts\u201d. Labour says today\u2019s promise is \u201cmeaningless\u201d without much more substantial investment. In a statement Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: The funding pledged by the government would reopen just 25 miles of railway. The Conservatives claim to have been reversing Beeching cuts since 2017 despite not reopening an inch of track. Investing in the railway is a fantastic policy but this is meaningless without a serious funding commitment of billions of pounds. The timing of this announcement is also suspicious and seems designed to distract from the imminent collapse of the Northern rail franchise. Later we will get a much more significant investment announcement from the government - the decision about Huawei. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of the national security council to decide whether Huawei will be allowed a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. 10am: The migration advisory committee publishes a report on how an Australian-style points-based immigration system could work in the UK. 11.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons. Afternoon: Ministers are due to make oral statements in parliament about the Huawei decision. Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, is expected to make the statement in the Lords, but it is not clear yet who will address the Commons. 2.45pm: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, chairs a meeting of the joint ministerial committee, which includes ministers from the devolved administrations, in Cardiff to discuss Brexit. 3.35pm: Lord Berkeley, former deputy chair of the Oakervee review of HS2, gives evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

My life as a dog owner has been dogged (sorry) by unavoidable social interactions. Our first park, six or seven years ago, featured an aggressively social group of walkers who marched round together discussing planning applications and parking outrages. There was even an annual picnic, for pity\u2019s sake. On my next walk route, I was drawn into initially pleasant conversation with a fellow whippet owner, before discovering she was floridly racist and having to spend three years trying to dodge her. I thought I had found silent-walk nirvana with my current itinerary \u2013 around the dump and along the narrowest, muddiest paths of the nature reserve in the dark \u2013 but a garrulous man with a fat staffie has decided I need daily updates on his New Year fitness regime. Much like at primary school drop offs, your dog unerringly makes friends with the dog of the person you least want to talk to, lingering or speeding up unhelpfully so you\u2019re forced to drop into step with them.

      "bodyText": "Dogs combat human loneliness: German research last year comparing older dog owners, cat owners and people without pets found that only the dog people reported reduced feelings of social isolation. It is partly the dog\u2019s company (our brains release the bonding hormone oxytocin when we\u2019re around them) but it\u2019s also about all those walks, bringing you into contact with cheery, like-minded souls, pockets stuffed with poo bags and fetid liver-based treats. It\u2019s true and I hate it. My life as a dog owner has been dogged (sorry) by unavoidable social interactions. Our first park, six or seven years ago, featured an aggressively social group of walkers who marched round together discussing planning applications and parking outrages. There was even an annual picnic, for pity\u2019s sake. On my next walk route, I was drawn into initially pleasant conversation with a fellow whippet owner, before discovering she was floridly racist and having to spend three years trying to dodge her. I thought I had found silent-walk nirvana with my current itinerary \u2013 around the dump and along the narrowest, muddiest paths of the nature reserve in the dark \u2013 but a garrulous man with a fat staffie has decided I need daily updates on his New Year fitness regime. Much like at primary school drop offs, your dog unerringly makes friends with the dog of the person you least want to talk to, lingering or speeding up unhelpfully so you\u2019re forced to drop into step with them. It\u2019s even harder to dodge a dog bore than a colleague who shares your commute. I tallied seven social interactions on today\u2019s walk: three hellos and four chats (it\u2019s cold, our dogs are idiots, watch out for the grumpy husky, and, unusually, a compliment on my coat). I realise that sounds perfectly pleasant, and I know it\u2019s good for me: research on \u201cweak-ties\u201d and stranger interactions consistently shows these contacts enhance mood. But what I crave on our morning walk is an hour alone with the birdsong, the murderous honking of the local geese and the sluggish churn of my thoughts. I should have got a cat.",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell.

      "bodyText": "A British family trapped in the centre of the coronavirus outbreak are facing their \u201cworst nightmare\u201d after being told wife and mother Sindy Siddle will not be allowed on the plane evacuating them from the country. Siddle travelled to Hubei province with her husband, Jeff, and nine-year-old daughter, Jasmine, to spend lunar new year with her family in the village of Hongtu. The UK Foreign Office (FCO) has told her that since she has a Chinese passport, she will not be allowed to board the plane evacuating British nationals in the next few days. China does not recognise dual nationality; any citizen who wants to get a passport from another country has to give up their Chinese one. Many people unofficially managed to hold two passports, by acquiring a second nationality without informing Chinese authorities. But in recent years, driven partly by an anti-corruption campaign, there have been greater official efforts to crack down on dual nationals. A 42-year-old accounts assistant, Siddle has had a visa for permanent residency in the UK since 2008. \u201cMy head is spinning. It\u2019s just horrendous,\u201d said Jeff Siddle, 54, an IT software developer. \u201cThis ordeal just turned into our worst nightmare \u2026 How can they put a family in this position?

      "body": "<p>This book contains, as the title promises, many delightful curiosities. There are people, for instance, who get aroused by the sun. \u201cActirasty\u201d, it\u2019s called, which sounds like a probiotic yoghurt drink but would of course be life-changing if you lived in M\u00e1laga. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesjoyce\" title=\"\">James Joyce</a> used to address his letters to Nora, \u201cdear Fuck Bird\u201d.

As early as 1139, it was signed into canonical law that impotence was grounds for the annulment of a marriage, so you can see why the try-anything approach persisted, when a person could be unmade by physical failure, publicly ejected from the organising bond of society. Dough has reminded humans of sex, one way or another, pretty much since the cultivation of wheat began; any loaf of bread worth its salt was originally designed to resemble either a penis or a vagina. But much of the significance of food, especially in the early modern period, was not its erotic redolence but its mediating role in the bewitchery of carnal urges. So a wife might increase her husband\u2019s ardency by keeping a live fish in her vagina for two days, then roasting it and feeding it to him. Or she might, conversely, set out to kill him by covering herself in honey and rolling in wheat, before grinding the wheat and turning it into bread, which she then fed to him. But she\u2019d have to remember to mill it in the opposite direction to the sun, whatever that means.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As late as the 20th century, grafting a monkey\u2019s testicle on to your scrotum was thought a plausible cure for impotence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the point at which bicycles were adopted by vanguard feminists as a source of liberation \u2013 the American suffragette Susan B Anthony said they had \u201cdone more to emancipate women than anything else in the world\u201d \u2013 they simultaneously started to feature heavily in pornography. This glances towards an original and rather buoying notion about men, women, desire and the patriarchy. Perhaps beneath the rich history of centuries of prejudice, outlined by Lister, in which women were denied sexuality even while they were accused of voraciousness, there has been a competing truth that freedom is, itself, arousing. Perhaps female emancipation was driven not by the arc of history (like the invisible hand, more convincing as a phrase than it is an observable fact) but by the fact that equality is a huge turn-on, and rigid belief structures are no match for that. Or perhaps not. Lister\u2019s vivid and playful language observes no rules of academic turgidity \u2013 sorry, thoroughness, But you can hear the lecturer in her nonetheless: she drops facts in a dainty way, as if they are trivia, yet each triggers a deeper rumination on how sex interlaces with all other human fortunes.</p> <p>Dildos, the clitoris, depilatory creams are all explored in her rambunctious style. A fascinating chapter, Colonising the Cunt, uncovers layer on layer of oppression almost too horrific to see collected in one place \u2013 black women and men displayed to a gaping public like zoo animals, a pseudo-scientific gloss applied on top. Lister quotes Dr William Lee Howard\u2019s <em>The Negro </em><em>As a Distinct Ethnic Factor in Civilisation</em>, on the \u201clarge size of the African\u2019s penis\u201d, one consequence of which is that \u201che will walk the alleys late at night with a penis swollen from disease, and infects his bride-to-be with the same nonchalance that he will an hour later exhibit when cohabiting with the lowest of his race\u201d. The on\u2011the-spot diagnosis is rum, but so is the confusion of that imagery \u2013 that the shame of this other race lies in not keeping a spare, clean knob for the woman you\u2019re married to. It says so much about what it does to one\u2019s ability to reason and observe neutrally, when you come from a culture in which women\u2019s wombs are the primary method of transmitting property.</p> <p>Moral relativism often exculpates those living in the early 19th century; the idea that, high on their own adventures, blissfully naive, they simply didn\u2019t recognise the common humanity in any but a small number of similar-looking foreigners. This, the book delicately shows rather than tells, is bullshit: in 1810, the African Association, along with the anti-slavery campaigner Zachary Macaulay, took the case of the South African Khoikhoi woman Sarah Baartman to court, arguing that to be exhibited for your buttocks might possibly be a dehumanising experience. The case was dismissed, and Baartman died of alcoholism six years later, at the age of 26. The point is made: if anybody could have seen this as exploitation, everybody could have.</p> <p>Lister is creator of the Whores of Yore website, and writes here: \u201cThe truth is that I should not have used the word \u2018whore\u2019\u201d on the site: \u201cit\u2019s not my word, and if you\u2019re not a sex worker, it\u2019s not yours either. It\u2019s a term of abuse that sex workers hear every day by those seeking to devalue and shame them.\u201d But most readers will surely be able to tell the difference between using \u201cwhore\u201d as a term of abuse in 2020, and delving into its history, which started with the Norse for adulteress and only got its remunerative dimension much later. Not wanting to get bogged down in detail, Lister tells the less curious history \u2013 the workaday business of dates, laws, events \u2013 in rather broad terms. So, she notes, in 1580 Britain saw the first parliamentary bill to restrain \u201cbooks, pamphlets \u2026 and other works that promote lascivious ungodly love\u201d, and this was taken as the beginning of a new attitude to obscenity and, thereby, to sex. (Though it might have been worth referring to the invention of the printing press \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t have been much need to restrict pamphlets before the 1550s: the moral panic may have been more about the tech than the sex.) This segues straight into the observation that the \u201clicensing act of 1662 banned the publication of any \u2018heretical, seditious, schismatic or offensive books \u2026 contrary to Christian faith\u201d. Yet this was not explicitly or even implicitly prudish in intent: indeed, so soon after the restoration of Charles II, all the energy was geared towards forgetting the nation\u2019s brief flirtation with fundamentalist puritanism. The Act is more commonly understood as a re-enactment of the Order of the Star Chamber of 1637, or put more simply, a reassertion of monarchical order to make sure no one cut his head off again.</p> <p>In her conclusion, Lister describes in passing the difficulties of building a historically accurate portrait of sex, when you have the testimony of the church but not of the sex worker, the chronicles of the courts but not of the adulteress. In the absence of individual accounts, she has aimed instead to build a picture of the religious, political and cultural structures that \u201cframed people\u2019s experience of sex\u201d. This is an uncharacteristically dry account of a lively project, like giving the carb/protein/fat breakdown of a dish without saying how delicious it was, how an unexpected caper brought the whole thing alive.</p> <p>The Roman author Aelian describes a virginity test that involves a woman trying to feed a barley cake to a snake: if it won\u2019t bite or, wearing a blindfold, the woman fails to find the snake, then she apparently isn\u2019t a virgin and should be punished. Although there are plenty of men in this book \u2013 and not just oppressors but young lads who become \u201cwithered and aged because of \u2026 constant masturbating\u201d \u2013 it is unavoidably an account of injustice against women, and a compelling one.</p> <p><em> \u2022 A Curious History of Sex by Kate Lister is published by Unbound (RRP \u00a325).

But she\u2019d have to remember to mill it in the opposite direction to the sun, whatever that means. At the point at which bicycles were adopted by vanguard feminists as a source of liberation \u2013 the American suffragette Susan B Anthony said they had \u201cdone more to emancipate women than anything else in the world\u201d \u2013 they simultaneously started to feature heavily in pornography. This glances towards an original and rather buoying notion about men, women, desire and the patriarchy. Perhaps beneath the rich history of centuries of prejudice, outlined by Lister, in which women were denied sexuality even while they were accused of voraciousness, there has been a competing truth that freedom is, itself, arousing. Perhaps female emancipation was driven not by the arc of history (like the invisible hand, more convincing as a phrase than it is an observable fact) but by the fact that equality is a huge turn-on, and rigid belief structures are no match for that. Or perhaps not. Lister\u2019s vivid and playful language observes no rules of academic turgidity \u2013 sorry, thoroughness, But you can hear the lecturer in her nonetheless: she drops facts in a dainty way, as if they are trivia, yet each triggers a deeper rumination on how sex interlaces with all other human fortunes. Dildos, the clitoris, depilatory creams are all explored in her rambunctious style. A fascinating chapter, Colonising the Cunt, uncovers layer on layer of oppression almost too horrific to see collected in one place \u2013 black women and men displayed to a gaping public like zoo animals, a pseudo-scientific gloss applied on top. Lister quotes Dr William Lee Howard\u2019s The Negro As a Distinct Ethnic Factor in Civilisation, on the \u201clarge size of the African\u2019s penis\u201d, one consequence of which is that \u201che will walk the alleys late at night with a penis swollen from disease, and infects his bride-to-be with the same nonchalance that he will an hour later exhibit when cohabiting with the lowest of his race\u201d. The on\u2011the-spot diagnosis is rum, but so is the confusion of that imagery \u2013 that the shame of this other race lies in not keeping a spare, clean knob for the woman you\u2019re married to. It says so much about what it does to one\u2019s ability to reason and observe neutrally, when you come from a culture in which women\u2019s wombs are the primary method of transmitting property. Moral relativism often exculpates those living in the early 19th century; the idea that, high on their own adventures, blissfully naive, they simply didn\u2019t recognise the common humanity in any but a small number of similar-looking foreigners. This, the book delicately shows rather than tells, is bullshit: in 1810, the African Association, along with the anti-slavery campaigner Zachary Macaulay, took the case of the South African Khoikhoi woman Sarah Baartman to court, arguing that to be exhibited for your buttocks might possibly be a dehumanising experience. The case was dismissed, and Baartman died of alcoholism six years later, at the age of 26. The point is made: if anybody could have seen this as exploitation, everybody could have. Lister is creator of the Whores of Yore website, and writes here: \u201cThe truth is that I should not have used the word \u2018whore\u2019\u201d on the site: \u201cit\u2019s not my word, and if you\u2019re not a sex worker, it\u2019s not yours either. It\u2019s a term of abuse that sex workers hear every day by those seeking to devalue and shame them.\u201d But most readers will surely be able to tell the difference between using \u201cwhore\u201d as a term of abuse in 2020, and delving into its history, which started with the Norse for adulteress and only got its remunerative dimension much later. Not wanting to get bogged down in detail, Lister tells the less curious history \u2013 the workaday business of dates, laws, events \u2013 in rather broad terms. So, she notes, in 1580 Britain saw the first parliamentary bill to restrain \u201cbooks, pamphlets \u2026 and other works that promote lascivious ungodly love\u201d, and this was taken as the beginning of a new attitude to obscenity and, thereby, to sex. (Though it might have been worth referring to the invention of the printing press \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t have been much need to restrict pamphlets before the 1550s: the moral panic may have been more about the tech than the sex.) This segues straight into the observation that the \u201clicensing act of 1662 banned the publication of any \u2018heretical, seditious, schismatic or offensive books \u2026 contrary to Christian faith\u201d. Yet this was not explicitly or even implicitly prudish in intent: indeed, so soon after the restoration of Charles II, all the energy was geared towards forgetting the nation\u2019s brief flirtation with fundamentalist puritanism. The Act is more commonly understood as a re-enactment of the Order of the Star Chamber of 1637, or put more simply, a reassertion of monarchical order to make sure no one cut his head off again. In her conclusion, Lister describes in passing the difficulties of building a historically accurate portrait of sex, when you have the testimony of the church but not of the sex worker, the chronicles of the courts but not of the adulteress. In the absence of individual accounts, she has aimed instead to build a picture of the religious, political and cultural structures that \u201cframed people\u2019s experience of sex\u201d. This is an uncharacteristically dry account of a lively project, like giving the carb/protein/fat breakdown of a dish without saying how delicious it was, how an unexpected caper brought the whole thing alive. The Roman author Aelian describes a virginity test that involves a woman trying to feed a barley cake to a snake: if it won\u2019t bite or, wearing a blindfold, the woman fails to find the snake, then she apparently isn\u2019t a virgin and should be punished. Although there are plenty of men in this book \u2013 and not just oppressors but young lads who become \u201cwithered and aged because of \u2026 constant masturbating\u201d \u2013 it is unavoidably an account of injustice against women, and a compelling one. \u2022 A Curious History of Sex by Kate Lister is published by Unbound (RRP \u00a325).

It\u2019s also valuable for employee retention and productivity. \u201cMy instinct here is that yes, an employee will be more productive if they have some sense of peace over how their castle is doing, how their home is doing.\u201d Initialized Capital offers 16 weeks\u2019 paid parental leave. Last year, a quarter of their employees \u2013 including three fathers \u2013 took it. Ohanian, who refers to himself as a \u201cbusiness dad\u201d, has also started investing in \u201cfamily tech\u201d companies like The Mom Project, a recruitment service for mothers, and the childcare app Kinside. To get to gender equality, though, he says it\u2019s essential that men take as much parental leave as women. \u201cNo matter who\u2019s getting pregnant, if both parents are taking leave then it sort of nullifies that penalty for having a uterus.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Afghanistan\u2019s attorney general has launched an investigation into the alleged abuse of more than 500 schoolboys, following the discovery of a paedophile ring in the country\u2019s Logar province. Jamshid Rasooli, a spokesman for the attorney general\u2019s office, said a committee had been appointed. \u201cWe are in the process of running a comprehensive, impartial investigation,\u201d he said. No date has been set for the release of the committee\u2019s findings, but the closure of schools over the winter months might cause delays. The move follows the discovery by civil society organisation the Logar Youth, Social and Civil Institution of more than 100 videos posted to a Facebook page showing the alleged abuse of boys in six schools by teachers, headteachers and others in authority. The page has since been removed. The Guardian\u2019s report on the abuse led to a national debate on child abuse involving members of parliament and civil society, and an international outcry. Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Education launched an urgent investigation. The president\u2019s spokesperson Sediq Sediqqi said the ministry is drafting a school security plan to deal with multiple issues, including child abuse, as well as reviewing how schools deal with reports of abuse. \u201cThe teacher\u2019s professional code of conduct has additionally been revised and the approaches to deal with child abuse and gender-based violence have been incorporated,\u201d Seqiqqi said. Activists Mohammad Mussa Mahmoudi and Ehsanullah Hamidi, who exposed the abuse, have left Afghanistan with their families for safety reasons. Both had been receiving threats for months before they publicised their research and were detained by the country\u2019s intelligence services, the National Directorate of Security, for several days before being released after publicly denying their findings. At the time the former US ambassador John Bass tweeted that such \u201cSoviet-style\u201d tactics of coercing confessions were \u201cappalling\u201d. The European Parliament has commended the work of Mahmoudi and all human rights defenders in Afghanistan, calling for the investigation to be \u201cconducted in cooperation with international bodies including Unama (the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan), and in full transparency.\u201d \u201cThis is one of the most dangerous moments to be a human rights activist in Afghanistan,\u201d said Omar Waraich, deputy south Asia director at Amnesty International. \u201cNot only do they operate in one of the most hazardous environments, but they face threats from both the government and armed groups. \u201cThe Afghan government has a duty to respect, protect and support activists, to investigate threats and attacks against them, and to hold suspected perpetrators accountable,\u201d he said. Following publication of the research, UN agencies and NGOs said they would provide better protection to children in Logar and offer psychological support to survivors of abuse. \u201cResources have been made available to help children, and things are moving in a positive direction but much work needs to be done to address these issues across the country,\u201d said the director of one NGO working on child protection in Afghanistan, who wished to remain anonymous. The director said one problem was the lack of female social workers in Afghanistan as many of the boys who had been abused might not feel comfortable speaking to men. Abuse of boys in Afghanistan \u2013 often referred to as bacha bazi (literally, \u201cboy for play\u201d) \u2013 is widespread, but rarely talked about, as survivors often fear speaking up could lead to retribution or bring shame to their families. \u201cThere\u2019s a global culture of shame of the abused that is misplaced and it often comes out as denial.

      "body": "<p>Things might have been different if only Jack Kerouac had known how to hop a freight train. His attempts, described at the outset of the book that gained him celebrity, were a failure; a romantic notion from a bygone era that, in reality, proved tricky. Much easier to hitch a lorry ride. And thus the writer\u2019s euphoric westward peregrinations, by motor car, kindled a new spirit of domestic US travel: On the Road rather than On the Railroad.</p> <p>Since the 1950s, America\u2019s once great \u201ciron horse\u201d has suffered under the exhaust fumes of the four-wheeler. In recent years, however, national Amtrak services have seen <a href=\"https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/12/07/amtrak-says-growing-demand-makes-case-for-us-rail-funding/\" title=\"\">an increase in passenger numbers</a>, not just in the north-east\u2019s multi-city corridor but on long-haul routes, too. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/11/08/amtrak-touts-record-ridership-revenue-fiscal/\" title=\"\">Investing millions</a> in improving customer service, safety and, crucially, sustainability, the railroad may be on track to regain its former glory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2020-01-28T15:04:51.html\" data-alt=\"Chicago to Flagstaff, map of a US Amtrak Southwest Chief train journey.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2020-01-28T15:04:51.html\">Chicago to Flagstaff, map of a US Amtrak Southwest Chief train journey.</a> </figure>  <p>I am thinking of Kerouac as our train, the Southwest Chief, trundles over a moonlit Mississippi River, exchanging cornfield Iowa for the western plains, as he did more than 70 years ago. My brother and I are travelling from Illinois to Arizona \u2013 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jul/04/how-to-hike-the-grand-canyon-usa-walking-camping-adventure\" title=\"\">see the Grand Canyon</a> \u2013 aboard one of Amtrak\u2019s long-distance Superliner services. Having left Chicago\u2019s art deco Union station shortly before 3pm, a 30-hour journey will swing us through the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico before the Chief chugs on to Los Angeles.</p> <p>To fly to the canyon would have taken roughly a quarter of the time, on a ticket costing a third of the price. It would have freed up hours to hike more of the Colorado River valley and to sink beers in the craft breweries of Flagstaff. Alternatively, to drive would have meant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/feb/28/us-road-trip-route-66\" title=\"\">Route 66 \u2013 the iconic American road</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/feb/28/us-road-trip-route-66\" title=\"\"> trip</a> into the west.

Increasingly uncomfortable flying to attend interstate conferences, the academic from New Mexico is returning from Illinois on the Southwest Chief. \u201cI had to convince my university to cover the extra day\u2019s travel, plus a sleeper ticket,\u201d he tells me in the dining car. \u201cFortunately, they were understanding.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49b640b224120d74cf9b805098031700f9f4c4fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49b640b224120d74cf9b805098031700f9f4c4fe/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicago\u2019s Union station, USA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicago\u2019s Union station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Collins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reports for the US Department of Energy show that, per passenger mile, rail has a lower energy footprint than road and air (despite the diesel locomotives). And with Amtrak declaring a <a href=\"https://www.amtrak.com/travel-green\" title=\"\">17% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2010</a> \u2013 and more efficient, high-speed engines on the horizon \u2013 Michael, like me, is in favour of supporting rail. But I was curious, too. At some stage, all my American road trips have intercepted a train ploughing off into deep country; I have so often wanted to be aboard. And now, with the lights of Kansas City disappearing into the night, and Elvis\u2019s Mystery Train loud in the headphones, at last I am.</p> <p>Morning, and dawn casts an orange glow across wintry Kansas, flaring the curtains of my lower bunk window. My brother and I are sharing a \u201croomette\u201d \u2013 a cabin comprising two seats that convert into bunkbeds \u2013 and he drew the shorter straw. Though arguably just as comfortable, the top lacks a window view. Miles of prairie are lighting up from the east, studded by cattle and deer: interior America at its biggest.</p> <p>The engine issues a series of whistles and hurtles over a crossroads. We rouse ourselves with coffee from a round-the-clock dispenser in the sleeper gangway and sway along to the sightseer lounge. Here, the sunrise can be enjoyed via high curving windows and outward-facing seats. We join a handful of passengers: middle-aged Debby, who\u2019s been quietly \u201cwatching all the back yards of America\u201d since Missouri; a pair of jet-lagged Australian retirees en route to LA, and an Amish lumberman from Ohio, off to Colorado for \u201celk season\u201d hunting. The Amish are frequent patrons of the Southwest Chief, as are Mennonites from rural midwestern communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15ea2960dd61adb97052cfee62e7a355da6c10c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15ea2960dd61adb97052cfee62e7a355da6c10c7/0_0_3089_1853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sightseer lounge on the Southwest Chief, USA\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sightseer lounge on the Southwest Chief.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Collins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Debby has been to visit her daughter in Chicago. \u201cDid you notice how simple it all was?\u201d she asks, when I remark on yesterday\u2019s smooth departure. \u201cYou show your ticket, and off you go; nothing like an airport.\u201d Breakfast is announced over the PA and we move to the adjoining dining car. A restaurant attendant seats us at a four-berth table opposite Linda \u2013 Californian, mid 70s \u2013 a regular on this route. As Kansas whirls by over eggs and fried potatoes, we discuss her fear of flying: \u201cTrains are the only way to fly,\u201d she giggles, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got to have a sense of humour.\u201d</p> <p>Humour is required for the hold-ups. As private freight operators own these tracks, Amtrak\u2019s government-subsidised passenger services must give way to passing cargo, occasionally causing delays. Weather, too, can play with the timetable: in 2014 heavy snowfall stranded three Amtrak trains overnight in rural Illinois. Disruptions like these can discourage business travel, \u201cThat\u2019s not why I take the train,\u201d says Linda. \u201cI enjoy the interactions, meeting people \u2013 and the views you just can\u2019t get on the freeway.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6d8d0268aa470409354f9f1c40ceb54dac7ff930\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d8d0268aa470409354f9f1c40ceb54dac7ff930/0_229_4014_2408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View from near La Junta, Colorado\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from near La Junta, Colorado.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Collins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These elements \u2013 social and visual \u2013 combine to offer an experience unique to rail. Before lunch, my brother and I are chatting with our respective neighbours, aperitifs in hand, as the Chief climbs the Raton Pass from Colorado into New Mexico along a slip of old Santa Fe railway. A glorious view of dramatic rock, golden grass and snow-clad juniper promotes easy conversation. The nature of the seating, too \u2013 particularly in the dining car where tables are shared \u2013 is conducive to making introductions. Talk isn\u2019t mandatory. It is simply that, unlike the isolation of a car or the buttoned-up nature of planes, American train travel is wonderfully social, from the downstairs cafe car and upper lounge to the short stops at which passengers disembark for a smoke, a communal leg stretch or, as at Albuquerque, a chat with Navajo stallholders on the platform.</p> <p>But the historic views are the main attraction: Mark Twain\u2019s Mississippi, Jessie James\u2019s Missouri hide-outs; the New Mexican stomping grounds of the Apache and Navajo nations; and the distant white-capped Rockies. \u201cSee the indent in the ground,\u201d points solo traveller John excitedly, \u201cthat\u2019s a stretch of 19th-century wagon trail.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fb7b7d5ce638d3210123e0d05f9bf138dbfe0b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fb7b7d5ce638d3210123e0d05f9bf138dbfe0b3/0_345_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View from the train near Raton, New Mexico, USA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from the train near Raton, New Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Collins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Superliner routes such as this one include four sleeper-car options besides standard coach (other trips include LA to New Orleans on the <a href=\"https://www.amtrak.com/sunset-limited-train\" title=\"\">Sunset Limited</a> and Chicago to Seattle on the <a href=\"https://www.amtrak.com/empire-builder-train\" title=\"\">Empire Builder</a>). Our two-berth roomette is the basic choice with its folding table, temperature control, plug sockets and access to the carriage shower. Next, there\u2019s a three-person en suite bedroom (the lower bunk accommodates two); a \u201cfamily bedroom\u201d (four beds) and a wheelchair-accessible, two to three-person en suite. These rooms may lack the opulence of the Southwest Chief\u2019s predecessor, the \u201cSuper Chief\u201d \u2013 whose lavish veneered interiors charmed LA-bound Hollywood stars in the 1940s \u2013 but they are quiet and comfortable. A conscientious attendant accompanies the sleeper car, prepping beds and taking dining car reservations. At night, the carriage can rock while negotiating a bend and freights enter your dreams as their cargo thrums past but these minor intrusions authenticate a true railway experience.</p> <p>At around 9.30pm our attendant announces Flagstaff. Stepping out, we greet the dry, chill air of Arizona\u2019s high desert and head to the Weatherford Hotel. This three-storey downtown relic with wraparound balconies and period pillars is rich in western history. Inside, turn-of-the-century furnishings and the aroma of woodsmoke and whiskey recall its lively heritage, as do the ghosts that are said to haunt the hallways and rattle the pipes at night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d1aa000c7568c1f81251fd8075ed7c65a574a75b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1aa000c7568c1f81251fd8075ed7c65a574a75b/0_0_4895_2937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Train going through the station in Flagstaff at sunset, Arizona, US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Train going through Flagstaff station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similar to the Weatherford, the railroad arrived in Flagstaff in the late 19th century, bringing jobs, export connections and prosperity.

      "bodyText": "Things might have been different if only Jack Kerouac had known how to hop a freight train. His attempts, described at the outset of the book that gained him celebrity, were a failure; a romantic notion from a bygone era that, in reality, proved tricky. Much easier to hitch a lorry ride. And thus the writer\u2019s euphoric westward peregrinations, by motor car, kindled a new spirit of domestic US travel: On the Road rather than On the Railroad. Since the 1950s, America\u2019s once great \u201ciron horse\u201d has suffered under the exhaust fumes of the four-wheeler. In recent years, however, national Amtrak services have seen an increase in passenger numbers, not just in the north-east\u2019s multi-city corridor but on long-haul routes, too. Investing millions in improving customer service, safety and, crucially, sustainability, the railroad may be on track to regain its former glory. I am thinking of Kerouac as our train, the Southwest Chief, trundles over a moonlit Mississippi River, exchanging cornfield Iowa for the western plains, as he did more than 70 years ago. My brother and I are travelling from Illinois to Arizona \u2013 to see the Grand Canyon \u2013 aboard one of Amtrak\u2019s long-distance Superliner services. Having left Chicago\u2019s art deco Union station shortly before 3pm, a 30-hour journey will swing us through the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico before the Chief chugs on to Los Angeles. To fly to the canyon would have taken roughly a quarter of the time, on a ticket costing a third of the price. It would have freed up hours to hike more of the Colorado River valley and to sink beers in the craft breweries of Flagstaff. Alternatively, to drive would have meant Route 66 \u2013 the iconic American road trip into the west. So why take the train? \u201cClimate guilt,\u201d as fellow passenger Michael puts it. Increasingly uncomfortable flying to attend interstate conferences, the academic from New Mexico is returning from Illinois on the Southwest Chief. \u201cI had to convince my university to cover the extra day\u2019s travel, plus a sleeper ticket,\u201d he tells me in the dining car. \u201cFortunately, they were understanding.\u201d Reports for the US Department of Energy show that, per passenger mile, rail has a lower energy footprint than road and air (despite the diesel locomotives). And with Amtrak declaring a 17% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2010 \u2013 and more efficient, high-speed engines on the horizon \u2013 Michael, like me, is in favour of supporting rail. But I was curious, too. At some stage, all my American road trips have intercepted a train ploughing off into deep country; I have so often wanted to be aboard. And now, with the lights of Kansas City disappearing into the night, and Elvis\u2019s Mystery Train loud in the headphones, at last I am. Morning, and dawn casts an orange glow across wintry Kansas, flaring the curtains of my lower bunk window. My brother and I are sharing a \u201croomette\u201d \u2013 a cabin comprising two seats that convert into bunkbeds \u2013 and he drew the shorter straw. Though arguably just as comfortable, the top lacks a window view. Miles of prairie are lighting up from the east, studded by cattle and deer: interior America at its biggest. The engine issues a series of whistles and hurtles over a crossroads. We rouse ourselves with coffee from a round-the-clock dispenser in the sleeper gangway and sway along to the sightseer lounge. Here, the sunrise can be enjoyed via high curving windows and outward-facing seats. We join a handful of passengers: middle-aged Debby, who\u2019s been quietly \u201cwatching all the back yards of America\u201d since Missouri; a pair of jet-lagged Australian retirees en route to LA, and an Amish lumberman from Ohio, off to Colorado for \u201celk season\u201d hunting. The Amish are frequent patrons of the Southwest Chief, as are Mennonites from rural midwestern communities. Debby has been to visit her daughter in Chicago. \u201cDid you notice how simple it all was?\u201d she asks, when I remark on yesterday\u2019s smooth departure. \u201cYou show your ticket, and off you go; nothing like an airport.\u201d Breakfast is announced over the PA and we move to the adjoining dining car. A restaurant attendant seats us at a four-berth table opposite Linda \u2013 Californian, mid 70s \u2013 a regular on this route. As Kansas whirls by over eggs and fried potatoes, we discuss her fear of flying: \u201cTrains are the only way to fly,\u201d she giggles, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got to have a sense of humour.\u201d Humour is required for the hold-ups. As private freight operators own these tracks, Amtrak\u2019s government-subsidised passenger services must give way to passing cargo, occasionally causing delays. Weather, too, can play with the timetable: in 2014 heavy snowfall stranded three Amtrak trains overnight in rural Illinois. Disruptions like these can discourage business travel, \u201cThat\u2019s not why I take the train,\u201d says Linda. \u201cI enjoy the interactions, meeting people \u2013 and the views you just can\u2019t get on the freeway.\u201d These elements \u2013 social and visual \u2013 combine to offer an experience unique to rail. Before lunch, my brother and I are chatting with our respective neighbours, aperitifs in hand, as the Chief climbs the Raton Pass from Colorado into New Mexico along a slip of old Santa Fe railway. A glorious view of dramatic rock, golden grass and snow-clad juniper promotes easy conversation. The nature of the seating, too \u2013 particularly in the dining car where tables are shared \u2013 is conducive to making introductions. Talk isn\u2019t mandatory. It is simply that, unlike the isolation of a car or the buttoned-up nature of planes, American train travel is wonderfully social, from the downstairs cafe car and upper lounge to the short stops at which passengers disembark for a smoke, a communal leg stretch or, as at Albuquerque, a chat with Navajo stallholders on the platform. But the historic views are the main attraction: Mark Twain\u2019s Mississippi, Jessie James\u2019s Missouri hide-outs; the New Mexican stomping grounds of the Apache and Navajo nations; and the distant white-capped Rockies. \u201cSee the indent in the ground,\u201d points solo traveller John excitedly, \u201cthat\u2019s a stretch of 19th-century wagon trail.\u201d Superliner routes such as this one include four sleeper-car options besides standard coach (other trips include LA to New Orleans on the Sunset Limited and Chicago to Seattle on the Empire Builder). Our two-berth roomette is the basic choice with its folding table, temperature control, plug sockets and access to the carriage shower. Next, there\u2019s a three-person en suite bedroom (the lower bunk accommodates two); a \u201cfamily bedroom\u201d (four beds) and a wheelchair-accessible, two to three-person en suite. These rooms may lack the opulence of the Southwest Chief\u2019s predecessor, the \u201cSuper Chief\u201d \u2013 whose lavish veneered interiors charmed LA-bound Hollywood stars in the 1940s \u2013 but they are quiet and comfortable. A conscientious attendant accompanies the sleeper car, prepping beds and taking dining car reservations. At night, the carriage can rock while negotiating a bend and freights enter your dreams as their cargo thrums past but these minor intrusions authenticate a true railway experience. At around 9.30pm our attendant announces Flagstaff. Stepping out, we greet the dry, chill air of Arizona\u2019s high desert and head to the Weatherford Hotel. This three-storey downtown relic with wraparound balconies and period pillars is rich in western history. Inside, turn-of-the-century furnishings and the aroma of woodsmoke and whiskey recall its lively heritage, as do the ghosts that are said to haunt the hallways and rattle the pipes at night. Similar to the Weatherford, the railroad arrived in Flagstaff in the late 19th century, bringing jobs, export connections and prosperity. This was shortly after the completion of America\u2019s first transcontinental railway, an ambitious feat that commenced while the country remained at civil war. \u201cThe result,\u201d wrote railroad biographer Christian Wolmar, \u201cwas to enable America to be governable as a single nation ... a single country stretching from coast to coast.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine how such pivotal infrastructure yielded over the next century to Henry Ford and the open road; particularly here, where the tracks pass directly through town. Our short stay in Flagstaff is appropriately Arizonan: we photograph sunsets, devour Tex-Mex and marvel at the Grand Canyon, with its puzzling depth and winding trails occupied by mountain goats and blue Mexican jays. My brother does the pose \u2013 perched on a precipice \u2013 while my nerves get the better of me. At Kaibab national forest we take in swathes of ponderosa pine, smoky with the Forest Service\u2019s controlled burns, and the evenings pass with pale ales in Beaver Street Brewery. Days later, at 5am, we are back on the platform awaiting the eastbound to Chicago (the Southwest Chief runs only once a day, so departure hours can be antisocial).

As Boris Johnson is seen readying the Conservative party for another general election, Trumble documents Farage\u2019s loosening grip on power and questions his continuing motivation for putting himself in the spotlight.

The US president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/donald-trump-middle-east-peace-plan-israel-netanyahu-palestinians\">outlined the plan in Washington</a>, flanked by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, boasting that he was \u201cnot shying away from big problems\u201d. Under the plan, Jerusalem would become Israel\u2019s undivided capital and the vast majority of Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land would gain recognition. A Palestinian state would receive territory near Gaza, to compensate for the loss of about 30% of the West Bank, and be offered a potential capital near Jerusalem. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/israel-palestinian-peace-plan-trump-reaction\">who had rejected the deal in advance,</a> said it was a \u201cconspiracy\u201d that \u201cwill not pass\u201d.

Japanese citizens airlifted out of Wuhan have spoken of their relief at escaping the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak but voiced concerns for people left behind. A government-chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese citizens arrived in Tokyo from the Chinese city early this morning while an aircraft with around 200 US citizens onboard, including staff from the local US consulate, left the city overnight for the United States as the death toll from the outbreak climbed to 132. There are also nearly 6,000 people infected in China, more than the number who caught Sars during the 2003 outbreak that killed 770 around the world. One of the Japanese evacuees, steel company worker Takeo Aoyama, said he was relieved to be home but was concerned about 400 compatriots still in the city. Another Japanese, Takayuki Kato, said he had become \u201cvery alarmed\u201d when everyone in Wuhan started wearing masks and transport was shut down. \u201cIsolated and vulnerable\u201d Australian citizens in Wuhan and Hubei will be evacuated to Christmas Island, the remote island in the Indian ocean that is currently used as a controversial offshore detention camp. They will be quarantined for up to 14 days. Britain is finalising plans to repatriate citizens from in and around Wuhan. The European Union will fly its citizens out aboard two French planes this week, and South Korea is due to do the same. Anxieties about the spread of the virus were compounded when officials in Germany confirmed the first human-to-human transmission of the infection in Europe. * * * Class squeeze \u2013 Private schools say the higher education watchdog\u2019s plan to open up Oxbridge places for children from disadvantaged backgrounds will mean that their pupils are squeezed out of the elite universities.

The research by law reform group Justice says the judiciary is \u201cstill dominated by white men\u201d and that although there have been modest improvements there is still no BAME supreme court justice. * * * Stars and stripes \u2013 Amateur stargazers have helped scientists to discover a new form of the northern lights, the astronomical phenomenon visible at the North Pole that has captivated humans for millennia. The part-time astronomers were engaged by experts who were researching the different forms of the aurora borealis.

      "body": "<p>The first night Joe Norton brought home his adoptive sons, Tarren and Owen, he considered his new life, then thought: what have I done? \u201cIt\u2019s a monumental decision you\u2019re making, and you\u2019re making it on your own,\u201d says the 54-year-old educational manager from Yorkshire. \u201cThe enormity hit me.\u201d</p> <p>Going from being a single man to the sole carer for two children was tougher than he had expected. There was the misbehaviour, particularly when the boys, who are brothers, began to settle in. (Experts call this period \u201cregression\u201d, but it is usually a sign that children are beginning to relax around their new parents.) He was also stumped by unexpected questions \u2013 what size socks did the boys wear? Norton had no clue what to buy. \u201cYou have an idea what size a T-shirt should be, but socks are a different thing,\u201d he says, chuckling.</p> <p>But it was rewarding, much more so than Norton had hoped or dreamed. Three months after the adoption was completed, in October 2012, Norton took Owen and Tarren \u2013 then aged six and five respectively \u2013 on a break with family friends. On that holiday, the boys started calling him \u201cDad\u201d. \u201cIt was emotional,\u201d Norton says. \u201cIt was all starting to happen.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We go away for weekends, take the dog for a walk, go for hot chocolate. I think: it\u2019s my job to do this?</p> <footer> <cite>Gareth K Thomas</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Norton is one of the growing number of men in the UK who are choosing to become single fathers. Whether through surrogacy, adoption or fostering, these men are deciding to go it alone. While there are no reliable figures documenting the number of men starting families on their own (rather than becoming the primary caregiver after their partner leaves or dies), experts agree that it is becoming more common. There was a record number of single-parent adoptions in 2018. The singer Ricky Martin had twin sons via a surrogate, while the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is rumoured to have used the same method to have his eldest three children.</p> <p>\u201cWe are seeing more men wanting to adopt than in recent years,\u201d says Natalie Gamble, a lawyer specialising in fertility and surrogacy law. In addition to the spike in adoptions, Gamble tells me that single-father surrogacy is becoming more prevalent after a long-awaited change in the law enabled single parents who use surrogates to apply for full rights over their child. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/06/campaigners-call-reforms-surrogacy-laws\" title=\"\">Parents </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/06/campaigners-call-reforms-surrogacy-laws\" title=\"\">have to apply to the family courts for a parental order</a>; previously, only couples were able to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Without a parental order, a surrogate could, theoretically, reclaim their child at any moment \u2013 a prospect that terrorised Ian Mucklejohn for many years. In 2001, Mucklejohn, a business owner from Newbury, became Britain\u2019s first surrogate single father. Then 58, he used an egg donor and a surrogate in the US to have triplets \u2013 Piers, Lars and Ian. Although Mucklejohn was their biological father, he would have had no legal recourse to keep the boys if the surrogate, Tina Price, had chosen to claim them. \u201cAll she had to do was get on a plane and come and get them, no matter what she had signed,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"097e953224479364d5e9c42287d6ab058409ff41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/097e953224479364d5e9c42287d6ab058409ff41/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Burrell feeding his son, William, in hospital\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I felt like I knew him already\u2019 ...

(Having initially contested the case, the government conceded that the law discriminated against single parents when the president of the family division of the court declared it incompatible with human rights legislation.) Now, solo parents who have children through a surrogate can apply for a parental order listing them as the child\u2019s only legal parent. Gamble was there the day that the father of \u201cZ\u201d obtained his parental order, the first in the UK to record only a father. \u201cIt felt really monumental,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Thanks to the legal change, more men are considering surrogacy. \u201cThe options are opening up,\u201d Gamble says. \u201cMore British surrogates are willing to be matched with fathers.\u201d Dr Sophie Zadeh of University College London is researching the men who choose to become single fathers, in conjunction with the University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Family Research. She tells me that many men decide to go it alone for the same reason that many women do \u2013 none of their relationships have worked out and they want to have children before they are too old.</p> <p>This was the case for Norton, who separated from his wife in 2009. \u201cI\u2019d always grown up expecting to have children,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the oldest of four and three of my siblings are adopted, so when my marriage broke down without children I decided that adoption was the best way.\u201d But going through the adoption process on his own was difficult \u2013 it is an intrusive process that can take years, and there is no one to share your frustrations with.</p> <p>But not everyone who becomes a single father does so in the wake of a failed relationship. \u201cI always knew, from a very young age, that I wanted to be a dad \u2013 and also that I never wanted to be a biological father,\u201d says 35-year-old Ben Carpenter, a stay-at-home parent from West Yorkshire. \u201cThere were vulnerable children out there and I wanted to adopt them.\u201d Carpenter applied to adoption services aged 21. \u201cI knew it was what I wanted to do. Instantly, I completely found my niche.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next decade, Carpenter adopted five children: Jack, Ruby, Lily, Joseph and Teddy. All have special needs \u2013 Lily is deaf, Ruby is blind, Jack is autistic and Joseph has Down\u2019s syndrome. Teddy died last year, aged two, from complications relating to Cornelia de Lange syndrome. \u201cHe was a wonderful little boy,\u201d Carpenter says. \u201cWe\u2019re all gutted.\u201d They set a place for Teddy at the dinner table this Christmas, as a reminder that he was still part of the family.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There seems to be an assumption that men can\u2019t do it on their own</p> <footer> <cite>Simon Burrell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Being a single dad can be challenging if, like Carpenter, your children have special needs. Carpenter\u2019s mother lives with the family and helps with childcare. Even so, he can end up being pulled in more directions than he can manage at any one time \u2013 he wasn\u2019t able to get to all the children\u2019s nativity plays, because they attend different schools and the schedules clashed \u2013 but he is adamant that his parenting responsibilities are manageable. \u201cI do find time for myself,\u201d he says. In fact, he is considering adopting again. \u201cIt\u2019s so rewarding to see a child \u2013 whose future is, in some cases, so bleak and dark \u2013 flourishing into a child who is thriving and cared for.\u201d</p> <p>Carpenter receives an adoption allowance and child benefit, but still has to budget carefully each month to make ends meet. Indeed, using a surrogate from abroad is an option only for well-off people: the majority of Zadeh\u2019s research cohort who used surrogates had high incomes. \u201cI feel so privileged to have been able to do this,\u201d says 54-year-old Simon Burrell, an educational manager from Brighton. His son, William, was born to a US surrogate late last year. William\u2019s birth was dramatic \u2013 he was born two weeks early, on Boxing Day, meaning that Burrell had a mad rush to get to the US and missed the birth. Meeting his son for the first time felt wonderful, he says, but was less overwhelming than he had expected. \u201cI felt like I knew him already,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have that feeling of being overcome or in tears. I was his only parent, he needed me, and I was already a day and a half late getting there.\u201d</p> <p>As we speak, William is sleeping in another room in Burrell\u2019s rented apartment in California; he is waiting for William\u2019s paperwork to come through so he can bring him home. Burrell estimates that the surrogacy process, which was arranged through the British agency <a href=\"https://www.brilliantbeginnings.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Brilliant Beginnings</a>, cost about \u00a3200,000. Burrell funded it through the sale of his home in London. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair that other men who would also be good fathers can\u2019t do this, but they don\u2019t have the option.\u201d</p> <p>Adoption and fostering are alternatives for which you don\u2019t have to be wealthy, says Carpenter. \u201cYou can be from any walk of life, as long as you go through the process and are deemed to be a suitable person to adopt. There is no set adopter.\u201d In addition, foster parents are eligible for financial allowances that adoptive parents don\u2019t receive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ca6b3d4189f67388df36709574fd9d5a3374ba9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ca6b3d4189f67388df36709574fd9d5a3374ba9/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Carpenter and (from left) his children Joseph, Lily, Ruby and Jack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I knew it was what I wanted to do.

He has been fostering two boys, aged 13 and 10, and their seven-year-old sister since 2017. \u201cThe people going through your fostering application aren\u2019t interested in your sexuality or your marital status. They just want to know that you\u2019ll be a good parent to these kids.\u201d He advises single men who want to foster to get experience of being around children \u2013 Thomas volunteered with the Scout Association.</p> <p>He has taken to fostering with great happiness \u2013 and relative ease. \u201cSometimes I have to pinch myself,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cWe go away for weekends, camping, take the dog for a walk, go for hot chocolate. I think: it\u2019s my job to do this? Someone is going to find me out soon.\u201d He hopes to encourage other single men to consider fostering. \u201cThe door is wide open,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the message I would like to get across.\u201d</p> <p>But not everyone\u2019s experience of fostering as a single father is so positive. James, 39, a business owner from London, applied to become a foster parent in January 2018 after attending a fostering roadshow. \u201cI\u2019d wanted to do it for a while,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have much desire to have kids of my own, because I thought it was better to sort out the kids we already had.\u201d After being approved in November 2019, James was introduced to Carl, the 14-year-old he would be fostering.</p> <p>As a single carer, James expected support from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/fostering\" title=\"\">foster services</a>, but this was not to be the case. \u201cAll the promised support evaporated,\u201d he sighs. It took 10 weeks for James to find Carl a school placement, meaning that he was unable to work. His finances began to unravel. He pleaded for more support from fostering services, to no avail. \u201cI was going to them breaking down in tears.\u201d Eventually, James had to end the placement. \u201cThe last thing I wanted to do was let this kid down, but that\u2019s what ended up happening. It was really upsetting and stressful.\u201d He wishes that the foster services had been more realistic about how much support they could offer. \u201cI\u2019d come to care about the kid; to have to end the placement was horrible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0ca8f0f7c8533a1e004a26ba4961cef0e25d811c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ca8f0f7c8533a1e004a26ba4961cef0e25d811c/0_0_933_1400/667.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth K Thomas, who is a foster father of three\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sometimes I have to pinch myself\u2019 ...

      "bodyText": "The first night Joe Norton brought home his adoptive sons, Tarren and Owen, he considered his new life, then thought: what have I done? \u201cIt\u2019s a monumental decision you\u2019re making, and you\u2019re making it on your own,\u201d says the 54-year-old educational manager from Yorkshire. \u201cThe enormity hit me.\u201d Going from being a single man to the sole carer for two children was tougher than he had expected. There was the misbehaviour, particularly when the boys, who are brothers, began to settle in. (Experts call this period \u201cregression\u201d, but it is usually a sign that children are beginning to relax around their new parents.) He was also stumped by unexpected questions \u2013 what size socks did the boys wear? Norton had no clue what to buy. \u201cYou have an idea what size a T-shirt should be, but socks are a different thing,\u201d he says, chuckling. But it was rewarding, much more so than Norton had hoped or dreamed. Three months after the adoption was completed, in October 2012, Norton took Owen and Tarren \u2013 then aged six and five respectively \u2013 on a break with family friends. On that holiday, the boys started calling him \u201cDad\u201d. \u201cIt was emotional,\u201d Norton says. \u201cIt was all starting to happen.\u201d Norton is one of the growing number of men in the UK who are choosing to become single fathers. Whether through surrogacy, adoption or fostering, these men are deciding to go it alone. While there are no reliable figures documenting the number of men starting families on their own (rather than becoming the primary caregiver after their partner leaves or dies), experts agree that it is becoming more common. There was a record number of single-parent adoptions in 2018. The singer Ricky Martin had twin sons via a surrogate, while the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is rumoured to have used the same method to have his eldest three children. \u201cWe are seeing more men wanting to adopt than in recent years,\u201d says Natalie Gamble, a lawyer specialising in fertility and surrogacy law. In addition to the spike in adoptions, Gamble tells me that single-father surrogacy is becoming more prevalent after a long-awaited change in the law enabled single parents who use surrogates to apply for full rights over their child. \u201cParents have to apply to the family courts for a parental order; previously, only couples were able to do this.\u201d Without a parental order, a surrogate could, theoretically, reclaim their child at any moment \u2013 a prospect that terrorised Ian Mucklejohn for many years. In 2001, Mucklejohn, a business owner from Newbury, became Britain\u2019s first surrogate single father. Then 58, he used an egg donor and a surrogate in the US to have triplets \u2013 Piers, Lars and Ian. Although Mucklejohn was their biological father, he would have had no legal recourse to keep the boys if the surrogate, Tina Price, had chosen to claim them. \u201cAll she had to do was get on a plane and come and get them, no matter what she had signed,\u201d he says. The law changed in January 2019, after Gamble brought to the high court a test case involving a British single father who had had a son, \u201cZ\u201d, via a US surrogate. (Having initially contested the case, the government conceded that the law discriminated against single parents when the president of the family division of the court declared it incompatible with human rights legislation.) Now, solo parents who have children through a surrogate can apply for a parental order listing them as the child\u2019s only legal parent. Gamble was there the day that the father of \u201cZ\u201d obtained his parental order, the first in the UK to record only a father. \u201cIt felt really monumental,\u201d she says. Thanks to the legal change, more men are considering surrogacy. \u201cThe options are opening up,\u201d Gamble says. \u201cMore British surrogates are willing to be matched with fathers.\u201d Dr Sophie Zadeh of University College London is researching the men who choose to become single fathers, in conjunction with the University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Family Research. She tells me that many men decide to go it alone for the same reason that many women do \u2013 none of their relationships have worked out and they want to have children before they are too old. This was the case for Norton, who separated from his wife in 2009. \u201cI\u2019d always grown up expecting to have children,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the oldest of four and three of my siblings are adopted, so when my marriage broke down without children I decided that adoption was the best way.\u201d But going through the adoption process on his own was difficult \u2013 it is an intrusive process that can take years, and there is no one to share your frustrations with. But not everyone who becomes a single father does so in the wake of a failed relationship. \u201cI always knew, from a very young age, that I wanted to be a dad \u2013 and also that I never wanted to be a biological father,\u201d says 35-year-old Ben Carpenter, a stay-at-home parent from West Yorkshire. \u201cThere were vulnerable children out there and I wanted to adopt them.\u201d Carpenter applied to adoption services aged 21. \u201cI knew it was what I wanted to do. Instantly, I completely found my niche.\u201d Over the next decade, Carpenter adopted five children: Jack, Ruby, Lily, Joseph and Teddy. All have special needs \u2013 Lily is deaf, Ruby is blind, Jack is autistic and Joseph has Down\u2019s syndrome. Teddy died last year, aged two, from complications relating to Cornelia de Lange syndrome. \u201cHe was a wonderful little boy,\u201d Carpenter says. \u201cWe\u2019re all gutted.\u201d They set a place for Teddy at the dinner table this Christmas, as a reminder that he was still part of the family. Being a single dad can be challenging if, like Carpenter, your children have special needs. Carpenter\u2019s mother lives with the family and helps with childcare. Even so, he can end up being pulled in more directions than he can manage at any one time \u2013 he wasn\u2019t able to get to all the children\u2019s nativity plays, because they attend different schools and the schedules clashed \u2013 but he is adamant that his parenting responsibilities are manageable. \u201cI do find time for myself,\u201d he says. In fact, he is considering adopting again. \u201cIt\u2019s so rewarding to see a child \u2013 whose future is, in some cases, so bleak and dark \u2013 flourishing into a child who is thriving and cared for.\u201d Carpenter receives an adoption allowance and child benefit, but still has to budget carefully each month to make ends meet. Indeed, using a surrogate from abroad is an option only for well-off people: the majority of Zadeh\u2019s research cohort who used surrogates had high incomes. \u201cI feel so privileged to have been able to do this,\u201d says 54-year-old Simon Burrell, an educational manager from Brighton. His son, William, was born to a US surrogate late last year. William\u2019s birth was dramatic \u2013 he was born two weeks early, on Boxing Day, meaning that Burrell had a mad rush to get to the US and missed the birth. Meeting his son for the first time felt wonderful, he says, but was less overwhelming than he had expected. \u201cI felt like I knew him already,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have that feeling of being overcome or in tears. I was his only parent, he needed me, and I was already a day and a half late getting there.\u201d As we speak, William is sleeping in another room in Burrell\u2019s rented apartment in California; he is waiting for William\u2019s paperwork to come through so he can bring him home. Burrell estimates that the surrogacy process, which was arranged through the British agency Brilliant Beginnings, cost about \u00a3200,000. Burrell funded it through the sale of his home in London. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair that other men who would also be good fathers can\u2019t do this, but they don\u2019t have the option.\u201d Adoption and fostering are alternatives for which you don\u2019t have to be wealthy, says Carpenter. \u201cYou can be from any walk of life, as long as you go through the process and are deemed to be a suitable person to adopt. There is no set adopter.\u201d In addition, foster parents are eligible for financial allowances that adoptive parents don\u2019t receive. \u201cMy own experience of fostering was that they were incredibly open to single fathers,\u201d says Gareth K Thomas, 34, from south Wales. He has been fostering two boys, aged 13 and 10, and their seven-year-old sister since 2017. \u201cThe people going through your fostering application aren\u2019t interested in your sexuality or your marital status. They just want to know that you\u2019ll be a good parent to these kids.\u201d He advises single men who want to foster to get experience of being around children \u2013 Thomas volunteered with the Scout Association. He has taken to fostering with great happiness \u2013 and relative ease. \u201cSometimes I have to pinch myself,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cWe go away for weekends, camping, take the dog for a walk, go for hot chocolate. I think: it\u2019s my job to do this? Someone is going to find me out soon.\u201d He hopes to encourage other single men to consider fostering. \u201cThe door is wide open,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the message I would like to get across.\u201d But not everyone\u2019s experience of fostering as a single father is so positive. James, 39, a business owner from London, applied to become a foster parent in January 2018 after attending a fostering roadshow. \u201cI\u2019d wanted to do it for a while,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have much desire to have kids of my own, because I thought it was better to sort out the kids we already had.\u201d After being approved in November 2019, James was introduced to Carl, the 14-year-old he would be fostering. As a single carer, James expected support from foster services, but this was not to be the case. \u201cAll the promised support evaporated,\u201d he sighs. It took 10 weeks for James to find Carl a school placement, meaning that he was unable to work. His finances began to unravel. He pleaded for more support from fostering services, to no avail. \u201cI was going to them breaking down in tears.\u201d Eventually, James had to end the placement. \u201cThe last thing I wanted to do was let this kid down, but that\u2019s what ended up happening. It was really upsetting and stressful.\u201d He wishes that the foster services had been more realistic about how much support they could offer. \u201cI\u2019d come to care about the kid; to have to end the placement was horrible.\u201d In a society that is set up to regard women as primary caregivers, being a single father can feel alienating. Zadeh says: \u201cMen get questions asking whether it\u2019s Mum\u2019s day off.\u201d Even in relatively progressive California, Burrell gets comments. \u201cThey say: \u2018He\u2019s so cute! How\u2019s the mother?\u2019\u201d Single fathers can also be viewed with suspicion or seen as unfit parents. \u201cPeople assume they can\u2019t parent properly because they are male,\u201d says Zadeh. Her research indicates that fathers are subject to greater scrutiny from healthcare visitors than mothers. \u201cThey\u2019re seen as that bit more unusual,\u201d she says. When Burrell told his friends about his plans to have a child, some questioned whether he was biting off more than he could chew. \u201cWe\u2019re used to the idea of women as single parents, but there seems to be an assumption that men can\u2019t do it on their own,\u201d he says. Worse still is when people allege that single fathers are predators. Social media trolls have accused Carpenter of molesting his children. \u201cThey tell me that they hope I\u2019m arrested for my crimes of abusing children, and that\u2019s the only reason I wanted to adopt. They cannot cope with the fact that a man wants to love and care for children.\u201d But Carpenter emphasises that those people are in a minority. \u201cNine out of 10 times, the feedback is so supportive and wonderful.\u201d Mucklejohn has seen attitudes towards single fathers change since he became a parent. \u201cIn 2001, I was described as selfish, or undertaking a business transaction to get the children,\u201d he says. Although no one writes about the family critically now, those years caused damage \u2013 Mucklejohn\u2019s son Ian struggled to cope with the negative press. \u201cIt made him want to be invisible at school,\u201d Mucklejohn says. \u201cHe kept a very low profile for fear someone would tap his name into a search engine.\u201d As society becomes more accommodating of single-parent families, whether male or female, it is likely we will see more solo fathers on the school run. But there is still a way to go. \u201cWhether, in 50 years, there will be such a societal shift that we see men doing most of the primary caregiving, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d says Zadeh. She points out that statutory maternity leave is up to 52 weeks, whereas statutory paternity leave is up to two weeks. (However, adoption leave is equivalent to maternity leave.) \u201cThese conditions would have to be levelled out before you saw more men taking on non-traditional roles.\u201d About a week after William\u2019s birth, the emotion finally came. Burrell had woken at 7am, fed the baby, made coffee and looked out at the beautiful mountain vista he can see from the window of his rented apartment. \u201cIt hit me,\u201d Burrell says. \u201cI\u2019m his daddy. It\u2019s real. This is how we\u2019re going to be now, until he leaves home. That\u2019s when it finally dawned on me.\u201d He felt his heart expanding with love, and he was calm.

      "body": "<p>At 89, <a href=\"https://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3508-a-eulogy-to-claudia-andujar\">Claudia Andujar </a>still has her work cut out. For five decades she has photographed the Yanomami indigenous people, an Amer-Indian tribe who number 33,000 and live in 192,000 square kilometres of rainforest that straddle the borders of Brazil and Venezuela. Until the early 20th century they had lived almost entirely in isolation from the outside world, but since then disease, deforestation and climate change have taken their toll.</p> <p>The election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has proved a further threat. Vehemently against legislation protecting indigenous lands, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/24/jair-bolsonaro-racist-comment-sparks-outrage-indigenous-groups\">last week the far-right president commented</a>: \u201cIndians are undoubtedly changing \u2026 They are increasingly becoming human beings just like us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI now put all my efforts into the activism, into addressing Brazil\u2019s political situation,\u201d Andujar says as she prepares <a href=\"https://www.fondationcartier.com/en/exhibitions/claudia-andujar-lalutteyanomami\">a retrospective at the Fondation Cartier in Paris</a>, which shows a selection from a personal collection that runs to several thousand photographs. \u201cI no longer take photographs, but use my archive to show how I saw the Yanomami. This present government has no respect for them. They have no understanding of who they are as people.\u201d</p> <p>The changing nature of Andujar\u2019s work is chronicled in the show. Though the earliest images are straight documentary, the artist notes she was always more interested in striking up a human bond with her subjects than in approaching the work with professional detachment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad8912f3460ba23099e9a333874cb59989f397bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad8912f3460ba23099e9a333874cb59989f397bd/0_0_3548_2129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New vision \u2026 a house on the Catrimani River, Roraima, shot on infrared film in 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New vision \u2026 a house on the Catrimani River, Roraima, shot on infrared film in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudia Andujar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI decided very early that I would not photograph if I felt I did not have a connection with the person whose picture I was taking,\u201d she says. \u201cDeveloping an intimacy with the individual and community came first. The photography was always secondary to that.\u201d</p> <p>Immersing herself in the culture of the Yanomami, it soon became clear that she would never represent their worldview through conventional composition. Instead, employing techniques, including double exposure, long exposures, the use of coloured filters or smearing of vaseline on the lens, Andujar started to produce a body of work a lot stranger and more faithful, she says, to the experience of the Yanomami people.</p> <p>A room of the Paris show is dedicated to the shamanic rituals that are a key aspect to Yanomami cosmology. During these ceremonies the tribe believe spirits \u2013 <em>xapiri</em> \u2013 descend on the forest leaving trails of brilliant white light in their wake. Andujar represented this by shaking her camera as she took each photograph of the convulsing, gyrating shamans. One image shows a woman with her face obscured by curling trails of smoky white light dancing across the picture\u2019s surface.</p> <p>In another, a man, naked but for streaks of body paint, lies on the ground near a burning ball of light emitting from an unknown source. A funeral ceremony, in which the deceased is encased in a woven casket hung from a tree, is photographed through an otherworldly orange filter. A group of Yanomami are shown in layered multiples, using a double exposure, a way of reflecting the rhythm, movement and intense noise of the indigenous ceremonies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9e5856e5175d2b0a63d3ed89965713b06a316a1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e5856e5175d2b0a63d3ed89965713b06a316a1f/0_99_2954_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Total immersion \u2026 a young swimmer in the Brazilian state of Roraima, photographed in the early 70s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Total immersion \u2026 a young swimmer in the Brazilian state of Roraima, photographed in the early 70s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudia Andujar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3512-DaviYanomami\">Davi Kopenawa</a>, a Yanomami activist and shaman, first met Andujar in 1977. \u201cIt was quite unusual for a white woman to come, a woman who wasn\u2019t a missionary especially. Claudia took her time to get to know us; she slept in our <em>shabono</em>,\u201d he says, referring to the ring-shaped wooden buildings that the Yanomami live in communally. \u201cWhen the white people invaded our land, they took us by surprise and we weren\u2019t prepared to deal with that first contact. Non-indigenous people wanted us to vanish, they wanted us to die ... It is still a dangerous battlefield out there for us, but to survive we need to confront it. These pictures are part of that. She was able to show them, show us, to the people of the city.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Switzerland in 1931, Andujar was raised in Oradea, a border town that has switched between Romania and Hungary. Her parents separated when she was nine. In 1944, as the German army closed in on the town, her mother took her to Switzerland, leaving her father, Siegfried, behind. He, and his entire extended Jewish family, perished in Auschwitz and Dachau.</p> <p>This, Andujar says, lies behind the affinity she felt with the Yanomami. \u201cI want to help the Yanomami to survive like my family did not.

      "bodyText": "At 89, Claudia Andujar still has her work cut out. For five decades she has photographed the Yanomami indigenous people, an Amer-Indian tribe who number 33,000 and live in 192,000 square kilometres of rainforest that straddle the borders of Brazil and Venezuela. Until the early 20th century they had lived almost entirely in isolation from the outside world, but since then disease, deforestation and climate change have taken their toll. The election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has proved a further threat. Vehemently against legislation protecting indigenous lands, last week the far-right president commented: \u201cIndians are undoubtedly changing \u2026 They are increasingly becoming human beings just like us.\u201d \u201cI now put all my efforts into the activism, into addressing Brazil\u2019s political situation,\u201d Andujar says as she prepares a retrospective at the Fondation Cartier in Paris, which shows a selection from a personal collection that runs to several thousand photographs. \u201cI no longer take photographs, but use my archive to show how I saw the Yanomami. This present government has no respect for them. They have no understanding of who they are as people.\u201d The changing nature of Andujar\u2019s work is chronicled in the show. Though the earliest images are straight documentary, the artist notes she was always more interested in striking up a human bond with her subjects than in approaching the work with professional detachment. \u201cI decided very early that I would not photograph if I felt I did not have a connection with the person whose picture I was taking,\u201d she says. \u201cDeveloping an intimacy with the individual and community came first. The photography was always secondary to that.\u201d Immersing herself in the culture of the Yanomami, it soon became clear that she would never represent their worldview through conventional composition. Instead, employing techniques, including double exposure, long exposures, the use of coloured filters or smearing of vaseline on the lens, Andujar started to produce a body of work a lot stranger and more faithful, she says, to the experience of the Yanomami people. A room of the Paris show is dedicated to the shamanic rituals that are a key aspect to Yanomami cosmology. During these ceremonies the tribe believe spirits \u2013 xapiri \u2013 descend on the forest leaving trails of brilliant white light in their wake. Andujar represented this by shaking her camera as she took each photograph of the convulsing, gyrating shamans. One image shows a woman with her face obscured by curling trails of smoky white light dancing across the picture\u2019s surface. In another, a man, naked but for streaks of body paint, lies on the ground near a burning ball of light emitting from an unknown source. A funeral ceremony, in which the deceased is encased in a woven casket hung from a tree, is photographed through an otherworldly orange filter. A group of Yanomami are shown in layered multiples, using a double exposure, a way of reflecting the rhythm, movement and intense noise of the indigenous ceremonies. Davi Kopenawa, a Yanomami activist and shaman, first met Andujar in 1977. \u201cIt was quite unusual for a white woman to come, a woman who wasn\u2019t a missionary especially. Claudia took her time to get to know us; she slept in our shabono,\u201d he says, referring to the ring-shaped wooden buildings that the Yanomami live in communally. \u201cWhen the white people invaded our land, they took us by surprise and we weren\u2019t prepared to deal with that first contact. Non-indigenous people wanted us to vanish, they wanted us to die ... It is still a dangerous battlefield out there for us, but to survive we need to confront it. These pictures are part of that. She was able to show them, show us, to the people of the city.\u201d Born in Switzerland in 1931, Andujar was raised in Oradea, a border town that has switched between Romania and Hungary. Her parents separated when she was nine. In 1944, as the German army closed in on the town, her mother took her to Switzerland, leaving her father, Siegfried, behind. He, and his entire extended Jewish family, perished in Auschwitz and Dachau. This, Andujar says, lies behind the affinity she felt with the Yanomami. \u201cI want to help the Yanomami to survive like my family did not. I think my work is dependent on the suffering of my childhood. My friends from school all died in Auschwitz. Everyone. Nobody, nobody survived.\u201d Kopenawa agrees Andujar\u2019s childhood holds the key to her relationship with the Yanomami. \u201cWhen the people of the world waged war against each other, Claudia suffered a lot. But that gave her the experience that is required to take images of the Yanomami.\u201d After the war, Andujar moved first to New York, before settling in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1955. \u201cI was conscious that I was looking for something that was missing from my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI never forced the relationship with the Yanomami, but there was something within me that was searching for a connection or purpose that they provided.\u201d The longest of her repeated trips living with the tribe was over a year.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is expected to announce hundreds of redundancies as staff brace themselves for heavy cuts to high-profile news programmes and an increasingly centralised system for producing the corporation\u2019s journalism. In an email to staff, Fran Unsworth, the head of news, said she would use an all-staff meeting on Wednesday to explain how the corporation plans to put into action the BBC News mission statement of being \u201cdistinctive, trusted, engaging everyone, every day\u201d. In reality, what most BBC employees are concerned about is whether their job is facing the axe in an effort to save tens of millions of pounds, with the National Union of Journalists already gearing up for a battle with management over redundancies. At the heart of the proposals is a plan to centralise the production of the corporation\u2019s reporting. Rather than having teams of journalists focused on individual programmes \u2013 such as the soon-to-be-axed Victoria Derbyshire show \u2013 there will be more pooling of reporters. In theory this will reduce duplication of effort, with groups of journalists working on investigations and original reporting before pushing it out across television, radio, and online. The BBC argues that the award-winning journalism, of shows such as Victoria Derbyshire\u2019s can be produced for multiple outlets without the expense of presenting in the format of a standalone news outlet. Many BBC reporters fear this proposed system could become hard to operate in practice, given the different demands of outlets such as the Today programme and the BBC News website. There are also concerns that niche stories could no longer be covered as part of the push to unify more of the corporation\u2019s news output. The BBC declined to comment on the announcement and would not confirm speculation that hundreds of jobs cuts are planned.

Last week, Tony Hall, the director general, announced he was stepping down to allow a successor to be appointed before the BBC begins negotiations with the government over the rate it can charge for the licence fee from 2022. Hall has also criticised the corporation for contributing to a toxic discourse around political journalism, which he said was aimed at trying to \u201ccatch out\u201d politicians. Speaking at Edelman Trust Barometer 2020 event on Tuesday, he said: \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in the long-form political interview where you can explore at length, not in soundbites, the real policy decisions that politicians are making. Exploring those sort of nuances is an important part of what we should do.\u201d In a separate development, on Tuesday the BBC told production staff who make non-news or sport programmes for the corporation\u2019s national radio stations that about 60 redundancies were on the way. \u201cRising costs mean we shall end this year with a deficit of around a million pounds,\u201d said Graham Ellis, the BBC\u2019s controller of radio production, warning that his unit faced a decline in the \u201cnumber and value of commissions\u201d from the corporation\u2019s national radio stations over the coming years and would have to cut a substantial proportion of the corporation\u2019s in-house production staff. He said that while management would do its utmost to avoid compulsory redundancies, they could not be ruled out if not enough people chose to take a voluntary payout. He also said he wanted to create 40 new roles for content producers, suggesting an increased focus on social media output, although staff raised concerns that these would be paid less than traditional radio-producing jobs. Ellis said he was hoping podcasts could provide a way of increasing the amount of money flowing to his division of the BBC, which competes with external independent production companies to make BBC programmes. \u201cThis is a tough message on which to start 2020 but I\u2019m pleased to say we are also seeing reinvestment in some programmes from next year, especially documentaries and drama,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019ll mean better programme budgets which help to protect staff time on programmes. We\u2019re also investing in a development unit to capitalise on the popularity of podcasts which offer us an opportunity to grow new business.\u201d",

They are just one aspect of a political campaign, and the messages that work on the platform do not necessarily reflect more than \u201cwhat works on Facebook\u201d. The data that Facebook provides through its API is also limited. While campaigns may consider dozens of factors when deciding what group of voters to target with an ad, Facebook only provides researchers and journalists with broad demographic and geographic information about the age and gender group within which the ad performed best (ie that an ad received 17% of its impressions from men aged 45-54 and 22% of its impressions in Texas).</p> <p>Facebook also only provides spending and impression data for each ad as a range. According to Facebook\u2019s data, 158,909 (or 72%) of the ads that Trump\u2019s campaign ran in 2019 were seen by between zero and 999 Facebook users. This imprecise range means that in aggregate those ads could have garnered anywhere from 0 to 158m impressions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=How%20many%20people%20saw%20Trump\u2019s%20Facebook%20ads%3F%20&amp;standfirst=The%20vast%20majority%20of%20Trump\u2019s%20ads%20were%20seen%20by%20a%20tiny%20audience%20%E2%80%93%20but%20some%20went%20viral&amp;number-1=218k&amp;field-1=Total%20number%20of%20ads%20launched%20in%202019&amp;number-2=159k&amp;field-2=Ads%20that%20were%20seen%20fewer%20than%201000%20times&amp;number-3=100&amp;field-3=Ads%20that%20were%20seem%20more%20than%201m%20times&amp;number-4=633m%20-%201.3bn&amp;field-4=Impressions%20gained%20by%20all%20of%20Trump\u2019s%20ads%20in%202019&amp;number-5=&amp;field-5=&amp;number-6=&amp;field-6=&amp;number-7=&amp;field-7=&amp;number-8=&amp;field-8=\" data-alt=\"Statistics about Trump's 2019 Facebook campaign\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/numbered-list/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=How%20many%20people%20saw%20Trump\u2019s%20Facebook%20ads%3F%20&standfirst=The%20vast%20majority%20of%20Trump\u2019s%20ads%20were%20seen%20by%20a%20tiny%20audience%20%E2%80%93%20but%20some%20went%20viral&number-1=218k&field-1=Total%20number%20of%20ads%20launched%20in%202019&number-2=159k&field-2=Ads%20that%20were%20seen%20fewer%20than%201000%20times&number-3=100&field-3=Ads%20that%20were%20seem%20more%20than%201m%20times&number-4=633m%20-%201.3bn&field-4=Impressions%20gained%20by%20all%20of%20Trump\u2019s%20ads%20in%202019&number-5=&field-5=&number-6=&field-6=&number-7=&field-7=&number-8=&field-8=\">Statistics about Trump's 2019 Facebook campaign</a> </figure>  <p>Facebook has also made it difficult to analyze the \u201ccreative\u201d element in political ads.

Instead, as with the \u201cofficial approval poll\u201d ad, it ran hundreds of minor variations of a smaller number of distinct ads. We found 1,840 distinct versions of ad copy, of which the campaign ran anywhere from one to more than 3,000 versions. The variations within a specific tranche of ads are visible in some cases (ie when there are differences in the photo or video accompanying the ad copy) but not others (ie if the only difference is based on the campaign\u2019s targeting choices).</p> <p>While Trump ran ads on Facebook throughout the year, there was a marked increase as the impeachment inquiry ramped up in the fall. The campaign\u2019s single largest day of Facebook ad spending ($317,362) was Friday 27 September \u2013 the day after the Ukraine whistleblower\u2019s complaint was released. The second and third most expensive days were 20 and 21 December \u2013 the Friday and Saturday after he was impeached by the House of Representatives. The fourth was 14 November, the day after the impeachment hearings began in the House.</p> <h2>Issues and enemies</h2> <p>If you tried to deduce the issues of most importance to American voters from the president\u2019s Facebook ads, you would think that the number one concern to voters was not healthcare (as poll after poll shows), but<strong> </strong>the supposed malfeasances of the mainstream media. The media and its \u201cfake news\u201d are mentioned in 18.25% of the Trump\u2019s 2019 ads \u2013 more than any other issue. Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2013 immigration and a border wall \u2013 comes second, followed by impeachment, the economy, gun rights and the supreme court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2020-01-28T23:57:19/embed.html\" data-alt=\"A graph showing the number of ads that reference various issues\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2020-01-28T23:57:19/embed.html\">A graph showing the number of ads that reference various issues</a> </figure>  <p>Actual policy proposals and initiatives appear far less frequently, though the campaign did run very small tranches of ads about the First Step Act, paid family leave, \u201chealth care choice\u201d, and, interestingly, animal cruelty.

An <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=444903682763456\">ad</a> that ran after the impeachment inquiry began used images of Joseph Stalin, Fidel Castro and members of the fringe group the Revolutionary Communist party burning an American flag to suggest that Democratic candidates were \u201cdestroying American values\u201d. \u201cOnly one man can stop this chaos,\u201d the ad announces, before Trump appears under blue skies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bdeb71e71c8af63658e9b9a1efd9f403526c70da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdeb71e71c8af63658e9b9a1efd9f403526c70da/0_6_1129_558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump campaign Facebook ads about immigration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"494\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump campaign ads about immigration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Click, click, click</h2> <p>But it\u2019s not just doom, gloom and fearmongering.

These ads may not be getting under the skin of Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals, but they appear to be helping to drive the re-election campaign\u2019s substantial fundraising.</p> <p>Facebook ads are designed to induce online actions, and almost all of the Trump campaign\u2019s ads are clearly intended to produce one of four: donating money, attending a rally, buying campaign merchandise, or providing the campaign with a user\u2019s email address or mobile phone number.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2020-01-29T00:12:37/embed.html\" data-alt=\"A graph showing the desired outcome for Trump's Facebook ads\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2020-01-29T00:12:37/embed.html\">A graph showing the desired outcome for Trump's Facebook ads</a> </figure>  <p>To achieve these ends, the campaign appears to be using some of the most basic and click-inducing marketing tricks, which have little if anything to do with presidential politics.</p> <p>Of those ads that seek to garner contact information, for example, huge numbers involve a contest of some kind. The Trump campaign ran 5,551 Facebook ads promoting contests to win two signed hats \u2013 the \u201cone millionth Make America Great Again hat\u201d and the \u201cfirst Keep America Great hat\u201d. Other contests include meals with Trump at various campaign stops.</p> <p>The campaign also ran more than 30,000 ads asking supporters to sign various \u201ccards\u201d for the Trump family \u2013 for Donald\u2019s birthday, for Melania\u2019s birthday, for Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, Thanksgiving, and the new year.</p> <p>Surveys similar to the \u201cOfficial Approval Poll\u201d were also a common form of data harvesting, with users encouraged to click on a wide range of simplistic but apparently appealing questions:</p> <ul> <li><p>WILL YOU CHOOSE TRUMP OR A DEM IN 2020?</p></li> <li><p>TRUMP NY TIMES ACCOUNTABILITY SURVEY</p></li> <li><p>TRUMP CENSORSHIP SURVEY</p></li> <li><p>SHOULD TRUMP BE IMPEACHED?

At various times throughout the year, the campaign has run ads promising that donations would be \u201cdouble-matched\u201d, \u201ctriple-matched\u201d, \u201cquadruple matched\u201d, and even \u201c5x-matched\u201d. Frequent references to \u201cdeadlines\u201d bear no relationship to the actual Federal Election Commission\u2019s reporting deadlines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fc760449bef1a8a165d16bc141b3c6e5f9fe3d914%3Fcrop%3D1_2_546_515&amp;left-caption=A%20Trump%20ad%20promises%20%22triple-matched%22%20donations.%20Source%3A%20Facebook&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fe08596c68681cb94149ac2d7157b66a106f8eaf6%3Fcrop%3D0_0_408_412&amp;right-caption=Another%20ad%20promises%20quintuple%20matching.%20Source%3A%20Facebook&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Examples of Trump ads urging his supporters to donate money to his campaign\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fc760449bef1a8a165d16bc141b3c6e5f9fe3d914%3Fcrop%3D1_2_546_515&left-caption=A%20Trump%20ad%20promises%20%22triple-matched%22%20donations.%20Source%3A%20Facebook&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fe08596c68681cb94149ac2d7157b66a106f8eaf6%3Fcrop%3D0_0_408_412&right-caption=Another%20ad%20promises%20quintuple%20matching.%20Source%3A%20Facebook&always-place-captions-below=false\">Examples of Trump ads urging his supporters to donate money to his campaign</a> <figcaption>Examples of Trump ads urging his supporters to donate money to his campaign</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another strategy for gathering emails is an appeal from Trump to \u201cadd your name\u201d to various petitions or lists, often with the message that Trump is planning to read the list, and \u201che\u2019ll be looking for your name\u201d.</p> <p>The more emails and phone numbers the Trump campaigns gathers, the less it will have to rely on Facebook to reach these voters.</p> <h2>A sign for the future?</h2> <p>The limited data made available by Facebook makes it impossible to tell just how sophisticated the targeting of Trump\u2019s ads is.</p> <p>But one small tranche of ads launched at the very end of 2019 could provide a preview of targeted attack campaigning. Between 22 December and 29 December, the Trump campaign ran video ads targeting 10 members of the House of Representatives by name \u2013 exclusively within their home states (and probably within their congressional districts). All 10 are Democrats first elected in 2018, and all represent districts that voted for Trump in 2016. The message: your representative\u2019s vote for impeachment is \u201cnullifying your vote\u201d.</p> <p>The campaign\u2019s investment in the ads was relatively small \u2013 around $20,000. Still, in each of the 10 congressional districts they were seen by at least 20,000 people \u2013 far greater than the margin of victory in each representative\u2019s 2018 election.</p> <h2>Will Facebook make the difference?</h2> <p>The contrast between Trump\u2019s Facebook ads and those of the Democratic candidates is stark. Healthcare, climate change, college affordability and other bread-and-butter issues for Democratic voters dominate Democrats\u2019 messaging \u2013 which is often designed to persuade rather than inflame.</p> <p>The candidate whose Facebook campaign could rival Trump\u2019s is the former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg. After entering the race in late November, the billionaire immediately invested in a massive campaign on the platform, spending more than $6m on 16,260 ads \u2013 and racking up more impressions (more than 500m) than his primary rivals garnered over an entire year of campaigning.</p> <p>Bloomberg\u2019s campaign appears to be mimicking some aspects of Trump\u2019s campaign, running hundreds of minor variations on similar ads and aiming to inflame viewers\u2019 anger with negative ads about Trump. In January, he even started running a tranche of ads featuring cute, imperiled animals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"12a393c7c48f679c7b65577f2a9ca7237a9a1409\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12a393c7c48f679c7b65577f2a9ca7237a9a1409/3_3_870_435/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Bloomberg is also running Facebook ads about imperiled and adorable animals.\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Bloomberg is also running Facebook ads about imperiled and adorable animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether these tricks will translate into victory remains to be seen. But the idea that Trump\u2019s Facebook ads were determinant in 2016 was recently endorsed by the executive who oversaw Facebook\u2019s ad business at the time, Andrew Bosworth.</p> <p>\u201cWas Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected?\u201d he wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/facebook-andrew-bosworth-memo.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\">leaked memo</a>. \u201cI think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks.

      "bodyText": "As the Democratic candidates for president spent 2019 battling each other in early voting states, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign built a sophisticated social media machine to communicate with conservative voters, grow its email list and fine-tune its messaging. Over the course of 2019, the Trump campaign spent nearly $20m on more than 218,000 different Facebook ads, a new Guardian analysis shows. Among the ads were some of the images and videos that made front-page news for their xenophobic, fear-mongering, vitriolic and outright false rhetoric. But the campaign also ran a decidedly mundane social media campaign featuring classic marketing ploys designed to harvest user data. Considering the fact that the campaign has run these ads \u2013 which are largely substance-free and appear designed to maximize engagement with simple requests \u2013 over and over again, they were probably very effective. Trump\u2019s prowess on Facebook has struck fear in the hearts of Democrats. The architect of his 2016 digital campaign, Brad Parscale, boasted of the sophistication of his Facebook operation, and was promoted to campaign manager for 2020. \u201cThe campaign is all about data collection,\u201d Parscale told the Guardian. \u201cIf we touch you digitally, we want to know who you are and how you think and get you into our databases so that we can model off it and relearn and understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d In order to understand how Trump is communicating with Americans on Facebook in the 2020 election cycle, the Guardian built a database of all 218,100 campaign ads launched by the Trump campaign in 2019, using the Facebook political ad archive application programming interface, or API. The analysis is the most comprehensive of the Trump re-election campaign\u2019s Facebook advertising to date. On Facebook, Trump is vastly outspending his Democratic rivals. The top-spending Democratic candidate, Tom Steyer, spent $16.8m on just 12,704 ads on the platform over the course of the year. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg came closest to matching Trump\u2019s volume of advertisements, with 74,286 distinct ads. Of the hundreds of thousands of Facebook ads the Trump campaign ran in 2019, the most successful could reasonably be described as the most boring. \u201cTAKE THE OFFICIAL APPROVAL POLL!\u201d reads the ad copy, which sits above a portrait of Trump. \u201cPlease take the Official Trump Approval Poll before 11:59 PM TONIGHT to have your vote counted in the official results.\u201d The \u201cOfficial Approval Poll\u201d ads send Trump supporters to a \u201cjob performance survey\u201d designed to collect email addresses. This particular format \u2013 two sentences of copy atop one of a handful of portraits of Trump \u2013 garnered at least 48.9m \u201cimpressions\u201d, a metric that refers to the number of times an ad is shown to users. The campaign launched hundreds of versions of the ad every few days \u2013 3,578 total \u2013 between October and December, the \u201c11:59 PM TONIGHT\u201d deadline notwithstanding. Any analysis of Facebook ads is limited. They are just one aspect of a political campaign, and the messages that work on the platform do not necessarily reflect more than \u201cwhat works on Facebook\u201d. The data that Facebook provides through its API is also limited. While campaigns may consider dozens of factors when deciding what group of voters to target with an ad, Facebook only provides researchers and journalists with broad demographic and geographic information about the age and gender group within which the ad performed best (ie that an ad received 17% of its impressions from men aged 45-54 and 22% of its impressions in Texas). Facebook also only provides spending and impression data for each ad as a range. According to Facebook\u2019s data, 158,909 (or 72%) of the ads that Trump\u2019s campaign ran in 2019 were seen by between zero and 999 Facebook users. This imprecise range means that in aggregate those ads could have garnered anywhere from 0 to 158m impressions. Facebook has also made it difficult to analyze the \u201ccreative\u201d element in political ads. Facebook ads are constructed like Facebook posts that a normal user might publish, with a block of text (the \u201ccopy\u201d) above a photo or video and link to another page. The Facebook API allowed us to download the ad copy for all 218,100 Trump ads, but not the photos or videos. These can only be viewed through individual URLs, which it provides in a format that requires the use of an \u201caccess token\u201d. Scraping the creative from 218,100 URLs was beyond our technical capacity. Still, the analysis provides new insight into what messaging the Trump campaign chose to invest in and what makes Trump voters tick \u2013 and click. A year of Facebook ads The Trump campaign spent $19.4m on 218,100 different Facebook ads in 2019, which were seen between 633m and 1.3bn times. The campaign did not come up with 218,100 completely different messages . Instead, as with the \u201cofficial approval poll\u201d ad, it ran hundreds of minor variations of a smaller number of distinct ads. We found 1,840 distinct versions of ad copy, of which the campaign ran anywhere from one to more than 3,000 versions. The variations within a specific tranche of ads are visible in some cases (ie when there are differences in the photo or video accompanying the ad copy) but not others (ie if the only difference is based on the campaign\u2019s targeting choices). While Trump ran ads on Facebook throughout the year, there was a marked increase as the impeachment inquiry ramped up in the fall. The campaign\u2019s single largest day of Facebook ad spending ($317,362) was Friday 27 September \u2013 the day after the Ukraine whistleblower\u2019s complaint was released. The second and third most expensive days were 20 and 21 December \u2013 the Friday and Saturday after he was impeached by the House of Representatives. The fourth was 14 November, the day after the impeachment hearings began in the House. Issues and enemies If you tried to deduce the issues of most importance to American voters from the president\u2019s Facebook ads, you would think that the number one concern to voters was not healthcare (as poll after poll shows), but the supposed malfeasances of the mainstream media. The media and its \u201cfake news\u201d are mentioned in 18.25% of the Trump\u2019s 2019 ads \u2013 more than any other issue. Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2013 immigration and a border wall \u2013 comes second, followed by impeachment, the economy, gun rights and the supreme court. Actual policy proposals and initiatives appear far less frequently, though the campaign did run very small tranches of ads about the First Step Act, paid family leave, \u201chealth care choice\u201d, and, interestingly, animal cruelty. Not a single ad mentioned the climate crisis or the environment. Political enemies and grievances are a common feature of Trump ads. The campaign ran 10 times as many ads that mention the phrase \u201cwitch hunt\u201d as ads that mention terrorism, and nearly as many ads warning against \u201csocialism\u201d as ads about his own plans for trade or the economy. Many ads also single out political rivals by name, with the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, being the most commonly cited (and attacked), followed by the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer; chairman of the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff; and frequent rightwing bogey-women: the US representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar. Relatively few of Trump\u2019s ads mention his potential 2020 Democratic opponents, though Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Beto O\u2019Rourke were all mentioned in some ads by name. Warren, who is referred to by two different spellings of \u201cPocahontas\u201d, was mentioned the most, and the earliest. Americans may have grown used to Trump\u2019s coarse language on Twitter and at his rallies, and his campaign has injected significant doses of his signature invective into his Facebook advertisements. In addition to slurring Warren as \u201cPocahontas\u201d or \u201cPocohontas\u201d, he refers to Sanders as \u201cCrazy Bernie\u201d and Biden as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d. Pelosi is frequently called \u201ca liar and a fraud\u201d; Schiff is \u201cLittle Adam Schiff\u201d or \u201cSchifty-Schiff\u201d; the Democratic congressman Al Green, who was an early advocate for impeaching Trump, is \u201cLow-IQ Al Green\u201d; and congressional Democrats in general are the \u201cDo-Nothing Democrat Savages\u201d. Many video ads feature voiceovers from Trump warning of frightening if absurd eventualities, such as one in which he claims the Democrats are \u201copenly encouraging millions of illegal aliens\u201d to \u201cdestroy our nation\u201d. At times, Trump\u2019s voiceovers border on incoherent: \u201cThey have these witch-hunts, they have all nonsense, and you know what, people are wise to it, and that\u2019s why our poll numbers are so high,\u201d he says in one video. Ads about immigration use especially dark rhetoric and imagery, stoking fear of \u201ccaravan after caravan\u201d of migrants or urging voters to vote yes or no on whether to \u201cdeport illegals\u201d. An ad that ran after the impeachment inquiry began used images of Joseph Stalin, Fidel Castro and members of the fringe group the Revolutionary Communist party burning an American flag to suggest that Democratic candidates were \u201cdestroying American values\u201d. \u201cOnly one man can stop this chaos,\u201d the ad announces, before Trump appears under blue skies. Click, click, click But it\u2019s not just doom, gloom and fearmongering. Many of Trump\u2019s ads are the kind of cheerful, patriotic marketing that one would expect from a discount furniture showroom\u2019s Fourth of July sale. These ads may not be getting under the skin of Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals, but they appear to be helping to drive the re-election campaign\u2019s substantial fundraising. Facebook ads are designed to induce online actions, and almost all of the Trump campaign\u2019s ads are clearly intended to produce one of four: donating money, attending a rally, buying campaign merchandise, or providing the campaign with a user\u2019s email address or mobile phone number. To achieve these ends, the campaign appears to be using some of the most basic and click-inducing marketing tricks, which have little if anything to do with presidential politics. Of those ads that seek to garner contact information, for example, huge numbers involve a contest of some kind. The Trump campaign ran 5,551 Facebook ads promoting contests to win two signed hats \u2013 the \u201cone millionth Make America Great Again hat\u201d and the \u201cfirst Keep America Great hat\u201d. Other contests include meals with Trump at various campaign stops. The campaign also ran more than 30,000 ads asking supporters to sign various \u201ccards\u201d for the Trump family \u2013 for Donald\u2019s birthday, for Melania\u2019s birthday, for Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, Thanksgiving, and the new year. Surveys similar to the \u201cOfficial Approval Poll\u201d were also a common form of data harvesting, with users encouraged to click on a wide range of simplistic but apparently appealing questions: WILL YOU CHOOSE TRUMP OR A DEM IN 2020? TRUMP NY TIMES ACCOUNTABILITY SURVEY TRUMP CENSORSHIP SURVEY SHOULD TRUMP BE IMPEACHED? YES OR NO? SECURE THE BORDER? YES or NO? PRESIDENT TRUMP SOCIALISM POLL IS THE MEDIA FAIR TO THE PRESIDENT? The political campaign version of an irresistible BuzzFeed quiz, the surveys take users to a form where they must enter their email addresses or mobile phone numbers to record a response. Ads urging donations use language to inspire a sense of urgency \u2013 and frequently contain promises that donations will be \u201cmatched\u201d. At various times throughout the year, the campaign has run ads promising that donations would be \u201cdouble-matched\u201d, \u201ctriple-matched\u201d, \u201cquadruple matched\u201d, and even \u201c5x-matched\u201d. Frequent references to \u201cdeadlines\u201d bear no relationship to the actual Federal Election Commission\u2019s reporting deadlines. Another strategy for gathering emails is an appeal from Trump to \u201cadd your name\u201d to various petitions or lists, often with the message that Trump is planning to read the list, and \u201che\u2019ll be looking for your name\u201d. The more emails and phone numbers the Trump campaigns gathers, the less it will have to rely on Facebook to reach these voters. A sign for the future? The limited data made available by Facebook makes it impossible to tell just how sophisticated the targeting of Trump\u2019s ads is. But one small tranche of ads launched at the very end of 2019 could provide a preview of targeted attack campaigning. Between 22 December and 29 December, the Trump campaign ran video ads targeting 10 members of the House of Representatives by name \u2013 exclusively within their home states (and probably within their congressional districts). All 10 are Democrats first elected in 2018, and all represent districts that voted for Trump in 2016. The message: your representative\u2019s vote for impeachment is \u201cnullifying your vote\u201d. The campaign\u2019s investment in the ads was relatively small \u2013 around $20,000. Still, in each of the 10 congressional districts they were seen by at least 20,000 people \u2013 far greater than the margin of victory in each representative\u2019s 2018 election. Will Facebook make the difference? The contrast between Trump\u2019s Facebook ads and those of the Democratic candidates is stark. Healthcare, climate change, college affordability and other bread-and-butter issues for Democratic voters dominate Democrats\u2019 messaging \u2013 which is often designed to persuade rather than inflame. The candidate whose Facebook campaign could rival Trump\u2019s is the former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg. After entering the race in late November, the billionaire immediately invested in a massive campaign on the platform, spending more than $6m on 16,260 ads \u2013 and racking up more impressions (more than 500m) than his primary rivals garnered over an entire year of campaigning. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign appears to be mimicking some aspects of Trump\u2019s campaign, running hundreds of minor variations on similar ads and aiming to inflame viewers\u2019 anger with negative ads about Trump. In January, he even started running a tranche of ads featuring cute, imperiled animals. Whether these tricks will translate into victory remains to be seen. But the idea that Trump\u2019s Facebook ads were determinant in 2016 was recently endorsed by the executive who oversaw Facebook\u2019s ad business at the time, Andrew Bosworth. \u201cWas Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected?\u201d he wrote in a leaked memo. \u201cI think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn\u2019t get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I\u2019ve ever seen from any advertiser.

      "body": "<p>For environmentally minded consumers, the news is hard to swallow: almond milk is not healthy for the planet and the popular milk substitute is especially hard on bees. Our recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/07/honeybees-deaths-almonds-hives-aoe\">investigation</a> into the connection between<strong> </strong>California\u2019s industrialized almond industry and a record 50bn commercial bee deaths created quite a buzz. The widely read story prompted one primary response from readers: \u201cWhat should we be drinking instead?\u201d</p> <p>This is a thorny question, and food sustainability experts are reluctant to single out any one plant milk as best because all have pros and cons.</p> <p>But we\u2019re going to try.</p> <p>One thing is clear. All milk alternatives are far better for the planet than dairy. A 2018 <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987\">study</a> by researchers at the University of Oxford showed that producing a glass of dairy milk results in almost three times more greenhouse gas emissions than any plant-based milk and it consumes nine times more land than any of the milk alternatives. (Land is required to pasture the cows and grow their feed, which the animals belch out in the form of methane.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fadf53e43e8302dc8c377a3cf605c3566f2bf331\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fadf53e43e8302dc8c377a3cf605c3566f2bf331/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plant-based milk is better for the planet than dairy, but it can have a dark side.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plant-based milk is better for the planet than dairy, but it can have a dark side.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prostock-studio/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plant milks can, nevertheless, have a dark side, as when any crop is produced in mass quantities. It\u2019s important to consider not just whether they are grown using organic methods. Other factors include how the farming of the crop affects people and native habitats in developing countries, the carbon footprint and water use. And while each product has its trade-offs, some plant milks are more sustainable than others.</p> <p>Based on interviews with experts, here is a an environmental ranking of plant milks, from the disappointingly sour to the sustainably sweet.</p> <h2>Coconut: \u2018An absolute tragedy\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01edccd8eef1265f68efe4b743f4055cef991d97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01edccd8eef1265f68efe4b743f4055cef991d97/0_0_2549_1699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Global demand for coconut milk has led to deforestation and exploitation of workers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global demand for coconut milk has led to deforestation and exploitation of workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riau Images/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coconut has a reputation as exotic and healthy, but for poor regions in the Philippines, Indonesia and India, where pickers are often paid less than a dollar a day, the palm groves are no paradise.</p> <p>Because coconut trees only grow in tropical climates, the pressure to meet global demand is causing exploitation of workers and destruction of rainforests. \u201cCoconut is an absolute tragedy and it makes me really sad,\u201d Isaac Emery,<strong> </strong>a food sustainability consultant. \u201cI love cooking with coconut milk but I don\u2019t feel good about buying coconut products. Farmers in Indonesia should be growing food to feed their families instead of meeting international demands.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>To avoid supporting unsustainable practices, choose coconut products that are certified Fair Trade.</p> <h2>Almond: bad for bees</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd35a1652bedf1d6cd0685d4e1e8b8f0658553e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd35a1652bedf1d6cd0685d4e1e8b8f0658553e7/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Almond farming is placing unsustainable pressure on bees and beekeepers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Almond farming is placing unsustainable pressure on bees and beekeepers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Towfiqu Photography/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While almond trees occupy smaller amounts of farmland compared with other crops grown for milk, this benefit is overshadowed by the negative impacts of almond farming in the US. Concentrated almost entirely in California\u2019s arid Central Valley, almonds are the largest specialty crop in the US and the orchards cover a region the size of Delaware.</p> <p>Almonds require more water than any other dairy alternative, consuming 130 pints of water to produce a single glass of almond milk, according to the Oxford study. Satisfying continual demands for larger almond crops is also placing unsustainable pressures on US commercial beekeepers. Nearly 70% of commercial bees in the US are drafted every spring to pollinate almonds. Last year, a record number \u2013over one-third of them\u2013 died by season\u2019s end as a result of these pressures and other environmental threats. </p> <h2>Rice: a water-guzzler</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f99c752a41ac9acda76b8366d2be67eba2d27a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f99c752a41ac9acda76b8366d2be67eba2d27a6/0_821_3410_2046/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Research has found rice milk produced more greenhouse gas than any other plant milk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Research has found rice milk produced more greenhouse gas than any other plant milk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: &quot;Schindler, Martina&quot;/Getty Images/StockFood</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although rice milk is ubiquitous as an inexpensive and widely available dairy alternative, it offers little in the way of nutrition or environmental benefits compared with other choices.</p> <p>Rice is a water hog, according to the Oxford study, plus it produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other plant milk. Bacteria breeding in rice paddies pump methane into the atmosphere and large amounts of fertilizer pollute waterways.</p> <h2>Hazelnut: on the up</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63ec85e033918a2c9180b0109ff626c644e1a2dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63ec85e033918a2c9180b0109ff626c644e1a2dc/0_0_5989_3794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hazelnuts are a rising star in the plant-based milk arena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hazelnuts are a rising star in the plant-based milk arena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roman Borovikov/EyeEm/Getty Images/EyeEm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For consumers who want the nutritiousness and tastiness of a nut milk but without the environmental impacts of almond farming, the hazelnut is a rising star.<strong> </strong>Like all nuts, hazelnuts grow on trees that pull carbon from the atmosphere and help reduce greenhouse emissions rather than increase them. Hazelnuts are environmentally superior to almonds in that they are pollinated by the wind rather than commercial honeybees and they grow in moist climates, such as the Pacific north-west, where water is less of an issue.</p> <h2>Hemp and flax: niche contenders</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f35daab8289cd2f5d9ad0e3b3e1668164d8a972d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f35daab8289cd2f5d9ad0e3b3e1668164d8a972d/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seeds from the flax plant, which produces nutrient-rich milk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seeds from the flax plant, which produces nutrient-rich milk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Gainey/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another way to ensure sustainable choices is to choose milk alternatives made from what Emery describes as \u201cniche crops\u201d such as hemp and flax. They are grown in relatively small quantities in the northern hemisphere, which makes them more environmentally friendly compared with a monoculture operation. Both plants produce seeds that make for a milk rich in protein and healthy fats.</p> <h2>Soy: back in favor</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94024b75180296151b3396fbb14f48bfb33525af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94024b75180296151b3396fbb14f48bfb33525af/0_0_3435_3426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soy milk was the go-to alternative long before almond.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"997\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soy milk was the go-to alternative long before almond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Envision/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the Oxford study, soy milk is the joint winner on the sustainability scale. Plus, soy is the only plant milk that comes close to offering a protein content comparable to dairy. It was the go-to alternative long before almond milk came into vogue \u2013 but then soy fell out of favor.</p> <p>\u201cSoy has a relatively high concentration of certain hormones that are similar to human hormones and people got freaked out about that,\u201d says Emery. \u201cBut the reality is you would have to consume an impossibly large amount of soy milk and tofu for that to ever be a problem.\u201d Recent studies have instead found that a moderate amount of soy is healthy, especially for women.</p> <p>The primary environmental drawback to soy milk is that soybeans are grown in massive quantities around the world to feed livestock for meat and dairy production. Large swaths of rainforest in the Amazon have been burned to make way for soy farms. The work-around for this is to simply do a little research and read the carton to find soy milk that is made from organic soybeans grown in the US or Canada. </p> <h2>Oat: a humble hero</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a702caa061a91a8fa4c4093059b2696bd64aec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a702caa061a91a8fa4c4093059b2696bd64aec8/0_0_5100_3349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oat milk \u2018performs very well on all sustainability metrics\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oat milk \u2018performs very well on all sustainability metrics\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reda&amp;Co/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meet the winner: the unassuming oat.<strong> </strong></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m excited about the surge in oat milk popularity,\u201d says Liz Specht, associate director of science and technology for the Good Food Institute, a not-for-profit that promotes plant-based diets. \u201cOat milk performs very well on all sustainability metrics.\u201d Also: \u201cI highly doubt there will be unintended environmental consequences that might emerge when the scale of oat milk use gets larger.\u201d </p> <p>According to Bloomberg Business<strong>,</strong> retail sales of oat milk in the US have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2019-oatly-oat-milk-global-domination/\">s</a><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2019-oatly-oat-milk-global-domination/\">oared</a> from $4.4m in 2017 to $29m in 2019, surpassing almond milk as the fastest-growing dairy alternative. But unlike almonds, there are already plenty of oats to go around. \u201cRight now, 50 to 90% of global oat production goes into animal feed,\u201d says Specht, \u201cso there\u2019s a huge existing acreage that we can safely steal share from without moving the needle at all on total production.\u201d</p> <p>Oats are grown in cooler climates such as the northern US and Canada, and are therefore not associated with deforestation in developing countries. The only drawback with this trendy and guilt-free option is that most oats come from mass-produced, monoculture operations where they are sprayed with the Roundup pesticide right before harvest. A study by the Environmental Working Group found glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and a possible carcinogen, in all the foods it tested containing conventionally grown oats and even in one-third of products made with organic oats. However, the popular Oatly brand oat milk company maintains its oats are certified glyphosate free.</p> <h2>The bottom line: as long as it\u2019s not dairy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25b29e1ac8abc1c0ec096ee65426e6c7fdf227b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25b29e1ac8abc1c0ec096ee65426e6c7fdf227b1/0_0_5899_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The environmental impact of all non-dairy milk pales in comparison to diary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"519\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The environmental impact of all non-dairy milk pales in comparison to diary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maddie Red Photography/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Emery and Specht emphasize that whether it\u2019s coconut, soy or oat, consumers should drink whatever plant milk is most appealing to them and not fret over sustainability shortcomings, which are chump change compared with the environmental harms from dairy.</p> <p>\u201cDrink what you want,\u201d says Emery. \u201cIf you\u2019re going with plant milk instead of animal milk, you\u2019ve already addressed most of the environmental problems that your animal milk habit was causing.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Follow <a href=\"https://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/make-creamy-nutritious-plant-based-milk-home-ingredients/\">these recipes</a> to whip up a glass of hazelnut fig milk and other DIY plant milk varieties.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2020.

      "bodyText": "For environmentally minded consumers, the news is hard to swallow: almond milk is not healthy for the planet and the popular milk substitute is especially hard on bees. Our recent investigation into the connection between California\u2019s industrialized almond industry and a record 50bn commercial bee deaths created quite a buzz. The widely read story prompted one primary response from readers: \u201cWhat should we be drinking instead?\u201d This is a thorny question, and food sustainability experts are reluctant to single out any one plant milk as best because all have pros and cons. But we\u2019re going to try. One thing is clear. All milk alternatives are far better for the planet than dairy. A 2018 study by researchers at the University of Oxford showed that producing a glass of dairy milk results in almost three times more greenhouse gas emissions than any plant-based milk and it consumes nine times more land than any of the milk alternatives. (Land is required to pasture the cows and grow their feed, which the animals belch out in the form of methane.) Plant milks can, nevertheless, have a dark side, as when any crop is produced in mass quantities. It\u2019s important to consider not just whether they are grown using organic methods. Other factors include how the farming of the crop affects people and native habitats in developing countries, the carbon footprint and water use. And while each product has its trade-offs, some plant milks are more sustainable than others. Based on interviews with experts, here is a an environmental ranking of plant milks, from the disappointingly sour to the sustainably sweet. Coconut: \u2018An absolute tragedy\u2019 Coconut has a reputation as exotic and healthy, but for poor regions in the Philippines, Indonesia and India, where pickers are often paid less than a dollar a day, the palm groves are no paradise. Because coconut trees only grow in tropical climates, the pressure to meet global demand is causing exploitation of workers and destruction of rainforests. \u201cCoconut is an absolute tragedy and it makes me really sad,\u201d Isaac Emery, a food sustainability consultant. \u201cI love cooking with coconut milk but I don\u2019t feel good about buying coconut products. Farmers in Indonesia should be growing food to feed their families instead of meeting international demands.\u201d To avoid supporting unsustainable practices, choose coconut products that are certified Fair Trade. Almond: bad for bees While almond trees occupy smaller amounts of farmland compared with other crops grown for milk, this benefit is overshadowed by the negative impacts of almond farming in the US. Concentrated almost entirely in California\u2019s arid Central Valley, almonds are the largest specialty crop in the US and the orchards cover a region the size of Delaware. Almonds require more water than any other dairy alternative, consuming 130 pints of water to produce a single glass of almond milk, according to the Oxford study. Satisfying continual demands for larger almond crops is also placing unsustainable pressures on US commercial beekeepers. Nearly 70% of commercial bees in the US are drafted every spring to pollinate almonds. Last year, a record number \u2013over one-third of them\u2013 died by season\u2019s end as a result of these pressures and other environmental threats. Rice: a water-guzzler Although rice milk is ubiquitous as an inexpensive and widely available dairy alternative, it offers little in the way of nutrition or environmental benefits compared with other choices. Rice is a water hog, according to the Oxford study, plus it produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other plant milk. Bacteria breeding in rice paddies pump methane into the atmosphere and large amounts of fertilizer pollute waterways. Hazelnut: on the up For consumers who want the nutritiousness and tastiness of a nut milk but without the environmental impacts of almond farming, the hazelnut is a rising star. Like all nuts, hazelnuts grow on trees that pull carbon from the atmosphere and help reduce greenhouse emissions rather than increase them. Hazelnuts are environmentally superior to almonds in that they are pollinated by the wind rather than commercial honeybees and they grow in moist climates, such as the Pacific north-west, where water is less of an issue. Hemp and flax: niche contenders Another way to ensure sustainable choices is to choose milk alternatives made from what Emery describes as \u201cniche crops\u201d such as hemp and flax. They are grown in relatively small quantities in the northern hemisphere, which makes them more environmentally friendly compared with a monoculture operation. Both plants produce seeds that make for a milk rich in protein and healthy fats. Soy: back in favor According to the Oxford study, soy milk is the joint winner on the sustainability scale. Plus, soy is the only plant milk that comes close to offering a protein content comparable to dairy. It was the go-to alternative long before almond milk came into vogue \u2013 but then soy fell out of favor. \u201cSoy has a relatively high concentration of certain hormones that are similar to human hormones and people got freaked out about that,\u201d says Emery. \u201cBut the reality is you would have to consume an impossibly large amount of soy milk and tofu for that to ever be a problem.\u201d Recent studies have instead found that a moderate amount of soy is healthy, especially for women. The primary environmental drawback to soy milk is that soybeans are grown in massive quantities around the world to feed livestock for meat and dairy production. Large swaths of rainforest in the Amazon have been burned to make way for soy farms. The work-around for this is to simply do a little research and read the carton to find soy milk that is made from organic soybeans grown in the US or Canada. Oat: a humble hero Meet the winner: the unassuming oat. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the surge in oat milk popularity,\u201d says Liz Specht, associate director of science and technology for the Good Food Institute, a not-for-profit that promotes plant-based diets. \u201cOat milk performs very well on all sustainability metrics.\u201d Also: \u201cI highly doubt there will be unintended environmental consequences that might emerge when the scale of oat milk use gets larger.\u201d According to Bloomberg Business, retail sales of oat milk in the US have soared from $4.4m in 2017 to $29m in 2019, surpassing almond milk as the fastest-growing dairy alternative. But unlike almonds, there are already plenty of oats to go around. \u201cRight now, 50 to 90% of global oat production goes into animal feed,\u201d says Specht, \u201cso there\u2019s a huge existing acreage that we can safely steal share from without moving the needle at all on total production.\u201d Oats are grown in cooler climates such as the northern US and Canada, and are therefore not associated with deforestation in developing countries. The only drawback with this trendy and guilt-free option is that most oats come from mass-produced, monoculture operations where they are sprayed with the Roundup pesticide right before harvest. A study by the Environmental Working Group found glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and a possible carcinogen, in all the foods it tested containing conventionally grown oats and even in one-third of products made with organic oats. However, the popular Oatly brand oat milk company maintains its oats are certified glyphosate free. The bottom line: as long as it\u2019s not dairy Both Emery and Specht emphasize that whether it\u2019s coconut, soy or oat, consumers should drink whatever plant milk is most appealing to them and not fret over sustainability shortcomings, which are chump change compared with the environmental harms from dairy. \u201cDrink what you want,\u201d says Emery. \u201cIf you\u2019re going with plant milk instead of animal milk, you\u2019ve already addressed most of the environmental problems that your animal milk habit was causing.\u201d Follow these recipes to whip up a glass of hazelnut fig milk and other DIY plant milk varieties. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2020. We removed a statistic regarding deforestation in Indonesia as it did not relate specifically to coconut palm trees.",

Our recent investigation into the connection between California\u2019s industrialized almond industry and a record 50bn commercial bee deaths created quite a buzz. The widely read story prompted one primary response from readers: \u201cWhat should we be drinking instead?\u201d This is a thorny question, and food sustainability experts are reluctant to single out any one plant milk as best because all have pros and cons. But we\u2019re going to try. One thing is clear. All milk alternatives are far better for the planet than dairy. A 2018 study by researchers at the University of Oxford showed that producing a glass of dairy milk results in almost three times more greenhouse gas emissions than any plant-based milk and it consumes nine times more land than any of the milk alternatives. (Land is required to pasture the cows and grow their feed, which the animals belch out in the form of methane.) Plant milks can, nevertheless, have a dark side, as when any crop is produced in mass quantities. It\u2019s important to consider not just whether they are grown using organic methods. Other factors include how the farming of the crop affects people and native habitats in developing countries, the carbon footprint and water use. And while each product has its trade-offs, some plant milks are more sustainable than others. Based on interviews with experts, here is a an environmental ranking of plant milks, from the disappointingly sour to the sustainably sweet. Coconut: \u2018An absolute tragedy\u2019 Coconut has a reputation as exotic and healthy, but for poor regions in the Philippines, Indonesia and India, where pickers are often paid less than a dollar a day, the palm groves are no paradise. Because coconut trees only grow in tropical climates, the pressure to meet global demand is causing exploitation of workers and destruction of rainforests. \u201cCoconut is an absolute tragedy and it makes me really sad,\u201d Isaac Emery, a food sustainability consultant. \u201cI love cooking with coconut milk but I don\u2019t feel good about buying coconut products. Farmers in Indonesia should be growing food to feed their families instead of meeting international demands.\u201d To avoid supporting unsustainable practices, choose coconut products that are certified Fair Trade. Almond: bad for bees While almond trees occupy smaller amounts of farmland compared with other crops grown for milk, this benefit is overshadowed by the negative impacts of almond farming in the US. Concentrated almost entirely in California\u2019s arid Central Valley, almonds are the largest specialty crop in the US and the orchards cover a region the size of Delaware. Almonds require more water than any other dairy alternative, consuming 130 pints of water to produce a single glass of almond milk, according to the Oxford study. Satisfying continual demands for larger almond crops is also placing unsustainable pressures on US commercial beekeepers. Nearly 70% of commercial bees in the US are drafted every spring to pollinate almonds. Last year, a record number \u2013over one-third of them\u2013 died by season\u2019s end as a result of these pressures and other environmental threats. Rice: a water-guzzler Although rice milk is ubiquitous as an inexpensive and widely available dairy alternative, it offers little in the way of nutrition or environmental benefits compared with other choices. Rice is a water hog, according to the Oxford study, plus it produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other plant milk. Bacteria breeding in rice paddies pump methane into the atmosphere and large amounts of fertilizer pollute waterways. Hazelnut: on the up For consumers who want the nutritiousness and tastiness of a nut milk but without the environmental impacts of almond farming, the hazelnut is a rising star. Like all nuts, hazelnuts grow on trees that pull carbon from the atmosphere and help reduce greenhouse emissions rather than increase them. Hazelnuts are environmentally superior to almonds in that they are pollinated by the wind rather than commercial honeybees and they grow in moist climates, such as the Pacific north-west, where water is less of an issue. Hemp and flax: niche contenders Another way to ensure sustainable choices is to choose milk alternatives made from what Emery describes as \u201cniche crops\u201d such as hemp and flax. They are grown in relatively small quantities in the northern hemisphere, which makes them more environmentally friendly compared with a monoculture operation. Both plants produce seeds that make for a milk rich in protein and healthy fats. Soy: back in favor According to the Oxford study, soy milk is the joint winner on the sustainability scale. Plus, soy is the only plant milk that comes close to offering a protein content comparable to dairy. It was the go-to alternative long before almond milk came into vogue \u2013 but then soy fell out of favor. \u201cSoy has a relatively high concentration of certain hormones that are similar to human hormones and people got freaked out about that,\u201d says Emery. \u201cBut the reality is you would have to consume an impossibly large amount of soy milk and tofu for that to ever be a problem.\u201d Recent studies have instead found that a moderate amount of soy is healthy, especially for women. The primary environmental drawback to soy milk is that soybeans are grown in massive quantities around the world to feed livestock for meat and dairy production. Large swaths of rainforest in the Amazon have been burned to make way for soy farms. The work-around for this is to simply do a little research and read the carton to find soy milk that is made from organic soybeans grown in the US or Canada. Oat: a humble hero Meet the winner: the unassuming oat. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the surge in oat milk popularity,\u201d says Liz Specht, associate director of science and technology for the Good Food Institute, a not-for-profit that promotes plant-based diets. \u201cOat milk performs very well on all sustainability metrics.\u201d Also: \u201cI highly doubt there will be unintended environmental consequences that might emerge when the scale of oat milk use gets larger.\u201d According to Bloomberg Business, retail sales of oat milk in the US have soared from $4.4m in 2017 to $29m in 2019, surpassing almond milk as the fastest-growing dairy alternative. But unlike almonds, there are already plenty of oats to go around. \u201cRight now, 50 to 90% of global oat production goes into animal feed,\u201d says Specht, \u201cso there\u2019s a huge existing acreage that we can safely steal share from without moving the needle at all on total production.\u201d Oats are grown in cooler climates such as the northern US and Canada, and are therefore not associated with deforestation in developing countries. The only drawback with this trendy and guilt-free option is that most oats come from mass-produced, monoculture operations where they are sprayed with the Roundup pesticide right before harvest. A study by the Environmental Working Group found glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and a possible carcinogen, in all the foods it tested containing conventionally grown oats and even in one-third of products made with organic oats. However, the popular Oatly brand oat milk company maintains its oats are certified glyphosate free. The bottom line: as long as it\u2019s not dairy Both Emery and Specht emphasize that whether it\u2019s coconut, soy or oat, consumers should drink whatever plant milk is most appealing to them and not fret over sustainability shortcomings, which are chump change compared with the environmental harms from dairy. \u201cDrink what you want,\u201d says Emery. \u201cIf you\u2019re going with plant milk instead of animal milk, you\u2019ve already addressed most of the environmental problems that your animal milk habit was causing.\u201d Follow these recipes to whip up a glass of hazelnut fig milk and other DIY plant milk varieties. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2020. We removed a statistic regarding deforestation in Indonesia as it did not relate specifically to coconut palm trees.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has signalled sports clubs that missed out in a controversial $100m grants program may be given funding in future, promising to work with the treasurer on more funding, despite conceding no fault in his government\u2019s handling of sports grants. The offer comes as clubs recommended by Sport Australia but rejected by former sports minister Bridget McKenzie come forward to complain of their disappointment at missing out under the community sport infrastructure grant program, which the auditor general found was skewed towards marginal seats. Morrison\u2019s appearance at the National Press Club on Wednesday to discuss the policy response to the bushfires was dominated instead by questions about the sports program. The prime minister again defended the program by insisting all projects given grants were eligible under the rules and argued that politicians were better connected to their communities and therefore entitled to overrule departmental recommendations. McKenzie\u2019s position in cabinet is still in doubt, with Morrison\u2019s departmental secretary and former chief of staff Phil Gaetjens yet to report about whether she breached ministerial standards. Despite the auditor general stating it was \u201cnot evident\u201d what legal authority McKenzie had to give grants, Morrison claimed \u201cthere was a ministerial authority to make decisions in this matter and that\u2019s what was exercised\u201d. Morrison said that politicians were \u201cpart of our community\u201d and \u201caccountable to \u2026 people in our community\u201d, drawing a contrast with the public service by listing examples of unrelated departmental recommendations overturned by ministers, such as a decision to reinstate funding for Foodbank. Asked about worthy sports clubs that missed out, Morrison said there were \u201cmany, many more worthy projects in this area\u201d and committed to \u201cwork with the treasurer to see how we can better support even more projects in the future\u201d. Morrison agreed that public money should not be spent on personal political gain. He insisted \u201cthat is not what the government has done\u201d, without explaining what other criteria was applied by McKenzie, who selected projects from a list colour-coded by which party held the electorate in which they were located. Morrison dodged a question about why cabinet had extended the program by $42m in March 2019, given program guidelines specified funding was meant for projects that hadn\u2019t started construction but grants had to be spent by June. \u201cAs the auditor general found, the rules were followed \u2026 guidelines are separate issues,\u201d he replied. Earlier, Labor increased the pressure on Morrison and McKenzie by announcing it will move to set up an inquiry into the sports grants program. In a statement, Anthony Albanese said the \u201ccommunities that were cheated by this government deserve answers\u201d including details of the recommended projects that missed out and \u201cwhich applications the government facilitated weeks or months after the window for applications closed\u201d. \u201cThe auditor general\u2019s report and now almost daily whistle-blowing have exposed this government\u2019s political pork-barrelling campaign on an industrial scale,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, the ABC published a list of clubs that received a score of 74% or more, meaning they would have received funding if Sport Australia\u2019s recommendations had been followed by the minister. The Woorabinda Aboriginal Shire Council, in the traditional lands of the Wadja Wadja and Yungulu people in central Queensland, was one of those which missed out. Its application for a $500,000 grant to improve local sporting facilities was rated 84 out of 100 by Sport Australia, well above the 74 mark cut-off. The local mayor, Phillip Alberts, said he\u2019s starting to learn the region rarely wins grants from the federal government, something he described as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Alberts told Guardian Australia. \u201c[The sport grant] would have made a big difference for us in our community.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t ask me why, but it\u2019s pretty hard to get anything. [Other councils] get everything that they desire and we \u2013 because we\u2019re in the sticks, in the middle of nowhere \u2013 it\u2019s hard for us to get stuff out here. It is frustrating.\u201d Cherry Gardens Ironbank Recreation Ground, in the Centre Alliance-held seat of Mayo, received a score of 94 on its request for $480,621 for new female-friendly change rooms. Andy Adams, the president of Cherry Gardens, said it was \u201cin desperate need of new change rooms\u201d for its netball club of 250 members and two female football teams. \u201cThe visitors\u2019 change room is essentially a 30-year-old large shed: it\u2019s cold in winter and there are no adequate shower facilities,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe found out yesterday about the high score [we received], it was disappointing and frustrating for the club, volunteers and members who put a lot of time in putting together the application.\u201d The Coromandel Valley Ramblers Cricket Club, also in the seat of Mayo, received a score of 90 for its project \u2013 $50,000 towards a club room and toilet block. The president, Matt Smith, said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the way money was distributed because \u201cthis practice has been happening for a long time\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that\u2019s not done on merit. I know why they\u2019re done the way they are \u2026 It\u2019s for political gain, essentially, dollars for votes.\u201d Both clubs are not considering joining a legal challenge of the federal scheme at this stage, citing other grants applications at the local and state level. The Port Fairy Tennis Club, in the education minister Dan Tehan\u2019s seat of Wannon, received a score of 83 for its request for $50,000 for major infrastructure works including modified courts for junior members. The secretary, Alison Zehir, told Guardian Australia the club had \u201csignificantly scaled back its current infrastructure program\u201d, leaving planned junior courts in limbo. \u201cThe club is very disappointed to learn that our strong application was overlooked for federal sports grant funding,\u201d she said. \u201cOur belief is that applications should be judged on merit and need, so it is disappointing to not receive the grant.\u201d",

With the pattern apparently new to scientific literature, Palmroth asked the citizen scientists to take further images of the aurora. \u201cI was basically sitting on my couch and sending real-time messages to the observers saying \u2018take these kinds of pictures\u2019.\u201d The community did not disappoint \u2013 the images sent included two taken at the same time from different sites in Finland. That allowed Palmroth and colleagues to determine the altitude and other aspects of the phenomenon, such as the spacing between the ripples of the \u201cdunes\u201d. Palmroth said the green colour of the display is produced by excited oxygen, with further work revealing its form is probably down to disturbances in the atmosphere, known as gravity waves \u2013 these are the same sort of ripples that form when a pebble is tossed into a pond. In the atmosphere, however, waves often travel vertically upwards \u2013 and there are many of them. That, said Palmroth, offered a clue. \u201c[The waves] have different frequencies, different wavelengths, different amplitudes and [so] to observe something very even, like the dunes, means that there has to be some active mechanism which is making them so even,\u201d she said. Palmroth explained that mechanism could be an unusual event called a mesospheric bore, whereby a particular wave is filtered out and bent, allowing it to travel horizontally between two layers in the atmosphere. The phenomenon, she said, is similar to a tidal bore seen in rivers. Palmroth said this can happen when, unusually, the temperature of one layer of the atmosphere is slightly higher than both the layers above it and below it. The dune-like appearance of the aurora, the team say, is down to the wave producing peaks and troughs in the density of oxygen. \u201cWhen this inversion layer is forming [in] these places where you can also have the aurora, then you can see the dunes,\u201d added Palmroth. Details of the discovery are published in the journal AGU Advances. \u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 29 January 2020 to remove the suggestion that the discovery itself was made by people in a Facebook group.",

      "bodyText": "The decades-long campaign to secure world heritage listing for Australia\u2019s largest collection of rock art has finally been taken to Unesco. The federal government on Friday lodged a submission for the Murujuga cultural landscape on Western Australia\u2019s Burrup Peninsula to be included on Australia\u2019s world heritage tentative list, the first formal step toward achieving global recognition for the 50,000-year-old gallery of more than one million petroglyphs. Peter Jeffries, the chief executive officer of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation (MAC), said the listing was \u201cthousands of years in the making\u201d. \u201cMurujuga is a place of truly global significance and this is an important step in securing international awareness and protection of our incredible landscape and unique culture,\u201d he said. MAC represents five clans who are traditional custodians, or Ngurra-ra Ngarli, for the Burrup Peninsula, and who have taken over its care since the Yaburara people, the traditional owners, were devastated by a massacre in the 1860s. Those groups are the Ngarluma, Mardudhunera, Yaburara, Yindjibarndi people and Wong-Goo-Tt-Oo peoples, but Jeffries said that MAC would \u201cwelcome anyone with links to this special place to now participate in the world heritage nomination process alongside us\u201d. The WA Greens MP Robin Chapple, who has campaigned for world heritage listing for Murujuga since the 1980s, said he welcomed the decision but said the McGowan government was undermining its efforts to secure a world heritage listing by not moving faster to curb emissions from heavy industry on the Burrup Peninsula, which have caused damage and discolouration of some petroglyphs. \u201cIt will be very interesting to see how the government can manage the process of world heritage nomination at the same time as increasing industry on the Burrup,\u201d Chapple said. Establishing a formal monitoring program for potentially damaging emissions is part of the WA government\u2019s rock art strategy. MAC and the Department of Water and Environment Regulation are currently assessing tender applications for a monitoring program and a government spokesman says it is \u201canticipated that a contract will be awarded shortly\u201d. The largest industrial emitter on the peninsula, gas giant Woodside, received approval from the Environmental Protection Authority in WA to build a 434km pipeline from the Scarborough gas field near Broome to its processing facility on the Burrup Peninsula, extending the life of that facility by 25 years. The EPA\u2019s consideration of the full expansion project, which Woodside says will create almost 5,000 jobs in construction and 2,000 ongoing jobs, and boost Australia\u2019s GDP by $414bn between 2019 and 2063, is open for public comment until 12 February. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very, very difficult to say [to the world heritage committee] that industry and the rock art can coexist,\u201d Chapple said. \u201cWe know the increased acidity from emissions is already starting to damage the rock art.\u201d Judith Hugo, the co-convener of Friends of Australian Rock Art, said it was \u201ccompletely farcical\u201d to nominate Murujuga for world heritage listing while also encouraging further industrial development on the peninsula. The WA environment minister, Stephen Dawson, said there was a \u201ca broad level of support from stakeholders, including industry and the local community, for world heritage listing\u201d. The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said she was proud to support the nomination. \u201cMurujuga, which includes the Dampier Peninsula and surrounds, has the largest, densest and most diverse concentrations of petroglyphs in the world,\u201d Ley said. The submission will be considered when the world heritage committee meets in Fuzhou, China, in June and July this year. If the submission is accepted it has to sit on the tentative list for at least 12 months before the listing is formalised. However, because Australia currently sits on the world heritage committee, and has promised not to progress any of its own listings until that term is up, the earliest that Murujuga could be formally added to the world heritage list is 2022.",

I therefore flag the following as issues to be considered in the wake of recent events, namely:</em></p> <ul> <li><em>The constitutional and legal framework that would allow the Commonwealth to declare a national state of emergency - with clear authorities and appropriate safeguards for Commonwealth action on its own initiative, including the deployment of our defence force;</em></li> <li><em>The legal interface with the states and territories on responsibilities when it comes to preparation for, and response to, natural disasters and emergencies of national scale; </em></li> <li><em>An enhanced national accountability for natural disaster risk management, resilience and preparedness.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s do a quick recap of what we know. Despite weather in the mid 30s, benign wind conditions on Wednesday mean the ACT Emergency Services Agency has been able to downgrade the Orroral Valley fire from watch and act to an advice level bushfire warning. The blaze began on Monday when a defence helicopter landed in the Namadgi national park, south of Canberra, and accidentally sparked what authorities have called the city\u2019s \u201cmost serious\u201d bushfire threat since the city\u2019s devastating 2003 fires. Tuesday saw dramatic images of the fire approaching Canberra\u2019s southern suburbs, but conditions eased throughout the evening and the fire was downgraded from emergency level to watch and act just before midnight. The fire has now burned through 10,492ha, and earlier the ESA\u2019s incident controller, Matthew Shonk, warned conditions are expected to deteriorate in coming days. Friday and Saturday are expected to be especially challenging, with temperatures due to reach 42C and westerly and north-westerly winds increasing. Dangerous weather conditions will hit much of the east and south-east of Australia. In the coming days temperatures are expected to exceed 40C in Adelaide, Canberra and Melbourne, while some places \u2013 such as Cummins in South Australia, Echuca in northern Victoria, and Griffith in inland NSW \u2013 are expected to reach 45C. ACT emergency service personnel, police and defence force members are door-knocking residents in the southern Canberra suburbs of Banks, Gordon and Conder to remind them about the importance of having a bushfire survival plan. Good news. The ACT Emergency Services Agency has downgraded the Orroral Valley fire from watch and act to an advice level. It says there is now limited activity on the eastern edge of the fire, although there is an increase in fire activity on the western side of the fire. Active fire remains on the northern side of the fireground. The fire remains out of control. \u201cFirefighters are on scene patrolling, preparing for property protection and strengthening containment lines,\u201d the ESA says. \u201cThe ACT\u2019s specialist intelligence gathering helicopter is conducting aerial surveillance. People in the area may be affected by smoke, which could reduce visibility and air quality.\u201d I\u2019ll leave Morrison there because he moves on to emissions reductions and then, of course, questions about the controversial sports grants program overseen by Bridget McKenzie. Morrison: As the years pass, though, we note that the bush grows back and fuel loads increase and people move in in still larger numbers to live in fire-prone areas and dangerous fires occur again in a cycle which we must break. We must continue to [learn] from this fire season so we are better prepared for the next one because, of course, there\u2019ll be one. Whether that be the deployment of the defence forces, local hazard reduction, access to resources such as aerial firefighting equipment, consistency of disaster recovery arrangements or resilience in the face of a changing climate. And we must learn, as I discussed only last week, from the Indigenous Australians and their ancient practices and how to improve our resilience to these threats. Morrison points to the use of Australian defence force reservists as evidence the government has responded to the crisis, but says before the next bushfire season he will look at legislative changes including giving the commonwealth the power to declare a national state of emergency. He also flags changes to the \u201clegal interface\u201d between the commonwealth and states and territories on responsibilities when it comes to preparing for and responding to natural disasters and emergencies on a national scale. Morrison also flags \u201can enhancement of a national accountability framework for natural disaster risk management, resilience and preparedness\u201d. \u201cThis should include the setting of targeting and transparent reporting on key actions with enhanced national standards where necessary,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be comparing apples with apples.\u201d He says that before the events of this summer the role of the commonwealth in responding to natural disasters \u201chas been limited to responding to requests for assistance for state governments\u201d. \u201cThe scale of the bushfires this season, not least their simultaneous reach across many borders, has demonstrated to me the limits of these arrangements,\u201d he says. Morrison says the events of this summer have \u201creminded us that our national security is also about our preparedness, responsiveness and resilience to the natural disasters and the environment we will live in \u2013 today, over the next decade, and well beyond\u201d. Morrison says that \u201camidst this devastation\u201d it has been \u201chumbling to see Australia as its best\u201d. In recounting the stories of their selflessness as I did on Australia Day, my message was very simple: this is the greatness of Australia. This is the strength of Australia. This is why, as a people, we always overcome and prevail. Australia is strong, but we must become even stronger. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, begins his National Press Club address by acknowledging the families who have lost loved ones throughout the bushfire season. Your sorrow hangs heavy on our nation\u2019s heart and that heart is extended also to all of those who now face the daunting task of rebuilding homes, livelihoods, businesses, and local communities. \u201cWe\u2019ll be with you for the long haul. Many Australians, as well as our loyal friends from overseas who are standing here with us, remain on those frontlines today at some 75 or so fires burning around the country. \u201cOur brave firefighters, our emergency service workers, our volunteers, our soldiers, our reservists ... our mental health specialists, local community leaders, public servants as well as the networks of civil society are engaged in all manner of very practical, helpful, loving tasks from delivering food to rescuing and supporting recovering wildlife.\u201d It\u2019s not just the ACT that will see dangerous fire conditions increase as we get closer to the weekend. In the coming days temperatures are expected to exceed 40C in Adelaide, Canberra and Melbourne, while some places, such as Cummins in South Australia, Echuca in northern Victoria and Griffith in inland NSW, are expected to reach 45C. BOM meteorologist Diana Eadie told AAP on Wednesday that a hot air mass causing scorching temperatures across large parts of Western Australia will move across the country along with an increase in humidity. \u201cAs a result we\u2019re expecting severe to extreme heatwave conditions to develop across much of the south-east of Australia,\u201d she said. Eadie said many areas would experience uncomfortable overnight temperatures, including Adelaide where it would not drop below 28C on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing those severe to extreme heatwave conditions because when you don\u2019t get those temperatures dropping off overnight, it doesn\u2019t allow the body to recover.\u201d Eadie said the heatwave would bring elevated fire dangers, peaking on Thursday in South Australia, Friday in Victoria and Tasmania, and Saturday in fire-affected areas including the ACT and southern parts of NSW. \u201cWhilst we\u2019ll see those warm temperatures and strengthening winds, it\u2019s not as dry as what we\u2019ve seen with previous events, which is why at this stage we\u2019re only forecasting severe fire dangers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite as dangerous as previous situations ... because we do have that moisture over fire-affected areas.\u201d Some Australians are ignoring potentially life saving emergency alerts during disasters because they fear they are being scammed, says Queensland University of Technology associate professor Amisha Mehta. Mehta has told AAP that emergency alerts with a link to a website are often mistaken as a scam or computer virus by younger and older people. It is the latest challenge facing emergency authorities during times of natural disasters, Mehta says. Remember when the ACT was hit by a vicious hailstorm... last week. I\u2019ve just spoken to Abrar Shabren, a forecaster from the Bureau of Meteorology, who has given me a rundown on the weather fire crews in the ACT will face in the coming days. While the temperature will rise quite steeply as this afternoon goes on, with a forecast high of 36C, quite benign easterly and south-easterly winds are expected to keep things in check. However, conditions are expected to begin deteriorating from tomorrow until Sunday. Temperatures are expected to rise to 39C on Thursday before hitting 42C on Friday and Saturday, driven by increasing westerly winds. \u201cAround midmorning to midday on Friday the winds will start becoming north-westerly and that\u2019s when that hot surge comes in,\u201d he sais. \u201cIn the beginning those winds will be light, between 10 and 15km/h then 15 to 20km/h, so not the strong winds we\u2019ve seen in previous weeks with those high pressure systems bringing in quite strong winds. \u201cBut on Saturday we will see that wind increasing on the fire grounds, so dry, hot and strong winds probably about 30, 40 and 50km/h. In the elevated areas and high peaks the wind gusts will be a bit stronger than that. \u201cThat will drop off in the evening on Saturday and then through to Sunday winds become easterly and quite light.\u201d Looks like the bulk of Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference will be about the unfolding coronavirus but he begins by calling the fires in Canberra \u201ca reminder again that we\u2019re a long way from the end of this bushfire season\u201d. The Orroral Valley fire in the ACT has now burnt through 10,079 hectares. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is about to give a press conference in Canberra. I\u2019ll let you know if he touches on plans to expand the powers of the commonwealth to respond to national emergencies, which is expected to be a key focus of his National Press Club address today. Moving briefly to South Australia, AAP reports that authorities are bracing for a day of severe fire danger with special work to be conducted on the Kangaroo Island fire ground. Earthmoving equipment, water tankers and extra fire crews are being sent to strategic locations ahead of a day of high bushfire risk. The blaze is officially contained but the Country Fire Service says crews are still finding hotspots in various areas including Blue Gum Hills, Cygnet River and Vivonne Bay. The bushfire risk on Thursday is expected to be severe with a total fire ban to be put in place as temperatures soar. Adelaide is forecast to have a top of 42C with the mercury going even higher in some regional centres. The fire has already burned through more 210,000ha and destroyed more than 50 homes along with hundreds of other buildings, crops, livestock, wildlife and infrastructure including many kilometres of fencing. It also claimed two lives. Father and son Dick and Clayton Lang were killed when their car became engulfed in flames. From Tuesday night. A lot of ACT residents are comparing this fire to the devastating 2003 blaze. Just a reminder of where we\u2019re at. On Monday, a defence helicopter landed in the Namadgi national park, south of Canberra, and accidentally sparked what authorities have called the city\u2019s \u201cmost serious\u201d bushfire threat since the city\u2019s devastating 2003 fires. Tuesday saw dramatic images of the fire approaching Canberra\u2019s southern suburbs, but conditions eased throughout the evening and the fire was downgraded from emergency level to watch and act just before midnight. The fire remains active though and is travelling in a north-east and easterly direction towards the communities of Mount Tennant, Tharwa Village, Boboyan Road and Top Naas Road. The ACT Emergency Services Agency says residents in those areas need to \u201cremain vigilant\u201d. If you do not need to be in the area, \u201cit is still best for your safety to not enter or return\u201d. Residents in the southern Canberra suburbs of Banks, Gordon, Conder, Calwell and Theodore should also continue to monitor conditions. While milder conditions today are helping fire authorities the Bureau of Meteorology is predicting extremely high temperatures and low humidity that will prove challenging. Temperatures today are still tipped to reach 36C though before rising to 39C on Thursday. On Friday the mercury will increase to at top 42C. It will be 42C again on Saturday, before showers and possible storm pass through on Sunday, with a top temperature of 35C. As Luke has written, fire crews are making the most of today\u2019s milder conditions before the expected temperature rise tomorrow and on Saturday. Today ACT emergency service personnel, police and defence force members are door knocking in the southern Canberra suburbs of Banks, Gordon and Conder. It\u2019s not an evacuation \u2013 no evacuation warnings have been issued for those suburbs \u2013 but the ACT Emergency Services Agency says they\u2019ll be there to \u201canswer any questions and to help ensure residents have a bushfire survival plan\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for now. My colleague Michael McGowan will be taking over for a while. And a reminder that Scott Morrison will be addressing the National Press Club this afternoon. The ABC has reported some comments from the ACT Emergency Services Agency\u2019s incident controller, Matthew Shonk, who says authorities do not expect the fire to return to emergency level today. But Shonk says the fire is not going to be put out today or tomorrow and that conditions will worsen in coming days. \u201cWe can\u2019t sugarcoat that in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe conditions that we saw yesterday could well pop up again. \u201cThere\u2019s challenging times coming up; we\u2019re not going to get this fire out today and not tomorrow. This is a campaign fire and we\u2019ll be working for some time.\u201d The fire is about 8km south of Banks, the most southern suburb in Canberra. Fire crews are hoping to make the most of today\u2019s milder conditions. The size of the fire is 10,079ha, according to the latest update from the ACT Emergency Services Agency. Whelan on what she called \u201cdisaster tourism\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019d had a number of reports from residents in the southern suburbs of the significant amount traffic coming into the southern suburbs last evening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would appear we have a number of people who are coming into the suburbs to check out the fire, to take photographs, to undertake what I\u2019m calling disaster tourism. \u201cPlease refrain from doing this.\u201d We are seeing some amazing photographs of the Canberra fire. Many of these photographs will have come from safe vantage points or from a person\u2019s own property. However, the ACT\u2019s emergency services agency commissioner, Georgeina Whelan, is asking people not to engage in \u201cdisaster tourism\u201d by heading to head to Canberra\u2019s southern suburbs an Instagram shot. Scott Morrison will address the National Press Club today \u2013 and excerpts of his speech indicate a key theme will be expanding the powers of the commonwealth to respond to national emergencies. First, Morrison describes the problem as he sees it: \u201cTo date, the role of the Commonwealth in responding to natural disasters has been limited to responding to requests for assistance from state governments. They judge the time and form of support needed. The scale of the bushfires this season \u2013 not least their simultaneous reach across state borders \u2013 has unequivocally demonstrated the limits of those arrangements.\u201d And then, the solution: \u201cI believe, however, there is now a clear community expectation that the Commonwealth should have the ability to respond in times of national emergencies and disasters, particularly through deployment of our defence forces in circumstances where the life and property of Australians have been assessed to be under threat. ... I therefore flag the following as issues to be considered in the wake of recent events, namely: The constitutional and legal framework that would allow the Commonwealth to declare a national state of emergency - with clear authorities and appropriate safeguards for Commonwealth action on its own initiative, including the deployment of our defence force; The legal interface with the states and territories on responsibilities when it comes to preparation for, and response to, natural disasters and emergencies of national scale; An enhanced national accountability for natural disaster risk management, resilience and preparedness. This should include the setting of targets and transparent reporting on key actions, with enhanced national standards where necessary.\u201d Morrison will also give a bit more detail on his proposal for a royal commission into the bushfires, explaining its first take will be to \u201caudit the implementation of previous [inquiries\u2019] recommendations, drawing on work that has already been done in this area\u201d. This is some incredible footage from Martin Ollman, a photographer in Canberra. The weather over the coming days is expected to be very dry and hot in Canberra, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Wednesday is tipped to reach 36C, with the city shrouded in a smoke haze. Thursday will hit 39C, with more smoky conditions, while Friday the mercury will increase to at top 42C. It will be 42C again on Saturday, before showers and possible storm pass through on Sunday, with a top temperature of 35C. The current watch and act alert for the Orroral Valley fire warns residents in Tharwa Village, Boboyan Road, Apollo Road, and Top Naas Road to remain vigilant. \u201cMonitor conditions and know what you will do if the fire threatens,\u201d the ACT Emergency Services Agency says. \u201cIf you do not need to be in this area, it is still best for your safety to not enter or return.\u201d The agency says residents in Banks, Gordon, Condor, Calwell and Theodore should continue to monitor conditions. But it notes that no properties are under threat at this time. Yesterday, a fire started by a defence helicopter which landed in the Namadgi national park, south of Canberra, sparked what authorities called the city\u2019s \u201cmost serious\u201d bushfire threat since the city\u2019s devastating 2003 fires. The Orroral Valley fire has burnt through 9,500 hectares and is expected to grow, although it is now at a watch and act level. Moderate conditions overnight allowed firefighters at the scene to strengthen containment lines. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the bushfires threatening Canberra today.

      "bodyText": "Australia has unveiled plans to evacuate some of its nationals from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, flying the most \u201cisolated and vulnerable\u201d of 600 citizens to quarantine on Christmas Island. In a joint operation with New Zealand, which has about 50 citizens in the city at the epicentre of the global coronavirus outbreak, Australians will be evacuated from the locked-down city on a \u201clast-in first-out\u201d basis. Christmas Island, located 2,600km from the Australian mainland in the Indian Ocean, is the site of a notorious immigration detention facility that currently houses a Sri Lankan family of four. All those who are evacuated on the charter flight will be quarantined in the detention centre for up to 14 days, the internationally recognised incubation period for the virus. The chartered Qantas flight follows the Japanese and US governments flying citizens out of Wuhan on Wednesday morning, and plans by France, Indonesia and other countries for similar evacuations. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said his government would move to extricate its citizens from Wuhan as quickly as possible. \u201cWe have taken a decision this morning to prepare a plan for an operation to provide some assisted departures for isolated and vulnerable Australians in Wuhan and the Hubei province. \u201cThis will be done subject obviously to working closely and with the authority and approval of the Chinese government.\u201d Australians evacuated from Wuhan and quarantined on Christmas Island will be asked to pay some or all of the costs of their transport and quarantine. \u201cThey will also be required to commit to making a contribution to the cost, consistent with normal arrangements in these circumstances,\u201d a government statement said. Morrison stressed there was \u201ca limited window\u201d to extricate foreign nationals, and said the last-in-first-out basis would prioritise Australians who were short-term visitors to Hubei province, and who did not have family or other support, rather than those who lived in the province or who had been there for longer periods. \u201cWe\u2019re particularly focused on the more vulnerable components of that population. That\u2019s young people, particularly infants, and those who are elderly and that would be our priority in any operation we\u2019re able to put in place.\u201d On Wednesday the death toll from the virus reached 132 in China and there are more than 5,900 confirmed cases of infection on the mainland. There have been no deaths from coronavirus outside China. Morrison said it could not be guaranteed that the Australian plane could land and evacuate the Australian and New Zealand citizens. \u201cI want to stress that \u2026 we cannot give a guarantee that this operation is able to succeed and I also want to stress very clearly that we may not be in a position if we\u2019re able to do this on one occasion to do it on another occasion. \u201cThere are many complications and many issues that we\u2019re going to have to overcome.\u201d The prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, said her government was in close contact with Chinese authorities over New Zealand nationals, and working closely with Australia. \u201cI spoke with prime minister Morrison again this afternoon and we have confirmed that we will work together on a joint Anzac-assisted departure of Australians and New Zealanders from Wuhan. \u201cSpecific details of the evacuation plan, including the medical protocols that will be applied to returning New Zealanders, and access arrangements on the ground in China, are being worked through by officials.\u201d The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said just over 600 Australians were registered as being in Hubei, which has been under a militarily enforced lockdown for nearly a week. Payne said the Australian government had upgraded its travel advice, saying Australians should reconsider their need to travel to China, and not to travel to Hubei province. The New Zealand government followed suit on Wednesday. \u201cChinese authorities have restricted travel for parts of the country and may extend these restrictions at short notice,\u201d the New Zealand advice says. \u201cTravellers may be quarantined, due to their health condition or previous location.\u201d There are five confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia \u2013 four in New South Wales and one in Victoria \u2013 but the federal chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said this number was expected to rise. He said the risk was \u201cextremely low\u201d, adding: \u201cWe want to stress that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission in Australia.\u201d Authorities are still working to trace all human contact made by infected patients since they entered the country from China. Morrison said the Christmas Island immigration detention centre would be repurposed as a quarantine centre, augmented by medical and military logistics teams. Currently the detention centre is being used to house just four people \u2013 Sri Lankan couple Priya and Nades Murugappan, and their Australian-born daughters Kopika and Tharunicaa.

      "bodyText": "Live US politics reporting continues on Wednesday\u2019s blog: Donald Trump\u2019s attorneys concluded their opening arguments in the president\u2019s impeachment trial. Over the next two days, Senators will submit questions to both legal teams, and lawmakers are expected to debate and vote on whether to call witnesses on Friday. As Senate Republicans wrestle with whether or not to call in witnesses, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton was \u201cinadmissible\u201d. Senate leader Mitch McConnell has reportedly told Republicans they don\u2019t have the votes to block witnesses. The administration unveiled an Israeli-Palestinian peace proposal, which Palestinian leaders had pre-emptively rejected. The question of whether or not the Senate will consider additional evidence and testimony loom over the impeachment trial, now that the president\u2019s defense team has concluded its opening arguments. Read the key takeaways from today: FOIA reveals Rick Perry\u2019s talking points for Zelenskiy inauguration A watchdog group\u2019s FOIA request to the Energy Department yielded emails, messages, and notes as well as the talking point that former energy secretary Rick Perry took to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian president Vlodomry Zelenskiy. Perry was one of the \u201cthree amigos\u201d involved in Ukraine policy, and became a kew figure in the impeachment inquiry against Trump. As Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders spar on the campaign trail, the former vice president\u2019s campaign maintains that he\u2019s committed to backing the Democratic nominee, whoever it is. The tension between the former vice president and the progressive Vermont senator has been building as the Iowa caucus approaches next week. Though Biden had previously committed to endorsing the Democratic nominee, \u201cregardless\u201d of who wins the primaries, he appeared to be vacillating on Sanders. The two have clashed over foreign policy, trade, and social security. Last week, Biden\u2019s campaign released an ad accusing Sanders of negative attacks on the former vice president\u2019s and mischaracterizing his record on social security. Sanders\u2019 campaign lobbed back that it was Biden who was going negative. Sanders did apologize after a supporter\u2019s op-ed in The Guardian called Biden \u201ccorrupt\u201d. The two frontrunners are fighting off Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg ahead of the Iowa caucus. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make judgments now,\u201d Biden told reporters in Iowa, where he has been campaigning this week. \u201cI just think that it depends upon how we treat one another between now and the time we have a nominee.\u201d The Associated Press and other outlets interpreted this as vacillation. But Biden\u2019s campaign contested reports that he wouldn\u2019t back the Democratic nominee, whoever it is. Though Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has reportedly told senators privately that he doesn\u2019t have votes to block new witnesses in the impeachment trial, per multiple reports, there are still several days till senators would vote on the matter. Senate Republicans may still block witnesses, and some GOP lawmakers are confident they\u2019ll be able to do so, according to CNN. Lev Parnas\u2019 lawyer is expected to attend the Senate trial tomorrow. Joseph Bondy asked Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer for gallery tickets, according to The Daily Beast, which first reported the news. Bondy\u2019s co-counsel Stephanie Schuman is also expected to appear. Parnas himself may not be able to, as he wears an ankle monitor and electronics are banned in the trial chamber. Republicans may not have enough votes to block witnesses, and they know it according to a Wall Street Journal report. Though most Senate Republicans have dismissed the need to call witnesses, a few key members, including Mitt Romney of Utah and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have indicated an openness to hearing new testimony. Feinstein clarifies her statement: \u2018It\u2019s clear the president\u2019s actions were wrong\u2019 An Axios reporter who initially posed a question about acquittal to the senator today further clarified: Feinstein was open to potentially acquitting Donald Trump before, but is less so now. Is Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein open to acquittal? After the president\u2019s defense team concluded their arguments today, Feinstein, a Democrat of California, seemed to suggest she\u2019s not entirely opposed to acquittal. \u201cNine months left to go, the people should judge. We are a republic, we are based on the will of the people \u2014 the people should judge,\u201d Feinstein told the LA Times. \u201cThat was my view and it still is my view.\u201d Per the LA Times: Still, she indicated that arguments in the trial about Trump\u2019s character and fitness for office had left her undecided. \u201cWhat changed my opinion as this went on,\u201d she said, is a realization that \u201cimpeachment isn\u2019t about one offense. It\u2019s really about the character and ability and physical and mental fitness of the individual to serve the people, not themselves.\u201d Asked whether she would ultimately vote to acquit, she demurred, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not finished.\u201d At 86, Feinstein is the oldest member of the Senate. She\u2019s expected to retire after she completes the remaining four years of her term \u2014 so she doesn\u2019t necessarily need to consider how going against the grain will affect her chances of reelection in Blue-state California. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is the only other Senate Democrat whose vote to remove Trump from office isn\u2019t assured. On Fox News, he said, \u201cI am totally undecided,\u201d on how he\u2019ll vote. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump\u2019s lawyers concluded their opening arguments in the impeachment trial, advising senators to vote for acquittal and \u201cend the era of impeachment for good.\u201d The president\u2019s lawyers argued that John Bolton\u2019s manuscript was \u201cinadmissible\u201d for the impeachment trial because it included an \u201cunsourced allegation,\u201d a claim that impeachment managers said only emphasized the need for the former official to testify. Senate Republicans continued to wrestle with whether to support calling witnesses in the impeachment trial, although Susan Collins reiterated that she was \u201cvery likely\u201d to support the proposal. John Kelly, the president\u2019s former chief of staff, said he believes Bolton, who reportedly claimed in his forthcoming book that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. The Trump administration unveiled its Israeli-Palestinian peace proposal, which was automatically rejected by Palestinian leaders. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Speaking to CNN, Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s adviser and son-in-law who spearheaded the crafting of the administration\u2019s Israeli-Palestinian peace proposal, warned Palestinians against rejecting the deal. \u201cThe Palestinian leadership have to ask themselves a question: do they want to have a state? Do they want to have a better life?\u201d Kushner said. He then presented an ultimatum to the Palestinians. Kushner said, \u201cIf they do, we have created a framework for them to have it, and we\u2019re going to treat them in a very respectful manner. If they don\u2019t, then they\u2019re going to screw up another opportunity, like they\u2019ve screwed up every other opportunity that they\u2019ve ever had in their existence.\u201d But the Palestinian president has already rejected any possibility of agreeing to the White House\u2019s proposal. \u201cWe say a thousand times, no, no, no to the deal of the century,\u201d Mahmoud Abbas said. \u201cWe rejected this deal from the start and our stance was correct.\u201d Echoing her earlier comments, Republican senator Susan Collins told CBS News that she is \u201cvery likely\u201d to support calling witnesses for the impeachment trial. Collins said she and her Republican colleagues have had \u201ca lot more conversations\u201d about witness testimony since the publications of the report about John Bolton\u2019s book, which reportedly includes an allegation that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. Asked whether they were four Republicans who would support calling witnesses, Collins said, \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that question yet.\u201d But she added, \u201cI, for one, believe that there\u2019s some gaps, some ambiguities that need to be cleared up, and more information tends to be helpful when you\u2019re making such a weighty decision.\u201d Exiting a meeting with fellow Republican senators, John Cornyn said the caucus had not reached a decision on calling witnesses to testify in the impeachment trial. Three-quarters of registered voters support calling witnesses to testify in the impeachment trial, according to a newly released poll. The Quinnipiac survey found that 75% of voters are in favor of calling witnesses in the Senate trial, a figure that includes 49% of Republicans and 75% of independents. On the question of whether Trump should be removed from office, voters remain divided, with 48% opposing removal and 47% supporting it. But a majority of voters, 53%, say Trump is not telling the truth about his actions toward Ukraine, and 57% say they would like the president to provide more details about those interactions. Angus King, an indpendent senator who caucuses with the Democrats, has downgraded his prediction for how many Republican senators will support calling new witnesses to testify in the impeachment trial. King said yesterday that he thought Democrats would win over more than four Republicans, which is the minimum needed to get the proposal approved. \u201cI think there\u2019ll be more than four,\u201d King told NPR. \u201cMy bold prediction is there\u2019ll be five or 10.\u201d But speaking to CNN just now, King adjusted that estimate, calling it \u201cnaive.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be really close,\u201d King said of the vote on witnesses. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff stressed that senators needed to hear from John Bolton, whose book about his time in the Trump administration will be published in March. \u201cAre we really going to require the country to wait until his book comes out to find out information the senators could use?\u201d Schiff asked. The lead impeachment manager was also asked about the possibility that he could be called to testify if the Senate approves calling new witnesses. \u201cI can tell you what my testimony is,\u201d Schiff replied. \u201cHe\u2019s guilty, and he should be impeached.\u201d The House impeachment managers are now addressing reporters after an \u201cabrupt end\u201d to the Trump team\u2019s opening arguments, as lead manager Adam Schiff described it. Schiff said the president\u2019s lawyers did not address the allegations at the heart of the impeachment trial because they \u201ccannot defend the president on the facts.\u201d Echoing his earlier comments, Schiff said Trump\u2019s team fortified Democrats\u2019 argument for the necessity of John Bolton\u2019s testimony. \u201cI don\u2019t think, frankly, that we could have made as effective a case for John Bolton\u2019s testimony as the president\u2019s lawyers,\u201d Schiff said. During the brief recess before Trump\u2019s lawyers concluded their opening arguments, Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were seen chatting on the floor. Collins and Murkowski, along with Mitt Romney, are considered the most likely Republican senators to support Democrats\u2019 demand for new witnesses to testify in the impeachment trial. After chatting with Murkowski, Collins delviered an envelope to impeachment manager Jerry Nadler, who missed yesterday\u2019s proceedings because his wife has been diagnosed with pancreativ cancer. The Senate impeachment trial has adjourned and will resume tomorrow, when the senators begin the question-and-answer portion of the proceedings. There will be two days of questioning, spread over Wednesday and Thursday, and Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts said that answers should not last longer than five minutes, as they did during Bill Clinton\u2019s trial. After the two days of questioning, the Senate will move on to the all-important vote about calling new witnesses to testify in the trial. White House counsel Pat Cipollone has concluded the opening aguments for Trump\u2019s team, urging the Senate to reject the articles of impeachment. \u201cIt is time for this to end here and now,\u201d Cipollone said. The White House counsel advised the senators to do \u201cwhat the Constitution compels you to do: reject these articles of impeachment for the country and for the American people.\u201d Cipollone encouraged the senators to \u201cend the era of impeachment for good.\u201d He added, \u201cThis should end now, as quickly as possible.\u201d The impeachment trial has resumed, and White House counsel Pat Cipollone is now delivering the final presentation for the Trump team\u2019s opening arguments. \u201cAll you need in this case is the Constitution and your common sense,\u201d Cipollone said. The White House counsel then played a series of clips from Democratic lawmakers, some of whom are now impeachment managers and senators, criticzing the impeachment of Bill Clinton. \u201cYou were right,\u201d Cipollone said of the Democrats\u2019 warnings about misusing impeachment as a political weapon. \u201cBut I\u2019m sorry to say you were also prophetic.\u201d Even though the Senate impeachment trial will continue tomorrow, Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar has scheduled a quick trip to Iowa tonight. The Minnsota senator\u2019s camapign announced she will appear at a campaign event in Council Bluffs tonight, with just six days to go until the Iowa caucuses. The four senators running for president -- Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Klobuchar and Michael Bennet -- have had to severely restrict their Iowa appearances in the final days before the caucuses because of the impeachment trial. Some of their opponents, including Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, have sought to capitalize on their absence by hosting a number of events across the street over the past week. During his presentation, Jay Sekulow repeatedly dismissed the manuscript of John Bolton\u2019s book as \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cunsourced,\u201d while questions continue over whether the former national security adviser will be called to testify in the impeachment trial. But lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff said the argument from Trump\u2019s lawyers actually underscored the need to call Bolton as a witness so that questions about his allegations can be addressed. \u201cOnce again, the president\u2019s team - in a way that only they could - have further made the case for calling John Bolton,\u201d Schiff said. Bolton reportedly alleges in his forthcoming book that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. Jay Sekulow has concluded his presentation, arguing Trump\u2019s impeachment represented a partisan dispute over policy differences. \u201cThe bar for impeachment cannot be set this low,\u201d Sekulow warned as he finished his representation. Once Sekulow stepped away from the podium, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called for a 15-minute recess. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said they will deliver one more presentation after the break before resting their case for now. Lindsey Graham, one of the president\u2019s closest Senate allies, proposed earlier today that the manuscript of John Bolton\u2019s book be made available to senators in a \u201cclassified setting.\u201d But Jay Sekulow, a member of Trump\u2019s legal team, has just said Bolton\u2019s book should be considered \u201cinadmissible\u201d because it includes an \u201cunsourced allegation.\u201d If the president echoes that line of argument, it could scare Republican senators away from supporting a review of the manuscript, let alone calling Bolton as a witness in the trial. Jay Sekulow quoted from fellow Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz\u2019s presentation yesterday. which advanced the argument that the president\u2019s behavior was not impeachable, even if John Bolton\u2019s allegations are true. \u201cThere is no violation of law, there is no violation of the Constitution,\u201d Sekulow said. Sekulow also dismissed the manuscript of Bolton\u2019s book as \u201cinadmissible\u201d to the impeachment trial because it included an \u201cunsourced allegation.\u201d \u201cResponding to an unpublished manuscript that maybe some reporters have an idea of what it says, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call that,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cI\u2019d call it inadmissible.\u201d Jay Sekulow, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, is currently delivering a presentation that could be described as an airing of the president\u2019s grievances dating back to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller in 2017. Sekulow criticized Mueller\u2019s handling of the investigation and pointed to the anti-Trump text messages exchanged between former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page as evidence of the bureau\u2019s allegedly unfair treatment of the president. \u201cYou can\u2019t view this case in a vaccuum,\u201d Sekulow argued, going on to criticize House Democrats for trying to impeach a president in an election year. Trump\u2019s legal team issued a thinly veiled criticism of John Bolton, indicating the former national security adviser\u2019s book should not be a factor in the impeachment trial. Impeachment is \u201cnot a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, one of the president\u2019s lawyer. \u201cThat is politics unfortunately. and Hamilton put impeachment in the hands of this body, the Senate, precisely and specifically, to be above that fray.\u201d But Democrats have said Bolton\u2019s reported allegations go \u201cright to the heart\u201d of the impeachment trial and deserve to be examined. Some of Trump\u2019s Republican allies have sought to discredit John Bolton after the former national security adviser reportedly wrote in his book that the president directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of the Democrats. But Bolton has at least one Trump World figure in his corner: former White House chief of staff John Kelly. \u201cIf John Bolton says that in the book I believe John Bolton,\u201d Kelly told a Florida crowd last night. The retired Marine general added, \u201cEvery single time I was with him ... he always gave the president the unvarnished truth.\u201d Kelly said he would support calling new witnesses like Bolton to testify in the impeachment trial. \u201cSo I think if there are people that could contribute to this, either innocence or guilt ... I think they should be heard,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI think some of the conversations seem to me to be very inappropriate but I wasn\u2019t there. But there are people that were there that ought to be heard from.\u201d Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin is now delivering the first of three presentations today from Trump\u2019s lawyers. Philbin dismissed any notion that administration officials\u2019 decision to move the transcript of Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president to a more secure server represented a \u201ccover-up.\u201d Philbin said the move of the transcript, which former national security officials have described as highly unusual, was not done out of any kind of malicious intent. Opening today\u2019s proceedings with a prayer, Senate chaplain Barry Black expressed hope that the impeachment trial would not further divide the country. \u201cLord, grant that this impeachment trial will make our nation stronger, wiser and better,\u201d Black said. The Senate chaplain\u2019s prayers throughout the trial seem to have been laden with meaning for the senators. Last week, Black reminded the senators acting as jurors in the trial that \u201clistening is often more than hearing.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers have 15 hours and 33 minutes to conclude their opening arguments, but Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts noted it would not be possible to use their full remaining time. White House counsel Pat Cipollone quickly confirmed the president\u2019s team does not intend to use much of their remaining time today, with the goal of wrapping up \u201cby dinner time or well before.\u201d Cipollone said Trump\u2019s lawyers had planned three more presentations, with a brief break in between, before resting their case for now. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts has assumed his post in the Senate chamber, and the impeachment trial has now officially resumed. Trump\u2019s lawyers are scheduled to conclude their opening arguments today, and the Senate is exected to move on to question-and-answer sessions tomorrow. The Senate impeachment trial is set to resume in about 10 minutes, as Trump\u2019s lawyers finish delivering their opening arguments. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Republican senator Lindsey Graham suggested making the manuscript of John Bolton\u2019s book available to the Senate in a \u201cclassified setting,\u201d as Senate Republicans face pressure to back the Democratic proposal to call new witnesses for the impeachment trial. Trump unveiled his administration\u2019s Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, saying the proposal represented a \u201crealistic two-state solution.\u201d The president praised secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u2019s widely criticized treatment of NPR reporter Marie Louise Kelly. \u201cI think you did a good job on her, actually,\u201d Trump said of Pompeo. The blog will have updates and analysis from the Senate trial once it resumes, so stay tuned. Here\u2019s the video of Trump saying secretary of state Mike Pompeo \u201cdid a good job\u201d on NPR reporter Marie Louise Kelly, who was reportedly berated by Pompeo after she asked him pressing questions about his refusal to defend former US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch: The audience gathered at the White House for the announcement of the Israeli-Palestinian peace proposal laughed at this line. Trump then added to Pompeo, \u201cAre you running for Senate? I guess the answer is no, after that.\u201d A number of reporters pointed out that Trump\u2019s comments about the future of Jerusalem appeared to contradict each other. Trump said Jerusalem would remain Israel\u2019s \u201cundivided capital,\u201d but he then said that his administration\u2019s proposal would \u201cprovide a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem where America will proudly open an embassy.\u201d A former US ambassador to Israel under Barack Obama said this of the plan: Unveiling his administration\u2019s Israeli-Palestinian peace proposal, Trump praised secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who has become involved in a protracted feud with NPR after engaging in a contentious interview with reporter Marie Louise Kelly. \u201cThat was very impressive,\u201d Trump said after the gathered audience clapped for Pompeo. \u201cThat reporter couldn\u2019t have done too good a job on you yesterday. I think you did a good job on her, actually.\u201d Trump then asked Pompeo whether he intended to run for the Senate in his home state of Kansas, a possibility that the secretary of state has ruled out. Trump is apparently aware of Palestinian officials\u2019 opposition to his administration\u2019s proposal because he said at the White House that the plan includes \u201ca lot for the Palestinians.\u201d The US president argued the proposal \u201cwouldn\u2019t be fair\u201d if it did not include concessions to the Palestinians, but he told the audience gathered at the White House, \u201cDon\u2019t clap for that.\u201d Clearly trying to put pressure on the Palestinians, Trump said the plan represented a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d for Palestinians to ensure the creation of an independent state. Apparently trying to sound like a tough-talking negotiator, Trump also warned the Palestinians that another deal might not come around again. \u201cWe\u2019ll never have a team like we have right now,\u201d Trump said. Standing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said his administration\u2019s peace proposal represented a \u201crealistic two-state solution,\u201d indicating the plan would include the creation of a State of Palestine. The US president described the proposal as a \u201chistoric breakthrough\u201d and praised Netanyahu for \u201chaving the courage to take this bold step forward.\u201d \u201cThey want peace, and they want peace badly,\u201d Trump said of Israel. The AP has more details about the proposal: U.S. officials say President Donald Trump\u2019s long-awaited Middle East peace plan calls for the creation of a State of Palestine with its capital in portions of east Jerusalem, ending speculation as to whether his administration, in preparing a proposal without input from Palestinian leaders, would abandon a \u2018two-state resolution\u2019 to the conflict. The officials say the plan to be unveiled on Tuesday more than doubles the territory currently under Palestinian control, although it also recognizes Israeli sovereignty over major settlement blocs in the West Bank, something to which the Palestinians will almost certainly object. The Palestinians have already rejected the proposal, accusing Trump of being biased in favor of Israel as he has adopted policies that bolster Israel at their expense. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyu have arrived in the East Room of the White House to announce the administration\u2019s Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. Trump said Israeli youths are \u201cready for a more hopeful future\u201d and praised Israel for embracing peace. \u201cPeace transcends politics by any measure,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they want.\u201d Trump said the plan has the backing of Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, Netanyahu\u2019s opponent in Israel\u2019s upcoming elections, who is also visiting Washington this week. \u201cI was not elected to do small things or shy away from big prjects,\u201d Trump boasted of the plan. Trump will soon appear at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to unveil the administration\u2019s Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, even though the proposal faces little chance of success. The New York Times reports: President Trump will release a long-awaited Middle East peace plan on Tuesday that is expected to include a proposal for new Israeli borders and provide for Israeli sovereignty over much of the Jordan Valley, a strategic area on the eastern frontier of the West Bank abutting Jordan. ... Palestinian leaders, who no longer speak to Trump officials, are likely to oppose each of those elements, even if they are combined with the economic rewards of $50 billion or more that the Trump administration says it can deliver. That is why many analysts say the plan, developed under the supervision of Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, is relevant mainly for its potential effect on Israel\u2019s March 2 election, which is likely to decide the fate of the embattled Mr. Netanyahu, and as a distraction from the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial of Mr. Trump. Republican senator Joni Ernst is pushing back against Joe Biden after the Democratic presidential candidate pointed to her comments about the impeachment trial to argue Trump and his allies were trying to hurt his chances at the nomination. \u201cIowa caucuses are this next Monday evening,\u201d Ernst said yesterday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucus-goers. Will they be supporting Vice President Biden at this point? Not certain about that.\u201d Biden then tweeted out a video of Ernst\u2019s comments, saying it showed Republicans are \u201cscared to death I\u2019ll be the nominee.\u201d But Ernst is now claiming her initial comments were only meant to highlight Biden\u2019s past corruption, even though Ukrainian officials have confirmed the allegations against Biden are unfounded. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of trying to hide from the truth by refusing to sign off on calling new witnesses to testify in the impeachment trial. \u201cIf you vote with the White House to suppress, and cover up evidence, the odds are strong that the truth, the truth will eventually come out,\u201d Schumer warned his Republican colleagues. The Democratic leader also mocked the \u201cabsurd proposal\u201d from Republican senator Lindsey Graham that John Bolton\u2019s manuscript be made available to the Senate in a classified setting. \u201cIt\u2019s a book,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for it to be read in the SCIF unless you want to hide something,\u201d he added, referring to the secure area in the Capitol where classified information is shared. But other Democratic senators have voiced support for Graham\u2019s proposal, while emphasizing it does not go far enough. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer described Republicans\u2019 demands to have Hunter Biden as a \u201cdiversion\u201d meant to deflect attention away from the allegations against Trump. \u201cWhat can Hunter Biden tell us about the president\u2019s conduct with Ukraine?\u201d Schumer asked. \u201cWhat can Hunter Biden tell us about the president\u2019s obstruction of Congress? Nothing obviously.\u201d Schumer argued Republicans\u2019 insistence that Biden testify proved \u201cthey have no one to defend the president on the merits.\u201d Reports emerged last week that Democratic and Republican senators were considering a \u201cwitness swap\u201d to allow Trump officials like Bolton and the Bidens to testify, but Schumer then said the proposal was \u201coff the table.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer described the ongoing revelations from the manuscript of John Bolton\u2019s book as a \u201cdrip, drip, drip\u201d of information. \u201cIn that sense, this is reminiscent of Watergate,\u201d Schumer said, referring to the scandal that led to Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. The New York Democrat pointed to Bolton\u2019s willingness to testify as evidence of his higher level of credibility over Trump, who has tried to block officials from testifying. As senators wrestle with the question of whether to allow new witness testimony in the impeachment trial, Trump is busy chastizing Fox News for interviewing Democratic lawmakers. This is not a new complaint from Trump. Since the House formally launched the impeachment inquiry, the president has repeatedly lashed out against Fox for allowing Democrats on to the network. He has also previously lashed out against hosts who have criticized him -- including Shep Smith, who left the network in October. Despite the president\u2019s complaints, Fox saw its most successful year ever in 2019. The real question regarding Lindsey Graham\u2019s proposal to make John Bolton\u2019s manuscript available to senators is how it will affect witness testimony. Democrats have been pushing Republicans to support allowing new witness testimony in the impeachment trial, and they need at least four of their colleagues to cross party lines to get the proposal approved. But that mission could become more complicated if Bolton\u2019s manuscript is made available because Republicans who are wary about allowing new witness testimony could point to Graham\u2019s proposal as cover for opposing Democrats\u2019 proposal. After Lindsey Graham proposed making John Bolton\u2019s manuscript available to senators in a \u201cclassified setting,\u201d a number of reporters quickly noted the book is set for publication on March 17, raising serious questions about the necessity of its classification. Lindsey Graham, a top Trump ally who has been watched closely on how he would approach potential testimony from John Bolton, said he supported making the manuscript of the former national security adviser\u2019s book available to senators in a \u201cclassified setting.\u201d Senator James Lankford said yesterday that allowing the Senate access to the manuscript was the \u201cminimum amount that we should actually be able to get.\u201d \u201cI think getting that information first-hand would be really important for us,\u201d Lankford wrote in a Facebook post. However, it\u2019s unclear why the senators would need to review the manuscript in a \u201cclassified setting,\u201d considering Bolton reportedly believes the manuscript contains no classified information. Joe Biden jumped on comments made yesterday by Republican senator Joni Ernst to make the argument that Trump and his allies are trying to use the impeachment trial to hurt his chances at winning the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cIowa caucuses are this next Monday evening,\u201d Ernst, who faces her own reelection in Iowa this year, said at the Capitol yesterday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucus-goers. Will they be supporting Vice President Biden at this point? Not certain about that.\u201d Biden tweeted out the video hours later, saying it showed Republicans are \u201cscared to death I\u2019ll be the nominee.\u201d Presenting their opening arguments yesterday, Trump\u2019s lawyers defended the president\u2019s actions toward Ukraine by repeating unfounded corruption claims against Biden and his son, Hunter. \u201cWhy do they want to pay him millions of dollars?\u201d lawyer Eric Herschmann asked of Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities in Ukraine. \u201cWell, he did have one qualification, he was a son of the vice president of the United States. He was the son of the man in charge of the Ukrainian portfolio for the prior administration and we are to believe there is nothing to see here, that for anyone to investigate or inquire about this would be a sham.\u201d The White House has weighed in on the UK\u2019s decision to allow the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei to build parts of the country\u2019s 5G network. \u201cThe United States is disappointed by the UK\u2019s decision,\u201d an unnamed administration official said in a statement. \u201cThere is no safe option for untrusted vendors to control any part of a 5G network.\u201d Trump had blacklisted Huawei from involvement in the US 5G network and encouraged allies to follow suit. \u201cWe continue to urge all countries to carefully assess the long-term national security and economic impacts of allowing untrusted vendors access to important 5G network infrastructure,\u201d the administration official said. \u201cWe look forward to working with the UK on a way forward that results in the exclusion of untrusted vendor components from 5G networks.\u201d In some non-impeachment news, US lawmakers expressed criticism and disappointment after the UK announced it would allow the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei to build parts of the country\u2019s 5G network. The announcement comes fter Trump blocked Huawei from US 5G networks and urged allies to do the same. The Guardian\u2019s Heather Stewart and Dan Sabbagh report: The Chinese tech firm Huawei has been designated a \u2018high-risk vendor\u2019 but will be given the opportunity to build non-core elements of Britain\u2019s 5G network, the government has announced. The company will be banned from the \u2018core\u2019, of the 5G network, and from operating at sensitive sites such as nuclear and military facilities, and its share of the market will be capped at 35%. \u2018We are clear-eyed about the challenge posed by Huawei, which we today confirm is a high-risk vendor,\u2019 said a Whitehall source. Republican lawmakers criticized the UK for not following Trump\u2019s lead on Huawei: But Democrats argued UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to ignore Trump\u2019s advice underscored the declining global influence of the US, which they blamed on the current president: As Senate Republicans face scrutiny over whether they will support calling John Bolton to testify, the manuscript of the former national security adviser\u2019s book continues to make news. According to the New York Times, Bolton writes in the book that he had a conversation last year with attorney general Bill Barr about whether Trump was granting favors to autocratic leaders in countries like Turkey and China. The Times reports: Mr. Barr responded by pointing to a pair of Justice Department investigations of companies in those countries and said he was worried that Mr. Trump had created the appearance that he had undue influence over what would typically be independent inquiries, according to the manuscript. Backing up his point, Mr. Barr mentioned conversations Mr. Trump had with the leaders, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Xi Jinping of China. Mr. Bolton\u2019s account underscores the fact that the unease about Mr. Trump\u2019s seeming embrace of authoritarian leaders, long expressed by experts and his opponents, also existed among some of the senior cabinet officers entrusted by the president to carry out his foreign policy and national security agendas. The Justice Department put out a statement late last night denying the Times\u2019 report, claiming Bolton had mischaracterized the conversation with Barr: Good morning, live blog readers! The impeachment trial of Donald Trump will continue today, as the president\u2019s lawyers conclude their opening arguments. But the most interesting developments are happening outside the trial room, as Senate Democrats put the pressure on Republicans to support calling witnesses to testify. Those efforts have taken on newfound urgency following the revelations from John Bolton\u2019s manuscript. One Republican senator, Mitt Romney, has joined the Democrats\u2019 pressure campaign, reportedly making a \u201cstrong pitch\u201d for calling new witnesses during a caucus lunch yesterday. Republican senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski seem likely to support the witness request, but Democrats will need a fourth Republican colleague to join the cause in order to get the motion approved. Otherwise, this trial could wrap up in the next few days. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will unveil the administration\u2019s Israeli-Palestinian peace plan in a 12 pm ceremony. The president will also host a campaign rally in New Jersey tonight. Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Andrew Yang and John Delaney are in Iowa, with six days to go until the caucuses. Michael Bloomberg is on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Following an internal revolt from hundreds of journalists, the Washington Post said on Tuesday afternoon that a reporter it suspended had not violated the company social media policy by tweeting an article about Kobe Bryant\u2019s historical rape accusation hours after his death. The Washington Post\u2019s managing editor, Tracy Grant, also said the newspaper regretted speaking publicly about suspending Felicia Sonmez, a national politics reporter, for the tweets, which Post management had initially said \u201cundermined the work of her colleagues\u201d. \u201cAfter conducting an internal review, we have determined that, while we consider Felicia\u2019s tweets ill-timed, she was not in clear and direct violation of our social media policy,\u201d Grant said in an emailed statement. Shortly after Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash with eight others, including his 13-year-old daughter, Sonmez shared on Twitter a 2016 Daily Beast article, which revisited the 2003 rape accusation against Bryant made by a 19-year-old receptionist at a Colorado hotel. The teenager had told local police she had been raped in Bryant\u2019s hotel room but ultimately declined to testify in a criminal case. Bryant has always insisted the encounter was consensual and said in an apology: \u201cAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did.\u201d After sharing the story, Sonmez faced swift backlash online, including from the US president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr, who said: \u201cYou Washington Post reporters really can\u2019t help yourselves, can you?\u201d More than 300 journalists at the Post, one of the country\u2019s largest papers, signed a letter from its union expressing \u201calarm and dismay\u201d at the newspaper\u2019s decision to suspend Sonmez. The Washington Post Guild said Tuesday that Sonmez had been reinstated. The Post\u2019s opinion section also published an article by its own media critic slamming the move. \u201cIf journalists at the Post are prone to suspension for tweeting stories off their beats, the entire newsroom should be on administrative leave,\u201d wrote the critic, Erik Wemple. Sonmez told Wemple, the media critic, that someone had posted her home address online and that the newspaper\u2019s managing editor, Grant, had told her in an email that the Post\u2019s concerns with the tweets were that they didn\u2019t \u201cpertain\u201d to the reporter\u2019s \u201ccoverage area\u201d. Grant told Sonmez: \u201cYour behavior on social media is making it harder for others to do their work as Washington Post journalists,\u201d according to Wemple. In a letter to Grant, and the Post\u2019s editor-in-chief, Marty Baron, the Washington Post Guild said Sonmez left her home out of fear for her safety because of threats she received in response to the tweet \u201cand has gotten insufficient guidance from the Post on how to protect herself\u201d. The Guild said the Post previously issued a warning letter against Sonmez for violating its social media guidelines when she tweeted about being a survivor of sexual assault two years ago. Not only did the Guild express concern with how the Post responds to survivors of sexual violence, it also critiqued the company\u2019s \u201carbitrary and over-broad social media policy\u201d. Washington Post reporters further criticized the decision on Twitter. Amber Phillips, a reporter at the Post, shared the Guild statement on Twitter and said she would not be posting on the social media website any more until the Post clarified its social media policy and brought Sonmez back. Wesley Lowery, who won a Pulitzer prize with the Washington Post and announced he is leaving the newspaper on Tuesday, tweeted Wemple\u2019s article, saying he suspected by doing so the Post could argue he was violating its policy against criticizing colleagues. In a since-deleted tweet, Sonmez justified her decision to share the article: \u201cTo the 10,000 people (literally) who have commented and emailed me with abuse and death threats, please take a moment and read the story \u2013 which was written 3+ years ago, and not by me.

The data is contained in the federal government\u2019s report on law enforcement agencies\u2019 use of telecommunications data for investigating crimes and surveillance for the 2018-19 financial year. Under the mandatory data retention legislation, law enforcement must get a warrant to access a journalist\u2019s historical telecommunications metadata \u2013 including information on who they called, when they called or their location information. The journalist subject to the warrant has no knowledge that a warrant has been sought or issued, but a prime minister appointed public interest advocate can make submissions about whether to issue or refuse the warrant. The AFP was the only law enforcement agency to seek warrants to hunt down sources in the financial year, and came in a year where the AFP conducted raids at the ABC and on the home of the News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst in relation to leaks of government information. The high-profile raids led to a campaign from a broad range of media outlets in Australia, including Guardian Australia, for greater press freedom, and resulted in two parliamentary inquiries into press freedom. Late last year, the Right to Know coalition proposed to the joint parliamentary committee on intelligence and security amendments to legislation that would exempt journalists from criminal liability for bona fide reporting activity. It would also make the journalist information warrants contestable, where the journalist could present evidence or contest the application for the warrant. After last year\u2019s raids, the AFP was issued with a direction from the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, to consider the public interest implications before investigating leaks to journalists. The number of warrants sought is a threefold increase, but there was an overall reduction in the amount of data sought compared with the two warrants issued and 58 authorisations in the 2017-18 financial year. The report also reveals, for the first time, how law enforcement agencies are using the government\u2019s new anti-encryption legislation passed at the end of 2018. The AFP issued five technical assistance requests to tech companies, while New South Wales police issued two Tars. Tars are notices sent to tech companies or individuals seeking voluntary assistance for the purpose of investigating a serious crime. It is one stage below forcing compliance with a technical assistance notice, under threat of fines of up to $10m or jail time for individuals. The highly secretive nature of the notices means it is not revealed which companies were involved, or what assistance was offered.

      "body": "<p>Winston Peters is a colossus of New Zealand politics, and his New Zealand First party is, once again, poised to be the lynchpin in this year\u2019s election campaign. But so much hinges on whether his party makes it over the electoral system\u2019s all-important 5% threshold.</p> <p>Being the only centre party in parliament has made NZ First incredibly powerful. It can, and does, pivot between the left and right blocs of Labour-Greens and National-Act. Since 1996 when New Zealand adopted the mixed-member proportional electoral system, NZ First has decided the government three times \u2013 throwing its lot in with National once and Labour twice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/who-is-winston-peters-the-40-year-rise-of-new-zealands-next-acting-pm\">Who is Winston Peters? The 40-year rise of New Zealand's next acting PM</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This willingness to work with either side is why it was able to set up an auction between Labour and National after the last election in 2017, to secure the best deal in exchange for letting one of them lead the government. Jacinda Ardern\u2019s side won, resulting in Peters becoming deputy prime minister, and his party winning all sorts of policy prizes and ministerial positions.</p> <p>In government, the party has wielded great influence, preventing Labour from progressing reforms NZ First deem too liberal or leftwing. A proposed capital gains tax was vetoed, climate change and employment policies watered down. However, their pursuit of populist policies has also assisted the government\u2019s overall popularity in some ways \u2013 particularly in the regions where Labour is weak.</p> <p>Winston Peters\u2019 kingmaker role is likely to be reprised this year if \u2013 and it\u2019s a big if \u2013 his party survives. Right now NZ First are facing the same sort of headwinds they did as a junior coalition partner with Labour back in 2008 \u2013 right down to the accompanying finance scandals and lack of electorate seat as a backstop. It makes for a highly-unpredictable election year and outcome. Over the last two years the party\u2019s average poll rating has been 4%. Under New Zealand\u2019s proportional representation system, NZ First needs to get 5% of the vote or win an electorate seat \u2013 which is far from guaranteed, even if it cuts an electorate deal with Labour.</p> <p>In the last few months, the party has also weathered several scandals \u2013 particularly around whether they have broken electoral laws over political donations. Scandal is never far from NZ First, and this time could prove fatal to the party\u2019s self-styled anti-corruption and populist reputation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/jacinda-ardern-the-high-lows-of-her-term-in-office-so-far\">Jacinda Ardern \u2013 the highs and lows of her term in office so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If NZ First is wiped out, there is a much greater chance of National winning the election. National and Act would potentially have enough seats in parliament, possibly assisted by a new party, to form a government. If NZ First comes in under the 5% threshold, the mechanics of MMP would mean National and Act would require less than 50% of the vote to become the government.</p> <p>The National party would love to see NZ First out of parliament. One way of doing this, which National is rumoured to be contemplating, is to rule out working with NZ First after the next election. This would reduce the relevance of the minor party and NZ First\u2019s centre-right voters would be less likely to support the party, knowing their vote could only help the re-election of a Labour-led government.</p> <p>If NZ First are voted out, there is still a reasonable chance of a Labour-Green government being elected.

      "bodyText": "Winston Peters is a colossus of New Zealand politics, and his New Zealand First party is, once again, poised to be the lynchpin in this year\u2019s election campaign. But so much hinges on whether his party makes it over the electoral system\u2019s all-important 5% threshold. Being the only centre party in parliament has made NZ First incredibly powerful. It can, and does, pivot between the left and right blocs of Labour-Greens and National-Act. Since 1996 when New Zealand adopted the mixed-member proportional electoral system, NZ First has decided the government three times \u2013 throwing its lot in with National once and Labour twice. This willingness to work with either side is why it was able to set up an auction between Labour and National after the last election in 2017, to secure the best deal in exchange for letting one of them lead the government. Jacinda Ardern\u2019s side won, resulting in Peters becoming deputy prime minister, and his party winning all sorts of policy prizes and ministerial positions. In government, the party has wielded great influence, preventing Labour from progressing reforms NZ First deem too liberal or leftwing. A proposed capital gains tax was vetoed, climate change and employment policies watered down. However, their pursuit of populist policies has also assisted the government\u2019s overall popularity in some ways \u2013 particularly in the regions where Labour is weak. Winston Peters\u2019 kingmaker role is likely to be reprised this year if \u2013 and it\u2019s a big if \u2013 his party survives. Right now NZ First are facing the same sort of headwinds they did as a junior coalition partner with Labour back in 2008 \u2013 right down to the accompanying finance scandals and lack of electorate seat as a backstop. It makes for a highly-unpredictable election year and outcome. Over the last two years the party\u2019s average poll rating has been 4%. Under New Zealand\u2019s proportional representation system, NZ First needs to get 5% of the vote or win an electorate seat \u2013 which is far from guaranteed, even if it cuts an electorate deal with Labour. In the last few months, the party has also weathered several scandals \u2013 particularly around whether they have broken electoral laws over political donations. Scandal is never far from NZ First, and this time could prove fatal to the party\u2019s self-styled anti-corruption and populist reputation. If NZ First is wiped out, there is a much greater chance of National winning the election. National and Act would potentially have enough seats in parliament, possibly assisted by a new party, to form a government. If NZ First comes in under the 5% threshold, the mechanics of MMP would mean National and Act would require less than 50% of the vote to become the government. The National party would love to see NZ First out of parliament. One way of doing this, which National is rumoured to be contemplating, is to rule out working with NZ First after the next election. This would reduce the relevance of the minor party and NZ First\u2019s centre-right voters would be less likely to support the party, knowing their vote could only help the re-election of a Labour-led government. If NZ First are voted out, there is still a reasonable chance of a Labour-Green government being elected. Freed of the more centrist or moderate impulses of Peters, such an administration would likely have a stronger leftwing or radical agenda than the current Ardern-led one. However, if Peters has shown anything over a career that has spanned 40 years, and seen triumphs, defeats and comebacks, it\u2019s that you can never count him out. NZ First often campaigns very well in election year, and as a pragmatic conservative populist party is very adept at scratching the electoral itches that might help push the party above 5%. The usual targets are immigration, M\u0101ori separatism, law and order, foreign ownership and various injustices. As an elder statesman of parliament, Peters is increasingly unwilling to go so hard with conservative populism. But his heir apparent, Shane Jones, has willingly taken up the role of rabble-rouser. If this election turns into a \u201cculture war\u201d, with National attempting to accentuate polarising social issues as a way to wedge this government apart from centrist voters, Shane Jones is shaping up to take advantage. His self-styled \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d stances and utterances, designed to provoke outrage and invoke the wrath of progressives, are straight out of the Peters playbook. This week Jones has shown once again the power of provocation, when he referred to a M\u0101ori land rights leader as a \u201cputiputi\u201d (young flower), leading to condemnation for sexism and an open letter from 100 M\u0101ori leaders asking him to apologise. Although most New Zealanders might agree that Jones is out of line once again, there will be enough who will stand firmly with Jones.

Are they right? What\u2019s the issue? The Australian published comments by four Coalition backbenchers suggesting New Zealand\u2019s climate change minister, James Shaw, was a hypocrite for saying there had been an \u201callergic reaction\u201d in the international community to countries wanting to use an accounting measure to meet their 2030 climate target under the Paris agreement. There is no question Shaw was referring to Australia: it is the only country planning to use the measure \u2013 carryover credits claimed for having emitted less than previous self-set targets \u2013 under the Paris agreement. The backbenchers said New Zealand government was itself relying on carryover credits, in this case to meet its 2020 target under the Kyoto protocol. The newspaper followed up with an editorial on Wednesday headed \u201cJacinda Ardern\u2019s climate policy virtue signal exposed\u201d, saying among other things that New Zealand was not on track to meet the 2030 target it lodged in Paris. Who was quoted and what did they say? Jason Falinski, a moderate from New South Wales, said NZ had shown a \u201clack of consistency and standards\u201d in criticising countries for using the credits. James Paterson, a Victorian senator and former staff member at climate change-denying Institute of Public Affairs, said it was appropriate for Australia to \u201creserve the right to get credit for its success in reducing emissions\u201d.

Is what they say correct? At one highly qualified level, yes: New Zealand says it will use 27.7m tonnes of carry-over credits to meet its 2020 target under the Kyoto protocol. Like Australia, it \u201cbeat\u201d its target under the first stage of the Kyoto protocol, the precursor to the Paris agreement, which included targets for developed countries up to 2012. It means that, like Australia, it could carry those credits forward and count them against its target for the second stage of the Kyoto deal, which ends this year. Unlike Australia, New Zealand would need the credits to meet its 2020 Kyoto target (a 5% cut below 1990 levels). Australia will meet its 2020 target without them. Isn\u2019t that clear hypocrisy?

New Zealand deserves criticism for not meeting its Kyoto target.

Shaw is not being hypocritical in suggesting Australia shouldn\u2019t use Kyoto carryover credits to meet its 2030 Paris target for one, simple reason: the agreement struck in the French capital is a completely different treaty to Kyoto. The rules of the Kyoto protocol are clear: countries can claim credit against future targets if they beat earlier targets. The Paris agreement does not mention carryover credits, and is legally separate to the Kyoto agreement. Credits from Kyoto have no formal status under it, and New Zealand has no plan to use them its 2030 target. The implied goal of the Paris deal is net zero emissions, which means boosting cuts over time, not finding ways to limit them. While the Morrison government claims otherwise, Australia\u2019s attempt to use Kyoto credits under Paris has been widely criticised by other countries and remains a point of unresolved disagreement at UN negotiations. Laurence Tubiana, an architect of the Paris accord, told the Financial Times: \u201cIf you want this carryover, it is just cheating. Australia was willing, in a way, to destroy the whole system, because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement.\u201d Shaw\u2019s claim that there has been an \u201callergic reaction\u201d to Australia\u2019s planned reliance on carry over credits might be colourful, but is not hypocritical nor inaccurate. With at least 100 countries signed up to groups that oppose them, it seems a pretty reasonable call. Bill Hare, from policy and science institute Climate Analytics, puts it more bluntly. He says New Zealand should be applauded for rejecting the use of carryover in the Paris deal, and the hypocrites in this exchange are the Australian politicians who profess to be concerned about climate change while promoting policies, including the use of carryover credits, that will result in higher emissions.",

Analysis by the Local Government Association (LGA) found that councils collectively spent \u00a3663m on homelessness services in 2018-19 \u2013 a 28% overspend amounting to a \u00a3140m excess budget. It warned that local homelessness services were being pushed to \u201cbreaking point\u201d by rising demand caused by a shortage of social housing and the gap between rents and housing benefit, which made housing unaffordable for low-income families. Cllr David Renard, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, said homelessness was one of the most pressing issues facing councils. \u201cTo reverse rising levels of homelessness, which represents huge human consequences and financial costs, the government needs to invest in homelessness prevention.\u201d Cllr Kieron Williams, cabinet member for housing management and modernisation at Southwark council which overspent by \u00a34m in 2018-19 said councils would continue to struggle without government action to fix the broken housing market and reforms to the benefits system to ensure it covers the cost of renting locally. He added: \u201cLast year we received 3,054 homelessness applications, up from 2,685. History tells us to expect that kind of surge in a recession but it\u2019s over a decade since the last crash and nationally the numbers are still going up.\u201d The LGA said councils needed desperately to be allowed to build more social housing and called on the government to boost local housing allowance (LHA) benefit rates to protect families at risk of becoming homeless. Housing charity Shelter estimates that around 370,000 low income households renting privately in England struggle to bridge an average \u00a3113 a month gap between their rent and their LHA benefit payments. Official government figures highlighted by Shelter show that there was a net loss of 17,000 social homes in England in 2019. Some 23,740 were sold under right to buy or demolished, while just 6,287 new homes for social rent came on stream.

A chunk of the overspending has gone on putting homeless families up in bed and breakfast accommodation, up a fifth to \u00a3115m in 2018-19. There are currently 7,110 homeless households in B&amp;Bs \u2013 a 15-year high, according to the LGA. The growing cost of housing homeless families has alarmed local authorities, which spent nearly \u00a31bn in England alone on temporary accommodation in 2018-19, up 71% from the \u00a3584m spent in 2012-13. More than 86,000 households are currently in temporary accommodation, including 127,000 children. Ministers have announced a \u00a3112m rough sleeping grant to fund up to 6,000 bed spaces and 2,500 support staff across England and pledged to end rough sleeping by 2024. \u201cNo-one should have to face a night on the street and we have a moral duty to support those who need help the most,\u201d said housing secretary Robert Jenrick. A surge in rough sleeping saw 4,677 people bedding down on the streets or in sheds and tents in 2018, according to latest official government figures. This is 165% higher than in 2010, and charities say the figures are conservative. However, rough sleeping accounts for just a tiny fraction of overall homelessness figures. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, said: \u201cIt is very encouraging that the government has launched its Rough Sleeping Initiative and is investing in funding to tackle this urgent issue. \u201cHowever, we need to make sure we find long-term solutions rather than just keeping people homeless in night shelters. Low incomes and high rents are forcing people into homelessness in the first place and this is what we need to address urgently.\u201d",
