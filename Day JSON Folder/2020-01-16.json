Having decided before Christmas to pull out of the Australian Open, the 32-year-old has now withdrawn from two tournaments in Europe next month that were seen as key moments in his stuttering comeback. \u201cThe bone bruising is taking longer to heal than first thought, so I won\u2019t be playing in Montpellier or Rotterdam in February,\u201d the former world No 1 said from his Surrey home on Thursday night. Murray, who pulled out of his Australian trip at the last minute \u2013 also missing the ATP Cup in Sydney \u2013 will be more concerned than he admits about the bruising in his right thigh bone, where he had a metal insert last year to repair his chronically painful hip. He has not played since surviving five tough sets in the first round of the Davis Cup in Madrid in November and has been working hard on his recovery with his fitness team. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush anything or put a timeline on my recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to listen to my body and step back on the court to compete when the time is right.\u201d This latest setback is one of many since the afternoon at Wimbledon more than two and a half years ago when he limped out of the tournament after five sets against the American Sam Querrey.

Was that fair to the president? \u201cIt\u2019s just being observant,\u201d said Harris, a former California attorney general. \u201cBecause he has committed crimes in plain sight.\u201d Likewise, the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham has said he would \u201cdo everything I can\u201d to make impeachment \u201cdie quickly\u201d. \u201cI am trying to give a pretty clear signal I have made up my mind,\u201d he said during an interview with CNN at the Doha Forum in Qatar last month. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to reach a verdict and the verdict is going to be acquittal,\u201d the Texas senator Ted Cruz said in an interview on Fox News. \u201cThe verdict is going to be not guilty.\u201d Fairness, it would seem, is in the eye of the beholder. There remains a flicker of hope that at least one critical element of the trial might be bipartisan: the thorny decision of whether to summon new witnesses and documents. For weeks, the chambers were at an impasse over precisely how and when to proceed to the trial stage of the impeachment inquiry. After a month-long delay, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, relented and on Wednesday the chamber voted to send two articles of impeachment to the Senate. \u201cTime,\u201d she declared, \u201chas been our friend.\u201d As the House signed and delivered articles, new details were emerging about Trump\u2019s alleged effort to extract a political favor from Ukraine, which is at the heart of his impeachment trial. Troves of documents and interviews from Lev Parnas, an associate of the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, offered fresh insight into the alleged pressure campaign and Trump\u2019s involvement. And just hours before proceedings got under way on Thursday, a non-partisan federal watchdog agency concluded that the Trump administration had violated the law by withholding congressionally approved military assistance to Ukraine, another matter at the heart of the case against the president. Democrats said the report strengthened their argument to allow new documents and evidence during the Senate trial. A small but influential contingent of Republican senators have said they would like to hear from witnesses, particularly John Bolton, the former White House national security adviser who was present for many key episodes covered by the House\u2019s inquiry. Democrats only need four Republicans to force a vote on whether to subpoena a witness. But their effort to \u201cdo impartial justice\u201d faces a new obstacle. The Kentucky senator Rand Paul has vowed political retribution for displays of disloyalty. If any Republican lawmaker helped Democrats call a witness they hoped to hear from, Paul said he would force a retaliatory vote on a controversial witness the senators hoped to avoid. At the top of the list is Hunter Biden, son of the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company and is at the center of a corruption conspiracy theory promoted by Republicans, and the whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment inquiry. \u201cIf you vote against Hunter Biden, you\u2019re voting to lose your election, basically,\u201d Paul told Politico this week. Opening the door to witnesses could disrupt McConnell\u2019s carefully laid plans for the Senate trial that he intended to have \u201conly one outcome\u201d. \u201cThe weight of history sits on [our] shoulders,\u201d Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said after the swearing-in ceremony concluded, \u201cand produces, sometimes, results you never know will happen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Around the world, capital cities celebrated the new year and new decade with fireworks. Many people were disappointed with London\u2019s show, as smoke obscured the views amid still air. Lack of wind also slowed the dispersion of firework smoke throughout London, creating the year\u2019s first air pollution incident in the capital. It was also the first such incident to be recorded on any New Year\u2019s Day in London since the start of modern measurements of particle pollution in 1993. For four hours, the air was filled with tiny particles of the metals that are used to make firework colours. These included barium, copper and strontium that produce white, green, blue and red colours, along with potassium and chloride that are used as firework propellants. Air pollution from northern France also reached the city later in the day. In 2019 over 300,000 people signed a UK petition to ban the sale of fireworks to the public. New Year\u2019s Day fireworks in Sydney divided public opinion at a time when firefighters were tackling still-burning deadly bushfires and people were losing their homes. Although pre-recorded a few days before, Shanghai\u2019s new year display, with lit drones creating shapes in the sky, may be a more environmentally-friendly, but still spectacular, way to start future new years.",

      "bodyText": "The first of three inquiries into Crown Resorts and the conduct of its casino business kicks off on Tuesday in Sydney, when the former supreme court judge Patricia Bergin is expected to outline how she intends to tackle her task. Witnesses are likely to be called at a later date, when the New South Wales inquiry \u2013set up at arm\u2019s length to the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority \u2013 begins in earnest. Two other inquiries \u2013 by the Victorian casino authorities and the public hearings to be held by federal Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, appear to be on hold for the time being, awaiting the results of investigations. At the same time, Crown is fighting efforts by shareholders who are suing it in a class action to take witness statements from company employees convicted in China for illegally promoting gambling. The NSW inquiry is expected to focus on the proposed $1.75bn sale of 20% of Crown to Lawrence Ho\u2019s Melco Resorts, and whether this sale gives rise to any issues about probity of close associates or breaches of a specific clause in Crown\u2019s licence for the Barangaroo casino which prevents Ho\u2019s father, Stanley Ho, and a list of specified companies being associates of Crown. The clause was inserted into the licence when it was granted in 2014 after an adverse finding by New Jersey authorities about Stanley Ho and possible alleged connections with triads in Macau and China. Bergin\u2019s inquiry will need to delve into the complex structures of Lawrence Ho\u2019s and Stanley Ho\u2019s casino empires in Macau and their financing to determine the answer to this question. But revelations soon after the deal was announced that Lawrence Ho was a director of one of the banned companies, Lanceford, raised immediate questions. As a result, Lawrence Ho, who had initially bought 10%, announced he would pause on the second 10% purchase. But in another hurdle for Melco, another company on the banned list, Great Respect, which is closely linked to Stanley Ho, remains the owner of more than 20% of Melco. The NSW casino legislation also includes broad requirements that close associates of a company which holds a casino licence must be of good repute and not have a business association with persons who are not of good repute. While Lawrence Ho has passed scrutiny in the past when Melco and Crown had a joint venture in Macau together, it is likely he will need to clear this hurdle again to become a significant shareholder in the Australian licence. The NSW inquiry is also looking at a number of issues raised by 60 Minutes and Nine that allegedly go to the probity of Crown itself. These included allegations of money laundering in Crown\u2019s high roller rooms in its casino in Melbourne, failures to report cash transactions and dealing with junket operators with links to drug traffickers, money launderers, human traffickers and organised crime. Bergin\u2019s terms of reference specifically refer to the allegations as raising questions of suitability. But as they occurred in Melbourne and do not go to conduct involving the NSW licence (Barangaroo is not yet open) there may be questions about jurisdiction and whether Bergin wants to be at the forefront on these issues. For its part, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation has put a \u201cre-examination\u201d of Crown\u2019s licence on hold while it waits for the outcome of a federal investigation that has also shown little signs of progress. \u201cIn order for the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation to complete this work, it awaits the findings of other investigations being undertaken by federal agencies, as most of the matters raised in the media fall within the remit of these agencies,\u201d its acting chief executive, Alex Fitzpatrick, told Guardian Australia. The VCGLR had updated the responsible minister in August 2019 and continues to keep the minister briefed as required, he said. The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity announced that it would hold public hearings to examine allegations that visa officials gave high rollers destined for Crown casino favourable visa treatment, with the former Border Force boss Roman Quaedvlieg set to be the first witness, but abruptly halted its plans just before Christmas. Other federal agencies including Austrac and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission are also likely to be involved in investigating money laundering allegations. ACLEI told Guardian Australia that it was \u201cconsidering a large volume of information relevant to the allegations of corruption in interactions between the Department of Home Affairs and Crown Casino\u201d. \u201cACLEI will make an announcement concerning public hearings on its website and Twitter when it is in a position to do so,\u201d a spokesperson said. That will almost certainly hold up the Victorian inquiry. \u201cIf commonwealth investigations identify misconduct by Crown or its employees, the VCGLR may be able to use this information in order to consider appropriate action,\u201d Fitzpatrick said, when explaining why Victoria was waiting. The ACLEI has not responded to Guardian Australia\u2019s inquiries this week. Crown has also been dealing with the VCGLR over the regulator\u2019s demands it beef up its anti-money laundering procedures and strengthen its protocols to exclude criminals from the Melbourne casino. It has satisfied the regulator on the first demand by appointing the former senior NSW police officer Nick Kaldas to advise the board. But the VCGLR rejected Crown\u2019s first attempt at a new exclusion protocol and has demanded a second proposal, which is now being considered by the regulator. If Lawrence Ho and Melco were found to be a business associate of his father or not of good repute, he would either have to drop his ambition to own a significant slice of Crown or he could potentially restructure Melco. This could see all or part of James Packer\u2019s 46% controlling stake back on the market and could provide another opportunity for other suitors such as Wynn to return to the negotiating table. But the broader suitability question is potentially more serious for Crown. The question is who wants to go first in investigating that question. Meanwhile, Crown has been fighting a legal battle to stop details of convictions in China against 19 former employees spilling into public as part of a shareholder class action against the company. Crown has appealed a federal court ruling made in May last year that voided previously secret confidentiality agreements it struck with the employees and allowed the law firm running the case, Maurice Blackburn, to obtain from them witness statements and documents relating to their court cases in China. The Crown 19 include Jenny Jiang, who appeared in 60 Minutes and Nine Newspapers as a whistleblower. The appeal is awaiting judgment before a trial of the class action that is set down for November.",

If this bushfire crisis, this nation-wide trauma, can\u2019t loosen the denialists\u2019 grip on Coalition climate policy, then maybe nothing will. That would mean everyone sifting through Scott Morrison\u2019s verbiage for signs that he might really be intending to change direction is searching in vain, because he\u2019s just trying to talk himself out of political trouble. It would mean everyone patiently pointing out that the prime minister could quite easily \u201cevolve\u201d his current policies into something that actually reduced Australia\u2019s greenhouse emissions could save their breath, because that isn\u2019t the kind of evolution he is considering. And it would mean there\u2019s no point reprising the facts, that Australia\u2019s emissions are flatlining, not falling, that we could seize an economic advantage in a low-carbon world and at the same time help the globe avoid the all too obvious costs of inaction. The Coalition cabal who apparently still call the shots thinks climate science is \u201cvoodoo\u201d. They\u2019re impervious to facts. They are already threatening, via anonymous quotes to the Australian, to \u201cblow the place up\u201d. Again. Just like they\u2019ve been blowing up national climate action for more than a decade. And as this week\u2019s Guardian Essential poll showed, despite the widespread sense that the fires are a tipping point, despite global outrage at the self-defeating stupidity of our policies, despite the world\u2019s largest fund manager ditching thermal coal, despite the wave of grief and anger from around the world \u2013 even from James Murdoch \u2013 it\u2019s still not clear that Australian public opinion will force this government to change.

After Morrison overthrew Malcolm Turnbull and ditched the Neg, the Business Council of Australia, desperate for someone to do something, was actually canvassing how companies could \u201cgo it alone\u201d , agree on on framework to just start getting on with it, and that idea is still under discussion in business circles. A bunch of billionaires are backing massive renewable energy export policies despite the lack of a coherent climate and energy policy. It would obviously be better for the federal government to fulfil its responsibilities, to do its job, but maybe it\u2019s time to concede that may never happen, and for the states, and the business community, to look for ways to work around it. We\u2019ve actually been in this position before. In the late 2000s, despairing in the face of an intransigent Howard government, the New South Wales government introduced one of the world\u2019s first mandatory greenhouse emission trading schemes and the premiers set up a taskforce to collaborate on turning it into a national system. But then, trailing in the polls and watching community concern mount as the millennial drought dragged on, John Howard dramatically reversed his government\u2019s long-standing sceptical stance and, in June 2007, announced details of a carbon trading scheme he would introduce if re-elected. \u201cBeing among the first movers on carbon trading in this region will present new opportunities for Australia.

      "bodyText": "As the Senate opened an impeachment trial in which Donald Trump will stand charged with abusing the power of his office, the president was hit with new allegations of wrongdoing by a federal watchdog agency. The Government Accountability Office released a finding on Thursday morning that the suspension last year of military aid for Ukraine at Trump\u2019s direction violated laws governing the disbursement of congressionally appropriated funds. Trump caused the law to be broken, the agency found. The White House did not immediately respond to the allegation of criminality. The opening of the Senate trial on Thursday brought the impeachment inquiry closer to its climax, nearly four months after Nancy Pelosi announced the investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged scheme to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. Trump, only the third president in US history to have been impeached, now faces a trial due to begin next week. The proceedings could result in the president\u2019s removal from office \u2013 but that is seen as unlikely. A group of seven impeachment managers from the House, led by the intelligence chair, Adam Schiff, arrived just after noon to the Senate chamber, where they were announced by the sergeant at arms, Paul Irving, reading from a historic script. \u201cHear ye, hear ye,\u201d Irving said. \u2018\u2018All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Donald John Trump.\u201d Schiff then read the articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging abuse of power, the second charging obstruction of Congress \u2013 to the senators, each of whom was seated at her or his individual desk. Later, the US supreme court\u2019s chief justice, John Roberts, was sworn in for his presiding role at the trial. He then swore in the 100 senators \u2013 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents \u2013 as jurors. Each senator signed an \u201coath book\u201d signifying a pledge of impartiality. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, moved for a summons to be sent to Trump, who was given until 6pm on Saturday to file an answer with the secretary of the Senate. House managers were given until 5pm on Saturday to file briefs in the case, with White House briefs required the next day and any House rebuttal due by noon on Tuesday. The Senate planned to reconvene for the trial at 1pm Tuesday, following the Martin Luther King Jr holiday. A two-thirds majority of voting senators would be required to convict Trump and remove him from office, but he appears to be extremely well insulated against that possibility by Republican loyalists. Despite his declaration last month that he could not be an \u201cimpartial juror\u201d in the case, McConnell vowed on Wednesday night that each senator would weigh the case against Trump with care. \u201cWe\u2019ll pledge to rise above the petty factionalism and do justice for our institutions, for our states and for the nation,\u201d McConnell said. But McConnell was back in his partisan foxhole on Thursday morning, vowing that the Senate would check the \u201crunaway passions\u201d of the House and indicating that he would continue to press for a trial limited in scope. \u201cNow they want the Senate to redo their homework and rerun the investigation,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what this process will be going forward. \u201cThe House\u2019s hour is over. The Senate\u2019s time is at hand.\u201d The White House released a statement on Wednesday that said \u201cPresident Trump has done nothing wrong\u201d and \u201cexpects to be fully exonerated\u201d. Extraordinary restrictions were in effect on Capitol grounds, including the penning of reporters in the halls of the Senate. Their attempts to interview members of Congress were interrupted by an unusual number of police officers on the scene. The Government Accountability Office finding that Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget had broken the law by withholding aid to Ukraine did not pose an immediate legal hazard for Trump personally, and the president has not been charged with a crime. But the finding by the GAO, which is part of the legislative branch, could impose further stress on Trump\u2019s Senate Republican defenders, who even before the trial began were lashing out at reporters asking about the continuing stream of evidence damaging to Trump. The team of impeachment managers is led by Schiff and the judiciary committee chair, Jerry Nadler. Trump has reportedly tapped the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, to lead his team. The managers delivered the articles of impeachment to the Senate in a ceremonial procession on Wednesday evening. \u201cWe are here today to cross a very important threshold in American history,\u201d Pelosi, the House speaker, said before a vote to transmit the articles. The second-ranking member of the Senate, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, swore in Roberts on Thursday. The chief justice then administered this oath to the senators: I solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws: so help me God. Addressing her colleagues on the House floor on Wednesday, Pelosi sharply rejected criticism by Republicans that she had delayed transmission of the articles. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about my timing,\u201d she said. After months of resisting calls \u201cfrom across the country\u201d for Trump\u2019s impeachment, she said, Trump ultimately \u201cgave us no choice. He gave us no choice.\u201d Trump was impeached in December for an alleged scheme in which he pressured Ukraine to announce false investigations of the former vice-president Biden and then fought an inquiry into the scheme. No US president has ever been removed through impeachment, though Richard Nixon resigned in the face of that prospect. While Trump\u2019s removal is unlikely, the trial holds political hazards for him. He succeeded in enforcing message discipline among Republicans as impeachment moved through the House last fall, but there were indicators that the conduct of some Republicans in the Senate would be more difficult to manage. A group of moderate Republicans has expressed openness in recent weeks to hearing from witnesses and a desire to weigh the charges against Trump on the merits. Those positions could quickly wither under personal pressure from Trump, who has directed rage at any suggestion that his conduct was less than perfect. House Republicans responded vigorously to Trump\u2019s demands that they defend him, offering worshipful assessments of Trump\u2019s conduct, which they said was motivated by Trump\u2019s desire to fight corruption in Ukraine. But that posture may become more difficult as new evidence continues to emerge of Trump\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. On Tuesday night, House Democrats released newly gathered evidence including a handwritten note by a Trump associate describing a plot involving the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Biden. Trump \u201cknew exactly what was going on\u201d in a scheme to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, that associate, Lev Parnas, told MSNBC on Wednesday night.

      "bodyText": "Has he delivered the most devastating blow yet to Donald Trump\u2019s defence? Or is he merely a desperate man trying to save his skin? Lev Parnas is the latest obscure figure to find himself thrust centre stage by the impeachment of the US president. A close associate of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Parnas on Wednesday added to evidence that Trump personally directed an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate one of his political rivals. \u201cPresident Trump knew exactly what was going on,\u201d he said in a televised interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Wednesday. \u201cHe was aware of all my movements \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president.\u201d The interview took place even as the House of Representatives transferred articles of impeachment to the Senate ahead of Trump\u2019s trial. But who is he \u2013 and can he be trusted? Lev \u2013 the name means \u201clion\u201d in Russian \u2013 Parnas was born in February 1972 in Odessa, Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. His family moved to America when he was three, first to Detroit, then to New York. When Parnas was 23, he settled in Florida. He co-founded a company called Global Energy Producers and, in 2013, another named Fraud Guarantee \u2013 reportedly so he could bury Google search results about a history of debts and court judgments against him. Parnas had little interest in politics until Trump ran for president. Parnas attended his campaign rallies and became a donor. \u201cParnas told me that he \u2018bumped into\u2019 Trump \u2018plenty of times\u2019 at events in New York over the years, but that they didn\u2019t get to know each other until the 2016 campaign,\u201d Adam Entous of the New Yorker reported. After Trump\u2019s shock win, Parnas became closer to Giuliani and worked on his behalf to collect dirt on Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine \u2013 which became the core of the impeachment inquiry that could lead to Trump\u2019s removal from office. Parnas told the New Yorker: \u201cBecause of my Ukrainian background and my contacts there, I became like Rudy\u2019s assistant, his investigator. I don\u2019t do anything on my own. I don\u2019t lobby people. I go get information. I set up a meeting. I make sure that the call went right. I make sure the translation is done right.\u201d Documents released this week suggest that Parnas was also involved in monitoring the movements of Marie Yovanovitch, who was ambassador to Ukraine until Trump abruptly recalled her last May. Ukraine said on Thursday it has launched an investigation into alleged illegal surveillance of Yovanovitch. Yuri Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general, said in an October interview that he and Parnas met for the first time with Giuliani in New York, and then later in Warsaw. Parnas became his main contact for the group, and they regularly exchanged SMS messages with articles from Ukrainian and US media. \u201cIt seemed to me that they were close to Giuliani and they really tried to help him with finding information about issues Mr Giuliani is interested in,\u201d Lutsenko said of Parnas and his business partner Igor Fruman. Lutsenko claimed he was not the one who set Parnas and Fruman and Giuliani against Yovanovitch. \u201cGiuliani and especially these two guys [Parnas and Fruman] told me they are against [Yovanovitch] as an ambassador long before our meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cI never asked for any activity against her \u2026 I never asked for any deal on this point.\u201d \u201cI find this story very funny. How could two American businessmen dismiss the ambassador?\u201d he said in the October interview. \u201cHow could Mr Giuliani dismiss an ambassador?\u201d After their meeting, he said, Parnas began asking for help organising other top-level meetings in Ukraine. \u201cHe asked me after our presidential elections to help with meeting the newly elected president [Zelenskiy], but I told him that it\u2019s impossible for me to help,\u201d said Lutsenko. \u201cWe exchanged some newspaper and mass media articles, but nothing else. I never shared legal materials with them. We never spoke about their business, I don\u2019t even know what business they\u2019re in.\u201d Last October Parnas and Fruman were arrested as they tried to flee the US. They were indicted on charges of conspiracy, making false statements and falsification of records and ordered to turn over key documents to congressional investigators. Prosecutors allege they made outsize campaign donations to Republican causes after receiving millions of dollars originating from Russia. Parnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty. Trump said last year: \u201cI don\u2019t know those gentlemen. I don\u2019t know what they do. Maybe you will have to ask Rudy.\u201d But numerous photos show Trump and Parnas together. Photos released from Parnas\u2019s phone this week show him not only with Trump but his son Donald Jr, daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner.

Burke said jurors were entitled to hold \u201cstrongly held beliefs\u201d about those issues, but they were not relevant in this case. \u201cThe sole issue is for you to decide whether or not the defendant committed certain acts which constitute a particular crime \u2026 You must decide this case on the evidence.\u201d The jurors are entitled to their own opinions about #MeToo, sexual harassment and women\u2019s rights, he said, so long as they don\u2019t allow those opinions to influence the verdict they must reach that will seal Weinstein\u2019s fate. But even before the trial began on 6 January, the criminal prosecution of Weinstein had become detached in notable ways from #MeToo. Not least, the numbers of women testifying in the trial is likely to be a fraction of the 105 women who have so far come forward to accuse the former film producer of sexual misconduct towards them. Only two women are being presented in court as the accusers in this case, representing two counts of rape and one of a criminal sexual act. A further four women are expected to testify about earlier alleged sexual assaults at Weinstein\u2019s hands which the prosecution will use to try to secure convictions on two counts that he engaged in predatory sexual assault \u2013 a pattern of behavior over many years that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The number of women has been whittled down to a total of just six partly because it has been very difficult for prosecutors to persuade alleged victims to expose themselves so publicly to potential character assassination by Weinstein\u2019s lawyers in cross-examination. Other women complained of being sexually harassed by the producer \u2013 alleged acts that can be and have been pursued in civil litigation but which are not classed as crimes. If selected, jurors will sit in judgment on a trial that will begin with opening statements next Wednesday and could last two months.",

      "body": "<p>Prosecutors have accused a former Barclays boss of proposing two separate illegal deals before settling on an advisory agreement that allegedly disguised the true nature of \u00a3322m in payments to Qatar in 2008.<br><br>The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) made the allegations during the first day of the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination of Thomas Kalaris, the former head of Barclays\u2019 wealth division. Kalaris was known as the \u201cquarterback\u201d for Barclays\u2019 emergency fundraising at the height of the financial crisis.<br><br>In a telephone transcript read to a jury at the Old Bailey, Kalaris proposed two ways in which Barclays could meet Qatar\u2019s demand for extra fees and secure the Gulf state\u2019s participation in the bank\u2019s rescue deal: interest paid on a large cash deposit in a Barclays account, or a share option deal that would allow Qatar to buy stock at a fixed price.<br><br>Focusing on the first proposal, Philip Stott, a prosecuting lawyer for the SFO, claimed that Kalaris was suggesting paying Qatar a very high interest rate that would not be offered to other clients as a way of funnelling extra funds to the Gulf state.</p> <p>Kalaris insisted there was nothing untoward about either option, including the cash deposit, which Barclays could use to fund loans for other customers. \u201cIf you were to do something that was commercially not of value, then I agree with you, it would be a means of delivering something incorrectly, illegally,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Stott responded: \u201cAlthough there\u2019s an advantage of having a very large deposit \u2026 If you were to pay vastly much more than that for no other reason than you wanted to secure their investment in a capital raising, that would be paying a disguised fee. It would be dishonest.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIf that was the case, the answer is yes,\u201d Kalaris responded.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you are suggesting and thinking about here to Mr Boath,\u201d Stott said. Richard Boath was head of Barclays\u2019 European financial institutions at the time.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, absolutely not,\u201d Kalaris said, later adding that the two ideas were solely part of a \u201cgeneral brainstorm\u201d that ultimately led to a legitimate side deal with Qatar. <br><br>The SFO has accused Kalaris and two former Barclays executives of devising fraudulent advisory services agreements in order to disguise payments worth \u00a3322m to Qatar. It alleges that the money was actually a fee demanded by Qatar in exchange for investing \u00a34bn in the bank as part of an \u00a311bn emergency fundraising drive at the height of the financial crisis.<br><br>The fees in effect meant that Qatar was able to purchase Barclays shares at a heavily discounted price not available to other investors.</p> <p>Kalaris and two former colleagues \u2013 Boath and Roger Jenkins, the former head of the lender\u2019s investment banking business \u2013 face charges of fraud as well as conspiracy to commit fraud. All three deny the charges.<br><br>A previous trial involving all three executives came to a close in April 2019, when the jury was discharged following four months of court proceedings. The former Barclays chief executive John Varley was a co-defendant in that trial, but was acquitted. </p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Prosecutors have accused a former Barclays boss of proposing two separate illegal deals before settling on an advisory agreement that allegedly disguised the true nature of \u00a3322m in payments to Qatar in 2008. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) made the allegations during the first day of the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination of Thomas Kalaris, the former head of Barclays\u2019 wealth division. Kalaris was known as the \u201cquarterback\u201d for Barclays\u2019 emergency fundraising at the height of the financial crisis. In a telephone transcript read to a jury at the Old Bailey, Kalaris proposed two ways in which Barclays could meet Qatar\u2019s demand for extra fees and secure the Gulf state\u2019s participation in the bank\u2019s rescue deal: interest paid on a large cash deposit in a Barclays account, or a share option deal that would allow Qatar to buy stock at a fixed price. Focusing on the first proposal, Philip Stott, a prosecuting lawyer for the SFO, claimed that Kalaris was suggesting paying Qatar a very high interest rate that would not be offered to other clients as a way of funnelling extra funds to the Gulf state. Kalaris insisted there was nothing untoward about either option, including the cash deposit, which Barclays could use to fund loans for other customers. \u201cIf you were to do something that was commercially not of value, then I agree with you, it would be a means of delivering something incorrectly, illegally,\u201d he said. Stott responded: \u201cAlthough there\u2019s an advantage of having a very large deposit \u2026 If you were to pay vastly much more than that for no other reason than you wanted to secure their investment in a capital raising, that would be paying a disguised fee. It would be dishonest.\u201d \u201cIf that was the case, the answer is yes,\u201d Kalaris responded. \u201cThat\u2019s what you are suggesting and thinking about here to Mr Boath,\u201d Stott said. Richard Boath was head of Barclays\u2019 European financial institutions at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s not, absolutely not,\u201d Kalaris said, later adding that the two ideas were solely part of a \u201cgeneral brainstorm\u201d that ultimately led to a legitimate side deal with Qatar. The SFO has accused Kalaris and two former Barclays executives of devising fraudulent advisory services agreements in order to disguise payments worth \u00a3322m to Qatar. It alleges that the money was actually a fee demanded by Qatar in exchange for investing \u00a34bn in the bank as part of an \u00a311bn emergency fundraising drive at the height of the financial crisis. The fees in effect meant that Qatar was able to purchase Barclays shares at a heavily discounted price not available to other investors. Kalaris and two former colleagues \u2013 Boath and Roger Jenkins, the former head of the lender\u2019s investment banking business \u2013 face charges of fraud as well as conspiracy to commit fraud. All three deny the charges. A previous trial involving all three executives came to a close in April 2019, when the jury was discharged following four months of court proceedings. The former Barclays chief executive John Varley was a co-defendant in that trial, but was acquitted. The trial continues.",

The number of people employed in the \u201clow carbon and renewable energy economy\u201d declined by more than 11,000 to 235,900 between 2014 and 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Green businesses fared little better, seeing their numbers drop from an estimated 93,500 to 88,500 over the same four-year period. The ONS said there was a small increase in the number of people employed in the green economy between 2016 and 2018, but this was not enough to offset a huge drop in the number of jobs and businesses between 2014 and 2016. Critics of the Conservative government\u2019s record of support for the low carbon and renewables sector blamed the Treasury\u2019s dramatic cut in subsidies to the solar power industry for the sudden loss of employment. Solar panel installers were among the many businesses connected to the industry that went bust after the Treasury cut subsidy payments by 65% in 2015 before abolishing them altogether last year. Of the UK\u2019s four countries, England saw the biggest fall in the number of green jobs followed by Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales was the only area to see an increase \u2013 from 10,000 to 11,400 jobs. Adding to the downbeat analysis, the ONS said the recent increase in activity was also mainly due to acquisitions in the renewable sector rather than an increase in investment. A report by the Committee on Climate Change, an independent government advisory body, found that UK emissions met the government\u2019s 2018 target, following a decline in emissions to 44% below 1990 levels. But a recent slowdown meant it was \u201cnot on track\u201d to meet the next target, which covers the period 2023-27, or to reduce emissions by at least 100% of 1990 levels by 2050.

The thinktank\u2019s director of economics, Asheem Singh, said: \u201cIt is pretty clear that the UK is well behind in meeting its next milestones and the 2050 target. \u201cReaching the target is inextricably linked to the growth of the green economy and it is clear from these figures that this just isn\u2019t happening.\u201d Britain\u2019s renewable energy industry has expanded in the last three years, mainly in response to the growth of offshore windfarms. The share of total electricity generation from renewables reached 38.9% in September, the highest recorded and higher than gas generation for the first time. But the industry employs relatively few workers in service companies while most turbines are manufactured abroad, limiting the scope for a dramatic rise in the number of people employed across the industry. The ONS figures showed that \u00a36.3bn worth of imports of renewables and low carbon services exceeded the value of exports by \u00a31.2bn, leaving the UK with a 20% deficit in the balance of green trade. Caterina Brandmayr, senior policy analyst at Green Alliance said the figures \u201cexpose the yawning gap between the UK\u2019s net zero law and policy in most government departments to drive decarbonisation\u201d. She said most efforts to cut carbon had focused on the offshore wind sector, \u201cbut other sectors have huge untapped potential to decarbonise\u201d. She added: \u201cEfforts to cut carbon emissions from transport and buildings have been woefully unambitious. Transport emissions have flatlined since 1990 and buildings energy efficiency policy has been stalled for years. And there is very little policy at all to improve industry\u2019s resource efficiency.\u201d The Treasury is expected to put forward several measures to encourage investment in industries that promise to reduce carbon emissions, but investments are likely to take several years to bear fruit.",

The agreement reached between federal ministers and representatives of four coalmining states removes a key hurdle in Germany\u2019s plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades. Some regions, particularly in the less prosperous east, are heavily dependent on mining lignite, or brown coal. Together with imported bituminous \u2013 or black \u2013 coal it provides about a third of Germany\u2019s electricity needs but is also responsible for a big share of the country\u2019s carbon emissions. The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, said that operators of heavily polluting coal-fired power plants in western Germany will receive \u20ac2.6bn (\u00a32.2bn) in compensation for switching them off early, while \u20ac1.75bn will go to those with plants in the east.

It said the compensation offered was less than the \u20ac3.5bn hit it estimated it would take, even excluding the expected loss of profits. However, the deal pushed up RWE\u2019s share price by 2%, their highest level in five years. The compensation for the utilities is on top of \u20ac40bn that the government has already promised to coalmining regions to soften the economic blow of abandoning the fossil fuel. The government said reviews will be carried out in 2026 and 2029 to determine whether Germany can exit coal-fired electricity generation in 2035, three years before the final deadline. \u201cWhat we have here is a good agreement for climate protection because it makes clear that we mean it seriously,\u201d the economy minister Peter Altmaier said. Environmental campaigners criticised the decision, though, noting that the agreement will still mean a new coal-fired plant \u2013 Datteln 4 \u2013 goes online this year and allow for the expansion of the Garzweiler opencast mine in western Germany, although a nearby forest that has been the target of long-running protests will be spared. \u201cAustralia\u2019s forests are burning, millions of people are demonstrating for climate protection and the German government is clearing the way for a new coal power plant,\u201d said Martin Kaiser, the managing director of Greenpeace Germany. \u201cNothing shows more clearly than Datteln 4 that this government can\u2019t find an answer to the climate crisis. \u201cChancellor [Angela] Merkel has missed a chance today to provide companies with long-term planning safety and to send a signal that Germany is reacting appropriately to the climate crisis.\u201d Eric Schweitzer, who heads the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said a key question is how the electricity currently coming from coal-fired power plants will be replaced. The government has set a target of generating 65% of Germany\u2019s electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The environment minister, Svenja Schulze, acknowledged that Germany will need a \u201cmassive expansion of wind and solar energy\u201d as the country is also in the process of exiting atomic power. The last nuclear reactor is set to go offline at the end of 2022. \u201cWe are the first country that is exiting nuclear and coal power on a binding basis and this is an important international signal that we are sending,\u201d she said of Thursday\u2019s agreement. The head of Germany\u2019s main industrial lobby group, BDI, urged the government not to wait until 2026 \u2013 three years after the shutdown of the last nuclear plant \u2013 to review the measures. However, Altmaier, the economy minister, said that while there would less \u201cexcess production\u201d in Germany in the future, \u201cwe are very sure that we can ensure sufficient electricity supply for business but also for private consumers\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>The great god Car is dead. The former acolytes assembled in the British petrolhead\u2019s chief city of Birmingham this week and announced they never want to see bumper, bonnet or wheel spoke again \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/13/birmingham-ban-cars-driving-through-city-centre\" title=\"\">most cars to be banned</a> from a centre they hope can become uncongested, unpolluted and green. This is true revolution.</p> <p>But what about the mess left behind? Birmingham in the 1960s and 70s savaged its city centre to make way for cars. The council razed at least half of its great Victorian metropolis to the ground, replacing it with a maze of flyovers, underpasses and gyratories.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This revolution could precipitate a grand experiment, to show the world how a city with fewer cars can reinvent itself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For several years in the late 80s it even staged the Superprix, a not-quite Formula One motor race round the city\u2019s inner road circuit. Birmingham was car mad. Under draft proposals from Birmingham city council, all through-traffic is now to reach a dead end or be rerouted to \u201can upgraded ring road\u201d.</p> <p>The question, then, is what happens to the acres of motorway crossing the city, much of which must eventually go begging? For that matter, what happens to the similar roads that have long adorned the downtowns of Liverpool, Glasgow, Newcastle, Nottingham and elsewhere in a car-less future?</p> <p>During the 1990s in the US, Boston faced a similar challenge. Its elevated highway, a concrete slash across the historic downtown, had become a congested disaster, dubbed \u201cone long parking lot\u201d. After much debate the city decided to cover it over, close its exits and plant trees along the route, naming it <a href=\"https://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/history/\" title=\"\">Rose Kennedy Greenway</a> after JFK\u2019s mother. In England at the same time, Norwich radically reorganised its streets to make it impossible to drive across the city centre. It was a transformation. London\u2019s boroughs likewise \u201cmazed\u201d their residential neighbourhoods. More recently, with traffic redefined from necessary nuisance to toxic menace, Oxford, Bristol and York have introduced bans on motor vehicles of varying degrees of severity.</p> <p>London overall was saved from Birmingham\u2019s fate by the sheer scale of its original ambition. Its post-war planner, Patrick Abercrombie, declared the metropolis \u201cobsolete, drab and dreary\u201d, and decided at least half of it should be rebuilt to start again, with orbital and radial motorways, and towers. The transport expert, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/dec/10/guardianobituaries.engineering\" title=\"\">Colin Buchanan</a>, proposed all London pedestrians should go on to \u201cpodiums\u201d, with the ground level dedicated to traffic.</p> <p>Podiums were tried at the Barbican in the City, and have been largely deserted ever since. People do not like being forced to walk in the air. In 1973, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/concrete-bungle-how-public-fury-stopped-the-1970s-plan-to-turn-london-into-a-motorway\" title=\"\">public anger</a> at plans to turn Covent Garden and Piccadilly Circus into more Barbicans brought a halt to Abercrombie\u2019s plans, but it was a close call. </p> <p>Birmingham is the city of my birth, and I hate being ashamed of its appearance.

      "bodyText": "The great god Car is dead. The former acolytes assembled in the British petrolhead\u2019s chief city of Birmingham this week and announced they never want to see bumper, bonnet or wheel spoke again \u2013 with most cars to be banned from a centre they hope can become uncongested, unpolluted and green. This is true revolution. But what about the mess left behind? Birmingham in the 1960s and 70s savaged its city centre to make way for cars. The council razed at least half of its great Victorian metropolis to the ground, replacing it with a maze of flyovers, underpasses and gyratories. For several years in the late 80s it even staged the Superprix, a not-quite Formula One motor race round the city\u2019s inner road circuit. Birmingham was car mad. Under draft proposals from Birmingham city council, all through-traffic is now to reach a dead end or be rerouted to \u201can upgraded ring road\u201d. The question, then, is what happens to the acres of motorway crossing the city, much of which must eventually go begging? For that matter, what happens to the similar roads that have long adorned the downtowns of Liverpool, Glasgow, Newcastle, Nottingham and elsewhere in a car-less future? During the 1990s in the US, Boston faced a similar challenge. Its elevated highway, a concrete slash across the historic downtown, had become a congested disaster, dubbed \u201cone long parking lot\u201d. After much debate the city decided to cover it over, close its exits and plant trees along the route, naming it Rose Kennedy Greenway after JFK\u2019s mother. In England at the same time, Norwich radically reorganised its streets to make it impossible to drive across the city centre. It was a transformation. London\u2019s boroughs likewise \u201cmazed\u201d their residential neighbourhoods. More recently, with traffic redefined from necessary nuisance to toxic menace, Oxford, Bristol and York have introduced bans on motor vehicles of varying degrees of severity. London overall was saved from Birmingham\u2019s fate by the sheer scale of its original ambition. Its post-war planner, Patrick Abercrombie, declared the metropolis \u201cobsolete, drab and dreary\u201d, and decided at least half of it should be rebuilt to start again, with orbital and radial motorways, and towers. The transport expert, Colin Buchanan, proposed all London pedestrians should go on to \u201cpodiums\u201d, with the ground level dedicated to traffic. Podiums were tried at the Barbican in the City, and have been largely deserted ever since. People do not like being forced to walk in the air. In 1973, public anger at plans to turn Covent Garden and Piccadilly Circus into more Barbicans brought a halt to Abercrombie\u2019s plans, but it was a close call. Birmingham is the city of my birth, and I hate being ashamed of its appearance. Owen Hatherley, master geographer of the UK\u2019s \u201cnew kind of bleak\u201d, calls the nation\u2019s second city \u201ca national embarrassment\u201d. Now surely it has a golden opportunity. Assuming it is successful in excluding through traffic from its core, the obvious next step is to use the bonanza of freed space for something else. If highways are no longer sacred but heretical, the task is to release their latent value. Birmingham could go down Boston\u2019s route and simply plant trees. It could thread its downtown with linear parks, perhaps linking Brindley Place \u2013 a rare truly handsome work of modern architecture \u2013 to its \u201ccreative\u201d jewellery quarter with a version of New York\u2019s High Line. But most of Birmingham\u2019s post-war roads are so wide they could accommodate whole avenues and squares of traditional terraces. Or they could go informally medieval, with camping sites, street markets, displays and entertainments, like Germany\u2019s now ubiquitous Christmas markets. Medieval towns around Europe are prospering. This urban revolution could precipitate a grand experiment, to show the world how a city with fewer cars can reinvent itself.

It has staged no inquiry, there has been no apology for the staggering cost, both financial and communal, it inflicted on urban Britain to make way for cars.

      "body": "<h2>66. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/61305172\">The Stars (Are Out Tonight) (2013)</a></h2> <p>Swinton\u2019s spectral-twin relationship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\">David Bowie</a> led to this music-video collaboration. While, like most Bowie videos, it is pretty annoying, it at least demonstrates Swinton\u2019s ability to look good in trying circumstances.</p> <h2>65. Avengers: Endgame (2019)</h2> <p>Only a brief scene here, in her guise as the Ancient One, handing over the time stone to Banner/Hulk. Not especially demanding, even if she had to reshoot it a year later after some plot details changed.</p> <h2>64. The Zero Theorem (2013)</h2> <p>Sporting prosthetic teeth, a wig and a funny accent, Swinton pops up briefly as Christoph Waltz\u2019s virtual therapist, Dr Shrink-Rom, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/terry-gilliam\">Terry Gilliam</a>\u2019s chaotic and frankly unenlightening fantasy parable.</p> <h2>63. Egomania: Island Without Hope (1986)</h2> <p>Swinton has always been game for anything: this bizarre, freeform work with overtones of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/derek-jarman\">Derek Jarman</a>, orchestrated by German theatre director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/aug/24/christoph-schlingensief-obituary\">Christoph Schlingensief</a>, is decent evidence.</p> <h2>62. The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008)</h2> <p>Another one-minute wonder: Swinton\u2019s White Witch tries to tempt Caspian into freeing her from her ice prison. Doesn\u2019t work.</p> <h2>61. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010)</h2> <p>A third Narnian walk-on (float-on, perhaps?): her White Witch appears in a cloud of evil mist, as a temptation for her former victim Edmund. Doesn\u2019t work this time, either.</p> <h2>60. The Party: Nature Morte (1991)</h2> <p>A rambling black-and-white film from Jamaican director Cynthia Beatt, mostly in German, with Swinton playing a woman whose marriage is in meltdown, and who throws a party instead.</p> <h2>59. War Machine (2017)</h2> <p>As a German politician who nervously tells off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradpitt\">Brad Pitt</a>\u2019s gung-ho US general, Swinton has about three minutes on screen here, but she makes them count.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2a1dfc049704e3c923dd7f3570ddbf1861d4ee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2a1dfc049704e3c923dd7f3570ddbf1861d4ee5/0_183_2896_1738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swinton Female Perversions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take a memo \u2026 Swinton in Female Perversions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G Lefkowitz/Map/Transatlantic Ent/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>58. Female Perversions (1996) </h2> <p>This probably seemed like an interesting project, inspired by Louise Kaplan\u2019s study of sexuality and fetish. It has Swinton as an uptight lawyer with a sideline in rambunctious sexual encounters, freaky dreams and an erratic sister. But it doesn\u2019t look all that great now: clunky direction and cheesy set design undermine its intentions.</p> <h2>57. Teknolust (2002)</h2> <p>The second of Swinton\u2019s collaborations with artist and film-maker Lynn Hershman Leeson: a digital-paranoia fantasy fable about hybrid online succubi.</p> <h2>56. Letters from Baghdad (2016)</h2> <p>Swinton acted as executive producer, as well as contributing some letter-reading voiceover, for this documentary profile of traveller-diplomat Gertrude Bell; she would arguably have been better cast for the feature film about Bell the year before, which eventually starred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolekidman\">Nicole Kidman</a>.</p> <h2>55. Remembrance of Things Fast: True Stories Visual Lies (1994)</h2> <p>In the early 90s, <a href=\"https://lux.org.uk/artist/john-maybury\">John Maybury</a> was very much the heir apparent to Jarman, so it was no surprise to see Swinton popping up in this collage of queer imagery tricked out with then-cutting-edge video graphics. She is not given too much to do, if we are being honest, lolling about with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rupert-everett\">Rupert Everett</a> in a hospital room in Maybury\u2019s \u201cuncommercial presentation\u201d short blips.</p> <h2>54. Aria (1987)</h2> <p>Short but sweet, Jarman\u2019s contribution to this multi-part opera film still looks lovely. Swinton spends most of the six-minute running time fooling about on a beach with hunky Spencer Leigh, all scored to Depuis le Jour from Gustave Charpentier\u2019s Louise. A compressed example of the kind of playfulness Jarman liked to conjure up.</p> <h2>53. Play Me Something (1989)</h2> <p>Swinton is one of the delayed passengers sitting around an in airport on a remote Scottish island, listening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-berger\">John Berger</a> tell a convoluted Venice-set story. She does not get much screen time (and her <a href=\"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/highlands/1598093/tilda-swinton-defends-her-scottishness-against-claim-by-fellow-actress-kelly-macdonald/\">Scots accent </a>attracted criticism) but it put her adjacent to Berger, another long-term collaborator and friend.</p> <h2>52. War Requiem (1989)</h2> <p>Swinton plays multiple roles \u2013 nurses, mostly \u2013 in Jarman\u2019s collage-like treatment of Benjamin Britten\u2019s first world war requiem. In effect, it is a silent-movie performance, with Swinton\u2019s emotional intensity matching the music.</p> <h2>51. Friendship\u2019s Death (1987) </h2> <p>One of the earlier attempts to take advantage of Swinton\u2019s otherworldly air: here she plays a self-confessed alien (named Friendship) who has accidentally landed slap-bang in the middle of the Black September war between the PLO and the Jordanian army. A talky, experimental film, very much of its time, from the late film theorist and academic Peter Wollen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e98576260824300990373aeeee6bc4b2b7755f59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e98576260824300990373aeeee6bc4b2b7755f59/311_432_5010_3007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton Jeremy Northam = The Statement\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chasing Caine \u2026 with Jeremy Northam in The Statement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>50. The Statement (2003)</h2> <p>Swinton is in lawyerly mode in this sturdy but old-fashioned drama: she is hunting down Nazi-collaborator-in-hiding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/14/michael-caine-best-films-ranked\">Michael Caine</a>, apparently the target of a Jewish hit squad. Not, perhaps, one of her flashier roles; maybe the chance to work with Caine was not one to turn down.</p> <h2>49. The Limits of Control (2009)</h2> <p>Loyalty clearly plays a big part in Swinton\u2019s job choices, especially if it offers her a chance to climb into a fancy getup. This is her second, and slightest, film for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jim-jarmusch\">Jim Jarmusch</a>, playing one of the philosophical hitman Isaach de Bankole\u2019s cafe contacts. In a blond wig, outsize sunglasses, leopard-print knee boots and white mac, for once she looks like she lost a fight with the costume cupboard.</p> <h2>48. Vanilla Sky (2001)</h2> <p>Swinton\u2019s first foray into the Hollywood big league, playing another business-suited corporate type: the creepy representative of Life Extension, who sells Tom Cruise his \u201clucid dream\u201d.</p> <h2>47. The Invisible Frame (2009)</h2> <p>Building on an earlier short, Cycling the Frame, with the same film-maker, Cynthia Beatt, Swinton got back on her bike for an art-concept project, following the line of the (by then mostly demolished) Berlin wall. Lots of peering over bridges and weaving in and out of traffic.</p> <h2>46. Conceiving Ada (1997) </h2> <p>In the first of Swinton\u2019s collaborations with Hershman Leeson, she plays the 19th-century computing pioneer Ada Lovelace, with whom a modern-day scientist is obsessed. It is all a bit on the clunky side until Swinton shows up in the flesh; the impressive delicacy of her performance makes a major difference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44215ea5c3b9c37813eb29a21f4984f0540503cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44215ea5c3b9c37813eb29a21f4984f0540503cd/0_879_3376_4218/800.jpg\" alt=\"tilda swinton Michael Gough Wittgenstein\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Absolutely fabulous \u2026 with Michael Gough in Wittgenstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>45. Wittgenstein (1993)</h2> <p>Jarman\u2019s entertaining account of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s life and ideas contains one of the earliest of Swinton\u2019s personal gallery of grotesque poshos. She plays society aesthete <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp03183/lady-ottoline-morrell\">Lady Ottoline Morrell</a>. Most of her scenes are actually with Michael Gough\u2019s Bertrand Russell; swathed in feathers, with an acid, cut-glass accent, she is, as ever, quite a sight.</p> <h2>44. Isle of Dogs (2018)</h2> <p>In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson\">Wes Anderson</a> films have turned into cameo fests: his beautifully realised, Japan-set canine fable was no different. Swinton has a minor voice role, a wisdom-dispensing pug called Sage.</p> <h2>43. Strange Culture (2007)</h2> <p>A directly activist intervention: Swinton participated in Hershman Leeson\u2019s film about the bizarre case of Steve Kurtz, the food-science artist who was arrested for bioterrorism after his wife Hope was found dead. Swinton plays Hope in re-enactments of past events, as well as stepping out of character, in Leeson\u2019s enterprising treatment of issues including artistic expression and abuse of power.</p> <h2>42. Possible Worlds (2000)</h2> <p>Another multi-character showcase in an interestingly cerebral thriller from theatre director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/robert-lepage\">Robert Lepage</a>. As cops are tracking down a brain-stealing killer, she plays a woman who may or may not be the figment of a mathematician\u2019s imagination.</p> <h2>41. Constantine (2005)</h2> <p>Swinton channelled a mid-70s Bowie look \u2013 tailored double-breasted jacket, asymmetrical droopy fringe \u2013 as the archangel Gabriel in this authentically berserk satanic horror-thriller. In a film stuffed with scenery-chewers and screen-demolishing special effects, Swinton actually comes across as poised and restrained. As restrained as you can be when unleashing hell on the world.</p> <h2>40. The Garden (1990)</h2> <p>Swinton gets one big scene in Jarman\u2019s impressionist parable filmed around his real-life home in Dungeness: she is a crimp-haired, green-gowned version of the Madonna, tormented by paparazzi-as-terrorists.</p> <h2>39. Man to Man (1992)</h2> <p>Having made a splash in Manfred Karge\u2019s stage play about a woman disguising herself as a man to get through the second world war, Swinton was a natural pick for the screen version. Maybury directs, and Swinton got to play with androgyny in a virtual rehearsal for Orlando.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0106e9b9960cbe42b7208f220429fb575bab072\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0106e9b9960cbe42b7208f220429fb575bab072/0_165_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton Leonardo DiCaprio The Beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Never trust a hippy \u2026 with a young Leonardo DiCaprio in The Beach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>38. The Beach (2000)</h2> <p>Not the blockbuster everyone was hoping for, this adaptation of Alex Garland\u2019s gap-year-adventure novel cast Swinton as the manipulative leader of a colony of hippies living in secret on a Thai island. She gives it her usual amount of welly, but the film suffers a bit from heat exhaustion.</p> <h2>37. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)</h2> <p>Swinton went dowdy for a vivid cameo in this reverse-spool romance-fable directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-fincher\">David Fincher</a>; she\u2019s the \u201cplain as paper\u201d diplomat\u2019s wife who has a brief, intense affair with Button (Pitt in Marlon Brando-ish grey wig). As is often the case, she is not in the film for long, but makes every second count.</p> <h2>36. Love is the Devil (1998)</h2> <p>Swinton is almost unrecognisable in Maybury\u2019s Francis Bacon biopic, propping up the bar as the raddled Muriel Belcher, owner of the Colony Room and a key Soho face. Lots of drunk shrieking and cigarette sucking ensues.</p> <h2>35. Blue (1993)</h2> <p>No acting was required for Jarman\u2019s last completed feature, not long before his death, when he had lost much of his sight. Swinton provides one of the voices for a sound collage over an unchanging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/13/yves-klein-london-birth-blue\">International Klein Blue</a> screen.</p> <h2>34. The War Zone (1999)</h2> <p>You do not often get rock-hard realism from Swinton, but that is what she does here in Tim Roth\u2019s unutterably bleak study of intra-family sex abuse. She plays the wife of a monstrous Ray Winstone, closing her mind to the damage going on around her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d533b8bf7cf8127c8545ddaf2140b25df11535b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d533b8bf7cf8127c8545ddaf2140b25df11535b/132_0_2235_1341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swinton The Dead Don\u2019t Die\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cutting edge \u2026 Swinton in The Dead Don\u2019t Die.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lifestyle pictures/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>33. The Dead Don\u2019t Die (2019)</h2> <p>Jarmusch\u2019s deadpan hipster zombie comedy contains one of Swinton\u2019s most bizarre characters: a Scottish samurai sword-wielding undertaker who turns out to be an alien. Somehow you believe her when she says: \u201cI\u2019m quite confident of my ability to defend myself against the undead.\u201d</p> <h2>32 Hail, Caesar! (2016)</h2> <p>Out and out comedy here, as twin-sister gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (a play on the Louella Parsons-Hedda Hopper rivalry). Swinton leavens the laughs with a blast of neurotic intensity.</p> <h2>31. The Protagonists (1999)</h2> <p>Swinton heads the cast of this singular mix of documentary and re-enactment directed by the then-unknown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/luca-guadagnino\">Luca Guadagnino</a> \u2013 an amazing illustration of Swinton\u2019s ability to sniff out future brilliance. It is a mediation-cum-investigation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jun/27/appeal-conviction-quash-jamie-petrolini\">the brutal murder of chef Mohamed el-Sayed</a>, killed randomly in London in 1994. Admittedly Guadagnino throws a little too much into the directorial kitchen sink, but what could have been tasteless and exploitative emerges instead as intelligent and dignified, held together by Swinton\u2019s seriousness of purpose.</p> <h2>30. Stephanie Daley (2006)</h2> <p>A conventional-looking issue film about teenage pregnancy, anchored by Swinton\u2019s performance. She plays a pregnant psychologist interviewing a 16-year-old who has been arrested for murder after her newborn baby is found dead in a toilet. Although this is Lifetime channel material on some level (it was actually shown there under the title What She Knew), Swinton\u2019s customary commitment to the role keeps things honest.</p> <h2>29. Moonrise Kingdom (2012)</h2> <p>A pantomime-villain role here, as the caped-and-hatted \u201cSocial Services\u201d in Wes Anderson\u2019s whimsical runaway-kids comedy. As good as ever, but she is a bit adrift in a sea of cameos.</p> <h2>28. The Man from London (2007)</h2> <p>Who else but Swinton would agree to star in a two-and-a-half hour adaptation of a Georges Simenon novel in black and white by B\u00e9la Tarr and \u00c1gnes Hranitzky, Hungarian geniuses of the slow crawl? She plays the wife of a harbourmaster who finds a bag of (unspendable) British money. Thrilling this is not, but it scores molto points for agonising existential crises.</p> <h2>27. The Seasons in Quincy: Four Portraits of John Berger (2011)</h2> <p>Swinton was personally invested in this four-section documentary about her old friend, the writer and critical theorist she crossed paths with on Play Me Something. Part of the film records her conversation with Berger in his French farmhouse; and in another (which she directs herself) she brings her children to visit.</p> <h2>26. Burn After Reading (2008)</h2> <p>On perfectly poised form as John Malkovich\u2019s vengeful wife, Swinton does not actually get many of the funnies in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/coenbrothers\">Coen brothers</a>\u2019 absurdist spy comedy. It is a key role though, considerably bigger than many of her comedy or villain walk-ons.</p> <h2>25. Adaptation (2002)</h2> <p>A memorable cameo here, as the smooth but slightly sinister studio executive who commissions The Orchid Thief script from Nicolas Cage\u2019s \u201cCharlie Kaufman\u201d. Apart from anything else, it was confirmation of Swinton\u2019s unexpected elevation to hipster status in boutique-produced US cinema.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75c32c6c08d5649e7a0a4a1097eaa6015aea2f1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75c32c6c08d5649e7a0a4a1097eaa6015aea2f1c/0_210_3999_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swinton Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Witch report \u2026 Swinton in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Bray/Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>24. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)</h2> <p>Inspirational casting: Swinton\u2019s legendary <em>froideur</em> channelled into a superbly nasty ice-witch character. The franchise never really took off (its mythology a little arcane, perhaps, for post-Harry Potter audiences) but Swinton was great in the role.</p> <h2>23. The Last of England (1987)</h2> <p>Possibly through natural presence alone, Swinton became the star turn of Jarman\u2019s ensemble, even in its most abstract and diaristic modes. She had one especially memorable sequence here: as a bride mourning her executed husband, tearing at her clothes as fire burns all around. Strong stuff.</p> <h2>22. Doctor Strange (2016)</h2> <p>Swinton walked into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/04/doctor-strange-tilda-swinton-whitewashing-row\">a whitewashing row</a> after her casting as the Ancient One, sensei and guru to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/benedict-cumberbatch\">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>\u2019s miracle-seeking surgeon. It is a shame: with her de-haired scalp, Swinton brought an unashamedly brainy dimension to the role, in one of Marvel\u2019s more entertaining recent efforts.</p> <h2>21. Caravaggio (1986)</h2> <p>Swinton\u2019s first film role came in \u2013 arguably \u2013 Jarman\u2019s most accessible and successful feature. She was cast as the Gypsy-ish Lena, girlfriend of Sean Bean\u2019s Ranuccio, and whose corpse Caravaggio copies for his masterpiece, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_the_Virgin_(Caravaggio)\">Death of the Virgin</a>. A highly impressive start.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab7e2eb4ead9745e62fc020ec9972978b200f42c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab7e2eb4ead9745e62fc020ec9972978b200f42c/0_257_4824_2894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honor Swinton Byrne Tilda Swinton The Souvenir\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turning the tables \u2026 with her daughter Honor Swinton Byrne in The Souvenir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Films/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>20. The Souvenir (2019)</h2> <p>As the mother of the lead performer, Honor Swinton Byrne, it was only natural that Swinton \u2013 an old friend of writer-director Joanna Hogg \u2013 should play the mother. Her role is small but perfectly formed, although she does get to announce the most Hogg death ever \u2013 spoiler alert! \u2013 a drug overdose in the <a href=\"https://www.wallacecollection.org/?gclid=CjwKCAiAsIDxBRAsEiwAV76N84W44ElCIdxQZ23O2ZpADfSDir5i-PSgp6qtug-bGd_fO_AYp6LHcRoCQ8UQAvD_BwE\">Wallace Collection</a> toilets.</p> <h2>19. The Personal History of David Copperfield (2019)</h2> <p>Providing what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/02/the-personal-history-of-david-copperfield-review-armano-iannucci\">the Guardian\u2019s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw describes</a> as a \u201cthermonuclear star turn\u201d, Swinton appears as Betsey Trotwood, the donkey-whacking \u201cwidow\u201d who provides a haven for Dev Patel\u2019s David.</p> <h2>18. Michael Clayton (2007)</h2> <p>Swinton won her Oscar for this corporate-shark role in a twisty, clotted legal corruption thriller \u2013 one of her more conventional outings, if truth be told. She is excellent at articulating the neurosis underlying the executivespeak, while the final breakdown scene probably won the statuette on its own.</p> <h2>17. Edward II (1991)</h2> <p>Swinton showed off her top-notch classical acting chops in Jarman\u2019s adaptation of Christopher Marlowe. She is Edward\u2019s wife Isabella, alternately desperate and vengeful as Gaveston threatens her marriage and her kingdom.</p> <h2>16. Suspiria (2018)</h2> <p>A bit of a tour de force in her fourth film with Guadagnino, a remake of Dario Argento\u2019s classic Italian horror. Swinton is at her most sinister as dance instructor Madame Blanc and witchy coven member; and also at her most pranksterish, swathed in layers of latex as the elderly psychotherapist Dr Klemperer.</p> <h2>15. Broken Flowers (2005)</h2> <p>Swinton was in pretty heady company here \u2013 Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy \u2013 as one of the string of exes Bill Murray visits to try and track down his son. Bitter and vengeful (again) but she does it so well.</p> <h2>14. Thumbsucker (2005)</h2> <p>One of the wave of quirky indie-coms that infested the mid-00s, this is actually pretty good. Directed by Mike Mills, Swinton plays the mother of the teen with the oral fixation who is a little too keen on hunky actor Matt Schramm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d4b530d7a4ae3d361b4c6f388903e9373fb7221\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d4b530d7a4ae3d361b4c6f388903e9373fb7221/0_156_3750_4688/800.jpg\" alt=\"Swinton  Eva  Only Lovers Left Alive.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vampire weekend \u2026 Swinton as Eva in Only Lovers Left Alive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Soda Pictures/Sportsphoto Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>13. Only Lovers Left Alive (2013)</h2> <p>The pick of the films Swinton has made with Jarmusch (so far), a genuinely funny vampire comedy which opts for a gothicky, absurd tone rather than Jarmusch\u2019s usual affectless deadpan. Tom Hiddleston is great, too: there\u2019s something winning about the film\u2019s mix of shabby-rocker chic, spoiled-brat petulance and melodramatic attitudinising.</p> <h2>12. The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)</h2> <p>A small but fantastically memorable role: as the ancient Madame D, hotel owner and paramour of Ralph Fiennes\u2019s major domo, whose death sets events rolling. An absolute tour de force of latex acting, with Swinton perfectly calibrating voice and posture to match.</p> <h2>11. Derek (2008)</h2> <p>A love letter to her mentor, Jarman; written and read by Swinton as a voiceover for a documentary tribute directed by Isaac Julien and Bernad Rose, and co-exec-produced by Swinton herself. You can feel the emotion pouring out of it.</p> <h2>10. Julia (2008)</h2> <p>A rare out-and-out lead, for French director Erick Zonca. Swinton likes to play characters on the edge, and this is one of the edgiest: so whacked-out she frequently wakes up with no memory of the night before. Before long, she is involved in a convoluted kidnap and blackmail plot in US-Mexico border country; as you\u2019d guess, things do not go to plan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40c76d1057c347366d1b35fa33458a10151ea70c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40c76d1057c347366d1b35fa33458a10151ea70c/408_130_3170_1902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swinton  Trainwreck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hold the front page \u2026 Swinton as a magazine editor in Trainwreck.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9. Trainwreck (2015)</h2> <p>Contains probably the funniest of all Swinton\u2019s makeover-transformations, as the estuary-accented magazine editor Dianna, boss of Amy Schumer\u2019s self-hating flake. Slathered in bronzer, surmounted by a blow-wave wig and caked with mascara, Dianna is a frighteningly plausible figure (apparently inspired, visually, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jun/23/carine-roitfeld-rules-for-chic-french-vogue\">Carine Roitfeld</a>), and is supplied with a string of killer lines in Schumer\u2019s script (\u201cI once fucked three quarters of Pink Floyd \u2026 dark side of all their moons\u201d).</p> <h2>8. Snowpiercer (2013)</h2> <p>This bizarrely brilliant train-based sci-fi parable from the Korean director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bong-joon-ho\">Bong Joon-ho</a> got caught up in a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpiercer#Controversy\"> distribution powerplay</a>, and never quite got the airing it deserved. But everything about it is extraordinary: Swinton (in Rose West-style glasses and hair) is the rabble-rousing lieutenant of the boss-class, attempting to stem an uprising of the peasant-passengers in the back half of the train as it speeds through an icebound future-ruin landscape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8665fb7d360a638819793e966aa74c1b5de817b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8665fb7d360a638819793e966aa74c1b5de817b/0_6_3296_1977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swinton Ewan McGregor Young Adam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Argy bargey \u2026 Swinton and Ewan McGregor in Young Adam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Hanway Films/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7. Young Adam (2003)</h2> <p>Swinton plumbs the depths of coldness as iron-hard barge owner Ella in David Mackenzie\u2019s superlative adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/aug/23/thejunkygeniusofalexander\">Alexander Trocchi</a>\u2019s novel. She brilliantly traces Ella\u2019s path from tough haulier to trusting, betrayable housewife; the look of intense covetous hunger she gives Ewan McGregor\u2019s Joe is amazing.</p> <h2>6. Okja (2017)</h2> <p>Once again, a corporate-shill character is mined for unexpected depths. Her Lucy Mirando is a sort of James Murdoch figure: a company chief burdened with inconvenient feelings of liberal guilt, which she channels into the development of a strain of super-pigs. Although Mirando is conceived as something of a grotesque, Swinton paints her with a wide range of colours, from empathy to rapacity \u2013 and gets to paint with a few more in the role of Miranda\u2019s flint-hearted twin, Nancy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"303054ea6ebef126c9cdf6c58101c16654e0a424\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/303054ea6ebef126c9cdf6c58101c16654e0a424/0_279_1819_2272/801.jpg\" alt=\"Swinton I Am Love\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italians do it better \u2026 Swinton as Emma Recchi in I Am Love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. I Am Love (2009)</h2> <p>Guadagnino announced himself with this gloriously operatic romance: Swinton plays Emma Recchi, wife of a well-off Italian executive, who unexpectedly falls in love with a friend of her son, and effectively abandons her privileged life for him. Not only does she act in Italian (although her character is Russian-born, presumably to gloss over any awkwardness of accent), she carries the full emotional charge of this impassioned film.</p> <h2>4. The Deep End (2001)</h2> <p>The film that made Swinton\u2019s name in the US, and introduced her to a new generation of up-and-coming indie directors. It has the lineaments of a quite conventional thriller: Swinton is a well-organised, well-off woman whose attempts to stop her son getting involved in an ill-advised relationship with an older man end up in blackmail and death. Suggesting the frailties and anxiety behind a high-gloss facade has become a specialty of Swinton\u2019s, and this is one of her first and best versions of it.</p> <h2>3. A Bigger Splash (2015)</h2> <p>At her most Bowie-esque, Swinton\u2019s portrayal of a singer who has lost her voice is an extraordinary, exotic creation. Guadagnino\u2019s remake of the late-1960s four-hander La Piscine is brilliantly transferred to the deep-south Italian island of Pantelleria, a blood-heat emotional thriller in which cross-currents of jealousy, possessiveness and desire play themselves out. Swinton\u2019s effortless charisma underpins everything she does here.</p> <h2>2. Orlando (1992)</h2> <p>Films rarely improve with age as impressively as this. Sally Potter\u2019s spectacular adaptation of Virginia Woolf\u2019s novel exploited all of Swinton\u2019s androgynous qualities. Her character starts out male, transitions to female and moves through the centuries largely untouched by the ravages of time. Swinton handles it all with effortless ease; it deservedly turned her into a major name and showed a career trajectory outside the Jarman films that had been her preoccupation to date.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc42c94b060c743d2fbca1d1a593d3218c213bda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc42c94b060c743d2fbca1d1a593d3218c213bda/0_275_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We Need to talk about kevin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Child\u2019s play \u2026 Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Rivelli photography/Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1.

      "bodyText": "66. The Stars (Are Out Tonight) (2013) Swinton\u2019s spectral-twin relationship with David Bowie led to this music-video collaboration. While, like most Bowie videos, it is pretty annoying, it at least demonstrates Swinton\u2019s ability to look good in trying circumstances. 65. Avengers: Endgame (2019) Only a brief scene here, in her guise as the Ancient One, handing over the time stone to Banner/Hulk. Not especially demanding, even if she had to reshoot it a year later after some plot details changed. 64. The Zero Theorem (2013) Sporting prosthetic teeth, a wig and a funny accent, Swinton pops up briefly as Christoph Waltz\u2019s virtual therapist, Dr Shrink-Rom, in Terry Gilliam\u2019s chaotic and frankly unenlightening fantasy parable. 63. Egomania: Island Without Hope (1986) Swinton has always been game for anything: this bizarre, freeform work with overtones of Derek Jarman, orchestrated by German theatre director Christoph Schlingensief, is decent evidence. 62. The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008) Another one-minute wonder: Swinton\u2019s White Witch tries to tempt Caspian into freeing her from her ice prison. Doesn\u2019t work. 61. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010) A third Narnian walk-on (float-on, perhaps?): her White Witch appears in a cloud of evil mist, as a temptation for her former victim Edmund. Doesn\u2019t work this time, either. 60. The Party: Nature Morte (1991) A rambling black-and-white film from Jamaican director Cynthia Beatt, mostly in German, with Swinton playing a woman whose marriage is in meltdown, and who throws a party instead. 59. War Machine (2017) As a German politician who nervously tells off Brad Pitt\u2019s gung-ho US general, Swinton has about three minutes on screen here, but she makes them count. 58. Female Perversions (1996) This probably seemed like an interesting project, inspired by Louise Kaplan\u2019s study of sexuality and fetish. It has Swinton as an uptight lawyer with a sideline in rambunctious sexual encounters, freaky dreams and an erratic sister. But it doesn\u2019t look all that great now: clunky direction and cheesy set design undermine its intentions. 57. Teknolust (2002) The second of Swinton\u2019s collaborations with artist and film-maker Lynn Hershman Leeson: a digital-paranoia fantasy fable about hybrid online succubi. 56. Letters from Baghdad (2016) Swinton acted as executive producer, as well as contributing some letter-reading voiceover, for this documentary profile of traveller-diplomat Gertrude Bell; she would arguably have been better cast for the feature film about Bell the year before, which eventually starred Nicole Kidman. 55. Remembrance of Things Fast: True Stories Visual Lies (1994) In the early 90s, John Maybury was very much the heir apparent to Jarman, so it was no surprise to see Swinton popping up in this collage of queer imagery tricked out with then-cutting-edge video graphics. She is not given too much to do, if we are being honest, lolling about with Rupert Everett in a hospital room in Maybury\u2019s \u201cuncommercial presentation\u201d short blips. 54. Aria (1987) Short but sweet, Jarman\u2019s contribution to this multi-part opera film still looks lovely. Swinton spends most of the six-minute running time fooling about on a beach with hunky Spencer Leigh, all scored to Depuis le Jour from Gustave Charpentier\u2019s Louise. A compressed example of the kind of playfulness Jarman liked to conjure up. 53. Play Me Something (1989) Swinton is one of the delayed passengers sitting around an in airport on a remote Scottish island, listening to John Berger tell a convoluted Venice-set story. She does not get much screen time (and her Scots accent attracted criticism) but it put her adjacent to Berger, another long-term collaborator and friend. 52. War Requiem (1989) Swinton plays multiple roles \u2013 nurses, mostly \u2013 in Jarman\u2019s collage-like treatment of Benjamin Britten\u2019s first world war requiem. In effect, it is a silent-movie performance, with Swinton\u2019s emotional intensity matching the music. 51. Friendship\u2019s Death (1987) One of the earlier attempts to take advantage of Swinton\u2019s otherworldly air: here she plays a self-confessed alien (named Friendship) who has accidentally landed slap-bang in the middle of the Black September war between the PLO and the Jordanian army. A talky, experimental film, very much of its time, from the late film theorist and academic Peter Wollen. 50. The Statement (2003) Swinton is in lawyerly mode in this sturdy but old-fashioned drama: she is hunting down Nazi-collaborator-in-hiding Michael Caine, apparently the target of a Jewish hit squad. Not, perhaps, one of her flashier roles; maybe the chance to work with Caine was not one to turn down. 49. The Limits of Control (2009) Loyalty clearly plays a big part in Swinton\u2019s job choices, especially if it offers her a chance to climb into a fancy getup. This is her second, and slightest, film for Jim Jarmusch, playing one of the philosophical hitman Isaach de Bankole\u2019s cafe contacts. In a blond wig, outsize sunglasses, leopard-print knee boots and white mac, for once she looks like she lost a fight with the costume cupboard. 48. Vanilla Sky (2001) Swinton\u2019s first foray into the Hollywood big league, playing another business-suited corporate type: the creepy representative of Life Extension, who sells Tom Cruise his \u201clucid dream\u201d. 47. The Invisible Frame (2009) Building on an earlier short, Cycling the Frame, with the same film-maker, Cynthia Beatt, Swinton got back on her bike for an art-concept project, following the line of the (by then mostly demolished) Berlin wall. Lots of peering over bridges and weaving in and out of traffic. 46. Conceiving Ada (1997) In the first of Swinton\u2019s collaborations with Hershman Leeson, she plays the 19th-century computing pioneer Ada Lovelace, with whom a modern-day scientist is obsessed. It is all a bit on the clunky side until Swinton shows up in the flesh; the impressive delicacy of her performance makes a major difference. 45. Wittgenstein (1993) Jarman\u2019s entertaining account of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s life and ideas contains one of the earliest of Swinton\u2019s personal gallery of grotesque poshos. She plays society aesthete Lady Ottoline Morrell. Most of her scenes are actually with Michael Gough\u2019s Bertrand Russell; swathed in feathers, with an acid, cut-glass accent, she is, as ever, quite a sight. 44. Isle of Dogs (2018) In recent years, Wes Anderson films have turned into cameo fests: his beautifully realised, Japan-set canine fable was no different. Swinton has a minor voice role, a wisdom-dispensing pug called Sage. 43. Strange Culture (2007) A directly activist intervention: Swinton participated in Hershman Leeson\u2019s film about the bizarre case of Steve Kurtz, the food-science artist who was arrested for bioterrorism after his wife Hope was found dead. Swinton plays Hope in re-enactments of past events, as well as stepping out of character, in Leeson\u2019s enterprising treatment of issues including artistic expression and abuse of power. 42. Possible Worlds (2000) Another multi-character showcase in an interestingly cerebral thriller from theatre director Robert Lepage. As cops are tracking down a brain-stealing killer, she plays a woman who may or may not be the figment of a mathematician\u2019s imagination. 41. Constantine (2005) Swinton channelled a mid-70s Bowie look \u2013 tailored double-breasted jacket, asymmetrical droopy fringe \u2013 as the archangel Gabriel in this authentically berserk satanic horror-thriller. In a film stuffed with scenery-chewers and screen-demolishing special effects, Swinton actually comes across as poised and restrained. As restrained as you can be when unleashing hell on the world. 40. The Garden (1990) Swinton gets one big scene in Jarman\u2019s impressionist parable filmed around his real-life home in Dungeness: she is a crimp-haired, green-gowned version of the Madonna, tormented by paparazzi-as-terrorists. 39. Man to Man (1992) Having made a splash in Manfred Karge\u2019s stage play about a woman disguising herself as a man to get through the second world war, Swinton was a natural pick for the screen version. Maybury directs, and Swinton got to play with androgyny in a virtual rehearsal for Orlando. 38. The Beach (2000) Not the blockbuster everyone was hoping for, this adaptation of Alex Garland\u2019s gap-year-adventure novel cast Swinton as the manipulative leader of a colony of hippies living in secret on a Thai island. She gives it her usual amount of welly, but the film suffers a bit from heat exhaustion. 37. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) Swinton went dowdy for a vivid cameo in this reverse-spool romance-fable directed by David Fincher; she\u2019s the \u201cplain as paper\u201d diplomat\u2019s wife who has a brief, intense affair with Button (Pitt in Marlon Brando-ish grey wig). As is often the case, she is not in the film for long, but makes every second count. 36. Love is the Devil (1998) Swinton is almost unrecognisable in Maybury\u2019s Francis Bacon biopic, propping up the bar as the raddled Muriel Belcher, owner of the Colony Room and a key Soho face. Lots of drunk shrieking and cigarette sucking ensues. 35. Blue (1993) No acting was required for Jarman\u2019s last completed feature, not long before his death, when he had lost much of his sight. Swinton provides one of the voices for a sound collage over an unchanging International Klein Blue screen. 34. The War Zone (1999) You do not often get rock-hard realism from Swinton, but that is what she does here in Tim Roth\u2019s unutterably bleak study of intra-family sex abuse. She plays the wife of a monstrous Ray Winstone, closing her mind to the damage going on around her. 33. The Dead Don\u2019t Die (2019) Jarmusch\u2019s deadpan hipster zombie comedy contains one of Swinton\u2019s most bizarre characters: a Scottish samurai sword-wielding undertaker who turns out to be an alien. Somehow you believe her when she says: \u201cI\u2019m quite confident of my ability to defend myself against the undead.\u201d 32 Hail, Caesar! (2016) Out and out comedy here, as twin-sister gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (a play on the Louella Parsons-Hedda Hopper rivalry). Swinton leavens the laughs with a blast of neurotic intensity. 31. The Protagonists (1999) Swinton heads the cast of this singular mix of documentary and re-enactment directed by the then-unknown Luca Guadagnino \u2013 an amazing illustration of Swinton\u2019s ability to sniff out future brilliance. It is a mediation-cum-investigation of the brutal murder of chef Mohamed el-Sayed, killed randomly in London in 1994. Admittedly Guadagnino throws a little too much into the directorial kitchen sink, but what could have been tasteless and exploitative emerges instead as intelligent and dignified, held together by Swinton\u2019s seriousness of purpose. 30. Stephanie Daley (2006) A conventional-looking issue film about teenage pregnancy, anchored by Swinton\u2019s performance. She plays a pregnant psychologist interviewing a 16-year-old who has been arrested for murder after her newborn baby is found dead in a toilet. Although this is Lifetime channel material on some level (it was actually shown there under the title What She Knew), Swinton\u2019s customary commitment to the role keeps things honest. 29. Moonrise Kingdom (2012) A pantomime-villain role here, as the caped-and-hatted \u201cSocial Services\u201d in Wes Anderson\u2019s whimsical runaway-kids comedy. As good as ever, but she is a bit adrift in a sea of cameos. 28. The Man from London (2007) Who else but Swinton would agree to star in a two-and-a-half hour adaptation of a Georges Simenon novel in black and white by B\u00e9la Tarr and \u00c1gnes Hranitzky, Hungarian geniuses of the slow crawl? She plays the wife of a harbourmaster who finds a bag of (unspendable) British money. Thrilling this is not, but it scores molto points for agonising existential crises. 27. The Seasons in Quincy: Four Portraits of John Berger (2011) Swinton was personally invested in this four-section documentary about her old friend, the writer and critical theorist she crossed paths with on Play Me Something. Part of the film records her conversation with Berger in his French farmhouse; and in another (which she directs herself) she brings her children to visit. 26. Burn After Reading (2008) On perfectly poised form as John Malkovich\u2019s vengeful wife, Swinton does not actually get many of the funnies in the Coen brothers\u2019 absurdist spy comedy. It is a key role though, considerably bigger than many of her comedy or villain walk-ons. 25. Adaptation (2002) A memorable cameo here, as the smooth but slightly sinister studio executive who commissions The Orchid Thief script from Nicolas Cage\u2019s \u201cCharlie Kaufman\u201d. Apart from anything else, it was confirmation of Swinton\u2019s unexpected elevation to hipster status in boutique-produced US cinema. 24. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) Inspirational casting: Swinton\u2019s legendary froideur channelled into a superbly nasty ice-witch character. The franchise never really took off (its mythology a little arcane, perhaps, for post-Harry Potter audiences) but Swinton was great in the role. 23. The Last of England (1987) Possibly through natural presence alone, Swinton became the star turn of Jarman\u2019s ensemble, even in its most abstract and diaristic modes. She had one especially memorable sequence here: as a bride mourning her executed husband, tearing at her clothes as fire burns all around. Strong stuff. 22. Doctor Strange (2016) Swinton walked into a whitewashing row after her casting as the Ancient One, sensei and guru to Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s miracle-seeking surgeon. It is a shame: with her de-haired scalp, Swinton brought an unashamedly brainy dimension to the role, in one of Marvel\u2019s more entertaining recent efforts. 21. Caravaggio (1986) Swinton\u2019s first film role came in \u2013 arguably \u2013 Jarman\u2019s most accessible and successful feature. She was cast as the Gypsy-ish Lena, girlfriend of Sean Bean\u2019s Ranuccio, and whose corpse Caravaggio copies for his masterpiece, Death of the Virgin. A highly impressive start. 20. The Souvenir (2019) As the mother of the lead performer, Honor Swinton Byrne, it was only natural that Swinton \u2013 an old friend of writer-director Joanna Hogg \u2013 should play the mother. Her role is small but perfectly formed, although she does get to announce the most Hogg death ever \u2013 spoiler alert! \u2013 a drug overdose in the Wallace Collection toilets. 19. The Personal History of David Copperfield (2019) Providing what the Guardian\u2019s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw describes as a \u201cthermonuclear star turn\u201d, Swinton appears as Betsey Trotwood, the donkey-whacking \u201cwidow\u201d who provides a haven for Dev Patel\u2019s David. 18. Michael Clayton (2007) Swinton won her Oscar for this corporate-shark role in a twisty, clotted legal corruption thriller \u2013 one of her more conventional outings, if truth be told. She is excellent at articulating the neurosis underlying the executivespeak, while the final breakdown scene probably won the statuette on its own. 17. Edward II (1991) Swinton showed off her top-notch classical acting chops in Jarman\u2019s adaptation of Christopher Marlowe. She is Edward\u2019s wife Isabella, alternately desperate and vengeful as Gaveston threatens her marriage and her kingdom. 16. Suspiria (2018) A bit of a tour de force in her fourth film with Guadagnino, a remake of Dario Argento\u2019s classic Italian horror. Swinton is at her most sinister as dance instructor Madame Blanc and witchy coven member; and also at her most pranksterish, swathed in layers of latex as the elderly psychotherapist Dr Klemperer. 15. Broken Flowers (2005) Swinton was in pretty heady company here \u2013 Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy \u2013 as one of the string of exes Bill Murray visits to try and track down his son. Bitter and vengeful (again) but she does it so well. 14. Thumbsucker (2005) One of the wave of quirky indie-coms that infested the mid-00s, this is actually pretty good. Directed by Mike Mills, Swinton plays the mother of the teen with the oral fixation who is a little too keen on hunky actor Matt Schramm. 13. Only Lovers Left Alive (2013) The pick of the films Swinton has made with Jarmusch (so far), a genuinely funny vampire comedy which opts for a gothicky, absurd tone rather than Jarmusch\u2019s usual affectless deadpan. Tom Hiddleston is great, too: there\u2019s something winning about the film\u2019s mix of shabby-rocker chic, spoiled-brat petulance and melodramatic attitudinising. 12. The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) A small but fantastically memorable role: as the ancient Madame D, hotel owner and paramour of Ralph Fiennes\u2019s major domo, whose death sets events rolling. An absolute tour de force of latex acting, with Swinton perfectly calibrating voice and posture to match. 11. Derek (2008) A love letter to her mentor, Jarman; written and read by Swinton as a voiceover for a documentary tribute directed by Isaac Julien and Bernad Rose, and co-exec-produced by Swinton herself. You can feel the emotion pouring out of it. 10. Julia (2008) A rare out-and-out lead, for French director Erick Zonca. Swinton likes to play characters on the edge, and this is one of the edgiest: so whacked-out she frequently wakes up with no memory of the night before. Before long, she is involved in a convoluted kidnap and blackmail plot in US-Mexico border country; as you\u2019d guess, things do not go to plan. 9. Trainwreck (2015) Contains probably the funniest of all Swinton\u2019s makeover-transformations, as the estuary-accented magazine editor Dianna, boss of Amy Schumer\u2019s self-hating flake. Slathered in bronzer, surmounted by a blow-wave wig and caked with mascara, Dianna is a frighteningly plausible figure (apparently inspired, visually, by Carine Roitfeld), and is supplied with a string of killer lines in Schumer\u2019s script (\u201cI once fucked three quarters of Pink Floyd \u2026 dark side of all their moons\u201d). 8. Snowpiercer (2013) This bizarrely brilliant train-based sci-fi parable from the Korean director Bong Joon-ho got caught up in a distribution powerplay, and never quite got the airing it deserved. But everything about it is extraordinary: Swinton (in Rose West-style glasses and hair) is the rabble-rousing lieutenant of the boss-class, attempting to stem an uprising of the peasant-passengers in the back half of the train as it speeds through an icebound future-ruin landscape. 7. Young Adam (2003) Swinton plumbs the depths of coldness as iron-hard barge owner Ella in David Mackenzie\u2019s superlative adaptation of Alexander Trocchi\u2019s novel. She brilliantly traces Ella\u2019s path from tough haulier to trusting, betrayable housewife; the look of intense covetous hunger she gives Ewan McGregor\u2019s Joe is amazing. 6. Okja (2017) Once again, a corporate-shill character is mined for unexpected depths. Her Lucy Mirando is a sort of James Murdoch figure: a company chief burdened with inconvenient feelings of liberal guilt, which she channels into the development of a strain of super-pigs. Although Mirando is conceived as something of a grotesque, Swinton paints her with a wide range of colours, from empathy to rapacity \u2013 and gets to paint with a few more in the role of Miranda\u2019s flint-hearted twin, Nancy. 5. I Am Love (2009) Guadagnino announced himself with this gloriously operatic romance: Swinton plays Emma Recchi, wife of a well-off Italian executive, who unexpectedly falls in love with a friend of her son, and effectively abandons her privileged life for him. Not only does she act in Italian (although her character is Russian-born, presumably to gloss over any awkwardness of accent), she carries the full emotional charge of this impassioned film. 4. The Deep End (2001) The film that made Swinton\u2019s name in the US, and introduced her to a new generation of up-and-coming indie directors. It has the lineaments of a quite conventional thriller: Swinton is a well-organised, well-off woman whose attempts to stop her son getting involved in an ill-advised relationship with an older man end up in blackmail and death. Suggesting the frailties and anxiety behind a high-gloss facade has become a specialty of Swinton\u2019s, and this is one of her first and best versions of it. 3. A Bigger Splash (2015) At her most Bowie-esque, Swinton\u2019s portrayal of a singer who has lost her voice is an extraordinary, exotic creation. Guadagnino\u2019s remake of the late-1960s four-hander La Piscine is brilliantly transferred to the deep-south Italian island of Pantelleria, a blood-heat emotional thriller in which cross-currents of jealousy, possessiveness and desire play themselves out. Swinton\u2019s effortless charisma underpins everything she does here. 2. Orlando (1992) Films rarely improve with age as impressively as this. Sally Potter\u2019s spectacular adaptation of Virginia Woolf\u2019s novel exploited all of Swinton\u2019s androgynous qualities. Her character starts out male, transitions to female and moves through the centuries largely untouched by the ravages of time. Swinton handles it all with effortless ease; it deservedly turned her into a major name and showed a career trajectory outside the Jarman films that had been her preoccupation to date. 1. We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011) Swinton was perhaps not natural casting for this authentic nightmare of a story: an American wife and mother whose attempts to bond with her son fall foul of his resolute commitment to sadistic, manipulative cruelty. But she pulls it off brilliantly, suggesting all the uncertainty, frustration and panic that life brings her. In this, she is aided by director Lynne Ramsay\u2019s distinctively oblique visual style, going against the grain and dwelling on unexpected, revelatory moments. This is, and remains, a monumental film, and should have won every award going.",

The Higher Education Statistics Agency\u2019s breakdown of students in UK higher education last year showed that the number of students from China rose above 120,000 for the first time, accounting for more than one in every three non-EU students. While the number of new students coming from EU countries rose by 2% - despite the political turmoil over Brexit \u2013 the numbers from outside the EU rose by 10%, with those from China alone rising by 13%.

The figures also showed that the increase in students awarded top degree classes has come to a halt, following several years of rapid growth at some institutions that raised concerns among policymakers.

      "body": "<p>The Taliban have offered to stand down their fighters for several days, in an effort to restart peace negotiations with the US that were abruptly called off last year by Donald Trump.</p> <p>The proposal for a seven to 10-day halt in military operations was given to the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/bded23c91240fcdf11bb605b05e42d6c\">AP reported</a>. The US, which has been pushing for a ceasefire to pave the way for new talks, is still evaluating the insurgents\u2019 offer, an American official said.</p> <p>The offer was reportedly handed over in Qatar, which hosts a Taliban political delegation and has been the venue for many rounds of talks. The group\u2019s top leadership is based in Pakistan and envoys have been shuttling back and forth between the countries.</p> <p>Washington last year appeared to be edging closer to an agreement to end its longest war, after nearly two decades, and bring thousands of troops home. But after a spike in violence and the death of a US soldier in September, Trump announced on Twitter that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/08/donald-trump-afghanistan-taliban-talks-camp-david\">called off negotiations</a>.</p> <p>Two months later, on a Thanksgiving trip to troops stationed on the ground, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/donald-trump-taliban-talks-surprise-afghanistan-visit\">appeared to signal that his peace effort was back on</a>, saying that the Taliban \u201cwant to make a deal\u201d, but it would be conditional on a ceasefire.</p> <p>A day later the militant group confirmed they were ready to restart talks. However, they have reportedly been concerned about agreeing to a ceasefire, for fear that it would sap fighters\u2019 morale and potentially undermine their position on the battlefield if it proved hard to redeploy fighters.</p> <p>The Taliban control large swaths of the countryside but do not hold any major towns or cities. \u201cThere was a thinking within the Taliban ranks that it would be difficult for them to reorganise fighters after a break in fighting,\u201d one Taliban official told AP.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/14/afghanistan-papers-political-self-delusion-public-indifference\">Afghanistan agony is a product of political self-delusion \u2013 and public indifference | Simon Tisdall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A short and partial ceasefire may allow the group to avoid those concerns. Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said in a video message only that the Taliban were \u201cready for a reduction in violence\u201d, rather than using the word ceasefire. The New York Times<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-agreement.html\"> also reported </a>that the Taliban had offered to scale back violence, not halt it entirely.</p> <p>Any kind of ceasefire may help bring Afghan officials into the peace process, as it would presumably require a matching commitment from Afghan security forces to temporarily lay down arms.</p> <p>\u201cThe signals from Doha point toward the Taliban edging closer to a deal with the Americans that would kickstart a peace process,\u201d said Graeme Smith, senior consultant with the International Crisis Group.</p> <p>\u201cThe Taliban have not launched a major urban attack anywhere in the country for two months. Such a calibrated pause is highly unusual. While insurgent attacks continue in rural areas, this suggests the Taliban do not want to spoil the ongoing diplomacy.\u201d</p> <p>President Ashraf Ghani and his team have largely been excluded from US-Taliban discussions because the militants denounce the Kabul government as US puppets and refuse to speak to them.</p> <p>Khalilzad has said in the past that a US-Taliban deal covering the withdrawal of American troops would also pave the way for negotiations between Afghans on all sides of the war, although critics fear that any Taliban commitments carry little weight without a mechanism to enforce them.</p> <p>The situation is complicated by Afghanistan\u2019s political fragility. It is still waiting for the official results of a presidential election held last September, which was marred by low turnout and violence before contested vote counting even began. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/22/afghanistan-president-ashraf-ghani-on-track-to-win-second-term\">Ghani has claimed re-election</a>, but his main rival Abdullah Abdullah is contesting the count.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Taliban have offered to stand down their fighters for several days, in an effort to restart peace negotiations with the US that were abruptly called off last year by Donald Trump. The proposal for a seven to 10-day halt in military operations was given to the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Wednesday, AP reported. The US, which has been pushing for a ceasefire to pave the way for new talks, is still evaluating the insurgents\u2019 offer, an American official said. The offer was reportedly handed over in Qatar, which hosts a Taliban political delegation and has been the venue for many rounds of talks. The group\u2019s top leadership is based in Pakistan and envoys have been shuttling back and forth between the countries. Washington last year appeared to be edging closer to an agreement to end its longest war, after nearly two decades, and bring thousands of troops home. But after a spike in violence and the death of a US soldier in September, Trump announced on Twitter that he had called off negotiations. Two months later, on a Thanksgiving trip to troops stationed on the ground, he appeared to signal that his peace effort was back on, saying that the Taliban \u201cwant to make a deal\u201d, but it would be conditional on a ceasefire. A day later the militant group confirmed they were ready to restart talks. However, they have reportedly been concerned about agreeing to a ceasefire, for fear that it would sap fighters\u2019 morale and potentially undermine their position on the battlefield if it proved hard to redeploy fighters. The Taliban control large swaths of the countryside but do not hold any major towns or cities. \u201cThere was a thinking within the Taliban ranks that it would be difficult for them to reorganise fighters after a break in fighting,\u201d one Taliban official told AP. A short and partial ceasefire may allow the group to avoid those concerns. Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said in a video message only that the Taliban were \u201cready for a reduction in violence\u201d, rather than using the word ceasefire. The New York Times also reported that the Taliban had offered to scale back violence, not halt it entirely. Any kind of ceasefire may help bring Afghan officials into the peace process, as it would presumably require a matching commitment from Afghan security forces to temporarily lay down arms. \u201cThe signals from Doha point toward the Taliban edging closer to a deal with the Americans that would kickstart a peace process,\u201d said Graeme Smith, senior consultant with the International Crisis Group. \u201cThe Taliban have not launched a major urban attack anywhere in the country for two months. Such a calibrated pause is highly unusual. While insurgent attacks continue in rural areas, this suggests the Taliban do not want to spoil the ongoing diplomacy.\u201d President Ashraf Ghani and his team have largely been excluded from US-Taliban discussions because the militants denounce the Kabul government as US puppets and refuse to speak to them. Khalilzad has said in the past that a US-Taliban deal covering the withdrawal of American troops would also pave the way for negotiations between Afghans on all sides of the war, although critics fear that any Taliban commitments carry little weight without a mechanism to enforce them. The situation is complicated by Afghanistan\u2019s political fragility. It is still waiting for the official results of a presidential election held last September, which was marred by low turnout and violence before contested vote counting even began. Ghani has claimed re-election, but his main rival Abdullah Abdullah is contesting the count.",

As Mitsotakis\u2019 only son, Kyriakos seemed destined to go into politics too. After being educated at Greece\u2019s elite Athens College, he was sent to Harvard University where he graduated with a degree in social studies in 1990.</p>\n    <p>But after continuing his studies \u2013 earning an MA in international relations at Standford University and an MBA from Harvard's Business School - he took a different path. He went to London to work as a financial analyst with Chase Investment Bank, and then as a consultant with the business company McKinsey. It wasn\u2019t until 2004, seven years after returning to Greece to continue his financial career, that he ventured into politics and ran for parliament.</p>\n    <p>Like his father, Mitsotakis saw himself as a liberal centrist who cared about green issues and human rights. From 2013 to 2015 he served as minister for administrative reform in the coalition government headed by Antonis Samaras. During his tenure thousands of civil servants were laid off, igniting fierce criticism from political opponents.</p>\n    <p>In January 2016, when the New Democracy party had been riven by Greece\u2019s economic crisis, he decided to run for the leadership, but had little support and soon discovered his name was more of a hindrance than a help. He eventually won the post, but only after running what aides describe as a tough campaign.

Yet his innings of 44 from 137 balls played a major part in helping England end the opening day of the third Test ahead of the game given the spin and variable bounce \u2013 illustrated by the Kagiso Rabada delivery that kept low to bowl Joe Root \u2013 that this slow pitch has shown during the first 90 overs. As things stand, Crawley is his side\u2019s top scorer even if Ollie Pope and Ben Stokes, respectively on 39 and 38 at stumps, look primed to overtake his total on the second day. \u201cIt was tough going, it was a slow wicket, so tough to score,\u201d Crawley said. \u201cThat said, there wasn\u2019t a lot of quick nip, so it was also tough for the bowlers.

Hopefully a few will go underground like Joe\u2019s did and we can bowl last on it and bowl well.\u201d For Crawley this series is an unexpected bonus given he is only in the team because of the freak ankle injury sustained by Rory Burns playing football on the eve of the second Test in Cape Town. In that match his scores of four and 25 were eclipsed by a stunning catch on the final evening off the bowling of Stokes \u2013 taken at the second attempt at third slip while on his backside \u2013 that captured South Africa\u2019s ninth wicket of Anrich Nortje and hurried England to a thrilling series-levelling victory. Yet on the first day here Crawley, 21 and playing only his third Test, displayed the qualities to suggest he may have a long career ahead.

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, the owner of Topshop, Topman and Dorothy Perkins, is closing a fresh wave of stores in the wake of a tough Christmas. The company, which also owns Evans, Burton, Miss Selfridge and Wallis, has quietly confirmed the closure of at least 12 sites in the last few weeks, including one of its high-profile stores at Westfield Stratford in east London. Several of the stores house more than one of Arcadia\u2019s brands but the majority include a Topshop. Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge shops are also set to close in the initiative. The landlords of several of the new closures \u2013 in Wolverhampton, Newbury, Blackburn, Bolton, Aylesbury and Worthing \u2013 agreed to 70% rent cuts as part of a rescue restructure finalised last year. That restructuring, which was agreed when Arcadia was on the brink of collapse, led to the closure of at least 23 stores. Two of the new closures \u2013 Stratford and Ipswich \u2013 had their rents cut by up to 40%. Three other stores now closing \u2013 in Carmarthen, Horsham and Blackpool \u2013 did not have their rents reduced but it is understood their leases have come to an end. A further 25 stores are likely to shut down as, at the time of its restructuring in June last year, Arcadia said it planned to put the property arms of Evans and Miss Selfridge into administration. That is yet to happen. Since Christmas, Arcadia has also been forced to close 26 outlets inside Debenhams, which this Sunday will shut the last seven of 22 department stores marked for closure as part of its own rescue plan. Arcadia is thought to be considering a second group restructuring after tough trading in the run-up to Christmas. Sales for the group fell 14% in the 12 weeks to 15 December, according to data from the high street analysts Kantar passed to the Guardian. While this figure partly reflects store closures, industry insiders said Arcadia\u2019s brands had endured a difficult end to the year, with underlying sales down. Signs of distress were clear when it emerged that the Topshop and Topman boss Paul Price had resigned last month after just over two years at the business. Prior to Topshop, Price was with Burberry for a decade. The Arcadia stores were caught up in a spate of heavy discounting at the end of last year as fashion retailers battled to attract shoppers more interested in spending on electronic gadgets, Netflix subscriptions and trips to restaurants and bars. In the week before Christmas, Topshop and Miss Selfridge increased their discounts to as much as 60%, as they also faced increasing competition from cheaper rivals such as H&amp;M and Primark as well as online specialists including Asos and Boohoo. Last month Green secured a last-ditch \u00a3310m mortgage deal for his flagship Topshop store on Oxford Street in London with the US private equity company Apollo Management International. Arcadia had said that difficulties in refinancing the loan could mean it would have to raise new funds to survive. The four-year agreement with Apollo should provide a firmer footing for Green\u2019s retail empire, but the specialist lender is likely to have demanded a high rate of interest, making life tougher for the high street business.",

And Rebecca Long-Bailey has won easily, with 70% of members saying the group should endorse her as leader.</p> <p>Momentum members have also narrowly backed Angela Rayner for deputy leader, with 52% approving a plan to endorse her candidature.</p> <p>To describe this as a proper ballot would be misleading. Despite being an organisation committed to giving Labour members more say in party decisions, Momentum members were not given the chance of voting for any of the five leadership candidates, or any of the five deputy leadership candidates. Instead, after Momentum\u2019s national coordinating group (NCG), decided to recommend Long-Bailey and Rayner, members were just asked whether the organisation should adopt both of these two recommendations. If members had said no, it is not clear whether the NCG would have chosen someone else to endorse, or whether it would have just stayed neutral.</p> <p>Earlier this month Momentum\u2019s decision not to hold a proper ballot was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParkerCiccone/status/1216028944241233920\">publicly criticised by <strong>Laura Parker</strong></a>, who until very recently was its national coordinator.</p> <p>Turnout was very low. Momentum has around 40,000 members, but only around 7,000 of them took part.</p> <p>But that does not mean the result doesn\u2019t matter. Momentum has huge organisational muscle, as well as a very good social media campaigning team, and this vote means it will now throw its weight behind getting Labour members to vote for Long-Bailey. </p> <p>Here are the results in detail.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Question 1 of 2: Should Momentum follow the NCG recommendation to endorse Rebecca Long-Bailey as the next leader of the Labour party? </em></p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> For: 4,995 (70.42%) Against: 2,098 (29.58%) </p> <p><em>Question 2 of 2: Should Momentum follow the NCG recommendation to endorse Angela Rayner as the next deputy leader of the Labour party? </em></p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> For: 3,684 (52.15%) Against: 3,380 (47.85%)</p> </blockquote> <p>A Momentum spokesman said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our membership has spoken and overwhelmingly backed Rebecca Long-Bailey to be the next leader of the Labour party and the next prime minister of the UK. We will now be mobilising thousands to persuade Labour members in the coming months.</p> <p>Rebecca is at the heart of a new and diverse generation of socialists who recognise that we cannot return to the politics of the past.

Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, expressed concern at first minister\u2019s questions (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/16/labour-leadership-contest-nandy-praised-for-neil-interview-as-poll-suggests-long-bailey-in-lead-live-news?page=with:block-5e205a298f082f37c01eaf3a#block-5e205a298f082f37c01eaf3a\">12.45pm)</a>, and the SNP MP <strong>Tommy Sheppard </strong>put out a press notice earlier claiming Nandy was \u201ccondoning violence and imprisonment as a way to oppose independence\u201d.</p> <p>Now Nandy has written<a href=\"https://medium.com/@lisa_nandy/socialism-and-peaceful-solidarity-can-defeat-divisive-nationalism-434c50f328a\"> a blog </a>clarifying what she meant when she said Catalonia could be a model. She says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have suggested if I become Labour\u2019s next leader I will set up an international commission to learn lessons from experiences elsewhere, in places like Quebec and Catalonia. In Quebec, the positive expression of solidarity from Canadians towards their fellow citizens \u2014 coupled with real devolution of powers \u2014 was the central reason why separatism was defeated there.

In <a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf\">the Conservative manifesto (pdf)</a> there is a notorious \u201cpage 48\u201d passage implying that Johnson will somehow curtail the powers of the supreme court. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After Brexit we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship between the government, parliament and the courts; the functioning of the royal prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary people ... We will ensure that judicial review is available to protect the rights of the individuals against an overbearing state, while ensuring that it is not abused to conduct politics by another means or to create needless delays. In our first year we will set up a Constitution, Democracy &amp; Rights Commission that will examine these issues in depth, and come up with proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates.</p> </blockquote> <p>During the election campaign no one managed to find out what this actually meant. During PMQs yesterday the Tory Brexiter <strong>Sir Desmond Swayne</strong> raised this topic and asked Johnson if he would \u201clet bygones be top priority\u201d - which seemed to be a way of asking if, instead of deciding not to revisit the supreme court prorogation decision (which might amount to letting bygones be bygones), Johnson would enact revenge. But Johnson did not engage, and <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-01-15/debates/FA60A4D9-47C6-4CA1-8A0A-626B3828761B/ConstitutionalReform\">he just read out the wording from the manifesto.</a></p> <p>This morning, in an interview on Sky\u2019s All Out Politics (ostensibly about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jan/16/judges-sentencing-in-high-profile-court-cases-to-be-televised\">the decision to allow broadcasters to film judges delivering sentences in crown courts)</a> <strong>Robert Buckland</strong> did give a few more clues about what is being planned. The full quotes are below, but here is a summary of what he was saying.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Buckland said the government was planning some \u201cconstitutional plumbing\u201d to stop judges getting involved in political decisions.</strong> He did not elaborate on how this would happen, but he claimed that increasing the courts had become involved in taking political decisions because \u201cgovernment over the years has increasingly contracted out some of the political decision making\u201d.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he was not in favour of moving to a US-style system, with senior judges subject to political confirmation hearings.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that what the government was planning was revenge on the supreme court of its decision to rule Johnson\u2019s five-week prorogation of parliament illegal.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Asked by Sky\u2019s <strong>Adam Boulton</strong> what the planned commission would do, Buckland said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think there is any question of revenge or hitting back ...</p> <p>This is all about taking a calm and considered approach to what has been a very febrile time in our constitutional history. I think it would be a missed opportunity for us as a government not to look carefully at the issues and to get that outside expert opinion as well that can help inform policy and allow us to do a bit of constitutional plumbing in a way that I think is in the best traditions of Conservative governments.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if he thought the supreme court was becoming too powerful, Buckland replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think the judges choose the cases that they get before them. What I am clear about, and I think this view is shared by many senior judges and retired judges, is that we do not want a constitutional court in the UK such as we have in the US. A constitutional court means that that is a court that by its own definition is going to be involved in politics, and that of course means in the US congressional hearings to appoint judges. That is not something that I favour at all. </p> </blockquote> <p>Boulton said some Tories did seem to favour confirmation hearings for judges. Buckland replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think colleagues are responding to the fact that they see politics coming into the traditional arena more and more, and therefore they are seeking for a solution to deal with that. </p> <p>Now, I think it is absolutely right to have that debate. But I do think at the end of it all we must preserve the independence of our judiciary, we must protect judges from ending up increasingly getting into a political arena, because I don\u2019t believe that they want to be there. And I think it is the job of politicians to actually make those decisions. And I think we therefore need to look at ourselves as well, and the way in which government over the years has increasingly contracted out some of the political decision making, created a vacuum, and into that vacuum we have seen unfortunately in some cases the judiciary having to make decisions. I don\u2019t think that is desirable for anybody. This is all about getting the balance right. But it is about looking at ourselves in the mirror as much as looking at the wider system as well. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"823d226bd428ebcb2b3b6040d93441c3f9a13196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/823d226bd428ebcb2b3b6040d93441c3f9a13196/54_0_892_535/500.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Buckland\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Buckland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T09:45:16.771Z\">at 9.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2021028f082f37c01eacf7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T09:10:38.637Z\">9.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour leadership contest: Nandy praised for Neil interview as poll suggests Long-Bailey in lead</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson appointed a key figure to the Grenfell Tower inquiry who has links to the company which made the cladding blamed for accelerating the fatal fire, the Guardian can reveal. Five thousand people died before they could be reimbursed for a government error that left chronically ill and disabled benefit claimants thousands of pounds out of pocket, it has emerged. Rebecca Long-Bailey has said she does not agree with allowing abortion on the grounds of disability after the standard limit of 24 weeks \u2013 but stressed that this was a personal view. Momentum has said that it will \u201cnow be mobilising thousands [of its activists]\u201d to persuade Labour party members to vote for Long-Bailey in the leadership contest after Momentum members endorsed her in a ballot. (See 2.42pm.) Scotland\u2019s sole remaining Labour MP, Ian Murray, has called on his party\u2019s leadership contenders not to come north of the border and talk about Scottish issues without attempting to understand them first. He was speaking as he launched his campaign to be the party\u2019s deputy leader. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, has said the government is planning some \u201cconstitutional plumbing\u201d to stop judges getting involved in political decisions. (See 9.44am.) Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has said Labour would be \u201cvery happy\u201d to join the cross-party talks the government is planning to try to find a consensus on the reform of adult social care. (See 12.25pm.) An estimated 900,000 EU citizens in the UK have yet to apply for settled status, which most will need to remain in the country long-term after Brexit. The hopes of diehard Brexiters to hear the chimes of Big Ben sound at the moment the UK leaves the EU appear to have finally been dashed by Downing Street, as it indicated this will not happen even if the public raises the \u00a3500,000 needed to pay for it. One of the European parliament\u2019s union jacks will be sent to the EU museum in Brussels, a committee has decided, but Brexit party MEPs are to be denied a flag-lowering ceremony on 31 January. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Following the Momentum vote to back Rebecca Long-Bailey, the group has now released this video promoting her campaign. Turning back to the Labour leadership, Tim Bale and Paul Webb, two politics professors involved in the Party Members Project have published a very interesting article on the Conversation website giving more details of of the YouGov polling looking at what Labour members think about the Labour leadership. The headline results, that suggest Keir Starmer is comfortably ahead on first preference and that he would beat Rebecca Long-Bailey in the final round by 61% to 39% (Labour uses the alternative vote), were published at the start of the month. But these figures, which explore what members think in more detail, are new. Do read the whole article, but two charts are particularly important. First, this one divides up members according to which trait they think is most important in a leader and then shows who comes top in each category. For example, the first line shows that, amongst members saying having a strong leader is what matters most, Starmer is ahead, on 45.5%. Starmer leads in most categories: Strong leader Intelligent Able to unite party Able to unite country Good crisis management Effective speaker Appealing to average voters Jess Phillips is ahead in just one category, good negotiator. Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry are not leading in any category (which may partly reflect the fact that the polling was carried out last month, and Nandy in particular has done a lot to raise her profile since). Long-Bailey, Starmer\u2019s main rival, is ahead in just three categories: Likeable In touch with ordinary voter Strong political convictions And that is where the second chart comes in. Labour members were also asked what what quality was most important when electing a new party leader. And \u201cstrong political convictions\u201d - Long-Bailey\u2019s key asset; she is well ahead on this measure - came out top. Phil Hogan, the EU\u2019s trade commissioner, has become the latest Brussels figure in recent days to say there is no chance of the UK and the EU negotiating a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020. Speaking at an event organised by the Global Counsel consultancy, he said the two sides were \u201ccertainly\u201d not going to be able to tie up everything on the future relationship before the end of the year. He said: Certainly by the end of the year we are not going to get everything that\u2019s in the 36-page document on the future relationship agreed because prime minister Johnson decided we are going to have everything concluded by the end of the year. It\u2019s just not possible. Last week Ursula Von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, both said the same thing (see here and here). Momentum, the influential Labour organisation that represents Jeremy Corbyn supporters, has released the results of its poll of members on who it should back for Labour leader. And Rebecca Long-Bailey has won easily, with 70% of members saying the group should endorse her as leader. Momentum members have also narrowly backed Angela Rayner for deputy leader, with 52% approving a plan to endorse her candidature. To describe this as a proper ballot would be misleading. Despite being an organisation committed to giving Labour members more say in party decisions, Momentum members were not given the chance of voting for any of the five leadership candidates, or any of the five deputy leadership candidates. Instead, after Momentum\u2019s national coordinating group (NCG), decided to recommend Long-Bailey and Rayner, members were just asked whether the organisation should adopt both of these two recommendations. If members had said no, it is not clear whether the NCG would have chosen someone else to endorse, or whether it would have just stayed neutral. Earlier this month Momentum\u2019s decision not to hold a proper ballot was publicly criticised by Laura Parker, who until very recently was its national coordinator. Turnout was very low. Momentum has around 40,000 members, but only around 7,000 of them took part. But that does not mean the result doesn\u2019t matter. Momentum has huge organisational muscle, as well as a very good social media campaigning team, and this vote means it will now throw its weight behind getting Labour members to vote for Long-Bailey. Here are the results in detail. Question 1 of 2: Should Momentum follow the NCG recommendation to endorse Rebecca Long-Bailey as the next leader of the Labour party? Results: For: 4,995 (70.42%) Against: 2,098 (29.58%) Question 2 of 2: Should Momentum follow the NCG recommendation to endorse Angela Rayner as the next deputy leader of the Labour party? Results: For: 3,684 (52.15%) Against: 3,380 (47.85%) A Momentum spokesman said: Our membership has spoken and overwhelmingly backed Rebecca Long-Bailey to be the next leader of the Labour party and the next prime minister of the UK. We will now be mobilising thousands to persuade Labour members in the coming months. Rebecca is at the heart of a new and diverse generation of socialists who recognise that we cannot return to the politics of the past. She has spent the last few years pioneering the policies of the future, including a detailed plan for a green new deal that can revive communities that have been ignored, bring the country together and lead the world in combating the climate crisis. She is an experienced, principled and inspiring candidate and our movement is proud to support her for leadership. George Parker, the Financial Times\u2019 political editor, is very astute on the Big Ben nonsense. (See 1.03pm.) Holger Hestermeyer, an international law specialist at King\u2019s College London, has written an interesting Twitter thread on Robert Buckland\u2019s call for constitutional reform that would keep the judiciary out of political decisions. (See 9.44am.) It starts here. And here is what is effectively his conclusion. In her interview with Andrew Neil last night the Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy was asked to explain the plan she announced in a speech on Monday for \u201can international commission, led by and for Scottish people, that seeks to learn from the few examples where at times in modern history the cause of social justice has beaten divisive nationalism.\u201d She replied: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with saying that rather than turn inwards and argue about resources we should look outwards to other countries and other parts of the world, where they\u2019ve had to deal with divisive nationalism and seek to discover the lessons from when in those brief moments in history in places like Catalonia and Quebec we have managed to go and beat narrow, divisive nationalism with a social justice agenda. The reference to Catalonia has angered Scottish nationalists because it sounded like an endorsement of the Spanish government\u2019s ultra-repressive treatment of Catalonian separatists. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, expressed concern at first minister\u2019s questions (see 12.45pm), and the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard put out a press notice earlier claiming Nandy was \u201ccondoning violence and imprisonment as a way to oppose independence\u201d. Now Nandy has written a blog clarifying what she meant when she said Catalonia could be a model. She says: I have suggested if I become Labour\u2019s next leader I will set up an international commission to learn lessons from experiences elsewhere, in places like Quebec and Catalonia. In Quebec, the positive expression of solidarity from Canadians towards their fellow citizens \u2014 coupled with real devolution of powers \u2014 was the central reason why separatism was defeated there. It allowed the people of Quebec to be who they wanted to be with overlapping, complex, multiple identities without forcing them into a choice that would require those identities to fragment. Equally socialists in Catalonia have for years been peacefully resisting the advance of separatists there, and most recent indications suggest that their democratic efforts may well succeed. There are hopeful signs their approach of socialism and solidarity \u2014 which stands in stark contrast to the unjustified violence we saw from the Spanish police operating under the instruction of Spain\u2019s then rightwing Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy \u2014 may yet win out. Richard Burgon has announced that Laura Pidcock is chairing his campaign for the Labour deputy leadership. Pidcock was tipped as a possible leadership candidate herself until she lost her seat at the general election. The 8,792 majority she had in North West Durham in 2017 was turned into a 1,144 majority for the Conservatives. The Brexiter Tory Mark Francois has said that Boris Johnson would be \u201cmad\u201d not to let a crowdfunding campaign cover the \u00a3500,000 cost of Big Ben chiming on 31 January to mark Brexit. Responding to the latest statement from No 10 on this (see 12.12pm), Francois said: We launched this campaign at 7pm last night and by 12.30pm today we have raised just over \u00a380,000, with donations averaging \u00a316 literally flooding in. As the prime minister effectively initiated this campaign live on TV two days ago and as we are clearly going to hit the target, he would be mad to back away from it. An appeal on gofundme has currently raised more than \u00a382,000. Both Tories and Labour attacked Nicola Sturgeon on domestic policy again at first minister\u2019s questions in Edinburgh this week, but the first minister did not miss the opportunity to reference Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal earlier this week to transfer to the Holyrood government the powers necessary to hold a second independence referendum. Reiterating SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford\u2019s phrasing at PMQs yesterday, she told the chamber that \u201cdemocracy denial will not prevail\u201d, and that the outcome of the general election - in which the SNP secured 47 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Westminster seats with an increased vote share of 45% - should be respected in Scotland as the Tories demand that it is in the rest of the UK. She accused the Tories of \u201crunning scared\u201d of a second referendum, because they fear that Scotland will choose independence this time. Sturgeon was also asked about Lisa Nandy\u2019s comments on nationalism during her Andrew Neil interview last night, in which she positively referenced Catalonia, causing outrage among Scottish independence supporters who have taken it as an affirmation of the Spanish government\u2019s violent crackdown on Catalan separatists. Sturgeon said that she was willing to give Nandy the benefit of the doubt, but called on her to clarify her remarks and, if necessary, apologise. This is from Michael Dougan, a law professor at Liverpool University, commenting on what Robert Buckland said this morning about the government\u2019s plans to keep judges out of political decisions. (See 9.44am.) Here\u2019s the polling expert Matt Singh on the LabourList poll of members on the Labour leadership. Polling party members is tricky because it is harder to get a representative sample than it is when polling members of the public, and this poll was based on LabourList readers who say they are also members of the party. Singh suggests the figures for how they voted in 2016 show they are more Corbynite than the membership as a whole. That might help to explain why Rebecca Long-Bailey has performed better in this poll than in the YouGov poll of party members earlier this month. In the Commons Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, is opening today\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech debate. He has just confirmed that Labour is willing to enter cross-party talks with the government intended to reach a consensus on social care. He was responding to a question from the Tory MP Mark Harper, who asked if the Labour leadership contest meant any decision on this might have to be deferred. But Ashworth also sounded sceptical about the value of such talks. He said Labour proposed a system of free adult personal care in its election manifesto and that there was wide support for this idea. Even the House of Lords economic affairs committee, chaired by the Thatcherite former cabinet minister Lord Forsyth, was in favour, Ashworth said. He said it was the government that was failing to sign up to the consensus on this issue. This is from UTV\u2019s Chris Hagan - confirming the point made by Julian Smith in his statement to MPs earlier. (See 11.47am.) Downing Street has finally dashed the hopes of keen Brexiters to have the chimes of Big Ben sound on departure night, strongly indicating this will not happen even if the public does raise the \u00a3500,000 needed to pay for it. It is largely the wariness of Commons authorities, who are part-way through a complex restoration of the clocktower housing the famous bell, that has ended this brief and sometimes curious Brexit sideshow, one inspired in part by Boris Johnson. On Tuesday the PM said the government was \u201cworking up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong\u201d. However, it transpired that there was no such plan. Then the House of Commons Commission, which organises the running of parliament, said the bell was \u201cunlikely\u201d to sound at 11pm on 31 January, in part due to the estimated cost of \u00a3500,000 to make it happen. Work needed would include restoring the clock chime mechanism, testing it, and building a temporary floor in the belfry to allow the work to take place, and delaying other restoration work. A crowdfunding page for the project has so far raised nearly \u00a370,000, but on Thursday Johnson\u2019s spokesman indicated the Brexiters\u2019 dream seemed doomed. He said: The House of Commons authorities have set out that there may be particular difficulties in accepting money from public donations. The PM\u2019s focus is on the events which he and the government are planning to mark 31 January. Asked whether people should thus not bother giving to the crowdfunder, he replied: \u201cWhat I have said is we\u2019re focusing on the events we\u2019re planning.\u201d We have yet to hear what the No 10 programme will be, but it is expected to be low-key, with an emphasis on avoiding perceived triumphalism on what is still a hugely divisive issue. Conor Murphy, the Sinn Fein MLA who is minister of finance in the power-sharing Northern Ireland executive, has denounced the \u00a32bn package for Northern Ireland announced by the UK government as inadequate. In a statement (pdf) issued yesterday, after the money was announced, Murphy said: The financial package claims to provide \u00a32bn. \u00a31bn of this was already coming to the executive. A further \u00a3240m was already promised as part of the confidence and supply agreement. The bottom line is with this proposed package, our public services face a shortfall of at least \u00a31bn next year alone. This will make it extremely difficult to fund public services ... This act of bad faith makes our job much more difficult. As finance minister I cannot and will not accept this and will be taking this up with the British government. In the Commons Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, is making a statement about the restoration of power-sharing in the region. He confirmed that the UK government was giving the Northern Ireland executive a financial package worth \u00a32bn, including \u00a31bn for infrastructure and \u00a3550m to boost the executive\u2019s finances. Smith said this money would enable nurses in Northern Ireland to be paid the same as nurses in Britain and that as a result the strike by nurses in Northern Ireland was being called off. My colleague John Crace, who was in the Commons chamber during attorney general\u2019s questions, tells me that when Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, told MPs the government was fully committed to remaining signed up to the European convention on human rights (see 10.25am), the Tory Brexiter Sir Desmond Swayne said: \u201cHow disappointing.\u201d Launching his campaign to be UK Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Ian Murray \u2013 the sole remaining Labour MP in Scotland \u2013 talked passionately about the need for radical change within the party. Telling an audience of activists gathered at his former high school in Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, Murray said he felt that Labour let the country down in December\u2019s general election campaign. He pledged to undertake a national listening exercise if elected, to report to party conference next September, so that \u201cnever again can the public be telling us \u2018I can\u2019t vote Labour\u2019 and we don\u2019t listen\u201d. Murray said: \u201cWe listen, we respond or this party dies.\u201d He said that having a Scot as deputy leader \u201csends out the message that we care regardless of where you live\u201d and pledged to take personal responsibility for the Labour party taking forward proposals for \u201chow we govern post-Brexit Britain\u201d. Taking a swipe at the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, he added: Let\u2019s never again have a senior member of the Labour party coming to a fringe show at the Edinburgh festival and changing our constitutional position. He also insisted that the party must stop trying to face both ways on independence and Brexit, saying: \u201cStraddling those two constitutional issues means we don\u2019t stand up for anything.\u201d And he made a final pledge to root out the \u201ccancer of antisemitism in the Labour party\u201d with a zero-tolerance approach. In an article for LabourList, former MP Ruth Smeeth singles out Murray as a \u201cwonderful man\u201d and one of the few colleagues willing to support her over antisemitism in public as well as in private. Murray said he was not backing any candidate for leadership, although he did nominate Jess Phillips, but he said that a new leader must demonstrate that they had listened to the electorate. In a Q&amp;A for a local church (pdf) before the general election, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, said that she thought it was wrong for the law to allow abortion up to full term on the grounds of disability, but only up to 24 weeks in other circumstances. Long-Bailey, who is Catholic, said: It is currently legal to terminate a pregnancy up to full term on the grounds of disability while the upper limit is 24 weeks if there is no disability. I personally do not agree with this position and agree with the words of the Disability Rights Commission that \u201cthe context in which parents choose whether to have a child should be one in which disability and non-disability are valued equally\u201d. The quotes have been flagged up today in a post at Red Roar, a Labour blog sympathetic to \u201ccentrists\u201d in the party. Here is the latest Politics Weekly podcast from the Guardian. Heather Stewart is joined by Rory Carroll, Henry McDonald, Jill Rutter and Jonathan Isaby to discuss the Northern Ireland assembly reopening, as well as the latest on Brexit and the Labour leadership campaign. Some 163,300 EU citizens applied last month to live and work in the UK after Brexit, the Press Association reports. The number of applications received for the EU settlement scheme in December takes the total number received by the end of that month to more than 2.7 million (2,756,100), according to the Home Office. Overall, the number of applications finalised by the end of December was more than 2.45m (2,450,100). Of those dealt with in December (219,200), 55% were granted permanent leave to remain in the country, called settled status, and 44% were granted pre-settled status - which means they have temporary leave to remain and would need to apply again for permanent permission at a later date. As PA reports, six applications have now been refused on \u201csuitability grounds\u201d, the Home Office report (pdf) said. In the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has just announced next week\u2019s Commons business. The House of Lords is due to wrap up its consideration of the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill early next week, and Rees-Mogg said that Wednesday has been set aside for the Commons to consider Lords amendments to the bill. That means if the peers amend the bill (as they may well do to reinstate the Dubs provisions for unaccompanied child refugees), and MPs take out those amendments, \u201cping pong\u201d between the two houses would start on the Wednesday. In the Commons Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow solicitor general, asked Geoffrey Cox about the Tory manifesto commitment to stop judicial review being abused in such a way as to create \u201cneedless delays\u201d. (See 9.44am.) He challenged Cox to give examples of this happening. Cox refused to give any examples. But he said: There is no question of weakening judicial review. The question is whether we can make it more efficient, streamlined and focused on the purpose, which is holding the government to account for its administrative decisions. He went on to say there was \u201cno question of backtracking upon the fundamental principle of the independence of the judiciary\u201d. In the Commons Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is taking questions. In response to a question from the shadow Home Office minister Afzal Khan, Cox said that the government was completely committed to remaining signed up to the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and that it would \u201cnever withdraw\u201d from it in \u201cany circumstance\u201d. And he said the government would continue to participate vigorously in the Council of Europe (which upholds the convention). But Cox also said this does not mean the government was not critical of some elements of human rights law in this country. For years membership of the ECHR has had cross-party support in the Commons, although when Theresa May was home secretary in 2016 she did say the UK should leave it. But as PM she never tried to implement this. Andrew Fisher, who was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s head of policy until the general election, has a sensible take on the LabourList/Survation leadership polling (see 9.10am) on Twitter. The number of knife crimes being dealt with by the police and courts are the highest in a decade, official figures show. As the Press Association reports, there were 22,286 knife and offensive weapon offences formally dealt with by the criminal justice system in England and Wales in the year ending September 2019, according to Ministry of Justice statistics (pdf). This is a 3% rise on the previous year and the highest since September 2009 (26,364). The figures follow Tuesday\u2019s announcement that the prime minister ordered all Whitehall departments to take action on tackling crime. Among the many unknowns attached to Boris Johnson\u2019s government is what it will do about constitutional reform. In the Conservative manifesto (pdf) there is a notorious \u201cpage 48\u201d passage implying that Johnson will somehow curtail the powers of the supreme court. It says: After Brexit we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship between the government, parliament and the courts; the functioning of the royal prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary people ... We will ensure that judicial review is available to protect the rights of the individuals against an overbearing state, while ensuring that it is not abused to conduct politics by another means or to create needless delays. In our first year we will set up a Constitution, Democracy &amp; Rights Commission that will examine these issues in depth, and come up with proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates. During the election campaign no one managed to find out what this actually meant. During PMQs yesterday the Tory Brexiter Sir Desmond Swayne raised this topic and asked Johnson if he would \u201clet bygones be top priority\u201d - which seemed to be a way of asking if, instead of deciding not to revisit the supreme court prorogation decision (which might amount to letting bygones be bygones), Johnson would enact revenge. But Johnson did not engage, and he just read out the wording from the manifesto. This morning, in an interview on Sky\u2019s All Out Politics (ostensibly about the decision to allow broadcasters to film judges delivering sentences in crown courts) Robert Buckland did give a few more clues about what is being planned. The full quotes are below, but here is a summary of what he was saying. Buckland said the government was planning some \u201cconstitutional plumbing\u201d to stop judges getting involved in political decisions. He did not elaborate on how this would happen, but he claimed that increasing the courts had become involved in taking political decisions because \u201cgovernment over the years has increasingly contracted out some of the political decision making\u201d. He said that he was not in favour of moving to a US-style system, with senior judges subject to political confirmation hearings. He rejected claims that what the government was planning was revenge on the supreme court of its decision to rule Johnson\u2019s five-week prorogation of parliament illegal. Asked by Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton what the planned commission would do, Buckland said: I don\u2019t think there is any question of revenge or hitting back ... This is all about taking a calm and considered approach to what has been a very febrile time in our constitutional history. I think it would be a missed opportunity for us as a government not to look carefully at the issues and to get that outside expert opinion as well that can help inform policy and allow us to do a bit of constitutional plumbing in a way that I think is in the best traditions of Conservative governments. Asked if he thought the supreme court was becoming too powerful, Buckland replied: I don\u2019t think the judges choose the cases that they get before them. What I am clear about, and I think this view is shared by many senior judges and retired judges, is that we do not want a constitutional court in the UK such as we have in the US. A constitutional court means that that is a court that by its own definition is going to be involved in politics, and that of course means in the US congressional hearings to appoint judges. That is not something that I favour at all. Boulton said some Tories did seem to favour confirmation hearings for judges. Buckland replied: I think colleagues are responding to the fact that they see politics coming into the traditional arena more and more, and therefore they are seeking for a solution to deal with that. Now, I think it is absolutely right to have that debate. But I do think at the end of it all we must preserve the independence of our judiciary, we must protect judges from ending up increasingly getting into a political arena, because I don\u2019t believe that they want to be there. And I think it is the job of politicians to actually make those decisions. And I think we therefore need to look at ourselves as well, and the way in which government over the years has increasingly contracted out some of the political decision making, created a vacuum, and into that vacuum we have seen unfortunately in some cases the judiciary having to make decisions. I don\u2019t think that is desirable for anybody. This is all about getting the balance right. But it is about looking at ourselves in the mirror as much as looking at the wider system as well. Good morning. It looks relatively quiet today in terms of government/Westminster politics, but the Labour leadership contest is warming up and overnight there were developments boosting two of the leading candidates. A poll of Labour members organised by the LabourList website and Survation suggests Rebecca Long-Bailey is on course to win. As Sienna Rodgers explains in her LabourList write-up: If the election took place today, the results of the poll suggest that Long-Bailey would win 42% of first preferences while Starmer would receive 37%. Jess Phillips is far behind on 9%, Lisa Nandy on 7% and Emily Thornberry on just 1%. Although Starmer receives the majority of second preferences from all candidates in the race, they are not enough to eliminate Long-Bailey\u2019s first round lead, with Long-Bailey leading 51% to 49% after second preferences are taken into account. My colleague Kate Proctor has more on this here. Lisa Nandy has been widely praised for her performance last night in her BBC interview with Andrew Neil. Facing an Andrew Neil interview is the toughest challenge in broadcasting for any politician, and there is a wide consensus that Nandy handled it extremely well last night. In his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe Jack Blanchard has a good summary of the reaction. The reviews are in: And lefty journos and commentators are gushing in their praise. \u201cShe did tremendously well,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker wrote. \u201cDirect, engaging, and handled [Neil] brilliantly. Sets the bar for the other candidates.\u201d The New Statesman\u2019s Ailbhe Rea said Nandy was \u201cbrilliant \u2026 Unflappable, warm and totally on top of detailed policy.\u201d Politics.co.uk editor Ian Dunt called it \u201cseriously impressive.\u201d HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh said Nandy \u201chandled Neil\u2019s questions better than most politicians I\u2019ve seen.\u201d And in his sketch for the Indy, Tom Peck deems her \u201cbright, articulate, honest and tenacious \u2026 A serious person, running for a serious job.\u201d (\u201cBut of course,\u201d Peck adds gloomily, \u201cthe party doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d) And it\u2019s not just the lefties: \u201cDare I say it, she\u2019s bossing this,\u201d the Sun\u2019s political editor Tom Newton Dunn wrote as he watched the interview last night. Evening Standard deputy editor Charlotte Ross was equally impressed. \u201cNandy will have helped her cause,\u201d the Spectator\u2019s political editor James Forsyth noted cautiously, while rightly pointing out she was \u201cvisibly nervous\u201d at the start and that some arguments did not quite stand up to scrutiny. He adds: \u201cWe wait to see if the frontrunners Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey are confident enough to subject themselves to the same treatment.\u201d Let\u2019s hope so. You can watch the 22-minute interview on YouTube here. And here is the transcript. I will post more on the poll and the interview later. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.15am: Ian Murray launches his campaign for the Labour deputy leadership in Edinburgh. After 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a Commons statement about next week\u2019s business. After 11.30am: Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, makes a statement in the Commons about the restoration of power-sharing in Belfast. 12.15pm: Phil Hogan, the EU\u2019s trade commissioner, is interviewed at a Global Counsel event by Peter Mandelson, the former EU trade commissioner. At some point today Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, is having talks in London with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, about EU citizens\u2019 rights. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

While Russia would remain a presidential republic, elements of the \u201csuper-presidential\u201d system \u2013 one that concentrates almost all political decision-making in the hands of the president \u2013 established by Boris Yeltsin in 1993 after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1993/oct/05/russia.davidhearst\" title=\"\">violent confrontation with parliament</a> \u2013 will be significantly altered.</p> <p>Putin is intentionally weakening the office that has become synonymous with him over the last 20 years.

      "bodyText": "Wednesday may prove to be one of the most important days in the political history of post-Soviet Russia. During the last 10 minutes of his annual state-of-the-nation speech, Vladimir Putin announced a series of proposals to reform Russia\u2019s constitution that seem to lay out the roadmap for his own political future after 2024. System-wide change is on the horizon for Russia, but the country\u2019s most important political figure is likely to remain central to it all for years to come. Putin\u2019s proposed constitutional reforms would reshape the balance of power between the legislature (the federal Duma) and the executive (the president), vesting authority for appointing and confirming the prime minister and cabinet in the Duma and limiting the president to two terms in office. While Russia would remain a presidential republic, elements of the \u201csuper-presidential\u201d system \u2013 one that concentrates almost all political decision-making in the hands of the president \u2013 established by Boris Yeltsin in 1993 after his violent confrontation with parliament \u2013 will be significantly altered. Putin is intentionally weakening the office that has become synonymous with him over the last 20 years. Future presidents of Russia will not be able to sit out a term to run again, as Putin did in 2008-2012, in order to comply with constitutional term limits. Nor will the president alone decide the composition of the government. Putin is transforming the presidency because he no longer intends to occupy the office.

      "body": "<p>Let\u2019s not beat about the bushfires. It\u2019s not the impacts of climate breakdown on our ecosystems or the world\u2019s poorest in the global south that worries Larry Fink, the CEO of that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/blackrock-says-climate-crisis-will-now-guide-its-investments\" title=\"\">financial behemoth</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/blackrock-says-climate-crisis-will-now-guide-its-investments\" title=\"\"> Black</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/blackrock-says-climate-crisis-will-now-guide-its-investments\" title=\"\">Rock</a>. No, what really worries him and his shadow banking peers is the \u201cfundamental reshaping of finance\u201d threatened by climate protesters, and what this means for his company\u2019s interests.</p> <p>Fink made headlines this week with <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\" title=\"\">his annual letter to CEOs</a>, which put the climate emergency front and centre. Acknowledging the risks that it poses to markets, and announcing that his fund will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36282d86-36e4-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4\" title=\"\">no longer invest in companies</a> that generate more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal production, his letter was hailed as a landmark move. But, before we get too laudatory, it\u2019s worth asking: what is BlackRock?</p> <p>The US company is the world\u2019s biggest asset management fund. 63% of the staggering $7tn financial assets it manages originates in the Americas and 29% in Europe. In the UK (as far as we know) BlackRock manages \u00a316.5bn of local government pensions, as well as at least \u00a33.8bn of Transport for London\u2019s pension fund.</p> <p>BlackRock\u2019s management of our savings takes place largely in a globalised sphere known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/01/shadow-banking-system-risk-financial-stability-imf\" title=\"\">shadow banking</a> sector. In the past, most savings were placed in carefully regulated high-street banks and other savings institutions. Today, many of these functions have migrated toward shadow banking.</p> <p>This sector is made up of institutions (including pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds) that use securities (a tradeable bundle of debt or equities) as collateral in a modern form of credit creation. BlackRock, backed by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrocks-assets-blow-past-7-trillion-in-milestone-for-investment-giant-11579089828\" title=\"\">$7</a><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrocks-assets-blow-past-7-trillion-in-milestone-for-investment-giant-11579089828\" title=\"\">t</a><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrocks-assets-blow-past-7-trillion-in-milestone-for-investment-giant-11579089828\" title=\"\">n of the world\u2019s savings</a>, also provides traditional banking services across the international financial system. Asset management funds such as BlackRock operate beyond democratic borders and are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as traditional banks.</p> <p>In his letter, Fink acknowledges that \u201cthe money [BlackRock] manages is not [its] own\u201d. \u201cLast September,\u201d he continues, \u201cwhen millions of people took to the streets to demand action on climate change, many of them emphasised the significant and lasting impact that it will have on economic growth and prosperity \u2013 a risk that markets to date have been slower to reflect. But awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.\u201d</p> <p>But the \u201cshape of finance\u201d, especially in the shadow sector, remains essentially the same: it spews out massive quantities of credit \u2013 forms of new money \u2013 much of it aimed at speculative activity.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s not beat about the bushfires. It\u2019s not the impacts of climate breakdown on our ecosystems or the world\u2019s poorest in the global south that worries Larry Fink, the CEO of that financial behemoth BlackRock. No, what really worries him and his shadow banking peers is the \u201cfundamental reshaping of finance\u201d threatened by climate protesters, and what this means for his company\u2019s interests. Fink made headlines this week with his annual letter to CEOs, which put the climate emergency front and centre. Acknowledging the risks that it poses to markets, and announcing that his fund will no longer invest in companies that generate more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal production, his letter was hailed as a landmark move. But, before we get too laudatory, it\u2019s worth asking: what is BlackRock? The US company is the world\u2019s biggest asset management fund. 63% of the staggering $7tn financial assets it manages originates in the Americas and 29% in Europe. In the UK (as far as we know) BlackRock manages \u00a316.5bn of local government pensions, as well as at least \u00a33.8bn of Transport for London\u2019s pension fund. BlackRock\u2019s management of our savings takes place largely in a globalised sphere known as the shadow banking sector. In the past, most savings were placed in carefully regulated high-street banks and other savings institutions. Today, many of these functions have migrated toward shadow banking. This sector is made up of institutions (including pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds) that use securities (a tradeable bundle of debt or equities) as collateral in a modern form of credit creation. BlackRock, backed by $7tn of the world\u2019s savings, also provides traditional banking services across the international financial system. Asset management funds such as BlackRock operate beyond democratic borders and are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as traditional banks. In his letter, Fink acknowledges that \u201cthe money [BlackRock] manages is not [its] own\u201d. \u201cLast September,\u201d he continues, \u201cwhen millions of people took to the streets to demand action on climate change, many of them emphasised the significant and lasting impact that it will have on economic growth and prosperity \u2013 a risk that markets to date have been slower to reflect. But awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.\u201d But the \u201cshape of finance\u201d, especially in the shadow sector, remains essentially the same: it spews out massive quantities of credit \u2013 forms of new money \u2013 much of it aimed at speculative activity. The Financial Stability Board reckons that at the end of 2017 shadow banks generated $184tr in financial assets. This money is then used to invest in the real economy of consumption and production \u2013 and in the fossil fuel sector. As Bill McKibben, leader of the campaign group, 350.org, writes, without asset management companies such as BlackRock, \u201cfossil-fuel companies would almost literally run out of gas\u201d; what\u2019s more, the company is the \u201cworld\u2019s largest investor\u201d in coal, oil and gas companies, and in those \u201cdriving deforestation\u201d. While it is significant that Fink has publicly acknowledged the risks that climate breakdown poses to his and other companies, that is surely not the only point. The real concern is that the world\u2019s politicians and regulators have allowed this behemoth to scoop up our savings, while turning a blind eye to how those savings are managed.

The deal is better than nothing, but doesn\u2019t end the trade war that has hurt the global economy for more than 18 months.</p> <p>Oxford Economics also suspect that China will struggle to buy the $200bn of US goods it has promised -- and if they do, it will come at the expense of other countries.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the key points from their note:<br></p> <ul> <li>Importantly, while beneficial, the US-China trade truce remains a fragile one. While the deal is a step in the right direction, any further roll back of the additional US tariffs on China imposed by the Trump Administration should not be expected until after the US presidential elections in November, and broken promises could lead to a \u201csnapping back\u201d of the agreed tariff reductions in the coming months. Fear of such a \u201csnapping back\u201d is likely to continue to weigh on businesses\u2019 investment plans and confidence in US-China relations pending greater clarity on the long-term bilateral relationship, including on the technology front.<br><br></li> <li>We expect most of the tariffs imposed by both sides and not covered by the deal to remain in place for some considerable time. We also believe that a follow-up \u201cphase two\u201d deal is unlikely to emerge as outstanding issues from a US perspective \u2013 subsidies and the fundamentals of China\u2019s state-led economic model \u2013 will be extremely difficult to resolve via a bilateral trade agreement.<br><br></li> <li>The two-year-long trade war has reduced bilateral US-China trade flows by $100bn, or 15%, since early 2018, while trimming the US bilateral trade deficit by 15%. However, most of the reduction in the US defincit stems from trade diversion from other countries. Looking ahead, China\u2019s promises to raise imports from the US are also likely to involve trade diversion, rather than trade creation.<br><br></li> <li>The $200 billion increase in China\u2019s imports from the US in 2020-21 stipulated by the agreement will be hard to achieve. The agreement has remarkably detailed targets as to by how much China\u2019s purchases of US manufactured products, agricultural products, energy and services should increase in 2020 and 2021.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T17:22:06.440Z\">at 5.22pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2098ef8f088d80a182c309\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richard-partington\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T17:12:35.630Z\">5.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UN issues global slowdown warning</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A late newsflash: The United Nations has warned that the global economy is weak -- which will undermine efforts to tackle the climate emergency.</strong><br></p> <p>The warning comes in a new report, just released.

If Flybe fails (as it undoubtedly will once this Government subsidy ends) then Ryanair, Easyjet, BA and others will step in and provide lower fare flights from the UK regional airports, as we already have to make up for the recent failure of Thomas Cook Airways.</p> <p>This Flybe \u2018subsidy\u2019 cannot comply with Competition, or State Aid rules unless the same APD eco tax holiday and other Government subsidies are extended to all other UK competitor airlines including Ryanair, Easyjet, BA among others.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T15:11:25.889Z\">at 3.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2077fa8f082f37c01eb0b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T14:52:02.613Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>S&amp;P 500,</strong> which covers a broader range of US companies than the Dow, has also hit a record high -- up 14.96 points at 3,304.</p> <p>The tech-focused <strong>Nasdaq</strong> has also romped to a record high, up 0.57% at 9,311.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e206c118f088d80a182c098\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T14:46:37.837Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street hits fresh record high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecd57e4f8de92b427cd32004e18e510c85190b2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecd57e4f8de92b427cd32004e18e510c85190b2e/0_84_6417_3850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trader Peter Tuchman wears a hat he had made while working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trader Peter Tuchman on the floor of the New York stock exchange</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Wall Street has opened at a new record high, as the bull market shows no signs of running out of energy.<br></strong></p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped by 125 points as the first buy and sell orders fly, hitting 29,155 for the firs time.</p> <p>Traders can keep their \u201cDow 29,000\u201d hats on (legendary trader Peter Tuchman probably slept in his.)<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/1217807807266852864\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DOW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DOW</a>  29155  +0.39%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SPX</a>  3304  +0.42%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASDAQ?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NASDAQ</a>  9080  +0.46%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RUSSELL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RUSSELL</a>  1697  +0.77%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FANG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FANG</a>  3355  +0.24%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IGOpeningCall?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IGOpeningCall</a></p>&mdash;

      "bodyText": "Finally, European stock markets have not felt any trade war optimism today. The FTSE 100 index has closed down 32 points, dragged down by that profit warning from Pearson (-8%). Whitbread (-5.1%) was another big faller, after telling shareholders that demand for regional hotels is weak. Germany\u2019s DAX ended the day flat, not helped by warnings that its factories are still in recession, while France\u2019s CAC gained a mere 0.1%. David Madden of CMC Markets sums up the day: The FTSE 100 is underperforming against its Continental counterparts as healthcare and consumer stocks have lost the most ground. Broadly speaking, volatility in Europe has been low in the wake of the US-China trade deal having been signed yesterday. The interim trade agreement between the two largest economies in the world took a long time to be hammered out, so now dealers are wondering what will be the next big story to move the markets. Bullish sentiment has been in short supply, but then again, the bears have been quiet too. On that note, goodnight! GW Oxford Economics have just published their assessment of the US-China trade deal signed yesterday. And having analysed the deal, they\u2019re also not-too impressed. The deal is better than nothing, but doesn\u2019t end the trade war that has hurt the global economy for more than 18 months. Oxford Economics also suspect that China will struggle to buy the $200bn of US goods it has promised -- and if they do, it will come at the expense of other countries. Here\u2019s the key points from their note: Importantly, while beneficial, the US-China trade truce remains a fragile one. While the deal is a step in the right direction, any further roll back of the additional US tariffs on China imposed by the Trump Administration should not be expected until after the US presidential elections in November, and broken promises could lead to a \u201csnapping back\u201d of the agreed tariff reductions in the coming months. Fear of such a \u201csnapping back\u201d is likely to continue to weigh on businesses\u2019 investment plans and confidence in US-China relations pending greater clarity on the long-term bilateral relationship, including on the technology front. We expect most of the tariffs imposed by both sides and not covered by the deal to remain in place for some considerable time. We also believe that a follow-up \u201cphase two\u201d deal is unlikely to emerge as outstanding issues from a US perspective \u2013 subsidies and the fundamentals of China\u2019s state-led economic model \u2013 will be extremely difficult to resolve via a bilateral trade agreement. The two-year-long trade war has reduced bilateral US-China trade flows by $100bn, or 15%, since early 2018, while trimming the US bilateral trade deficit by 15%. However, most of the reduction in the US defincit stems from trade diversion from other countries. Looking ahead, China\u2019s promises to raise imports from the US are also likely to involve trade diversion, rather than trade creation. The $200 billion increase in China\u2019s imports from the US in 2020-21 stipulated by the agreement will be hard to achieve. The agreement has remarkably detailed targets as to by how much China\u2019s purchases of US manufactured products, agricultural products, energy and services should increase in 2020 and 2021. A late newsflash: The United Nations has warned that the global economy is weak -- which will undermine efforts to tackle the climate emergency. The warning comes in a new report, just released. My colleague Richard Partington has read it, and reports: The world economy risks suffering a sharp slowdown in 2020 that would derail international efforts to tackle the mounting climate emergency and heightened poverty around the world, the United Nations has warned. In a flagship report ahead of the annual gathering of world leaders in Davos next week, the international governmental organisation sounded the alarm that trade tensions between major countries threatened to serve as a brake on growth, with damaging consequences for sustainable development. The UN said that rumbling trade tensions between the US and China had dragged down economic growth in 2019 to the lowest level in a decade, with the prospect that a renewed flareup, financial turmoil, or an escalation of geopolitical tensions could derail a recovery this year. The warning comes after Donald Trump signed the first phase of a new trade deal with China on Tuesday, dialling-down the trade standoff between the world\u2019s two biggest economic superpowers. Although the UN said that easing trade tensions should help to propel global GDP growth to around 2.5% this year from a ten-year low of 2.3% in 2019, it warned the potential for relapse was high. Failure to keep the risks in check would mean GDP growth in 2020 slumping to around 1.8%, with a knock-on consequences for government efforts to hit their sustainable development goals, it added. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, said: \u201cThese risks could inflict severe and long-lasting damage on development prospects. They also threaten to encourage a further rise in inward-looking policies, at a point when global cooperation is paramount.\u201d Donald Trump has now claimed that US farmers are delighted with his trade deal, and have also benefitted from the tariffs on Chinese goods. I\u2019m not sure all the farmers are happy, though. The National Farmers Union said last night that it fears all the pain since 2018 has not been worth it. The pork and beef industry were more positive, hoping to sell more of their wares to Chinese consumers. National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association President Jennifer Houston called it a \u201cgame changer\u201d. However.... Trump\u2019s claim that he\u2019s been using tariff proceeds to help the farmers also smells suspicious. Those tariffs are paid by companies who import goods, and consumers through higher prices -- unless Chinese firms agree to cut their prices (not always possible, while remaining competitive). Breaking! Ryanair has launched a stinging attack on the UK government\u2019s rescue of regional airline Flybe. In a strongly worded letter, Ryanair\u2019s CEO Michael O\u2019Leary says the deal (which reportedly to include a delay to its air passenger duty bill) violates competition law and state aid rules. O\u2019Leary also puts the boot into Flybe\u2019s owners, including Sir Richard Branson, saying they don\u2019t deserve to have their \u2018unviable\u2019 airline rescued. He says: \u201cThis Government bailout of the billionaire owned Flybe is in breach of both Competition and State Aid laws. The Flybe model is not viable which is why its billionaire owners are looking for a state subsidy for their failed investment. The reason why Flybe isn\u2019t viable is because it cannot compete with lower fare services from UK regional airports on domestic and EU routes provided by Ryanair, Easyjet, BA and others; and it cannot compete with lower cost road and rail alternatives on many smaller UK domestic routes. If Flybe fails (as it undoubtedly will once this Government subsidy ends) then Ryanair, Easyjet, BA and others will step in and provide lower fare flights from the UK regional airports, as we already have to make up for the recent failure of Thomas Cook Airways. This Flybe \u2018subsidy\u2019 cannot comply with Competition, or State Aid rules unless the same APD eco tax holiday and other Government subsidies are extended to all other UK competitor airlines including Ryanair, Easyjet, BA among others.\u201d The S&amp;P 500, which covers a broader range of US companies than the Dow, has also hit a record high -- up 14.96 points at 3,304. The tech-focused Nasdaq has also romped to a record high, up 0.57% at 9,311. Wall Street has opened at a new record high, as the bull market shows no signs of running out of energy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped by 125 points as the first buy and sell orders fly, hitting 29,155 for the firs time. Traders can keep their \u201cDow 29,000\u201d hats on (legendary trader Peter Tuchman probably slept in his.) Relief that the Phase One trade deal is signed (despite its flaws), and today\u2019s strong retail sales and jobless data, is cheering the markets. Breaking: The outgoing Bank of England governor has a new job - helping to save the planet. Mark Carney has just been appointed as Boris Johnson\u2019s finance advisor for the COP26 climate emergency conference, being held in Glasgow this November. Carney\u2019s challenge is to mobilise \u201cambitious action from across the financial system\u201d, to help keep global warming within the 1.5\u00b0C target set in the Paris Agreement. This will include building a framework in which companies can report their climate impact, and manage the risk of a changing climate. That will help private investors factor in climate change when they are investing their money. It\u2019s a vital issue for companies -- earlier this week, BlackRock finally agreed to put climate at the heart of its investment strategy. It\u2019s a good job for Carney to do -- he appears to understands the scale of the crisis, recently warning that some assets will be made worthless by the climate emergency). The governor (who leaves the Bank in March) says COP26 is vital: The combination of these critical meetings and the UK\u2019s global leadership in financial services provides a unique opportunity to address climate change by transforming the financial system. To seize it, all financial decisions need to take into account the risks from climate change and the opportunities from the transition to a net zero economy. The UK has a plan to do just that, and I look forward to working with the private sector, HM Government, the Bank of England and all stakeholders to help make this promise of sustainable finance a reality. Donald Trump isn\u2019t bowing to critics of his trade deal. The president has just tweeted that the Phase One agreement with China is \u201cone of the greatest trade deals ever made\u201d (despite not really addressing America\u2019s major concerns about China). Trump also claims that $250bn will be coming into America; the deal actually says China will buy at least $200bn more stuff. The eurozone economy is looking a little brighter today, despite the gloom in German factories. Car sales across the EU jumped by 21.4% year-on-year in December, new industry figures showed this morning. Demand was sharply higher in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. The figures show a recovery compared with 2018, when the diesel emissions scandal hit sales hard. European consumers also flocked to Primark stores; the discount chain reported a 5.1% jump in eurozone sales over Christmas, helped by \u201cstrong progress in France and Italy\u201d. Breaking: US retail sales have risen, and the number of Americans signing on for jobless benefit has fallen. In news that will please Donald Trump, retail sales jumped by 0.3% in December. They rose by a healthier 0.7% if you strip out cars purchases, suggesting that consumers continued to spend over the festive period. The initial claims figure -- showing how many people applied for state unemployment benefits -- dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000. That\u2019s a really low figure, showing US firms aren\u2019t slashing their workforce despite the drag from the trade war. Financial analyst and journalist Louise Cooper has analysed the US-China trade deal, and concluded that Xi Jinping and Liu He have done Donald Trump up like a kipper. She reckons that most of China\u2019s \u2018concessions\u2019 actually suit Beijing jolly nicely (you can read the agreement here). For example, pledging to buy US food is a no-brainer, when China is suffering from food scandals and a swine fever epidemic. Four whole pages of the deal relate to dairy and infant food formula - an area where China really needs US help. In a trade agreement of just 46 written pages, four pages are for dairy and infant formula! That is extraordinary. And it reflects Beijing\u2019s concerns not the interests of America! FYI China had a baby milk formula scandal over a decade ago that saw Chinese babies die. 22 Chinese companies were involved and still now Chinese parents don\u2019t trust Chinese made formula: China has also promised to allow parties in civil dispute to call witnesses, and cross-examine them. That will help to develop its legal system - handy in a more developed economy. And on forced technology transfers, China is pledging not to put pressure on US companies to hand over their secrets in return for approving a deal or joint venture. Cooper reckons this commitment is rather wishy-washy: This section is two pages long because many American companies will decide it is a worthwhile trade to do this. And it is very difficult to police. Which company would complain to Washington if they knew their complaint would get back to Beijing and they may be restricted from operating in the country for years? In conclusion, Cooper reckons that Trump (who was crowing about his deal yesterday), has actually been easily manipulated. I believe this trade agreement reflects the man. His inability to read much documentation, his short attention span, his inability to look into detail. But still to believe in his own brilliance and expertise. Just in: Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley has just beat expectations. MS has posted a 46% jump in net profits in the last quarter, to $2.2bn from $1.5bn. Revenues were sharply higher across the company, hitting record levels, with its investment banking and sales trading both growing their turnover. Its wealth management did pretty well, with record net revenues and pre-tax income. And Fixed-Income (bond-trading) had a stellar quarter, with revenues more than doubling (to $1.273bn, from $564m). Back in the UK, my colleague Rob Davies has another fascinating scoop into Britain\u2019s gambling industry: The brothers who own high street bookmaker Betfred are making millions from a business that provides treatment for health problems, including gambling addiction for public sector staff, the Guardian can disclose. Betfred\u2019s owners, the billionaire Tory party donors Fred and Peter Done, also own Health Assured, which holds dozens of government contracts to provide staff health and wellbeing programmes. Its taxpayer-funded clients include multiple NHS trusts that also treat gambling addicts as well as staff working for MPs, some of whom campaign for tighter restrictions on gambling. The Dones have taken \u00a35.2m in dividends from the business in the past three years. They have donated \u00a3375,000 to the Conservative party since 2016... Here\u2019s the full story: Germany\u2019s industrial heartland is still locked in recession, according to a fresh warning from its manufacturers. Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI industry body, told its annual conference today that there is no sign of an upturn, following a grim 2019. Kempf warned: \u201cIndustry remains stuck in recession, there are no signs for the sector bottoming out.\u201d Overall, BDI (the Federation of German Industries) only expects Germany to grow by 0.5% this year -- partly helped by an increase in working days. Germany has suffered badly from the US-China trade war, with weaker global growth meaning less demand for German-made heavy-duty machinery. It has also suffered from the slowdown in the eurozone, and structural problems in its car industry (the move away from polluting diesel cars to electric models). BDI is calling for Berlin to implement a big new public infrastructure project to boost growth (and give its members more work to do). It also wants corporation tax to be cut, from 31% to 25%, Reuters reports. These requests might run foul of Germany\u2019s insistence on running a balanced budget, though. Economist Rupert Seggins has helpfully crunched today\u2019s UK credit conditions survey: Getting back to the US-China trade deal.... and Chinese officials have been denying that the agreement is a damp squib. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that the Phase 1 agreement was good for both countries and the world, playing down concerns that China hasn\u2019t got much out of the deal. Chinese media have also been discouraging griping, as Reuters explains: An editorial in the Global Times, a tabloid run by the People\u2019s Daily, stated that debating \u201cabout who had lost or gained is shallow.\u201d \u201cWe urge individuals and forces to exercise some restraint in their nitpicking of the agreement and bad-mouthing future trade negotiations,\u201d it wrote. The Bank of England\u2019s latest survey of credit conditions is out, and shows that demand for loans fell in the last quarter. Demand for credit cards, mortgages and corporate loans all fell in the last three months -- a sign that households and companies were nervous ahead of December\u2019s election and the Brexit deadline later this month. Commercial banks reported that they expect demand for credit cards to rise in the current quarter, while mortgage demand could keep dropping. Lenders also expected demand for corporate lending in Q1 to increase slightly for small businesses and to decrease for medium and large businesses. Recruitment firm Hays is also among the fallers, down 3.3%, after hitting investors with a profits warning. Hays suffered a 4% drop in fees in the UK and Ireland, with demand for permanent workers down sharply. It blamed \u201ceconomic and political uncertainty\u201d for deterring firms from hiring new staff. CEO Alistair Cox blamed a quadruple-whammy of factors, from protests in France to the bushfire disaster in Australia. \u201cGrowth slowed markedly in December, driven by specific events in key markets: general strikes in France, tragic Australian bushfires and the UK election. Each event impacted markets already facing challenging economic conditions and low business confidence. Germany weakened further, with economic uncertainties driving increased client cost controls. Hays reports that Australian firms have reined in their hiring plans - a reminder of how the climate emergency will hurt the economy. The bushfires in Australia are a tragic and unprecedented situation and our first priority is the safety and well-being of our colleagues, temps and clients. We will do everything we can to provide any support that they need at this very difficult time. Net fees in Australia &amp; New Zealand (ANZ) declined by 7%, versus a tough growth comparative. Having been broadly sequentially stable in October and November, the Perm market slowed materially in December, with sentiment heavily impacted by the bushfires. Total fees are down 4% over the last quarter: Crumbs. Pearson\u2019s share price has hit its lowest level since the financial crisis a decade ago, after this morning\u2019s downbeat trading update. At 555p, they\u2019re a third of their value back in 2015, when it also owned the Financial Times (since sold to Japanese firm Nikkei). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: In all that time, under the stewardship of CEO John Fallon, and the sale of the FT in 2015 to Nikkei for \u00a3844m, the share price has pretty much gone one way, from record highs in March that year, to over 60% lower today, which suggests that while the Pearson management team may have had a strategy for the business, investors were less than convinced, and judging by this morning\u2019s reaction to yet another profits warning, remain to be so. In another twist, CFO Coram Williams is leaving the company, and being replaced by his deputy, Sally Johnson Hewson says this \u201cdoesn\u2019t exactly come across as a vote of confidence either, coming so soon after the decision by CEO John Fallon to step aside last month.\u201d Whitbread has joined Pearson at the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, down 5% this morning. It warned shareholders that demand for hotel rooms in Britain\u2019s regions (a key political battleground) is still weak. Its Premier Inns regional division has suffered a 2% drop in sales in the last quarter, while sales in London grew by almost 5%. Whitbread also warned that 2020 could be tough: The UK political &amp; economic environment remains uncertain and the sustained industry inflation continues. It remains difficult to predict business confidence in the short-term and its impact on the market. Shares in Pearson have plunged by 10% this morning after the educational publishing giant disappointed the City. Investors are unimpressed that profits will only reach the bottom of Pearson\u2019s guidance (around \u00a3590m), as the company continues to struggle with the move away from physical books in favour of digital. It\u2019s US higher education division dragged the rest of the company back, says CEO John Fallon: \u201cWe have secured flat revenue this year and delivered operating profit within the guidance range, with much weaker sales in US Higher Education Courseware offset by a strong performance in the broader 76% of Pearson. There\u2019s no trade deal bounce in Europe this morning. The stock markets have opened cautiously, with the FTSE 100 up by just 3 points or 0.05%. There are some big movers in the City, though.... Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the former EU Trade commissioner, says the global economy will continue to suffer from the tariffs on US and Chinese goods. Rating agency Moody\u2019s has given the Phase One trade deal a modest welcome, but warned that relations between Washington and Beijing could flare up again. Michael Taylor, managing director of Moody\u2019s Investors Service Credit Strategy, says: The agreement could help boost bilateral exports by the two economies and lead to an improvement in business confidence as well as investment. \u201cBut the details of the agreement suggest that there remains considerable scope for friction between the two sides.\u201d Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, also sees challenges ahead: \u201cWe believe the agreement underpins a positive outlook for risk assets, especially emerging market stocks. But it is also important for investors to understand the limitations of the deal. So we see the deal as representing a partial calming rather than an end to trade tensions.\u201d Despite being around 92 pages long, the US-China trade deal is still vague on some key issues. The National Farmers Union, which represents almost 200,000 American farmers, is disappointed that there\u2019s not more detail about exactly what extra products will be purchased. They say: Without more concrete details, we are deeply concerned that all of this pain may not have been worth it. Given the numerous deals that have been reached and then breached in the past two years, we are also sceptical.\u201d Fernando Valle, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, agrees that there\u2019s a lack of clarity to back up the big numbers (such as the $200bn in extra purchases China plans to make). Valle says: \u201cIt\u2019s just big numbers thrown around.\u201d American farmers may be feeling glum today. Soybean prices have fallen to a one-month low since the details of the US-China trade deal were published. Wheat and corn prices are down too. There\u2019s disappointment that China hasn\u2019t made any specific commitments to buy certain commodities - just to raise its total spending on US farm products by $32bn over the next two years. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Peace has broken out in the US-China trade war, but for how long? There\u2019s relief in the markets this morning after the two sides finally signed their long-awaited Phase One trade deal....but also concerns that the agreement won\u2019t provide much of a boost to the global economy As we covered last night, China has agreed to buy $200bn of US products over the next two years, including at least $32bn extra agricultural products. Signing the deal last night at the White House, Chinese vice-premier Liu He pledged to work with Washington to implement the deal. Liu told a room packed with US business leaders that: \u201cThe Phase-one deal will help maintain world peace, stability and prosperity. US and China can work together to achieve win-win relationship despite differences in politics, economic model.\u201d Trump (never one to leave his trumpet untooted) says it\u2019s \u201cthe biggest deal ever\u201d.... \u201cMomentous\u201d was mentioned too, as the president declared a breakthough in relations with Beijing. Here\u2019s a breakdown of China\u2019s commitments: Manufacturing goods: at least $32.9bn more in 2020, rising to $44.8bn more in 2021 Agricultural products: at least $12.5bn more in 2020, rising to $19.5bn in 2021. Energy products: at least $18.5bn more in 2020, rising to $33.9bn in 2021 Services: at least $12.8bn more in 2020, rising to $25.1 in 2021 The deal means that some planned tariffs on Chinese-made consumer electronics products have been cancelled, and others have been lowered. The reality, though, is that tricky issues such as China\u2019s state subsidies, and the forced transfer of technologies from US companies, haven\u2019t been addressed yet. And that means America is leaving tariffs in place on around $360bn of Chinese goods, including food, chemicals, industrial products and some electronics. Rebecca Harding, trade economist and CEO of Coriolis Technologies says the deal is \u201centirely political\u201d: In an election year, President Trump can present this as a win for US manufacturers and producers. He also retains leverage on China in any future trade deals that might be negotiated. Issues around China\u2019s Intellectual Property \u201ctheft\u201d and its security risk to the US economy have been kicked into a subsequent agreement which is unlikely to be signed before the US Presidential election. Traders seem to agree that the deal, although welcome, isn\u2019t really ground-breaking. Stocks rallied, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to a new closing high of 29,030. Australia\u2019s stock market has hit a new closing high, on hopes that Chinese demand for Australian raw materials will hold up well. But soybean prices have fallen overnight, on disappointment that China isn\u2019t making bigger commitments -- and concerns over how the deal will be enforced. We\u2019ll be tracking reaction to the deal today. Also coming up today It\u2019s a busy morning in the City, with several UK companies reporting weak results. Pearson, the publishing company, has only reported flat revenues for 2019 due to a sharp drop in sales in the US. This means profits will miss forecasts. Recruitment firm Hays have warned that operating profits have been hit by a slowdown in hiring, in the UK, France and Australia. Fashion retailer N Brown has also warned that profits will miss forecasts, partly due to heavy discounting on the high street. Hotel chain Whitbread is also finding conditions tough, reporting a 1.3% drop in like-for-like sales in the UK. Halfords, though, is upbeat after selling record numbers of kids bicycles last year. And discount chain Primark has reported a pick-up in demand in the eurozone. More on all that shortly too....

Writing for the Guardian, Long-Bailey said the party\u2019s Brexit position lay at the heart of its failure to win against Boris Johnson. She said that after the EU referendum in 2016 Labour should have spent less time trying to \u201cwin procedural games in parliament\u201d and more time holding public meetings outside Westminster. \u201cWe should have used the aftermath of the referendum result to go around the country, holding public meeting after public meeting to stir up a democratic revolution, pledging to take on the political establishment and raise up the people\u2019s demands beyond our institutional arrangements with the European Union,\u201d she said. Her approach echoes that of Jeremy Corbyn, whose leadership was focused on trying to build a socialist movement to help transform society. Long-Bailey said the next Labour leadership team \u201cmust not junk our values\u201d but ought to change in order to \u201ctrust its members and be so much more than a group of politicians in parliament\u201d. By holding public meetings, Labour could have come up with \u201ca set of popular remedies to deal with the three, linked crises our country faces: of democracy, the economy and the environment\u201d, she said. As leader of the party, Long-Bailey said she would seek to create a \u201cpopular movement to turn the British state against the privatisers, big polluters and tax dodgers that have taken hold of our political system\u201d. She said scrapping the House of Lords was only the beginning, as the British state \u201cneeds a seismic shock to prise it open at all levels to the people\u201d. One poll so far has indicated Long-Bailey is the favourite with the membership, while a previous one put Keir Starmer ahead. Momentum\u2019s backing for Long-Bailey is likely to give her a big boost, as the group is planning to host hundreds of phone banks across the country and use peer-to-peer calling apps to support her campaign.

      "bodyText": "The brothers who own the high street bookmaker Betfred are making millions from a business that treats public sector staff for health problems including gambling addiction, the Guardian can disclose. Betfred\u2019s owners, the billionaire Tory party donors Fred and Peter Done, also own Health Assured, which holds dozens of government contracts to provide health and wellbeing programmes to staff. Its taxpayer-funded clients include multiple NHS trusts that also treat gambling addicts, as well as MPs\u2019 employees, some of whom campaign for tighter restrictions on gambling. The Dones have taken \u00a35.2m in dividends from the business in the past three years. They have donated \u00a3375,000 to the Conservative party since 2016. MPs on both sides of the house voiced dismay at the \u201ccynical\u201d arrangement, while the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the fact the Dones were profiting from betting and from gambling addiction treatment showed an \u201cunacceptable conflict of interest\u201d. Claire Murdoch, the NHS mental health chief who wrote to gambling firms including Betfred this week urging them to improve their practices, said the Dones\u2019 ownership of addiction services was \u201chypocrisy and tokenism\u201d. Health Assured runs Employee Assistance Programmes, which provide companies or public sector organisations with services that staff can access to address issues affecting their wellbeing. Analysis reveals it holds at least \u00a32.5m-worth of government contracts with public sector bodies, including the Houses of Parliament, local authorities and the Ministry of Defence. The true figure is likely to be much higher because some multimillion-pound contracts are awarded to multiple firms and are not itemised to show which company earned what. The contracts mean that Health Assured\u2019s services are potentially used by tens of thousands of government employees, particularly in the NHS. Murdoch said: \u201cThe example of gambling companies providing clinics to treat the very people they have stoked [\u2026] is I think hypocrisy and tokenism.\u201d She urged problem gamblers to visit one of a raft of new NHS clinics set up to deal with the problem instead. Her comments come the day after she wrote to gambling firms to say that the health service should not be left to pick up the pieces from tactics they use to retain customers with addiction issues. In the letter, Murdoch said: \u201cAs the head of England\u2019s mental health services and a nurse of more than 30 years\u2019 experience, I have seen first hand the devastating impact on mental wellbeing of addiction and am concerned that the prevalence of gambling in our society is causing harm.\u201d She added that she was particularly concerned about the incentives offered to gamblers who are members of VIP schemes, the widespread use of which was revealed in the Guardian earlier this month. According to Health Assured\u2019s website, NHS staff can access counselling for issues such as \u201creckless behaviour\u201d, including excessive drinking or gambling. Ashworth said: \u201cAddiction, whether from gambling, drinks or drugs, is a growing mental and public health emergency in society.

To win again, Labour must become a force capable of bringing that about. Proper democracy takes power away from the offshore bank account and places it on the ballot paper, so workers can have more, and bank accounts in tax havens less, and we can tackle the climate crisis with a green new deal that unites all of Labour\u2019s heartlands.</p> <p>The people of this country can do it. We can take charge and build a very different future for ourselves, but only if we grasp our most powerful collective weapon: a government for and by the people. We need a popular movement to turn the British state against the privatisers, big polluters and tax dodgers that have taken hold of our political system.</p> <p>The Labour party now has four years to reconnect with the people of our country, build a powerful movement to raise up their demands and be the force that helps them take charge. Politicians themselves will never upend the political system in the interests of the many, not the few, but our movement can help the people of Britain make that change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/17/rebecca-long-bailey-leadership-pitch-is-far-from-perfect\">Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s leadership pitch is far from perfect | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To meet that demand, Labour must continue to change, trust its members and be so much more than a group of politicians in parliament. Much of Labour politics should take place far away from Westminster, as a movement helping people take charge in their workplaces, homes and communities. In this way, we will develop and win support for policies that start a democratic revolution to take power out of the hands of unaccountable elites.</p> <p>So, yes, that means scrapping the House of Lords. But that is only the beginning. The British state needs a seismic shock, to prise it open at all levels to the people \u2013 their knowledge, their skills, their demands.</p> <p>For the people to take charge, those that hoard power \u2013 like the big corporations that fund the Conservatives or the corporate lobbyists who write laws to suit their paymasters \u2013 will have to be forced out.</p> <p>And we have to be honest. For the people to take charge, we must pick a fight with the political establishment. To be trusted, we must show voters how our movement can, and will, win with them.</p> <p>That\u2019s our path to power.</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Long-Bailey is the Labour MP for Salford and Eccles and a candidate for the Labour party leadership</p>",

A joint agenda could have brought people together. Instead, we tried to compromise between the two extremes on Brexit, neither of which could deliver the change the British people need. For lasting, serious change to happen, people in this country must themselves take charge of politics through a democratic revolution. To win again, Labour must become a force capable of bringing that about. Proper democracy takes power away from the offshore bank account and places it on the ballot paper, so workers can have more, and bank accounts in tax havens less, and we can tackle the climate crisis with a green new deal that unites all of Labour\u2019s heartlands. The people of this country can do it. We can take charge and build a very different future for ourselves, but only if we grasp our most powerful collective weapon: a government for and by the people. We need a popular movement to turn the British state against the privatisers, big polluters and tax dodgers that have taken hold of our political system. The Labour party now has four years to reconnect with the people of our country, build a powerful movement to raise up their demands and be the force that helps them take charge. Politicians themselves will never upend the political system in the interests of the many, not the few, but our movement can help the people of Britain make that change. To meet that demand, Labour must continue to change, trust its members and be so much more than a group of politicians in parliament. Much of Labour politics should take place far away from Westminster, as a movement helping people take charge in their workplaces, homes and communities. In this way, we will develop and win support for policies that start a democratic revolution to take power out of the hands of unaccountable elites. So, yes, that means scrapping the House of Lords. But that is only the beginning. The British state needs a seismic shock, to prise it open at all levels to the people \u2013 their knowledge, their skills, their demands. For the people to take charge, those that hoard power \u2013 like the big corporations that fund the Conservatives or the corporate lobbyists who write laws to suit their paymasters \u2013 will have to be forced out. And we have to be honest. For the people to take charge, we must pick a fight with the political establishment. To be trusted, we must show voters how our movement can, and will, win with them. That\u2019s our path to power. \u2022 Rebecca Long-Bailey is the Labour MP for Salford and Eccles and a candidate for the Labour party leadership",

It's an out-of-control response of the body to infection and most common in young and old who have fragile or impaired immune systems. In severe sepsis, the immune system goes into overdrive in an attempt to fight off an infection \u2013 most commonly pneumonia \u2013 and the body\u2019s organs shut down. Sepsis can be, but is not always, a complication of septicaemia, which is severe blood poisoning. It is difficult to diagnose and life-threatening if not caught quickly. Those who survive can suffer severe disabilities.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the signs?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It varies depending on the age of the sufferer. In children under the age of five, people should look for whether they appear \u201cmottled, bluish or pale\u201d, whether they are \u201cvery lethargic or difficult to wake\u201d and if the child is \u201cabnormally cold to touch\u201d, says the NHS. Fast breathing, a rash that does not fade and fits or convulsions are also warning signs.</p>\n    <p>In anyone older, early symptoms include: a \u201chigh temperature (fever) or low body temperature\u201d and chills, as well as fast breathing and heart rate. Sepsis is often mistaken for flu, so sufferers are advised to seek medical help if they get those symptoms after having had an infection or an injury.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How common is it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Global Burden of Disease study says there were almost 50 million cases worldwide in 2017 and 11 million deaths \u2013 85% of them in low and middle-income countries. It affects babies and small children most \u2013&nbsp; more than 40% of deaths were in children under 5. In the UK there were nearly 48,000 adult and child cases that year. UCL experts say about 150 children die each year.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What causes it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Elderly people in affluent countries with chronic conditions such as heart failure and type 2 diabetes and newborn babies in low income countries are particularly at risk from sepsis because they have weak or under-developed immune systems, which allow an infection to spread around the body. That can be any serious infection, such as flu, pneumonia, Group B strep or a hospital-acquired infection. The immune system fights back, but the chemicals it releases to fight the infection affect the entire body, causing widespread inflammation, damaging tissue and interfering with blood flow. That can lead to low blood pressure and less oxygenation of organs, which may shut down as a result.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The increase in cases they had found was not surprising, she said. \u201cWe are finally able to access data for children for areas of the world and groups of young children for which we had the least data previously.\u201d</p> \n<p>In high-income countries, by contrast, \u201cwe find similar or in some cases slightly lower levels of sepsis than previously,\u201d she said.

Perhaps future rhetorical struggles, then, will contend over whether home-grown robots or suspiciously cosmopolitan xenobots from overseas should replace us in our jobs. In the meantime, I for one welcome our new xenobot overlords. \u2022 Steven Poole\u2019s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus.",

      "body": "<p>A gig economy union leader is to sue the police after he was wrongly prosecuted for alleged assault at a demonstration by using a megaphone close to police officers\u2019 ears.</p> <p>James Farrar, a former Uber driver who leads the private hire branch of the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), will claim malicious prosecution after his trial at Southwark crown court collapsed on Thursday because of a lack of evidence.</p> <p>Judge Philip Bartle QC instructed the jury to acquit after two days of evidence and said it was \u201cvery unfortunate indeed that this case arose\u201d. Farrar described the prosecution as \u201ca corrupt and crude attempt by the Metropolitan police and Transport for London to break our union and further disenfranchise precarious workers\u201d.</p> <p>Farrar\u2019s solicitor said he could also sue the Crown Prosecution Service in the same civil suit.</p> <p>Farrar said the prosecution was triggered only when he chased up a complaint about police treatment of the minicab drivers at the 4 March protest that he believed was discriminatory because police were responding differently to a simultaneous black taxi protest. He asked the Independent Office for Police Conduct to escalate his complaint on 23 July 2019 and he was charged with assault 48 hours later.</p> <p>Two police officers complained their hearing was hurt by Farrar\u2019s loud megaphone when he was leading the protest against the mayor of London\u2019s decision to levy the congestion charge on minicabs but not black taxis. The union alleges it amounts to racial discrimination because minicab drivers in London are mostly from ethnic minorities while taxi drivers are mostly white.</p> <p>\u201cWe think the prosecution was a result of James\u2019s complaints,\u201d said Raj Chada, his solicitor at Hodge Jones Allen. \u201cThe police were covering their own backs and using it as a smokescreen.\u201d</p> <p>Bartle instructed the jury there was no evidence of \u201cbeating\u201d and that using a loudhailer was not sufficient to amount to an offence of the unlawful application of force.

      "bodyText": "A gig economy union leader is to sue the police after he was wrongly prosecuted for alleged assault at a demonstration by using a megaphone close to police officers\u2019 ears. James Farrar, a former Uber driver who leads the private hire branch of the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), will claim malicious prosecution after his trial at Southwark crown court collapsed on Thursday because of a lack of evidence. Judge Philip Bartle QC instructed the jury to acquit after two days of evidence and said it was \u201cvery unfortunate indeed that this case arose\u201d. Farrar described the prosecution as \u201ca corrupt and crude attempt by the Metropolitan police and Transport for London to break our union and further disenfranchise precarious workers\u201d. Farrar\u2019s solicitor said he could also sue the Crown Prosecution Service in the same civil suit. Farrar said the prosecution was triggered only when he chased up a complaint about police treatment of the minicab drivers at the 4 March protest that he believed was discriminatory because police were responding differently to a simultaneous black taxi protest. He asked the Independent Office for Police Conduct to escalate his complaint on 23 July 2019 and he was charged with assault 48 hours later. Two police officers complained their hearing was hurt by Farrar\u2019s loud megaphone when he was leading the protest against the mayor of London\u2019s decision to levy the congestion charge on minicabs but not black taxis. The union alleges it amounts to racial discrimination because minicab drivers in London are mostly from ethnic minorities while taxi drivers are mostly white. \u201cWe think the prosecution was a result of James\u2019s complaints,\u201d said Raj Chada, his solicitor at Hodge Jones Allen. \u201cThe police were covering their own backs and using it as a smokescreen.\u201d Bartle instructed the jury there was no evidence of \u201cbeating\u201d and that using a loudhailer was not sufficient to amount to an offence of the unlawful application of force. Even if an application for costs is successful, the three-day trial will still have cost Farrar and his union about \u00a320,000. Farrar said: \u201cI now call on the mayor of London to conduct an urgent investigation into this case and ensure those responsible are held to account. I have now instructed my lawyers to pursue this matter.\u201d The alleged assault occurred when police tried to clear protesters away from flatbed trucks the Met had brought in to help remove parked cars. Farrar had wanted his members to be able to drive on to the square and complained to police that they were being treated differently to the protesting black-cab drivers. The prosecution told the jury the loud noise from Farrar\u2019s megaphone exacerbated an ear infection in one of the officers, Sgt James Lewis. PC Ann Spinks, who was diagnosed with a hearing problem several decades ago and wore hearing aids, claimed she was left with her ear ringing \u201clike a fire alarm going off\u201d. \u201cThe initial ringing in my ear was still happening towards the end of that day and it wasn\u2019t as bad as it had initially been, probably about two or three days after,\u201d she said. Ikah Peart QC, for Farrar, put it to her that the noisy demonstration was like \u201ca loud rock concert\u201d and \u201cyou can\u2019t attribute the ringing in your ear simply because you\u2019ve chosen to stand in front of Mr Farrar\u2019s megaphone\u201d. \u201cNot specifically, no,\u201d Spinks replied. Bartle told the jury: \u201cThe facts did not justify the offence in either case of assault by beating, because that offence requires unlawful application of force and I accepted the defence argument that on the facts of this case the use of a loudhailer was not, considering the law, sufficient to amount to an offence of the unlawful application of force.\u201d The IWGB said it was \u201cdeeply concerned that police allegations came after the union had lodged official complaints with the Metropolitan police road and transport command over police behaviour at the demonstration\u201d. \u201cFarrar complained about police violence against protesters and terrorist profiling of union members.

Based on her lifestyle portal, currently valued at $250m, The Goop Lab will see the turbocapitalist fanny-egg entrepreneur take us to new frontiers in the wellness universe.</p> <p>Incidentally, I just want to say right off the bat that I still have no idea what \u201cwellness\u201d even means, but I make sure to always use it with an appearance of knowingness, like I do with \u201cneoliberalism\u201d or \u201ccervix\u201d. In fact, I am beginning to think there may be some semantic overlap between all three of the aforementioned concepts. And once I\u2019ve read all the books in the world about all the other subjects, I guess I\u2019ll force myself to get around to finding out.</p> <p>For now, let\u2019s just let the show\u2019s arrival cascade over us like the outdoor shower in a $1,700-a-night East African luxury eco-lodge (the massage cabanas are amazing, but the town does get dangerous after nightfall). And so to a breakdown of what we know.</p> <h2><strong>The title</strong><br></h2> <p>Of course, Gwyneth &amp; Co have gone with The Goop Lab, suggestive as it is of a highly scientific facility, and definitely not one of those Potemkin labs the Russians use during the Olympics, where it\u2019s basically just a lab-effect stage set built around a hole in the wall through which they pass the clean piss.</p> <p>It seems pretty clear the only thing you do with clean piss here is drink it. The Goop Lab is one of those labs with pink sofas and bunches of cultivated wildflowers, where people can pipette phrases such as \u201cwearable stickers that rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies\u201d and \u201csurprisingly affordable yacht rental\u201d into your consciousness.

      "bodyText": "Huge excitement in TV\u2019s burgeoning disinfomercial genre, as Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Netflix show prepares to make landfall next week. Based on her lifestyle portal, currently valued at $250m, The Goop Lab will see the turbocapitalist fanny-egg entrepreneur take us to new frontiers in the wellness universe. Incidentally, I just want to say right off the bat that I still have no idea what \u201cwellness\u201d even means, but I make sure to always use it with an appearance of knowingness, like I do with \u201cneoliberalism\u201d or \u201ccervix\u201d. In fact, I am beginning to think there may be some semantic overlap between all three of the aforementioned concepts. And once I\u2019ve read all the books in the world about all the other subjects, I guess I\u2019ll force myself to get around to finding out. For now, let\u2019s just let the show\u2019s arrival cascade over us like the outdoor shower in a $1,700-a-night East African luxury eco-lodge (the massage cabanas are amazing, but the town does get dangerous after nightfall). And so to a breakdown of what we know. The title Of course, Gwyneth &amp; Co have gone with The Goop Lab, suggestive as it is of a highly scientific facility, and definitely not one of those Potemkin labs the Russians use during the Olympics, where it\u2019s basically just a lab-effect stage set built around a hole in the wall through which they pass the clean piss. It seems pretty clear the only thing you do with clean piss here is drink it. The Goop Lab is one of those labs with pink sofas and bunches of cultivated wildflowers, where people can pipette phrases such as \u201cwearable stickers that rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies\u201d and \u201csurprisingly affordable yacht rental\u201d into your consciousness. Everything that happens in the trailer [cf The Trailer] feels as if the camera has been switched on two seconds after Gwynnie has announced: \u201cYou can say anything within these walls and there will be no judgment.\u201d If these words have in fact been said, they should absolutely not be taken as a challenge. You simply couldn\u2019t call any of this stuff transparent and exploitative rubbish in The Goop Lab, which you should assume ranks somewhere between Iran and Somalia on the blasphemy laws front. Consider the moment in the trailer, where the words \u201cpsychic mediums\u201d are flashed on the screen, and we cut to Gwyneth telling four people who contractually can\u2019t call her a silly cow: \u201cShe knew something that my husband didn\u2019t even know.\u201d Course she did. Meanwhile, as you would expect of a firm that has previously reached settlements with the California Food, Drug, and Medical Device Task Force, the show\u2019s mere existence has met with exasperation from some of the doctors and scientists who have criticised its output in the past. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated that Gwyneth Paltrow and Goop and their pseudoscientific empire is being given a platform,\u201d Timothy Caulfield, a professor of health law and science policy at the University of Alberta, stated this week. The ad campaign Given that Goop has previously pushed $956 loo roll, Gwyneth has always banked on extremely strong troll energy. Of the various scientific firestorms the site has ignited, she simply observed last year: \u201cI can monetise those eyeballs.\u201d You may be already aware of a recent sellout Goop product, a \u00a358 scented candle branded with the line \u201cTHIS CANDLE SMELLS LIKE MY VAGINA\u201d. If so, it will feel inevitable that Netflix\u2019s promotional picture for The Goop Lab deliberately places a smiling Gwyneth in a sort of endlessly receding pink tunnel.

One danger, the US believes, is that its intelligence could be compromised because the UK has access to data under the \u201cfive eyes\u201d pact and Huawei could be subject to Chinese state influence, something Huawei has denied. Hogan said the EU and the US needed to cooperate on regulation on technology, otherwise both sides would lose to China. He also said he believed the US and the EU could come to some agreement on a tax on digital companies such as Amazon and Google. \u201cEverybody accepts, including the US, there will be a global tax to deal with technology companies. It\u2019s a question of how we define that and we criteria we end up with,\u201d he said. On Brexit he warned that it was impossible to agree a comprehensive new relationship with the UK by the December deadline set by Boris Johnson. \u201cPrime minister Johnson has said he wants everything concluded by the end of the year \u2013 it\u2019s just not possible,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially when you have to make a decision about the transition period by the first of July.\u201d After the interview, Lord Mandelson told reporters that a narrow trade deal was possible by the end of the year but the strings attached to it might be unpalatable. \u201cI think we can get a bare bones agreement by the end of the year, which would envisage tariff-free and quota-free trade, but it would come at a price and I am not sure that the government would, given the political constraints, be willing to pay it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "At least 80% of the Blue Mountains world heritage area and more than 50% of the Gondwana world heritage rainforests have burned in Australia\u2019s ongoing bushfire crisis. The scale of the disaster is such that it could affect the diversity of eucalypts for which the Blue Mountains world heritage area is recognised, said John Merson, the executive director of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Institute. The data is based on a Guardian Australia analysis of areas burned in New South Wales and Queensland and was confirmed by the NSW government. Guardian Australia reported in December that 20% of the Blue Mountains world heritage area had been affected by fire in the early months of the crisis. Four times that amount has now burned in what Merson said were fires of a scale that \u201chas never happened before\u201d. \u201cThis is totally, totally unique. As everybody keeps saying, it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d he said. The Blue Mountains world heritage area covers one million hectares of national park and bushland and is dominated by temperate eucalypt forest. The area is renowned for the diversity of its vegetation and is home to about a third of the world\u2019s eucalypt species. While most are fire-adapted and can regenerate, many of the species depend on long intervals between fires, Merson said. \u201cWe had a very large fire in 2013. It\u2019s only six years after that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe eucalypts can be very badly reduced in diversity if fires come through in too short and intense intervals. Their numbers will virtually collapse.\u201d He said the full impact on tree species and wildlife would not be known until more assessments were done as fire grounds became accessible. But there are concerns about the effect on breeding and feeding habitats for species including the spotted-tail quoll and the brush-tailed rock-wallaby. The fires have also burnt swamp communities that release water slowly and are important water resources. They flow into streams that feed into Sydney\u2019s water supply and provide water for wildlife. It was revealed this week that a rescue mission by NSW fire crews was able to save the only known natural grove of Wollemi pines, so-called \u201cdinosaur trees\u201d that fossil records show existed up to 200m years ago. Merson said the fires had entered areas that had not burnt previously and the need for the rescue mission was indicative of the intensity of the fires in the region. \u201cThis is climate change in its most fundamental form,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is right in our face. We\u2019re living it.\u201d Further north, the fires have devastated parts of the Gondwana rainforest world heritage area, a collection of reserves of subtropical rainforest that span 366,500 hectares across NSW and Queensland. Guardian Australia used newly released data which combines all burned areas in NSW and Queensland since 1 July 2019, and calculated the area of overlap with world heritage areas. This analysis shows 53% of the Gondwana rainforest area has burned. Guardian Australia spoke to Mark Graham, an ecologist with the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, in December. Graham is based in the Bellinger Valley near some of these fires. He said since December there had been \u201csignificant, additional fire in areas that hadn\u2019t burned\u201d in Barrington Tops, and that most of the Gondwana areas have taken a \u201cmassive hit\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s heart-wrenching. It\u2019s disturbing. It\u2019s frightening.\u201d Graham said his area had experienced some rain in recent weeks but there were now concerns that sediment washed into the Bellinger River has affected the food sources for the critically endangered Bellinger River snapping turtle. A spokesman for the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment said understanding the impact of the fires on both world heritage areas was a priority. \u201cAnalysis will improve as the forests becomes safe to enter and the smoke clears, enabling accurate satellite and aerial imagery to help guide our assessment and on work on ground,\u201d he said. He said both regions contained a mixture of forest types, some of which was adapted for fire, but others that were more sensitive to fire, such as dense rainforest. Jess Abrahams, the nature campaigner for the Australian Conservation Foundation, said climate change was hitting Australia\u2019s world heritage areas \u201cvery hard\u201d. \u201cWe have witnessed consecutive years of devastating coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, while global heating has been described as a catastrophic risk to the Wet Tropics and Shark Bay world heritage areas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really upsetting to see how much of the Blue Mountains world heritage area has been burnt. \u201cThis is a place many Australians know and love.

At the time it seemed impossible that such a place would ever burn. Now it seems impossible that it didn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>The Wollemi pine has been a story that has captured people\u2019s imaginations. It is a tale of high adventure and academic excellence. First, there was a dramatic canyoning exploration trip that led to its discovery, then scientific detective work to determine exactly what that 40-metre-tall tree found by Noble actually was, followed by the quest to understand how it survived unnoticed, so close to Sydney.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the significance of the discovery was best captured by a quote given to me by the then director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Carrick Chambers, on the day the discovery was announced: \u201cThis is the equivalent of finding a small dinosaur alive on Earth.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d8c6a8c047db5737df6ac18c9f10ba0ddbf47e3b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8c6a8c047db5737df6ac18c9f10ba0ddbf47e3b/0_330_7952_4774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pine needles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wollemi pines have a lineage dating back to the age of dinosaurs and were on the precipice of extinction before they were found.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What Chambers was alluding to and that most people don\u2019t realise is that Wollemi pines are time travellers from a different Australia, from a warmer and wetter planet. Their history stretches back more than 100m years and they have survived natural climate change that has seen temperatures swing dramatically and sea levels rise and fall by hundreds of metres, multiple times.</p> \n<p>The trees tell the story of almost unimaginably deep time. Once, instead of gum trees, Gondwana \u2013 of which Australia was a small part \u2013 was covered in immense forests of Wollemi pines and their close relatives. These ancient trees deposited so much pollen that it is still found as fossils around the southern hemisphere, retrieved by geologists who find evidence of the trees in cores, from places like Bass Strait, that are kilometres thick.</p> \n<p>Then, 10m years ago, the trees begin to vanish from the fossil pollen record and two million years ago they disappeared altogether, indicating that the climate had shifted in a way that made their widespread survival untenable.</p> \n<p>Since then, as the planet shifted towards icier, colder, drier conditions, any surviving populations of the trees would have slowly shrunk, become separated and forced to retreat into the last refuges of wet deep rainforest canyons. After people arrived in Australia and widespread burning was practised, their fate was sealed to imprisonment in a single deep gorge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b06574805f47d6202acd1e2045fdd09ffc6a8a2e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b06574805f47d6202acd1e2045fdd09ffc6a8a2e/0_331_4032_2641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firefighter operating irrigation machine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Intensive water-bombing and the installation of emergency irrigation by firefighters has allowed the trees to survive.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is hard, after this week, to consider the remaining original Wollemi pines as wild. Only intensive water-bombing, the installation of emergency irrigation and the intervention of determined firefighting has allowed them to survive until the next threat.

      "bodyText": "Imagine if more than a quarter of a century ago, the bushwalker David Noble had not stumbled across the stand of Wollemi pines and they had remained undiscovered. The trees survive in three stands in just one remote canyon in a massive wilderness to Sydney\u2019s north-west. Until they were found, they were a species clinging to the edge of the precipice of extinction \u2013 just one disaster away from vanishing. A quarter of a century for a species with a lineage going back to the age of dinosaurs is not even a fraction of a millionth of a blip. And given the monumental effort that has gone into saving this desperately endangered wild population it is highly likely that had they not been found in 1994, then the past few months would have seen them wiped out without anyone ever knowing they still existed. The miracle of their discovery has become the miracle that has saved them \u2013 for now. I remember the day in a Sydney newsroom almost 20 years ago when an editor at the paper where I worked at the time heard that I was writing a book about the Wollemi pines. Even though the trees\u2019 discovery in 1994 made news on front pages around the world, my boss walked over to my desk, looked me in the eye and said: \u201cNo one is going to read a fucking book about a tree.\u201d Implicit in what he said was that no one cared about Wollemi pines enough to read a book about them. How wrong he was, was demonstrated this week as dramatic news emerged that the trees had been saved from the firestorm of the vast Gospers Mountain fire and people rejoiced. To see the photos of the ribbon of green of the Wollemi pines, surrounded by the charred towering clifftops and ridgelines, was a rare moment of joy and relief for a community that has watched so much destroyed during the past few months. When I visited the canyon in 1997 I was taken in by helicopter wearing a blindfold and then abseiled into a deep and dark prehistoric environment that was absolutely soaked and waterlogged. At the time it seemed impossible that such a place would ever burn. Now it seems impossible that it didn\u2019t. The Wollemi pine has been a story that has captured people\u2019s imaginations. It is a tale of high adventure and academic excellence. First, there was a dramatic canyoning exploration trip that led to its discovery, then scientific detective work to determine exactly what that 40-metre-tall tree found by Noble actually was, followed by the quest to understand how it survived unnoticed, so close to Sydney. Perhaps the significance of the discovery was best captured by a quote given to me by the then director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Carrick Chambers, on the day the discovery was announced: \u201cThis is the equivalent of finding a small dinosaur alive on Earth.\u201d What Chambers was alluding to and that most people don\u2019t realise is that Wollemi pines are time travellers from a different Australia, from a warmer and wetter planet. Their history stretches back more than 100m years and they have survived natural climate change that has seen temperatures swing dramatically and sea levels rise and fall by hundreds of metres, multiple times. The trees tell the story of almost unimaginably deep time. Once, instead of gum trees, Gondwana \u2013 of which Australia was a small part \u2013 was covered in immense forests of Wollemi pines and their close relatives. These ancient trees deposited so much pollen that it is still found as fossils around the southern hemisphere, retrieved by geologists who find evidence of the trees in cores, from places like Bass Strait, that are kilometres thick. Then, 10m years ago, the trees begin to vanish from the fossil pollen record and two million years ago they disappeared altogether, indicating that the climate had shifted in a way that made their widespread survival untenable. Since then, as the planet shifted towards icier, colder, drier conditions, any surviving populations of the trees would have slowly shrunk, become separated and forced to retreat into the last refuges of wet deep rainforest canyons. After people arrived in Australia and widespread burning was practised, their fate was sealed to imprisonment in a single deep gorge. It is hard, after this week, to consider the remaining original Wollemi pines as wild. Only intensive water-bombing, the installation of emergency irrigation and the intervention of determined firefighting has allowed them to survive until the next threat. The trees are now dependent on us for their survival. And it\u2019s not just our efforts to protect the canyon where they survive, it is also about the research that has seen millions of trees cultivated and sold commercially around the world. It is about the creation of back-up populations in other similar canyons in the greater Blue Mountains. It is also about the ongoing effort to keep the location of the trees secret and protected from fungal pathogens. The fact that out of this catastrophe, Wollemi pines have become a symbol of survival and all that is good about what we can do when we are determined to protect something, shows that all is not lost as human-made climate change tightens its grip.

      "bodyText": "The Labor MP Graham Perrett has complained about the politicisation of the Coalition\u2019s controversial $100m community sport infrastructure grant program after he was excluded from the announcement of a local grant he\u2019d lobbied for while his Liberal opponent was invited for a photo opportunity. The member for Moreton told Guardian Australia he had helped local soccer club the Sunnybank Saints win $135,000 for a clubhouse upgrade by writing a letter of support, only to discover the application was successful when the club was contacted for a photo opportunity with his opponent, the councillor Angela Owen. Perrett\u2019s is just one complaint from Labor MPs about the $100m program overseen by the then sports minister Bridget McKenzie that is the subject of a scathing audit office report which found funding decisions were skewed in favour of marginal and target seats. The audit was sparked by a similar incident when Labor questioned how the Liberal candidate for Mayo, Georgina Downer, was able to present a giant taxpayer-funded $127,373 cheque to the Yankalilla Bowling Club in February 2019. Perrett said the Sunnybank Saints had a \u201cstrong women\u2019s program\u201d and were worthy recipients but he was concerned by \u201cthe politicisation \u2026 of normal processes\u201d \u2013 including excluding him from the announcement. The Labor MP Lisa Chesters said she was \u201cdisappointed but not surprised\u201d that after receiving $527,000 in the first two rounds of the program, her seat of Bendigo was given nothing in the final round before the election. \u201cThis minister [Bridget McKenzie] and the government have form,\u201d Chesters told Guardian Australia. Projects to miss out in her seat included pitches from the Bendigo Rowing Club, Castlemaine Bowls Club, Woodend Tennis Club and Garden Gully Hockey Pavilion, a project backed by the City of Greater Bendigo. The audit office found that in the first round 41% of projects approved were not recommended by the Sport Australia board \u2013 rising to 70% in the second round and 73% in the final round of funding. On Thursday, Labor\u2019s shadow minister for sport, Don Farrell, accused the Coalition of \u201cpork-barrelling on an industrial scale\u201d and demanded Nationals deputy leader McKenzie\u2019s resignation. McKenzie defended her conduct by arguing all of the projects granted funding were eligible and \u201cno rules were broken\u201d. She claimed her intervention had actually increased the proportion of projects in Labor electorates from 26% to 34%, suggesting this amounted to \u201creverse pork-barrelling\u201d. Although the list of successful projects has been published, the government has knocked back attempts by Labor to reveal unsuccessful applicants and the projects that Sport Australia recommended for funding. On Thursday, Sport Australia rebuffed queries by claiming that \u201cfor privacy reasons we will not be providing further detail on individual applications beyond what is outlined in the [audit] report\u201d. It would not say, for example, whether it recommended a grant of $125,000 be given to the Bradman Foundation, an organisation that lists the former prime minister John Howard as its director and patron. The money was awarded in round two of the program for upgrades to the heritage-listed Bradman Oval in Bowral. The auditor general found that 70% of the grants awarded in round two were not endorsed by the Sport Australia board. There is no suggestion Howard played any role in obtaining the grant, or that it was awarded because of his involvement with the Bradman Foundation. The grant was also awarded in the very safe Labor electorate of Whitlam and was helped by lobbying from a Labor MP, Stephen Jones, who told local news at the time that it was the result of \u201ca great application from the Bradman Foundation and a bit of back door lobbying from me\u201d. The Bradman Foundation executive director, Rina Hore, said the grant aligned with the program\u2019s aims and guidelines and enjoyed the strong support of Wingecarribee council and Jones, the local MP. \u201cOur staff and volunteers worked very hard over a two-year period to secure funding for improving public spaces at Bradman Oval,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cTwo major areas to be improved were shade cover for everyday users, children groups and locals and visitors alike that visit the oval seven days a week, from dawn to dusk.\u201d Hore said Howard was not involved in the application. \u201cMr Howard was not at any time involved in the grant application process, nor did we include his role or position within our application information,\u201d she said. Farrell said taxpayers \u201chave a right to know and we intend to find out who was approved by Sport Australia, why they didn\u2019t get the money and where the money has gone to\u201d. Farrell said that unsuccessful applicants \u201cstill want to apply for grant money in the future and, of course, they are fearful of retribution\u201d if they speak out about politicisation of the program. The Australian National Audit Office found the successful applications were \u201cnot those that had been assessed as the most meritorious in terms of the published program guidelines\u201d and that McKenzie\u2019s office had instead run a \u201cparallel\u201d assessment process in deciding how to hand out the funds. The audit committee is already investigating the $220m regional jobs and investment packages program, in which ministers knocked back almost 30% of recommended projects and supported 17% of those not recommended by the department. Labor MP Julian Hill, deputy chair of the joint committee of public accounts and audit, wants the committee to \u201curgently expand the current inquiry\u201d to demand answers about the allocation of sports grants. \u201cThe regional jobs report was bad enough but I just about fell off my chair in reading the sports \u2026 report \u2013 it\u2019s a shocker,\u201d he said. \u201cEither the minister needs to explain herself properly by publishing the list of applications and make clear which grants were approved on advice and which weren\u2019t, or she should consider standing aside until a proper parliamentary inquiry is completed.\u201d Janet Rice, the Greens sports spokeswoman, said McKenzie should be \u201cashamed\u201d of what appeared to be \u201ca government rort designed to win elections\u201d. \u201cTo ignore the merit-based assessment of Sports Australia for almost half of the successful applicants, and instead decide to award grants based on political gain, is a clear and unforgivable misuse of taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will pursue this in Senate estimates and will consider seeking the support of the Senate for an inquiry.\u201d The government has refused to release documents relating to its trouble-plagued $220m regional grants program, claiming release under freedom of information would not inform debate on a \u201cmatter of public importance\u201d.",

And like the British-tinged accent he spoke in, that grainy footage is almost unrecognisable from what we know today: the form has evolved to colour, to digital, to streaming. We\u2019ve seen the introduction of 24-hour news channels and reality TV, and most recently, a surge in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/04/aacta-awards-2019-winners-the-nightingale-and-total-control-dominate-australian-screen-awards\">award-winning stories</a> reflecting the true diversity and history of the country.</p> <p>This month, we\u2019re celebrating the unforgettable moments of Australian TV history \u2013 from drama, comedy and daytime television, to news, sport and reality programs.</p> <p>We\u2019ll launch a poll of the top 50 next week, but first we need your nominations: what was the scene or moment that was most important to you, most defining for the country, or most seared into your memory? We\u2019re not looking for entire broadcasts, seasons or episodes, but the moments that happened within them.</p> <p>To help get you started, we asked Guardian staffers to nominate theirs. Please add yours to the comments below, tweet it at us using the #UnforgettableAusTV hashtag, or email us at UnforgettableAusTV@theguardian.com</p> <h2>Lou\u2019s death on Love My Way</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/23/love-my-way-was-this-the-most-devastating-moment-in-australian-tv-history\">Love My Way: was this the most devastating moment in Australian TV history?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the worst thing imaginable and it happened out of the blue on a normal, happy day. Like things do sometimes. Lou\u2019s death in episode eight of Love My Way, scooting through the park one second, lifeless on the grass the next \u2013 and the reaction of Frankie, her mum, played by Claudia Karvan \u2013 was the perfect portrayal of overwhelming grief. It got the disbelief and confusion of it, and then the visceral pain of it, deep in the gut; it got the way time warps so that anything but overwhelming sadness is an intrusion on the present, far less welcome or fathomable than memories of the past.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t saccharine or overdone, but it didn\u2019t flinch either. It felt real. Too real. I didn\u2019t need to rewatch it to write this. <em><strong>\u2013 Lenore Taylor</strong></em></p> <h2>Julia Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech</h2> <p>I was 23 and living in Brisbane when I first saw Julia Gillard thunder <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOPsxpMzYw4\">\u201cI will not be lectured by this man\u201d</a> on the news.

      "bodyText": "\u201cGood evening, and welcome to television,\u201d advertising executive Bruce Gyngell said, introducing the first mainstream broadcast to Australia in 1956. And like the British-tinged accent he spoke in, that grainy footage is almost unrecognisable from what we know today: the form has evolved to colour, to digital, to streaming. We\u2019ve seen the introduction of 24-hour news channels and reality TV, and most recently, a surge in award-winning stories reflecting the true diversity and history of the country. This month, we\u2019re celebrating the unforgettable moments of Australian TV history \u2013 from drama, comedy and daytime television, to news, sport and reality programs. We\u2019ll launch a poll of the top 50 next week, but first we need your nominations: what was the scene or moment that was most important to you, most defining for the country, or most seared into your memory? We\u2019re not looking for entire broadcasts, seasons or episodes, but the moments that happened within them. To help get you started, we asked Guardian staffers to nominate theirs. Please add yours to the comments below, tweet it at us using the #UnforgettableAusTV hashtag, or email us at UnforgettableAusTV@theguardian.com Lou\u2019s death on Love My Way It was the worst thing imaginable and it happened out of the blue on a normal, happy day. Like things do sometimes. Lou\u2019s death in episode eight of Love My Way, scooting through the park one second, lifeless on the grass the next \u2013 and the reaction of Frankie, her mum, played by Claudia Karvan \u2013 was the perfect portrayal of overwhelming grief. It got the disbelief and confusion of it, and then the visceral pain of it, deep in the gut; it got the way time warps so that anything but overwhelming sadness is an intrusion on the present, far less welcome or fathomable than memories of the past. It wasn\u2019t saccharine or overdone, but it didn\u2019t flinch either. It felt real. Too real. I didn\u2019t need to rewatch it to write this. \u2013 Lenore Taylor Julia Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech I was 23 and living in Brisbane when I first saw Julia Gillard thunder \u201cI will not be lectured by this man\u201d on the news. Truly, something in me changed. At the time, many in the press gallery didn\u2019t grasp what a moment it was, and I still see the speech dismissed all the time. For some people, Gillard can\u2019t be a woman who had some bad policies and also experienced visceral sexism and grief \u2013 she has to be perfect to be angry, or to fight against sexism. I don\u2019t require anyone in my normal life to be perfect, and I\u2019m not so deluded to think that any politician is \u2013 but for months I used to watch the speech on repeat before I went to sleep. My politics did not go along any party\u2019s lines at the time, and they still don\u2019t \u2013 but that moment sparked something in me: my first realisation that not only was it OK to be angry, but that there was reason to be. \u2013 Bridie Jabour John Aloisi\u2019s World Cup-qualifying goal When John Aloisi slotted his famous penalty against Uruguay in 2005, my friend\u2019s dad, a long-suffering fan of Australian football, burst into tears. \u201cI\u2019ve waited 30 years for this,\u201d he said.

The scale of the devastation \u2013 with more than a billion animals estimated to have died \u2013 has prompted renewed calls from some wildlife experts for mental health support for wildlife carers, almost a third of whom already experience \u201cmoderate to severe grief\u201d as part of the ordinary course of their work. The Wildlife Victoria chief executive, Megan Davidson, said she supported the call for greater mental health support, saying images of animals killed by the fires, as well as knowledge of the millions of hectares of habitat lost, had caused widespread distress among volunteer wildlife rescuers and rehabilitators. She said a wildlife carer who runs a wombat refuge at Goongerah, which survived the fire that burned through on New Year\u2019s Eve but is now surrounded by burned forest, told her \u201cthere is a scent of death in every breath\u201d. \u201cBecause there are so many dead animals in the forest, they can smell it in the air,\u201d Davidson said. Animals that survive rehabilitation may not be able to be released for some time, because their habitat is gone, she said. That will increase the costs for carers. The Victorian government has announced grants of up to $1,000 for shelters and foster carers caring for animals affected by the bushfires, and Wildlife Victoria has received $6m in donations since the crisis began. The bushfire devastation and broad-scale habitat destruction has been repeated across the country and is even worse on Kangaroo Island, which wildlife rescue workers have described as \u201capocalyptic\u201d.

Another survey of wildlife carers in NSW, published in 2019 by the NSW environment department, found that carers volunteered an average of 898 hours a year \u2013 17 hours a week \u2013 and spent $3,213 of their own money a year.

      "bodyText": "More than 10.7m hectares of land have burnt so far in Australia\u2019s bushfires \u2013 larger than the total area of South Korea, or Portugal, and 1.3 times the size of Scotland. The ongoing and unprecedented bushfire crisis has spread across six states and multiple months. In New South Wales alone, the Gospers Mountain megafire, north of Sydney, is 512,626 hectares in size \u2013 larger than Long Island and Manhattan combined. Last week, fires across the north-east of Victoria merged with fires in the NSW Snowy Valley, creating a huge complex of fires across the state border. Here are nine images, before and after the fires, that show the devastation from beach to bush, farm to forest, across NSW and South Australia. Many more fires are still burning \u2013 especially in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland and the NSW south coast \u2013 and the full visual aftermath will only be known when weather conditions improve. Harrington Harrington, 60km south of Port Macquarie, was hit by fires before summer even started. The NSW mid-north coast bore the brunt in early November, when fires killed four and destroyed hundreds of homes. In Harrington, water-bombing aircraft dropped bright pink fire retardant on homes after a fire in Crowdy Bay national park threatened. Crowdy Bay The fire in Crowdy Bay national park grew to more than 12,000 hectares. Across the mid-north coast, up to 30% of the region\u2019s koala habitat was destroyed in the fires, in what the NSW environment minister said could have killed a third of the koala population. Forster The seaside town of Forster, also on the mid-north coast, was ringed by fires in November. The Pacific Highway was cut to the south and Failford Road was cut to the north, as residents gathered at the Tuncurry bowling club evacuation centre. Wallabi Point Homes were also declared to be in immediate danger at nearby Wallabi Point as the 21,000 hectare Hillville Road fire flared to emergency level. Nana Glen In Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, actor Russell Crowe\u2019s house was nearly destroyed by the fires in November. At one point, the Liberation Trail fire grew to a perimeter of 1,000km as it burnt through homes and properties. Lenswood, Adelaide Hills In South Australia\u2019s Adelaide Hills, the Cudlee Creek fire tore through the region in December, just days before Christmas. In Lenswood, fires burned crops, vineyards and farms. Across the Adelaide Hills, more than 500 buildings were destroyed and one person killed. Lobethal, Adelaide Hills Nearby Lobethal was also devastated, as the Cudlee Creek fire tore through a total 23,234 hectares.",

Last year, after a long-running campaign, the government reduced the maximum stake to \u00a32. Some bookmakers sought to bypass the FOBT crackdown by quickly inventing new games that mimicked FOBTs while technically complying with the rules. They withdrew the games under pressure from the Gambling Commission after the Guardian exposed the practice. Deregulation also led to a sharp increase in the number of gambling adverts. In 2013 the broadcast regulator Ofcom found the number of ads on TV had increased by 600% in six years. The sector\u2019s annual spend on advertising reached \u00a31.5bn by 2017. Many adverts were attached to live football broadcasts. Mounting public concern about the impact on children prompted the industry to impose a voluntary \u201cwhistle-to-whistle\u201d ban on betting ads from 2019. However, some have since shifted to social media marketing instead. Football remains the betting industry\u2019s cash cow. Of the top 40 clubs in English football, 25 have a gambling sponsor. There have also been controversial bespoke deals, including Wayne Rooney and Derby County\u2019s tie-up with the online casino 32Red. Shirt sponsorships and TV ads aside, football fans still see betting logos wherever they look. An episode of Match of the Day can feature more gambling logos than a Sky broadcast because of visible branding on pitch-side hoardings and elsewhere. Concern has been expressed about gambling branding in the children\u2019s section of football programmes. A recent tie-up that resulted in seven gambling firms buying exclusive rights to show FA Cup games free to customers with an active betting account prompted outrage and a swift climbdown from the industry and the Football Association. The growth of the gambling industry has been accompanied by a wave of transgressions that has led to firms being sanctioned by the regulator. Firms to face punishment include Betfred, PaddyPower, Ladbrokes Coral, William Hill, SkyBet, 888, 32Red and LeoVegas, to name but a few. In some cases, problem gamblers have been given hush money to sign a non-disclosure agreement that prevents them taking their case about a specific company\u2019s failings any further. The Gambling Commission has since clamped down on this. Some techniques are still permitted but are increasingly seen as questionable. Earlier this year the Guardian revealed details of the industry\u2019s use of so-called VIP schemes \u2013 offering free bets and free tickets to big sporting events to heavy gamblers \u2013 implicated in multiple cases where problem gambling had spiralled out of control. The commission is reviewing the schemes and could ban them. Earlier this month the commission announced plans to stop gamblers from using credit cards to bet in the light of cases where addicts used multiple cards to rack up huge debts. The industry contends that the rate of problem gambling has remained relatively stable at 0.7% of the population, despite deregulation. However, that is equal to 340,000 people and hospital admissions related to the addiction are rising. Recent studies have suggested a rise in the number of child problem gamblers to 50,000.

Graham would always try to rein me in a bit and say, you need to just let the horse do it itself.</p> \n<p>\u201cI always liked the way he rode and I\u2019ve tried to copy him a bit. He was a very quiet rider, he got horses in a great rhythm and conserved energy, popping away. He might look like he\u2019s not doing anything but he\u2019s squeezing them down to the jumps. I remember watching him ride a few winners for Ferdy Murphy round Cheltenham, hugging the inside on horses that might not have been short-price favourites but he rode them as if they were.\u201d</p> \n<p>The power of northern racing has ebbed since Murphy\u2019s heyday and Hughes points to Saturday\u2019s results at Wetherby as an example of the way things are now. All seven races at the Yorkshire track were won by stables in the south, the closest being 140 miles away in Warwickshire. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a southern horse coming up rated 130 and a northern horse on the same rating, the northern horse gets beat nearly every time. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re competitively handicapped.\u201d</p> \n<p>He expresses nothing but admiration for the Herefordshire-based Johnson (\u201ca great fella, a gentleman\u201d) and says he and McCoy have helped raise the standard of jockeyship in England over the past 20 years. What would it mean to take the title off him? \u201cIt\u2019d be brilliant \u2026 but I\u2019m not setting my heart on it because any jump jockey is only one bad fall from their season being over. At the minute, my aim is to ride as many winners as I can and stay in one piece.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"997c18e3-afc3-482c-9fb5-14f234a1f25e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield</b> <b>12.00 </b>Real Estate <b>12.30 </b>Billyoakes<b> 1.00 </b>Sir Rodneyredblood <b>1.35 </b>Cliff Wind&nbsp;<b>2.05 </b>Savalas <b>2.40 </b>Terri Rules <b>3.10 </b>Starfighter <b>3.40 </b>Bentley Wood</p>\n    <p><b>Chepstow </b><b>1.10 </b>Lac Sacre <b>1.45 </b>Fado Des Brosses <b>2.15 </b>Kingsplace <b>2.50 </b>Vision Des Flos<b> 3.20 </b>Queen Of The Wind (nap) <b>3.55 </b>Flaming Charmer</p>\n    <p><b>Musselburgh </b><b>1.20</b> Highway Companion <b>1.55 </b>High Noon <b>2.25 </b>Dieu Benisse <b>3.00 </b>The Mouse Doctor (nb) <b>3.30 </b>John Williams <b>4.00 </b>Good Time Jonny</p>\n    <p><b>Newcastle </b><b>3.15 </b>Foresee <b>3.45 </b>Sweet Marmalade <b>4.15 </b>Vive La Difference <b>4.45 </b>Double Martini <b>5.15 </b>Alsvinder <b>5.45 </b>Never Dark <b>6.15 </b>Wasntexpectingthat <b>6.45 </b>Hot Hot Hot</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

I said: \u2018James, this is some jumper, is he an old point to pointer?\u2019 He said: \u2018No, Hughesy, that\u2019s a four-year-old, the first time he\u2019s left home \u2026\u2019\u201d Hughes credits Graham Lee with giving him race-riding insights after he came over to England in search of opportunities. \u201cWhen you were young and you\u2019re watching AP McCoy, you try to ride like AP McCoy; you try to fire them and be very positive over jumps. Graham would always try to rein me in a bit and say, you need to just let the horse do it itself. \u201cI always liked the way he rode and I\u2019ve tried to copy him a bit. He was a very quiet rider, he got horses in a great rhythm and conserved energy, popping away. He might look like he\u2019s not doing anything but he\u2019s squeezing them down to the jumps. I remember watching him ride a few winners for Ferdy Murphy round Cheltenham, hugging the inside on horses that might not have been short-price favourites but he rode them as if they were.\u201d The power of northern racing has ebbed since Murphy\u2019s heyday and Hughes points to Saturday\u2019s results at Wetherby as an example of the way things are now. All seven races at the Yorkshire track were won by stables in the south, the closest being 140 miles away in Warwickshire. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a southern horse coming up rated 130 and a northern horse on the same rating, the northern horse gets beat nearly every time. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re competitively handicapped.\u201d He expresses nothing but admiration for the Herefordshire-based Johnson (\u201ca great fella, a gentleman\u201d) and says he and McCoy have helped raise the standard of jockeyship in England over the past 20 years. What would it mean to take the title off him? \u201cIt\u2019d be brilliant \u2026 but I\u2019m not setting my heart on it because any jump jockey is only one bad fall from their season being over. At the minute, my aim is to ride as many winners as I can and stay in one piece.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fossil experts in the US have revealed the remains of what they say is the first animal that may have set foot on land \u2013 an ancient scorpion. The earliest animals were aquatic, but eventually transitioned on to land. While scorpions are known to be one of the first animals to have become fully land-dwelling, experts say the two new fossils add to a growing debate about when animals made the shift. The scorpion, which is about 2.5cm in length, is thought to have lived about 437m years ago, with the fossils discovered in a quarry north of state highway 164 in Wisconsin in the 1980s. The earliest arachnid yet discovered, the creature has been named Parioscorpio venator, meaning ancestral scorpion and hunter. The creature, like modern scorpions, had two large claws and a tail with a sting at its end. But the team behind the discovery say it is the scorpion\u2019s internal structure that is most exciting. \u201cThis scorpion had the respiratory structures that indicate it was able to live on land. It is the earliest evidence we have that an animal could do this,\u201d said Dr Andrew J Wendruff, a palaeontologist at Otterbein University, Ohio, and co-author of the research. These structures include evidence of pulmo-pericardial sinuses that, in modern scorpions, connect the animal\u2019s respiratory organs with its circulatory system. Wendruff added that such structures, as well as other features of the animal\u2019s cardiovascular system, suggested the ancient animal was, like modern scorpions, able to breathe air. The team say the features are also similar to those seen in horseshoe crabs, which live in shallow coastal waters but can venture on to land for brief spells. \u201cThe fossil was found in a shallow water setting and so it is likely this animal lived in both environments,\u201d said Wendruff, although he said the team cannot be sure it scuttled ashore. A move to terra firma would have offered advantages, said Wendruff. \u201cThroughout all of Earth\u2019s history there is a race to utilise resources that are not being used. Land \u2013 something we take majorly for granted \u2013 was barren by todays standards,\u201d he said. The discovery, published in the the journal Scientific Reports, pushes back the date of the earliest known scorpion by up to three million years, with the previous record-holder a species discovered by a Victorian palaeontologist in the Pentland hills in Scotland. Dr Jason Dunlop, curator of arachnids and myriapods at the Museum of Natural History in Berlin, who was not involved in the latest research, said the preservation of some of the scorpion\u2019s internal structures, such as the cardiovascular system, is unusual. \u201cThis is very rare in fossils of this age and suggests that in some aspects of their anatomy scorpions have hardly changed in almost 440m years,\u201d he said. However he urged caution, noting the fossil did not show whether the scorpion had lungs or gills. \u201cThat would have been the key character, and so long as its missing I think we have to be cautious about saying whether or not it lived on land,\u201d he said. Dr Jesus Lozano-Fernandez, a palaeobiologist at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology of Barcelona, said it was a matter of much debate whether the earliest scorpions were indeed aquatic \u2013 a theory the new discovery piled further doubt on, he said. \u201cIf the described fossil scorpion was indeed terrestrial, that would suggest that [other arachnids with similar breathing apparatus such as spiders], at least, or even the whole [of] arachnids would already have colonised the land by that time.\u201d",

Why it\u2019s Oscar-winner Jared Leto, who played Joker in 2016\u2019s misfiring Suicide Squad turned Marvel\u2019s latest big-screen antihero. The first trailer for Morbius has arrived online, apparently designed to confuse the bejesus out of any viewer not intricately acquainted with the corporate politics that lies behind Hollywood superhero flicks. Morbius (full name: Morbius the Living Vampire, also known as Dr Michael Morbius), is not part of the established Disney-owned Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). But he is a graduate of the Marvel comic books, having debuted in 1971 as a villain in The Amazing Spider-Man #101 before morphing into a more sympathetic figure who ended up with his own series. Yet it\u2019s not so simple, because through a maze of corporate shenanigans, the character does exist in the same world as Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and the rest.

The pitch was slow, the band was surprisingly slow to play their trademark \u201cStand By Me\u201d and for much of the time the batting was slow until Ollie Pope launched a mini-assault against the second new ball in front of an admiring Ben Stokes. Yet it would be foolish to conclude that in the 21st century it will stay as serene as this. Matches tend to accelerate on this ground. Despite a bland, innocuous-looking surface draws are now a rarity here.</p> <p>When the players left the field England, after winning the toss, were 224 for four and oddly enough both sides could feel content with their efforts. The batsmen had battled away but only the best of them, which included Pope, could score with any freedom. None of them could post a half-century but the unbeaten partnership of 76 between Pope and Stokes in the final 90 minutes gave England the edge.</p> </blockquote> <p>Much more here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/16/south-africa-england-third-test-day-one-match-report\">Pope and Stokes lead England fightback after slow start and Rabada double</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2082a48f082f37c01eb154\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T15:42:29.714Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Zak Crawley has a chat:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s been a very good day. I think we\u2019re in a good position going into tomorrow. Hopefully we can bat for a while and then put them back in, because it\u2019s only going to get worse from here, the pitch. It was as slow as I\u2019ve batted for a while. It quickened up a little throughout the day. Hopefully it continues to quicken up and brings the nicks into it a bit more. [On his dismissal] I don\u2019t think I can leave that, at that pace. Maybe to someone bowling a bit slower you can react and maybe put it away. At that pace it\u2019s very instinctive. I could have kept it down, that would be the one thing, or gone up. He bowled me a similar ball earlier in the spell and I went up, which I thought about after. I think I was unlucky, but I shouldn\u2019t have done what I did really. </p> <p>I thought Rabada was going to take the first over, and when Philander bowled it I thought, it\u2019ll be second over. And then I saw Paterson. I can kind of understand, on debut, they want to get him in the game. But if I were captain I\u2019d probably have gone with Rabada. The game at Newlands was the best game ever. I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything better than that.

Who knows, maybe it would empower Root\u2019s leadership if he resembled a young Captain Birdseye.\u201d</p> <p>Insert your own can-he-grow-a-beard-yet joke here.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2017d78f0852212f74ef00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T08:00:29.337Z\">8.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here we go.</strong> Vernon Philander has the new ball, Zak Crawley is in the interrogation room.

He\u2019s been in and out of the side and bowled well in Hamilton and was reasonably decent in the Ashes. But even when he\u2019s played, it feels like Root underbowls him. He\u2019s the natural replacement for Anderson with the new ball. I\u2019m fine with Wood coming in as I think some extra pace will be needed, but the decision you need to make is around the new ball. Would Woakes be more effective with the new ball than Sam Curran?\u201d</p> <p>His illness has made this tour a bit of a write-off. He\u2019ll always be a good option, especially at home, and I thought he was poorly managed during the Ashes. But I\u2019d say England are right to use Curran for now. Woakes is 31 in March and has a chronic knee injury; it wouldn\u2019t shock me if Anderson outlasted him as a Test player.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2008dd8f082f37c01eac74\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T07:40:41.673Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Pre-match reading</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/15/england-south-africa-third-test-conditions-vic-marks\">England hope Wood\u2019s extra pace can help swing series their way | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/15/england-500th-overseas-test-match-cricket\">England\u2019s 500 overseas Tests: from horse-drawn carts to DVD marathons | Simon Burnton</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/14/england-under-19s-cricket-world-cup-class-of-98-relive-victory-the-spin\">The Spin | 'We piled on Allan Border in a pub': England U19s' class of 98 relive victory</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2011fd8f088d80a182bd32\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T07:36:38.829Z\">7.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Team news</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Both teams make one change, with each bringing in a skiddy fast bowler.

Let\u2019s start with something thrilling, a list of scores: 1-1, 1-0, 2-1, 2-1, 2-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-1, 0-2, 1-2, 3-1. Those are the series results between these sides since South Africa were readmitted in 1991. No whitewashes, not even a rout, and only three dead rubbers in 11 series.</p> <p>South Africa and England have been the most well-matched sides in world cricket in the last 30 years. Some might say that\u2019s because they\u2019re essentially the same team, but that\u2019s one for the Guardian Sport SuperBrains to consider. What we can say with confidence is that contests between the two usually come with a guarantee of tense, hard-nosed, occasionally brilliant cricket.</p> <p>This series, which has been no different, will end with back-to-back games at Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg. If you believe in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/12/death-of-momentum-guardian-sport-network\">the M word</a>, then England have it after their stirring victory in the second Test at Cape Town. But they will be without one of the stars of that match: Jimmy Anderson, who had frankly absurd match figures of 37-15-63-7, has flown home with the latest manifestation of professional old age.</p> <p>His like-for-unlike replacement will be Mark Wood, who has been bowling like the wind \u2013 or even the Typhoon \u2013 in the nets. Port Elizabeth has a reputation for being the slowest pitch in South Africa, so England want what we are now obliged to refer to as an X-factor bowler. There has been plenty of talk of reverse swing, too. Slow pitch or not, I doubt the next few days will be dull. After all, it\u2019s England v South Africa.</p> <p><strong>The match starts</strong> at 8am in England, 10am in Port Elizabeth.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-16T07:33:55.214Z\">at 7.33am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m done. Rob Smyth and Tom Davies will be here tomorrow. Bye! Here\u2019s Vic Marks\u2019 report on the first day\u2019s action: This was a slow burner of a day \u2013 except for those spectators foolish enough to stay out of the shade as a fierce sun blazed out of a cloudless sky. The pitch was slow, the band was surprisingly slow to play their trademark \u201cStand By Me\u201d and for much of the time the batting was slow until Ollie Pope launched a mini-assault against the second new ball in front of an admiring Ben Stokes. Yet it would be foolish to conclude that in the 21st century it will stay as serene as this. Matches tend to accelerate on this ground. Despite a bland, innocuous-looking surface draws are now a rarity here. When the players left the field England, after winning the toss, were 224 for four and oddly enough both sides could feel content with their efforts. The batsmen had battled away but only the best of them, which included Pope, could score with any freedom. None of them could post a half-century but the unbeaten partnership of 76 between Pope and Stokes in the final 90 minutes gave England the edge. Much more here: Zak Crawley has a chat: It\u2019s been a very good day. I think we\u2019re in a good position going into tomorrow. Hopefully we can bat for a while and then put them back in, because it\u2019s only going to get worse from here, the pitch. It was as slow as I\u2019ve batted for a while. It quickened up a little throughout the day. Hopefully it continues to quicken up and brings the nicks into it a bit more. [On his dismissal] I don\u2019t think I can leave that, at that pace. Maybe to someone bowling a bit slower you can react and maybe put it away. At that pace it\u2019s very instinctive. I could have kept it down, that would be the one thing, or gone up. He bowled me a similar ball earlier in the spell and I went up, which I thought about after. I think I was unlucky, but I shouldn\u2019t have done what I did really. I thought Rabada was going to take the first over, and when Philander bowled it I thought, it\u2019ll be second over. And then I saw Paterson. I can kind of understand, on debut, they want to get him in the game. But if I were captain I\u2019d probably have gone with Rabada. The game at Newlands was the best game ever. I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything better than that. Hopefully if we get another win on this pitch, that would be a great effort and a very nice start. 90th over: England 224-4 (Stokes 39, Pope 38) Maharaj, who has bowled more than a third of the day\u2019s overs, finishes it with yet another maiden. It\u2019s been a phenomenal effort from him across the day, but England probably end it with a slight advantage. 89th over: England 224-4 (Stokes 39, Pope 38) Stokes leans back, swings his bat and pulls the ball high towards deep midwicket! Catch, come the cries, but it lands safe. A bit of a risky shot to play with eight balls remaining in the day, but all\u2019s well that ends well, and that one ended in a four. 88th over: England 218-4 (Stokes 33, Pope 38) Maharaj comes back, and Stokes snaffles another single. There will be two more overs today. 87th over: England 217-4 (Stokes 32, Pope 38) A bit of late-in-the-day action for Rabada. Stokes is happy to see the over out, working the last to midwicket for a single. 86th over: England 216-4 (Stokes 31, Pope 38) Pope clips Philander through midwicket for four. \u201cI saw Pope\u2019s Sweaty Helmet at the Melkweg in 1987,\u201d writes Jim Baxter. \u201cSome decent tunes but their stage show was unpleasant.\u201d Oh yes, I remember them. They were part of the explosion of Somebody\u2019s Something Something bands that eventually culminated in the blossoming of Gorky\u2019s Zygotic Mynci and Ned\u2019s Atomic Dustbin. 85th over: England 212-4 (Stokes 31, Pope 34) Stokes pulls Nortje for four. This pair are batting excellently, while still giving the bowlers a bit of hope, making for fine entertainment. England will be pretty happy with their lot if both survive the last few overs of the day. 84th over: England 205-4 (Stokes 26, Pope 33) A single for Stokes. Pope, now having issues with liquids going into his body as well as liquids coming out, calls for a bonus drink. 83rd over: England 204-4 (Stokes 25, Pope 33) Pope has issues with a sweaty helmet, so to speak. Quiet at the back. He spends most of Nortje\u2019s over trying to work out how to drain it, with liquid spraying out every time he moves. Maiden. 82nd over: England 204-4 (Stokes 25, Pope 33) The lbw shout came from the first ball of Philander\u2019s spell, and the bowler was significantly more excited about it than anyone else. Bowling round the wicket to the left-hander, the ball algled across was always likely to be going wide of off stump, and so it proved. Nowhere interesting, is the answer. South Africa have no more reviews, England have two. Stokes leaves, and the ball clips his thigh pad. Where was it going? 81st over: England 204-4 (Stokes 25, Pope 33) The new ball is taken and thrown to Nortje, and Pope leaves the first couple, gets a bat to the third and then sends each of the last three to the rope! The first goes to third man, the second is nicely clipped through midwicket, and the last slammed past point! 80th over: England 192-4 (Stokes 25, Pope 21) Two singles off Maharaj. The new ball is now officially due. Is this the end of Maharaj\u2019s spell? I think they might have to prise this ball from his cold, dead hands. 79th over: England 190-4 (Stokes 24, Pope 20) Pope gets the tiniest edge into his pads. Paterson buries his face in his hands, and then Pope works the next to square leg for a couple. 78th over: England 188-4 (Stokes 24, Pope 18) Maharaj is just going to bowl forever. He\u2019s bowled 29 overs today in one unbroken spell. 77th over: England 186-4 (Stokes 23, Pope 13) After three dots Paterson bangs one in short and Pope helps it on its way, over slip and off for four. He does a funny kind of jump as he makes the shot, in which both feet leave the air and flick upwards, but his body doesn\u2019t move. A kind of non-rising jump. 76th over: England 182-4 (Stokes 23, Pope 13) Stokes thumps past extra cover for four. Actually there was a scoreboard link there throughout. Now there are two. Well, three, if you include the one in the previous update. Damn you, Steve Stern. 75th over: England 177-4 (Stokes 19, Pope 12) A run each, off Paterson. Steve Stern points out that there has been no link to the scoreboard from the OBO. It\u2019s now in the standfirst (at the top of the page), but it\u2019s also here. 74th over: England 175-4 (Stokes 17, Pope 11) Maharaj is still bowling. One off it. \u201cI completely agree with you,\u201d says Damian Burns on the DRS thing. \u201cWhere decisions are marginal go with the on-field decision. Everyone is happy. How the football people can\u2019t get this in their heads is beyond me. Someone needs to tell them to switch over to the cricket now and again. We have a near flawless system, developed over many years of use.\u201d But on the other hand: 73rd over: England 174-4 (Stokes 17, Pope 11) Paterson bowls short, and Pope pulls it away for four! It\u2019s been a relatively action-packed session, in which England have already scored as many runs as they did in the last one, and lost as many wickets. And that\u2019s drinks. 72nd over: England 168-4 (Stokes 17, Pope 5) Ooof! Maharaj hangs one outside off stump, Stokes tries to slog sweep it, and when he misses it completely the ball zips just past the stumps! 71st over: England 167-4 (Stokes 17, Pope 4) Stokes drives Paterson to mid-on, where a diving fielder stops it reaching the rope. Next time he drives a bit straighter, and there\u2019s no stopping this one. 70th over: England 161-4 (Stokes 9, Pope 4) Ye traditional Maharaj maiden. 69th over: England 161-4 (Stokes 9, Pope 4) Close! Paterson comes back and Stokes edges his first delivery straight to first slip only for the ball to bounce a foot short of the fielder! 68th over: England 161-4 (Stokes 9, Pope 4) Close! Stokes nudges one just wide of the fielder and short leg, who throws out a hand but can\u2019t hold. \u201cI don\u2019t think the protocol is right for the circumstances of the Ben Stokes DRS,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cSome of the ball struck in line with the stumps, so it hit \u2018in line\u2019. Umpire\u2019s Call is irrelevant because they is no predictive element.\u201d This reminds me of football\u2019s offside/VAR issues, which are also a question of fact but there people are demanding a bit of flexibility. We can\u2019t have it both ways, and I for one am entirely happy with the idea that DRS is there to correct clear umpiring errors and that didn\u2019t constitute one. 67th over: England 160-4 (Stokes 9, Pope 4) Rabada flings a full toss at Stokes, who hits it past mid-on for four with such nonchalance that he might have been packing a pipe in his parlour. 66th over: England 153-4 (Stokes 5, Pope 4) Maharaj was absolutely convinced that Stokes was out there, and was not shy about telling him so. Not to be, alas. Pope pummels the last ball to deep point for four to take England past 150. But he didn\u2019t. Not even close. That\u2019s a review lost. 65th over: England 148-4 (Stokes 3, Pope) A simple forward defensive would have dealt with that, but Root moved backwards and limply, vainly waved his bat at it. England patiently plodded to 100, and are chaotically tumbling to 150. The ball stays a bit low, Root gets nowhere near it, and it destroys off stump! 64th over: England 147-3 (Root 27, Stokes 3) Shot! Root sweeps past square leg for four, an excellent shot, and then tickles the next to fine leg for another. Another sweep off the last, but it doesn\u2019t have the legs to reach the rope. It was close, though. Umpire\u2019s call on contact, which saves him. Maharaj is again the bowler. It might have hit him outside the line, but it\u2019s worth checking I think. 63rd over: England 136-3 (Root 17, Stokes 2) Rabada extracts what menace he can from an unhelpful pitch. 62nd over: England 134-3 (Root 17, Stokes 1) Maharaj has bowled excellently today to control England\u2019s scoring - he\u2019s going at 1.23 an over - and thoroughly deserves his reward. That is as lbw as lbws get. Still, the umpire didn\u2019t see it and it took until the last second of their thinking time for South Africa to go with it. The umpire says no, but if this hit the pad before the bat he\u2019s in big trouble. 61st over: England 133-2 (Denly 25, Root 16) Another wide and loose Rabada delivery to start the over, which Denly cuts for four! England have scored a scarcely imaginable 16 runs in three overs! 60th over: England 124-2 (Denly 18, Root 15) A 20th over for Maharaj yields a single off balls one and six. \u201cI take a vicarious pleasure in watching players move up the ranks in the all time records list on Cricinfo\u2019s stats page - and today is a real treat: a Root century will see him rise from 40 to 34 on the all time runs scored charts,\u201d writes Richard Morris. \u201cGiven the current England run rate this is more exciting than actually watching England bat just now.\u201d 59th over: England 122-2 (Denly 17, Root 14) Root knocks the ball gently into the off side and goes for a single, and Denly was a yard and a half short of his ground when the throw zips just past the stumps! Then Rabada\u2019s final delivery is wide and loose and Denly thumps it away for his second boundary of the day! The players are on their way back out. A big session ahead, as always. 58th over: England 117-2 (Denly 13, Root 13) One more maiden to complete the session. South Africa have eked out a couple of wickets and England have scored 56 runs from 31 overs. Honours approximately even; I\u2019ll be back in a bit. 57th over: England 117-2 (Denly 13, Root 13) A fine, aggressive maiden over from Philander. \u201cPeople might complain that the SR of the top three is boring or not modern, but it\u2019s perfect for this situation imo,\u201d says Chris Parker. \u201cWith Paterson, Rabada, and Nortje, SA have three guys who are at their best when bowling fast in short spells, and they\u2019re already approaching 10 overs each for the day. Wear those guys out and let the middle order take advantage.\u201d It\u2019s a question of weighing up the benefits of best utilising ideal batting conditions or wearing down the bowlers. 56th over: England 117-2 (Denly 13, Root 13) Root comes forward to Maharaj and nearly finds himself yorked. A single off the last brings him level with Denly. 55th over: England 116-2 (Denly 13, Root 12) Philander\u2019s back, concluding Nortje\u2019s fine spell. \u201cIntrigued, I binged Lulu the 19th century trapeze artist,\u201d writes Robert Blanchard. \u201cNo words, but a few 1870s promotional items of her act at the Holborn Hippodrome. She was a believable she.\u201d There\u2019s a picture of her here, if you\u2019re interested. 54th over: England 115-2 (Denly 13, Root 11) A late cut brings Root four more, these scored more deliberately and chancelessly. He has 11 runs from 19 balls, Denly 13 from 73, though the latter is occasionally attempting aggressive shots, particularly against Maharaj; he backs away from the last to give him room to slap it straight to a fielder at cover. 53rd over: England 110-2 (Denly 13, Root 6) More streaky runs for Root, who bottom-edges into his waist and thence away for four, and then hooks the last, off the top part of the bat if not the edge, to square leg, where no fielder is present to complete the catch. Sky show an interesting graphic, illustrating how much straighter Nortje has bowled since lunch, the tactic that led eventually to Crawley\u2019s dismissal. 52nd over: England 105-2 (Denly 13, Root 1) Root gets off the mark in streaky style, top-edging a sweep that dropped just short of Nortje, running around from square leg! 51st over: England 103-2 (Denly 12, Root 0) A Nortje maiden to Root. \u201cI\u2019m sure that it is not the case - and I really must stress that to her lawyers - but calling the distraction to your distraction a \u2018trapeze artist\u2019 does sound a bit like a euphemism,\u201d writes Robin Hazlehurst. Not at all. She was a trapeze artist, and really quite famous for it. What she wasn\u2019t, in transpired, was a she. 50th over: England 103-2 (Denly 12, Root 0) Denly\u2019s strike rate is going down, now at 17.64 after another Maharaj maiden (53% of his 15 overs have brought no runs). Of his 24 Test innings only one has been slower, and that only lasted 24 balls. We\u2019re treated to a few more replays of that Van der Dussen catch, which really was exceptionally good. 49th over: England 103-2 (Denly 12, Root 0) Crawley swings his bat at a shoulder-high delivery that was heading just down leg side, nudging the ball a little wider for four, and England\u2019s score into triple figures. Three balls later, he\u2019s gone. That\u2019s a fantastic catch at leg gully! Crawley clips the ball off his legs, and Van der Dussen dives to his right and just about holds the catch, which bounces off one hand, off the other, and finally settles in both! 48th over: England 99-1 (Crawley 40, Denly 12) Another Crawley single. Denly, to be fair, advances and attempts to hit the final ball past extra cover but it\u2019s cut off by the fielder at short mid off. 47th over: England 98-1 (Crawley 39, Denly 12) England are in no kind of hurry. Crawley gets a single. 46th over: England 97-1 (Crawley 38, Denly 12) Maharaj zips through a maiden over. 45th over: England 97-1 (Crawley 38, Denly 12) Hello everybody! I have been a bit distracted this morning, which I have mainly spent researching England\u2019s 1876-77 tour of Australia and New Zealand (for future Spin purposes). Then I was distracted from my distraction by looking into a remarkable-sounding trapeze artist called Lulu (who the team met in Adelaide). Anyway, time to focus. Nortje bowls, and Denly clips one in the air just wide of midwicket. 44th over: England 95-1 (Crawley 37, Denly 11) Denly is beaten, fencing at a big-spinning delivery from Maharaj. Another maiden, and that\u2019s drinks. Simon Burnton will be with you for the rest of the day \u2013 you can email him here. Bye! 43rd over: England 95-1 (Crawley 37, Denly 11) Lovely batting from Crawley, who waits for a wide short ball from Paterson and slaps it over the cordon for four. This has been a superbly judged innings. 42nd over: England 89-1 (Crawley 32, Denly 10) Denly doesn\u2019t have many get-out strokes against Maharaj - and that almost leads to a get-out stroke of a different kind when he misses a rash slog-sweep. Maharaj, who is bowling beautifully, has figures of 11-5-13-0. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky the \u2018reviewer\u2019 who hadn\u2019t read your book (33rd over) gave it 4 stars,\u201d says Simon Myers. \u201cI was concerned to see a toy we were considering had a single review on Argos of 1 star. Turned out the purchaser was unhappy because the child they were buying it for already had one.\u201d I love reviews like that \u2013 one star for a book because some hipster spilt a can of Red Stripe over it on the bus, and I was already having a bloody bad day. 41st over: England 89-1 (Crawley 32, Denly 10) There\u2019s no need for England to hurry. Plenty of people think this pitch will crumble, subcontinental-style, so first-innings runs will be worth their weight in scoreboard pressure. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says J Wood. \u201cThat footage in the Australian dressing room is phenomenal. Is there a film coming out, do you know? I was, however, entirely depressed to hear the booing when Smith returned to carry on batting. I was there that day, and in my section of the ground, he got a standing ovation, so I didn\u2019t hear any of that. Honestly, some people need to take a long hard look at themselves.\u201d I assume it\u2019ll be another of those Amazon sport documentary series. This one\u2019s an exclusive \u2013 it\u2019ll be worth watching! 40th over: England 84-1 (Crawley 31, Denly 6) \u201cTalking of David Steele, he was well-known to be careful with his money,\u201d says Steve Hudson, \u201cand had one of the better nicknames \u2013 \u2018Crime\u2019, because he never pays.\u201d 39th over: England 84-1 (Crawley 31, Denly 6) Paterson nips one back a fraction to Denly, who gets a thick inside-edge onto the pad. I think that was seam movement rather than reverse swing. I\u2019m obsessed with reverse swing today. This is what happens when you read too many broadsheets. Paterson then tries the old one-two, a bouncer followed by a half-volley. Denly has seen it all before and drives sweetly between short extra and mid-off for four. He plays some gorgeous strokes. \u201cI\u2019m really confused by this morning\u2019s events,\u201d says David Bowden. \u201cI\u2019ve spent five years watching positive, front-foot cricket and yet weirdly I\u2019m feeling more positive about our match prospects at lunch on the first day than at any point in the last decade (apart from maybe Trent Bridge 2015). Can you offer any explanation for this?\u201d It\u2019s the life-changing magic of the dot ball. 38th over: England 80-1 (Crawley 31, Denly 2) A reprieve for Denly, who drives Maharaj a fraction short - if that - of Elgar at short extra cover. Elgar swooped forward in an attempt to take the catch, but it reached him on the half-volley and he couldn\u2019t get his fingers under the ball. It was an extremely difficult chance. 37th over: England 78-1 (Crawley 30, Denly 1) The debutant Dane Paterson returns to the attack. He\u2019s a reverse-swing expert, so keep your eyes on the shiny side. Nothing to report in that over, from which one run accrues. England are scoring at 2.1 per over, and it\u2019s great. \u201cI had a novel come out a while ago and had an Amazon reviewer give it one star and say it was awful,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cI checked him out only to find that his only other review was of an electric toothbrush recharger. Four stars! In terms of utility the chap had a point, but it did take three years of my life.\u201d Are you sure he didn\u2019t get the reviews mixed up? I\u2019ve never heard of an arresting, lyrical toothbrush recharger before. 36th over: England 77-1 (Crawley 29, Denly 1) A maiden from Maharaj to Denly, who is off to his usual slow start. No that was a compliment. 35th over: England 77-1 (Crawley 29, Denly 1) South Africa, control freaks that they are in the field, will be happy that England haven\u2019t got away from them. England might lose two quick wickets now, but I would still prefer 90/3 in the 40th to 90/3 in the 25th. It\u2019s a hot day, and if all goes well they will have the opportunity to punish South Africa in the final session. \u201cMorning Rob, morning everyone,\u201d says Robert Ellson. \u201cI always enjoyed that remark of Peter Roebuck\u2019s, that as Somerset\u2019s no.4, his main job was to stay in long enough to prevent Richards (no.3) and Botham (no.5) batting together, lest counterproductive member-measuring should occur. In a not-really-similar way, I think Joe Denly\u2019s role in this England side is simply to bat well enough to stop any talk of Root moving up from no.4. If Denly only averages 30, but Root goes back up towards 50, he\u2019ll have performed a valuable service to England.\u201d Yes, I agree. History will be very kind to him, I think. He\u2019s the David Steele de nos jours, hashtagtheprettyboywhowenttowar. 34th over: Kent 75-1 (Crawley 28, Denly 0) Nobody knows whether he\u2019ll make it or not, but there is a lot to like about Crawley\u2019s game. He plays with a breezy confidence, and his bat seems to have an appreciable middle. He\u2019s also light on his feet against the spinners, as he shows by dancing down to to drive Maharaj for a single. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Neil Harris. \u201cWhat was Brendon McCullum\u2019s strike rate as an opener?\u201d It was 61 in Tests, though most of those innings were played pre-epiphany. His last innings as an opener was 202 from 188 balls against Pakistan. 33rd over: England 74-1 (Crawley 27, Denly 0) \u201cI did look at those customer reviews of The Judge,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cMy favourite was the one that said \u2018I bought it as a present, so I haven\u2019t read it.\u2019 And then awarded the book 4 stars.\u201d Which, SINCE YOU ASKED, brought the blOODY AVERAGE DOWN. 32nd over: England 74-1 (Crawley 27, Denly 0) Crawley survives an LBW appeal from Maharaj - it was missing leg - and then puts him away to the midwicket boundary. Another good over from Maharaj, who looks like his old self today. 31st over: England 70-1 (Crawley 23, Denly 0) That was such a good over from Rabada, who created something out of nothing. Sibley had already survived two false strokes - one landed just short of midwicket, the other flew past gully at catchable height - and was sufficiently unsettled that he got out to the last delivery. Brilliant bowling from Kagiso Rabada! He troubled Sibley throughout the over before dismissing him with the final delivery. Sibley flicked a shortish ball towards short backward square leg, where Elgar dived forward to take a nice catch. 30th over: England 64-0 (Crawley 23, Sibley 30) Crawley edges Maharaj wide of slip for a couple. I don\u2019t think it would have carried anyway, but it was nicely bowled. South Africa will back him to at least hold an end - and maybe pick up a couple of wickets - while they wait for the ball to reverse. \u201cThis may be the first time in nine years that England have batted through the first session,\u201d says Felix Wood, \u201cbut in more recent memory they were no wickets down at lunch on the first day...\u201d It took me a while to get that. 29th over: England 62-0 (Crawley 21, Sibley 30) Rabada, the pick of the bowlers before lunch, returns to the attack. Crawley continues to play with discipline and restraint. In the second innings of the last Test he made a skittish 25 from 35 balls; today he has 21 from 86. \u201cSome other nerd has probably got here first but...\u201d begins John Horsley. \u201cAs a baseline: Boycott\u2019s strike rate in Tests: 39.8. Slater\u2019s strike rate in Tests: 53.3 Gordon Greenidge strike rate in Tests 60.3 Virender Sehwag strike rate in Tests: 80.\u201d For me, Clive, it\u2019s about influence, timing and symbolic moments. Sehwag was completely absurd, and I doubt there will ever be another Test opener like him. And some of Greenidge\u2019s shots are scary on YouTube, so goodness knows what it was like to bowl to him. But I\u2019m not sure either had the same influence on their peers as Slater. That said, it might just be that a) I\u2019m an England fan, and he routinely battered them and b) I was an impressionable age during his golden years. 28th over: England 61-0 (Crawley 20, Sibley 30) The left-arm spinner Maharaj starts after the interval. There was a snifter of turn before lunch, more than you\u2019d expect in the first session of a Test, and a couple of deliveries straighten promisingly to Sibley. A maiden. \u201cRoy Fredericks was no slouch,\u201d says Andrew Harrison. \u201cWould love to have seen his 71-ball ton against Lillee and Thomson at the WACA.\u201d This is a lovely piece, from Andy Bull, on that innings. It\u2019s such a shame that almost all of the footage of that series, including the Fredericks innings, was lost in a flood in the 1980s. \u201cI reckon Warner\u2019s true antecedent was Keith Stackpole, a burly Australian who gave the ball a hell of a thwack,\u201d says Mike Jakeman. \u201cAlso gave plenty of chances to the fielders, too.\u201d And he had one of those clever nicknames: Stacky. \u201cRegarding fast-scoring openers\u2026\u201d says Steve Hudson. \u201cWot, no Sehwag? No Jayasuriya? As for early examples of this style, how about Bob Barber in Aus in 1965/66?\u201d Sehwag and Jayasuriya came after Slater, though obviously before Warner. Bob Barber is an excellent suggestion, although he didn\u2019t do it for long enough to have a wider influence. I think Slater had the biggest global impact. Lunchtime reading 27th over: England 61-0 (Crawley 20, Sibley 30) That\u2019s lunch. I\u2019m not certain, because I\u2019m not, but I think this is the first time since the Oval Test against India in 2011 that England have batted through the first session of a Test without losing a wicket. Nine years, man! Zak Crawley and Dom Sibley played with patience and commonsense on a very slow pitch, and their partnership has given England a great chance to take control of this match in the first innings. South Africa need reverse swing, and fast. 26th over: England 61-0 (Crawley 20, Sibley 30) \u201cMorning Rob - I thought we\u2019d agreed never to mention Michael Slater again?\u201d says David Horn. \u201c(We didn\u2019t actually, but it\u2019s an unspoken pact I have with OBO\u2019ers) He did more than break opening. He broke an entire cricket following nation in one over (one ball, really) in 1994, and he broke me. I was 21, had just started working in Big City, thought anything was possible, and then Michael Slater broke everything. To cap it all, Simon Burnton\u2019s piece reminds me every time I\u2019m feeling particularly masochistic.\u201d I was unemployed at the time so planned to stay up all night. I honestly almost went to bed after one ball, and I did go to bed after Martin McCague\u2019s first spell disappeared all round Brisbane. 25th over: England 59-0 (Crawley 20, Sibley 28) Crawley, a naturally attacking batsman, has played with impressive restraint. In fact his strike rate today (26) is less than half his career strike rate in first-class cricket (58). He knows this is a rare opportunity to bat long - and maybe even do that - in a Test match. \u201cThe English idea of \u2018nicknames\u2019 is not really a nickname at all,\u201d says Andrew Webber, aka Lloyd. \u201cNicknames should have some thought, humour or association given to them as we Aussies do. Jason Gillespie was named Dizzy in association with the trumpeter. Steve Waugh was called Tugga for a while. Mark Waugh named Junior as the younger Waugh twin. Beefy Botham passes the test as a big man of ox like stature and heart...\u201d If that\u2019s not an opportunity to brazenly plug The Judge by Robin Smith (look at those customer reviews!), then I don\u2019t know what is. 24th over: England 56-0 (Crawley 19, Sibley 26) Crawley survives an LBW appeal after missing an absent-minded paddle sweep. It brushed the glove and hit him outside the line anyway. Hamza, at slip, ran across towards leg slip in an attempt to intercept the sweep. Had he stayed in position at first slip, he would have had a good chance of catching Crawley. Sibley is beaten by some sharp turn later in the over, which will encourage both Maharaj and Dom Bess. \u201cThat 1938 Oval scorecard is some scorecard,\u201d says Sam Collier. \u201cI was, however, momentarily left wondering who Hardstaffjnr was and whether he was the only Icelandic volcano ever to bat for England... It\u2019s still early.\u201d 23rd over: England 54-0 (Crawley 18, Sibley 25) Nortje jags one back to hit Sibley in the stomach. A few deliveries have taken the openers by the surprise, but generally it\u2019s been a lovely morning on which to bat. Sibley gets his fourth boundary later in the over, deliberately uppercutting Nortje over the slips. \u201cThe BBC cricket social is wondering if England openers are too boring\u2026\u201d says Thomas Whiteley. \u201cI blame David Warner. He broke opening the way Gilchrist broke wicketkeeping.\u201d I\u2019d argue it was Michael Slater, though you could go further back and make a case for Gordon Greenidge and Kris Srikkanth. 22nd over: England 50-0 (Crawley 18, Sibley 21) The left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj comes into the attack. There\u2019s some encouraging early turn to Crawley, who plays out another maiden. That\u2019s the seventh of the morning. Thanks, meanwhile, to Gary Naylor for this link, about which I am officially excited. 21st over: England 50-0 (Crawley 18, Sibley 21) Nortje, who has changed ends to replace Rabada, starts with a maiden to Sibley. It\u2019s been a dull morning, but that suits England just fine. 20th over: England 50-0 (Crawley 18, Sibley 21) Crawley thick-edges a back-foot drive for four, which brings up a serene fifty partnership. But then Philander reminds us all of his threat with a beauty that seams past Crawley\u2019s outside edge. At least I think it was seam movement, though it may have been reverse swing. 19th over: England 46-0 (Crawley 14, Sibley 21) South Africa\u2019 fielders are throwing the ball into the pitch, trying to rough it up so that it will reverse swing. It does usually reverse here. South Africa desperately need it to do so, because Crawley and Sibley are in complete control. \u201cIs it too soon,\u201d says Kim Thonger, \u201cto mention the highest ever England opening partnership of 359 by Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook in South Africa in December 1948?\u201d I\u2019ve already bookmarked the Oval Test of 1938. 18th over: England 43-0 (Crawley 12, Sibley 20) Philander replaces Nortje, which means a change of ends from his new-ball spell. His first ball beats Sibley outside off stump; the rest is harmless. England are progressing with disconcerting comfort. \u201cMorning, Rob,\u201d says Smylers. \u201cEngland\u2019s top three must be causing havoc with their long-standing nickname policy of just adding -y to players\u2019 surnames. Have you heard on the stump mic how they\u2019re coping? Has anyone attempted \u2018Sibbleyey\u2019, \u2018Crawleyey\u2019, or \u2018Denlyey\u2019?\u201d Isn\u2019t the rule that if the name ends in Y, you change it to -ers. Like, erm, Smylers? 17th over: England 43-0 (Crawley 12, Sibley 20) Rabada strays onto the pads of Crawley, with the ball zipping away for four leg-byes. Nothing much is happening for South Africa, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Faf du Plessis turned to spin before lunch. 16th over: England 39-0 (Crawley 12, Sibley 20) Too straight from Nortje, and Sibley drives imperiously wide of mid-on for four. Shot! \u201cIt\u2019s a really slow deck,\u201d says Mike Atherton on Sky. \u201cAs an opener, when you\u2019ve got past the new ball, you\u2019re saying, \u2018This is the day. This is my day.\u2019\u201d \u201cAfter reading your comments about the Basil D\u2019Oliveira trophy (5th over) I had a close look at a picture of it,\u201d says Kevin Holloway. \u201cI was surprised by how little the bust, to my eye, looks like the great man. Even the hair is parted on the wrong side - I think? It occurred to me that the sculptor might have googled D\u2019Oliveira and mistaken a photo of Dolly\u2019s son, Damian, for a photo of Dolly \u2026\u201d Oh my, you\u2019re right about the parting. I still think it looks like him, mind. 15th over: England 33-0 (Crawley 12, Sibley 14) This looks like an excellent opportunity for England to bore South Africa\u2019s bowlers into submission. Sibley, in particular, has the perfect temperament to bat in conditions like this. If the ball doesn\u2019t reverse swing, it could be a long day for South Africa. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Billy Mills. \u201cA bit cheeky, I know, but any chance of a shout-out for Ireland\u2019s win over the Windies in the T20 last night, and especially for Josh Little\u2019s nerve-shredding last over? I know it\u2019s not really cricket, but as an Irishman, we\u2019ll take what we get!\u201d Not cheeky at all \u2013 that was a seriously impressive win against a very strong West Indies side. 14th over: England 30-0 (Crawley 11, Sibley 13) Sibley repeats his stroke in the previous Nortje over, waving a cut through backward point for four. He has started superbly. Right here, right now, Sibley has a Test average of 41.16. Some people wanted him dropped, never to be seen again, after the New Zealand tour. That\u2019s drinks. \u201cHave England ever had two openers with three-letter forenames?\u201d says Daniel Harris. \u201cYes, Dom is Dominic, but Cricinfo have him down as Dom. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a proclivity.\u201d How about a two and a three, Mo Ali and Jos Buttler in that runchase in Pakistan in 2015-16? Alright, alright, how about Len Hutton and Reg Simpson? I think they opened together in that Brisbane fiasco in 1954-55. 13th over: England 26-0 (Crawley 11, Sibley 9) That errant pull stroke aside, Crawley has looked fine against Rabada so far. Rabada\u2019s line has been immaculate, but so has Crawley\u2019s judgement of off stump. 12th over: England 26-0 (Crawley 11, Sibley 9) Anrich Nortje replaces the debutant Dane Paterson, who bowled a reasonable first spell of 5-0-10-0. His second ball is steered crisply through backward point for four by Sibley. With no pace in the pitch and little movement, this looks like a beautiful day for batting. But we\u2019ve said that before with England, is it not. \u201cFormer Essex and Notts batsman Will Jefferson - now there was a tall opener,\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cHe played on an England A tour but never quite fulfilled his potential, partly perhaps because he was 6 foot 10 inches tall. I seem to remember Tom Graveney was pretty tall too - certainly by the diminished stature of Englishmen in a country on 1950s rations.\u201d Jefferson used to bat with James Taylor, which must have played havoc with the bowlers\u2019 lengths. 11th over: England 22-0 (Crawley 11, Sibley 5) Rabada has started excellently, with a challenging line just outside off stump. Sibley steals a single into the off side to move to five from 28 balls. As ever, he has crawled out of the blocks. No, that was a compliment. \u201cEngland have now gone 35 Tests without naming an unchanged side (including the batting line-up),\u201d says Chris Parker. \u201cFunnily enough the last time we did it was the 4th Test vs SA, but that was the home series back in August 2017.\u201d While I will fight any man who rejects the life-changing magic of a good stat, I would say that if they pick the same XI it\u2019s an unchanged side, regardless of any tweaks to the batting order. 10th over: England 21-0 (Crawley 11, Sibley 4) The pitch looks pretty slow, as promised, and Crawley mistimes another pull stroke. This one, off Paterson, fell just short of mid-on. 9th over: England 19-0 (Crawley 9, Sibley 4) Rabada comes on to replace Philander, not Paterson. He won that compelling contest with Crawley in the second innings of the second Test, and almost picks him up again here. Crawley mistimed a front-foot pull that teased Nortje, running back from mid-on, before dropping just in front of him. Careful now. \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says Matt Doherty. \u201cFrom memory the only other tall openers were Chris Broad and Tim Robinson.\u201d Oh yes, good one, although strangely they hardly ever opened together in Tests. 8th over: England 17-0 (Crawley 8, Sibley 4) The Paterson decision hasn\u2019t really worked for South Africa. He hasn\u2019t bowled badly; he just hasn\u2019t found much movement off the pitch or in the air. 7th over: England 14-0 (Crawley 7, Sibley 3) Quinton de Kock has moved up to the stumps for Philander to stop Crawley batting outside his crease. The result is a maiden. England\u2019s young openers - Crawley 21, Sibley 24 - have started calmly, although South Africa\u2019s decision to hold Kagiso Rabada back has helped. 6th over: England 14-0 (Crawley 7, Sibley 3) \u201cWith Crawley and Sibley both looking like at least 6ft4, is this England\u2019s tallest ever opening partnership?\u201d says Oliver Haill. \u201cAnd is there any significance in that?\u201d Climate change. Actually, it might be the tallest. Tony Greig never opened for England, and I can\u2019t think of any particularly tall openers. Cook and KP at Headingley in 2012 maybe. 5th over: England 12-0 (Crawley 7, Sibley 1) A rare piece of filth from Philander, short and wide, is larruped to the cover boundary by Crawley. Whether in attack or defence, the ball makes a lovely sound off Crawley\u2019s bat. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Richard Vale. \u201cAm I alone in thinking that the Basil D\u2019Oliveira Trophy being a bust of the man himself is just weird?\u201d Hmm, I don\u2019t know. At least it actually looks like him, which is a rarity these days. 4th over: England 8-0 (Crawley 3, Sibley 1) Not a great over from Paterson. He was too straight, which allowed a couple of singles into the leg side and then four leg byes when the ball flew to the boundary off Sibley\u2019s pad. 3rd over: England 2-0 (Crawley 2, Sibley 0) It looks like a clammy day in Port Elizabeth, though it\u2019s not always easy to discern conditions in South Africa when you\u2019re in an office approximately 9.371.6 miles away. There\u2019s a bit of grass on the pitch, as is usually the case in South Africa on the first morning, and Crawley is beaten by a glorious delivery from Philander that nips away off the seam. Only Steve Smith would have nicked that. The rest of the over is defended confidently. Good stuff from the Sky Sports team, who use the popular split-screen medium to demonstrate that Crawley has made a technical change, with his bat coming down much straighter. 2nd over: England 2-0 (Crawley 2, Sibley 0) Well I\u2019ll be damned. Dane Paterson, rather than Kagiso Rabada, will share the new ball. That\u2019s an eccentric decision, though I\u2019m sure South Africa have a plan. His fourth ball is a beauty, shaping away to beat Sibley\u2019s defensive poke. We have seen Paterson before, by the way - he gave a death-bowling masterclass in a T20 at Cardiff three years ago. 1st over: England 1-0 (Crawley 1, Sibley 0) Philander\u2019s second ball nips back sharply to hit Crawley on the thigh pad, and the third takes a thickish edge before falling short of third slip. Immaculate stuff from Philander, as always. Crawley then works a single into the leg side to put England 1-0 up. \u201cLooking at Joe Root\u2019s England blazer alongside the natty South African equivalent, I was immediately struck by how plainly classical it looks,\u201d says Tom van der Gucht, If you ask me, although judging by my own sartorial crimes against humanity you probably shouldn\u2019t, the ECB need to invest some of the money being blown on The Hundred in some extra trimming on their jackets. Nothing too garish: perhaps just a couple of gold rings around the cuffs and something along the lapels. Who knows, maybe it would empower Root\u2019s leadership if he resembled a young Captain Birdseye.\u201d Insert your own can-he-grow-a-beard-yet joke here. Here we go. Vernon Philander has the new ball, Zak Crawley is in the interrogation room. This will be a challenging morning for England. Now this is how to start a Test match \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Tom Bowtell. \u201cThere is a tantalising chance of an era-defining statgasm this morning. If Philander concedes 24 runs without taking a wicket, his career figures will read 222 wickets @ 22.22. It rather tarnishes Big Vern\u2019s career that he lacked the foresight and basic human decency to have scored 171 fewer Test runs which would have given him a current batting average of 22.22.\u201d \u201cWhere do you think Chris Woakes is at the moment?\u201d says Kevin Wilson. \u201cHe\u2019s the least talked up of any of England\u2019s quicks. He\u2019s been in and out of the side and bowled well in Hamilton and was reasonably decent in the Ashes. But even when he\u2019s played, it feels like Root underbowls him. He\u2019s the natural replacement for Anderson with the new ball. I\u2019m fine with Wood coming in as I think some extra pace will be needed, but the decision you need to make is around the new ball. Would Woakes be more effective with the new ball than Sam Curran?\u201d His illness has made this tour a bit of a write-off. He\u2019ll always be a good option, especially at home, and I thought he was poorly managed during the Ashes. But I\u2019d say England are right to use Curran for now. Woakes is 31 in March and has a chronic knee injury; it wouldn\u2019t shock me if Anderson outlasted him as a Test player. Pre-match reading Both teams make one change, with each bringing in a skiddy fast bowler. South Africa give a debut to Dane Paterson, who replaces the allrounder Dwaine Pretorius. England bring in Mark Wood for the injured Jimmy Anderson. South Africa Elgar, Malan, Hamza, du Plessis (c), van der Dussen, de Kock (wk), Philander, Maharaj, Rabada, Nortje, Paterson. England Sibley, Crawley, Denly, Root (c), Stokes, Pope, Buttler (wk), Curran, Bess, Wood, Broad. \u201cIt looks a good surface, dry underneath, and it could deteriorate,\u201d says Joe Root. Faf du Plessis, who has now lost six tosses in a row, says he would also have batted, though it was a 60/40 call. Hello and welcome to live, over-by-over coverage of the third Test between South Africa and England at Port Elizabeth. Let\u2019s start with something thrilling, a list of scores: 1-1, 1-0, 2-1, 2-1, 2-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-1, 0-2, 1-2, 3-1. Those are the series results between these sides since South Africa were readmitted in 1991. No whitewashes, not even a rout, and only three dead rubbers in 11 series. South Africa and England have been the most well-matched sides in world cricket in the last 30 years. Some might say that\u2019s because they\u2019re essentially the same team, but that\u2019s one for the Guardian Sport SuperBrains to consider. What we can say with confidence is that contests between the two usually come with a guarantee of tense, hard-nosed, occasionally brilliant cricket. This series, which has been no different, will end with back-to-back games at Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg. If you believe in the M word, then England have it after their stirring victory in the second Test at Cape Town. But they will be without one of the stars of that match: Jimmy Anderson, who had frankly absurd match figures of 37-15-63-7, has flown home with the latest manifestation of professional old age. His like-for-unlike replacement will be Mark Wood, who has been bowling like the wind \u2013 or even the Typhoon \u2013 in the nets. Port Elizabeth has a reputation for being the slowest pitch in South Africa, so England want what we are now obliged to refer to as an X-factor bowler. There has been plenty of talk of reverse swing, too. Slow pitch or not, I doubt the next few days will be dull. After all, it\u2019s England v South Africa. The match starts at 8am in England, 10am in Port Elizabeth.",

A Dog\u2019s Tale, written by Poppy Hollman, is a story of terrors and terriers, charting the frayed nerves and fierce competition at Crufts. Hollman\u2019s play, which will tour the UK, explores the famous dog spectacular\u2019s origins in the Victorian era, with the ambitious Charles Cruft \u2013 who masterminded the first event in 1891 \u2013 emerging as a PT Barnum figure. It is not so much the Greatest Showman, perhaps, as the Best-in-Showman.</p> <p>Hollman says her \u201cguilty secret\u201d about the comedy, which is her first professional commission, is that she shares her family home not with dogs but cats. (Two ginger toms, one fussy and one greedy, who tend to sleep on her laptop.) But she adds that Cruft himself \u201calways dodged the question about what dog breed he had.

It\u2019s such a hilarious place, ripe for comedy, but also a really inclusive and welcoming environment with a massive spectrum of society.\u201d After all, a quarter of the UK adult population <a href=\"https://www.pdsa.org.uk/get-involved/our-campaigns/pdsa-animal-wellbeing-report/uk-pet-populations-of-dogs-cats-and-rabbits\">have a dog</a>.</p> <p>One of the play\u2019s main themes is class: a Kennel Club snob calls Cruft \u201ca jumped-up salesman. A Man with no \u2013 ahem \u2013 pedigree.\u201d Cruft\u2019s father was a jeweller but, as a teenager, Charles decided against a career in the family business. He began selling \u201cdog cakes\u201d for James Spratt\u2019s pet food company before founding his competition.

      "bodyText": "Tom Hooper\u2019s extravagant blockbuster may have given cats all the attention but a lovably scruffy new stage musical puts their canine rivals in the spotlight. A Dog\u2019s Tale, written by Poppy Hollman, is a story of terrors and terriers, charting the frayed nerves and fierce competition at Crufts. Hollman\u2019s play, which will tour the UK, explores the famous dog spectacular\u2019s origins in the Victorian era, with the ambitious Charles Cruft \u2013 who masterminded the first event in 1891 \u2013 emerging as a PT Barnum figure. It is not so much the Greatest Showman, perhaps, as the Best-in-Showman. Hollman says her \u201cguilty secret\u201d about the comedy, which is her first professional commission, is that she shares her family home not with dogs but cats. (Two ginger toms, one fussy and one greedy, who tend to sleep on her laptop.) But she adds that Cruft himself \u201calways dodged the question about what dog breed he had. After he died, his wife said, \u2018We had cats!\u2019\u201d Being a cat lover gave Hollman an outsider\u2019s view on her two-day research trip to Crufts last year, she says. \u201cI sat next to the breed rings, seeing all these madly different-looking dogs and secretly chatting to people, asking their opinions and listening to them bitching about who was going to win. It\u2019s such a hilarious place, ripe for comedy, but also a really inclusive and welcoming environment with a massive spectrum of society.\u201d After all, a quarter of the UK adult population have a dog. One of the play\u2019s main themes is class: a Kennel Club snob calls Cruft \u201ca jumped-up salesman. A Man with no \u2013 ahem \u2013 pedigree.\u201d Cruft\u2019s father was a jeweller but, as a teenager, Charles decided against a career in the family business. He began selling \u201cdog cakes\u201d for James Spratt\u2019s pet food company before founding his competition. In one of Hollman\u2019s rousing songs, entitled Be More Dog, Cruft sings: \u201cThough you may be a mutt / When your dreams are bigger than others\u2019 / Who cares that you are not a pedigree?\u201d Cruft, says the playwright, had a mission to take dog shows \u201caway from the aristocrats\u201d and open them up for all audiences. \u201cCharging only a penny to enter was key to it becoming as huge as it is, even if it\u2019s now owned by the Kennel Club, who were initially his rivals in the world of dog shows.\u201d Before becoming a playwright, Hollman was head of touring exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

      "body": "<p>This was a slow burner of a day \u2013 except for those spectators foolish enough to stay out of the shade as a fierce sun blazed out of a cloudless sky. The pitch was slow, the band was surprisingly slow to play their trademark \u201cStand By Me\u201d and for much of the time the batting was slow, until Ollie Pope launched a mini-assault against the second new ball in front of an admiring Ben Stokes. Yet it would be foolish to conclude that in the 21st century it will stay as serene as this. Matches tend to accelerate on this ground. Despite a bland, innocuous-looking surface draws are now a rarity here.</p> <p>When the players left the field England, after winning the toss, were 224 for four and, oddly enough, both sides could feel content with their efforts. The batsmen had battled away but only the best of them, which included Pope, could score with any freedom. None of them could post a half-century but the unbeaten partnership of 76 between Pope and Stokes in the final 90 minutes gave England the edge.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/16/england-moeen-ali-scapegoat-test-cricket\">I was a made a scapegoat for England\u2019s Test defeats, says Moeen Ali</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The South Africans were tenacious and on target. There was not much there for the pacemen. As anticipated Faf du Plessis reinforced his attack by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/16/south-africa-cricket-test-squad-england\" title=\"\">replacing Dwaine Pretorius</a> with another 30-year-old debutant, Dane Paterson, one of a quartet who perspired freely, mostly when bowling from the Pavilion End. Keshav Maharaj, the left-arm spinner, delivered 30 consecutive overs from the Duckpool End, finding occasional, slow turn along the way. He allowed very few liberties but the fact he bowled so many overs reflects this was no paceman\u2019s paradise.</p> <p>So batting was hardly perilous but it was hard work for a new opening pair. They did not dominate the first session but they batted all the way through it, which was all that could be asked of them. This was the first time England openers had batted through all of the opening session of a Test since the Oval Test against India in 2011 when the two future knights, Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss, were still in harness.</p> <p>Du Plessis opened with his slower pacemen, Vernon Philander and Paterson. Zak Crawley was given one freebie from Philander which he cut for four but there would not be many more of those. Our expectation of this embryonic opening pair is that Dom Sibley is a sticker but Crawley is no crawler. In fact Sibley proceeded more quickly in that morning session during which Du Plessis employed all five of his bowlers; he had 30 to Crawley\u2019s 20 at lunch. Even so England\u2019s first Zak was learning fast about the peculiar rigours of Test cricket with every over he survived.</p> <p>After lunch both of them perished from shots off the face of their bats that were caught just behind square on the leg side, another indication of the nature of this pitch; the odd outside edge was not carrying to the slip cordon. Sibley clipped a rising delivery from Kagiso Rabada off his hip towards a crowded leg-side field and Dean Elgar held a sharp chance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77ed9a151933de9bad39c7941e8c12559b76a624\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77ed9a151933de9bad39c7941e8c12559b76a624/0_0_3500_2495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Stokes survives after poking towards short leg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes survives after poking towards short leg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That brought Joe Denly to the crease and the Kent pair ground away in a manner unfamiliar to regulars at Canterbury until Crawley flicked a full-length delivery from Anrich Nortje to the leg side and this time it was a diving Rassie van der Dussen who clung on to the catch. Crawley\u2019s 44 is his best yet for England even though this innings lacked his usual fluency.</p> <p>At tea England had mustered 117 for two from 58 overs \u2013 cricket for the connoisseur is the standard euphemism. The pace and intrigue of the game increased in the final session. First there was the unusual dismissal of Denly. He went back to the persevering Maharaj and the ball dribbled to extra cover; obviously it had hit the bat but there was a half-hearted appeal. Had it hit the pad first? The South Africans wisely reviewed and discovered this was indeed the case and the batsman was lbw.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/16/england-zac-crawley-south-africa-qualifies-third-test\">England\u2019s Zak Crawley shows right qualities despite finding going tough | Chris Stocks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So there was more exasperation for Denly, who had batted 100 balls for his 25. He has now made it to double figures 21 times in his 24 visits to the crease in Test cricket. This puts him in second place in a quirky list of batsmen with the highest percentage of double-figure scores among those who have played 20 Test innings (yes, the TMS scorer, Andrew Samson, has graced us with his presence for the first time in the series). The West Indian Charlie Davis is at the top of this list and after Denly comes Colin Bland, Marnus Labuschagne, Shimron Hetmyer and Jack Hobbs, a contrasting top six.</p> <p>Rabada then produced the most spectacular moment of the day when bowling to Joe Root, who had been the most proactive of the English batsmen, especially against Maharaj. In he sped, Root was lodged on the crease and late on the ball which crashed into his off-stump. Rabada roared in celebration a few feet from Root, who was about to begin his gloomy trek back tothe pavilion.</p> <p>England were faltering at 148 for four but Stokes and Pope stayed firm. Early on Stokes had a few trials against Maharaj but then he batted with easy discretion. Pope was rock-solid as well but the panache with which he struck three fours in Nortje\u2019s first over with the new ball enhanced English expectations of what might happen when play resumes on Friday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "This was a slow burner of a day \u2013 except for those spectators foolish enough to stay out of the shade as a fierce sun blazed out of a cloudless sky. The pitch was slow, the band was surprisingly slow to play their trademark \u201cStand By Me\u201d and for much of the time the batting was slow, until Ollie Pope launched a mini-assault against the second new ball in front of an admiring Ben Stokes. Yet it would be foolish to conclude that in the 21st century it will stay as serene as this. Matches tend to accelerate on this ground. Despite a bland, innocuous-looking surface draws are now a rarity here. When the players left the field England, after winning the toss, were 224 for four and, oddly enough, both sides could feel content with their efforts. The batsmen had battled away but only the best of them, which included Pope, could score with any freedom. None of them could post a half-century but the unbeaten partnership of 76 between Pope and Stokes in the final 90 minutes gave England the edge. The South Africans were tenacious and on target. There was not much there for the pacemen. As anticipated Faf du Plessis reinforced his attack by replacing Dwaine Pretorius with another 30-year-old debutant, Dane Paterson, one of a quartet who perspired freely, mostly when bowling from the Pavilion End. Keshav Maharaj, the left-arm spinner, delivered 30 consecutive overs from the Duckpool End, finding occasional, slow turn along the way. He allowed very few liberties but the fact he bowled so many overs reflects this was no paceman\u2019s paradise. So batting was hardly perilous but it was hard work for a new opening pair. They did not dominate the first session but they batted all the way through it, which was all that could be asked of them. This was the first time England openers had batted through all of the opening session of a Test since the Oval Test against India in 2011 when the two future knights, Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss, were still in harness. Du Plessis opened with his slower pacemen, Vernon Philander and Paterson. Zak Crawley was given one freebie from Philander which he cut for four but there would not be many more of those. Our expectation of this embryonic opening pair is that Dom Sibley is a sticker but Crawley is no crawler. In fact Sibley proceeded more quickly in that morning session during which Du Plessis employed all five of his bowlers; he had 30 to Crawley\u2019s 20 at lunch. Even so England\u2019s first Zak was learning fast about the peculiar rigours of Test cricket with every over he survived. After lunch both of them perished from shots off the face of their bats that were caught just behind square on the leg side, another indication of the nature of this pitch; the odd outside edge was not carrying to the slip cordon. Sibley clipped a rising delivery from Kagiso Rabada off his hip towards a crowded leg-side field and Dean Elgar held a sharp chance. That brought Joe Denly to the crease and the Kent pair ground away in a manner unfamiliar to regulars at Canterbury until Crawley flicked a full-length delivery from Anrich Nortje to the leg side and this time it was a diving Rassie van der Dussen who clung on to the catch. Crawley\u2019s 44 is his best yet for England even though this innings lacked his usual fluency. At tea England had mustered 117 for two from 58 overs \u2013 cricket for the connoisseur is the standard euphemism. The pace and intrigue of the game increased in the final session. First there was the unusual dismissal of Denly. He went back to the persevering Maharaj and the ball dribbled to extra cover; obviously it had hit the bat but there was a half-hearted appeal. Had it hit the pad first? The South Africans wisely reviewed and discovered this was indeed the case and the batsman was lbw. So there was more exasperation for Denly, who had batted 100 balls for his 25. He has now made it to double figures 21 times in his 24 visits to the crease in Test cricket. This puts him in second place in a quirky list of batsmen with the highest percentage of double-figure scores among those who have played 20 Test innings (yes, the TMS scorer, Andrew Samson, has graced us with his presence for the first time in the series). The West Indian Charlie Davis is at the top of this list and after Denly comes Colin Bland, Marnus Labuschagne, Shimron Hetmyer and Jack Hobbs, a contrasting top six. Rabada then produced the most spectacular moment of the day when bowling to Joe Root, who had been the most proactive of the English batsmen, especially against Maharaj. In he sped, Root was lodged on the crease and late on the ball which crashed into his off-stump. Rabada roared in celebration a few feet from Root, who was about to begin his gloomy trek back tothe pavilion. England were faltering at 148 for four but Stokes and Pope stayed firm. Early on Stokes had a few trials against Maharaj but then he batted with easy discretion. Pope was rock-solid as well but the panache with which he struck three fours in Nortje\u2019s first over with the new ball enhanced English expectations of what might happen when play resumes on Friday.",

      "bodyText": "Goldfinger opens with a shot of a floating fake duck that turns out to be attached to a wetsuit-clad Sean Connery as James Bond. He clambers out of the water, shoots a climbing rope from a gun, overpowers a security guard, plants a plastic explosive and peels off his suit to reveal a white tuxedo. Bond goes on to see the reflection of a knife-wielding baddie in the eyes of the girl he is kissing and overpowers him. Cue Shirley Bassey\u2019s immortal theme tune: \u201cGoldfinger, he\u2019s the man / The man with the Midas touch \u2026\u201d In 1964, the third Bond film (after Dr No and From Russia With Love) set the tone for the opening minutes of every Bond movie since. An action sequence is followed by the epic theme tune, the songs themselves defining eras and tracing pop\u2019s development through use of the biggest names available: Bassey, Paul McCartney, Duran Duran, a-ha, Madonna, Sam Smith and Adele. This year, 18-year-old Billie Eilish becomes the youngest ever artist to soundtrack a Bond film, co-writing the theme to Bond\u2019s 25th outing, No Time to Die, with her brother, the producer Finneas. Eilish has described the news as \u201ca huge honour\u201d, but the author and Bond expert Nick Parkhouse says the theme songs are little more than advertising jingles for the movies, seeking to identify the films with big songs, big voices and big stars. \u201cIt\u2019s always been about marketing and exposure, not artistic vision,\u201d he says. For the stars, the Bond gig offers what the University of Huddersfield music lecturer Catherine Haworth calls \u201ca chance to be part of a cultural phenomenon, the longest-running film franchise in history and one of the most recognisable literary and film characters ever\u201d.

The Ukrainian interior ministry issued a statement on Thursday saying that its position was not to interfere in US domestic affairs, but that press reports of messages contain \u201ca possible violation of the law of Ukraine and the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, which protects the rights of a diplomat on the territory of the foreign country\u201d. The statement said Ukrainian authorities had initiated criminal proceedings and asked the US for cooperation. \u201cIn accordance with the international legal mechanisms, the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, Arsen Avakov, suggested that the US side to take part in the investigation,\u201d the statement said. Neither the US state department nor the justice department responded to a request for comment. The state department has yet to make any statement on the possibility that Yovanovitch had been put under surveillance, after WhatsApp messages were released on Tuesday by the House intelligence committee between Trump donor Robert Hyde and Lev Parnas, a Soviet-born Florida businessmen. Both men had ties to Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s attorney and adviser, who the president had assigned to take the lead in persuading the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into his political rival former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. In an interview on Wednesday night, Parnas, a 47 year-old Republican donor who has been charged for campaign finance violations, told MSNBC that Trump \u201cknew exactly what was going on\u201d in the pressure campaign on Kyiv.

Hyde distanced himself from Parnas, calling him a \u201cdweeb\u201d and said he was only \u201cjoking around\u201d after a few drinks by sending \u201ccolourful texts\u201d. The texts, however, were sent over the course of an entire week. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Hyde had been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital last May, following an incident at Trump\u2019s Doral resort outside Miami. Hyde is reported to have told the police that he had been \u201cset up and that a hit man was out to get him\u201d and he also \u201cspoke about emails he sent that may have placed his life in jeopardy\u201d.

In a separate request, Ukraine appealed to the FBI for help in another investigation of a suspected cyber-attack by Russian military hackers on Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company, which hired Hunter Biden as a board member. The pressure by the Trump camp on the Ukrainian government was aimed in part at looking for damaging information about the younger Biden\u2019s role as a Burisma board member.",

      "body": "<p>The former Labour defence minister Lord Chalfont, who has died aged 100, had perhaps the most precipitous and unlikely rise to a political career in modern history. He was Alun Gwynne Jones, defence correspondent of the Times, at the time of the election of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson</a>\u2019s first Labour government in October 1964, and in a matter of days was summoned for an unexpected briefing with the prime minister at No 10, leaving a short time later as both a minister \u2013 for disarmament, based in the Foreign Office, not the Ministry of Defence \u2013 and a life peer.</p> <p>\u201cIf the word had been invented I would have said I was gobsmacked,\u201d Chalfont told the Independent in 1995. \u201cI have never expressed any political views that could characterise me as left or right.\u201d In that, over time, he advised all three main parties on defence issues, he was correct. Many, however, would query that assessment, as he later took increasingly authoritarian stands in support of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Thatcher</a> government, which led to her recommending his appointment in 1989 as deputy chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority and in 1990 as chairman of the Radio Authority.</p> <p>In 1964, since he had never been a member of the Labour party (or indeed any political party), running him in a byelection for the Commons was regarded as too risky, especially as Wilson\u2019s majority was only four. When he pointed out to the prime minister that he was not necessarily a Labour supporter, Wilson imperturbably replied: \u201cSuch ideological commitment if conscientiously pursued would mark you as unique in my administration.\u201d</p> <p>It was an astonishing career development for Gwynne Jones, born in Monmouth, south Wales, to Arthur, an electrician, and Liza (nee Hardman), a teacher. Educated at West Monmouth school in Pontypool, he was commissioned in the South Wales Borderers in 1940 and served with the regiment for 21 years. </p> <p>Chalfont won the Military Cross in a hand-to-hand firefight with communist guerrillas in Malaysia in 1957, shooting an attacker at a range of two yards and disabling his grenade before it could explode. He became an intelligence officer and fluent Russian speaker during the cold war, retiring in 1961 when passed over for command of his regiment, to become the Times\u2019s defence correspondent.</p> <p>On his appointment as a minister, his editor, William Haley, told him he would have much less influence on government policy than he had working for the paper. This may have been correct: Chalfont diligently pursued Labour\u2019s nuclear disarmament strategy, seeking to redirect resources to conventional arms, but the British proposals were eventually undermined by the Americans. An ancillary task was to prevent the frequently inebriated foreign secretary George Brown from embarrassing the government; Chalfont was the source of the famous story of Brown requesting a dance from a scarlet-clad figure at a reception who turned out to be a cardinal.</p> <p>In 1967 Chalfont was placed in charge of Britain\u2019s negotiations to join the European Common Market, during which he inadvertently caused a diplomatic incident by advising journalists that Britain might seek a free-trade deal with the US if rejected again and would consider removing troops from the defence of Germany. His offer to resign was refused by Wilson, De Gaulle vetoed the British application and troops stayed on the Rhine.</p> <p>After the government\u2019s defeat in 1970, Chalfont veered away from frontline politics, becoming a commentator \u2013 including, for a period, for the Guardian and New Statesman \u2013 a regular broadcaster and an author of eight books, mainly on military subjects, including a 1976 biography of Viscount Montgomery of Alamein.

      "bodyText": "The former Labour defence minister Lord Chalfont, who has died aged 100, had perhaps the most precipitous and unlikely rise to a political career in modern history. He was Alun Gwynne Jones, defence correspondent of the Times, at the time of the election of Harold Wilson\u2019s first Labour government in October 1964, and in a matter of days was summoned for an unexpected briefing with the prime minister at No 10, leaving a short time later as both a minister \u2013 for disarmament, based in the Foreign Office, not the Ministry of Defence \u2013 and a life peer. \u201cIf the word had been invented I would have said I was gobsmacked,\u201d Chalfont told the Independent in 1995. \u201cI have never expressed any political views that could characterise me as left or right.\u201d In that, over time, he advised all three main parties on defence issues, he was correct. Many, however, would query that assessment, as he later took increasingly authoritarian stands in support of the Thatcher government, which led to her recommending his appointment in 1989 as deputy chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority and in 1990 as chairman of the Radio Authority. In 1964, since he had never been a member of the Labour party (or indeed any political party), running him in a byelection for the Commons was regarded as too risky, especially as Wilson\u2019s majority was only four. When he pointed out to the prime minister that he was not necessarily a Labour supporter, Wilson imperturbably replied: \u201cSuch ideological commitment if conscientiously pursued would mark you as unique in my administration.\u201d It was an astonishing career development for Gwynne Jones, born in Monmouth, south Wales, to Arthur, an electrician, and Liza (nee Hardman), a teacher. Educated at West Monmouth school in Pontypool, he was commissioned in the South Wales Borderers in 1940 and served with the regiment for 21 years. Chalfont won the Military Cross in a hand-to-hand firefight with communist guerrillas in Malaysia in 1957, shooting an attacker at a range of two yards and disabling his grenade before it could explode. He became an intelligence officer and fluent Russian speaker during the cold war, retiring in 1961 when passed over for command of his regiment, to become the Times\u2019s defence correspondent. On his appointment as a minister, his editor, William Haley, told him he would have much less influence on government policy than he had working for the paper. This may have been correct: Chalfont diligently pursued Labour\u2019s nuclear disarmament strategy, seeking to redirect resources to conventional arms, but the British proposals were eventually undermined by the Americans. An ancillary task was to prevent the frequently inebriated foreign secretary George Brown from embarrassing the government; Chalfont was the source of the famous story of Brown requesting a dance from a scarlet-clad figure at a reception who turned out to be a cardinal. In 1967 Chalfont was placed in charge of Britain\u2019s negotiations to join the European Common Market, during which he inadvertently caused a diplomatic incident by advising journalists that Britain might seek a free-trade deal with the US if rejected again and would consider removing troops from the defence of Germany. His offer to resign was refused by Wilson, De Gaulle vetoed the British application and troops stayed on the Rhine. After the government\u2019s defeat in 1970, Chalfont veered away from frontline politics, becoming a commentator \u2013 including, for a period, for the Guardian and New Statesman \u2013 a regular broadcaster and an author of eight books, mainly on military subjects, including a 1976 biography of Viscount Montgomery of Alamein. His memoir, The Shadow of My Hand, was published in 2000. He spent increasing time on directorships in the City, including Lazard merchant bank, IBM, Shandwick public relations and the VSEL shipbuilding consortium until its takeover by BAE in 1995. Not all of these ventures ended happily: within six months of his being taken on to the board of Spey Finance, a property company, in 1974, it crashed, leaving him to rue City morality: \u201can insight not only into what could happen but into the dubious methods of a lot of people\u201d. There was also an increasing obsession with supposed communist infiltration that led to his association with various rightwing pressure groups including Freedom in Sport \u2013 championing the right of cricketers to play in apartheid South Africa and of the South African athlete Zola Budd to run for Britain in the Olympics \u2013 the Institute for the Study of Terrorism, the UK Committee for a Free World and the European Atlantic Group. There was also the Media Monitoring Group, primarily focused on alleged leftwing bias at the BBC; the corporation, Chalfont announced in 1987, employed \u201ccommunists, militants and leftwing agitators of all persuasions\u201d. The previous year he had said: \u201cWhat we need is not less secrecy but a great deal more,\u201d adding that the government had \u201ca duty to be as draconian and severe as it thinks fit\u201d. Such attitudes led Thatcher to support his appointment to the oversight bodies for broadcasters, which came to a rapid end when it became clear that Shandwick and the security firm Hamilton Ingram, with which he was associated, were advising ITV companies on how to secure their franchises. These and Chalfont\u2019s links to Zeus Security Consultants and Securipol had been denounced in the Commons, to Tory jeers, by the Lib Dem leader, Paddy Ashdown. Zeus had been engaged in the investigation and surveillance of anti-nuclear objectors to the Sizewell B nuclear power station inquiry. Chalfont\u2019s last campaign sought the exoneration of two RAF pilots whose helicopter crashed with the loss of 29 lives, mostly senior intelligence personnel, on the Mull of Kintyre in June 1994. The pilots were initially blamed by the RAF, but cleared in 2011. Chalfont had a brief wartime marriage, then in 1948 married Mona Mitchell, a doctor in the Royal Army Medical Corps. She died in 2008 and their daughter also predeceased him. \u2022 Alun Arthur Gwynne Jones, Lord Chalfont, politician and journalist, born 5 December 1919; died 10 January 2020",

      "body": "<p>If Sunspring is anything to go by, artificial intelligence in film-making has some way to go. This short film, made as an entry to Sci-Fi London\u2019s 48-hour film-making competition in 2016, was written entirely by an AI. The director, Oscar Sharp, fed a few hundred sci-fi screenplays into a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (the type of software behind predictive text in a smartphone), then told it to write its own. The result was almost, but not quite, incoherent nonsense, riddled with cryptic nonsequiturs, bizarre turns of phrase and unfathomable stage directions such as \u201che is standing in the stars and sitting on the floor\u201d. All of which Sharp and his actors filmed with sincere commitment.</p> <p>\u201cIn a future with mass unemployment, young people are forced to sell blood,\u201d says a man in a shiny gold jacket. \u201cYou should see the boy and shut up. I was the one who was going to be a hundred years old,\u201d replies a woman fiddling with some electronics. The man vomits up an eyeball. A second man says: \u201cWell, I have to go to the skull.\u201d And so forth. An unwitting viewer might be unsure whether they were watching meaningless nonsense or a lost Tarkovsky script.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7x2Ihqjmc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LY7x2Ihqjmc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This isn\u2019t how artificial intelligence is changing the movies \u2013 yet. But AI is changing the industry in other ways, to a greater extent than is being admitted. In early January, Warner Bros broke cover and <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/01/warner-bros-enlists-ai-specialist-cinelytic-to-help-shape-film-decisions-ces-1202825079/\" title=\"\">announced</a> it had signed up to an AI-driven project management system that would \u201cinform decision-making around content and talent valuation to support release strategies\u201d. In other words, Warners will be using AI to help it decide what movies to make.</p> <p>The system in question was launched last year by <a href=\"https://www.cinelytic.com/\" title=\"\">Cinelytic</a>, a Los Angeles-based startup. Other clients listed on its website include Sony Pictures, Ingenious Media and STX Entertainment (the studio behind Hustlers and Playmobil: The Movie). Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox has partnered with Google to develop its own AI, named <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/how-20th-century-fox-uses-ml-to-predict-a-movie-audience\" title=\"\">Merlin</a>, which predicts audiences based on analysis of patterns and objects in movie trailers. Other new companies have also entered the AI game in the past few years, including Belgium-based <a href=\"https://www.scriptbook.io/#!/\" title=\"\">ScriptBook</a> and Israel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vault-ai.com/\" title=\"\">Vault AI</a>.</p> <p>You can see the appeal, especially for a studio like Warner Bros. As well as putting out hits such as Joker and A Star Is Born, it has had its share of box-office flops, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/16/epic-fail-why-has-king-arthur-flopped-so-badly\" title=\"\">King Arthur: Legend of the Sword</a>,<a href=\"https://www.showbiz411.com/2019/08/22/summer-box-office-hell-warners-shuts-down-flop-the-kitchen-after-3-weeks-drops-almost-all-theaters\" title=\"\"> The Kitchen</a>, <a href=\"https://observer.com/2019/06/x-men-dark-phoenix-hellboy-keanu-reeves-shaft-biggest-box-office-flops-2019/\" title=\"\">Shaft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/09/the-goldfinch-box-office-what-went-wrong-1202174118/\" title=\"\">The Goldfinch</a>. These projects must have looked like hits on paper. How to tell the difference? Traditionally, Hollywood almost prides itself on its own unpredictability, accepting as a given William Goldman\u2019s adage \u201cno one knows anything\u201d. It is an industry that carries out extensive analysis, research and audience testing, but that still relies to a large extent on human intuition and gut instinct. It is also an industry where the majority of films made are never released, and less than half of those that are make their money back.</p> <p>Can the machines do better? Absolutely, says Cinelytic, which claims an accuracy of 85% in its box office forecasting. Cinelytic was founded in 2015 by Tobias Queisser, whose background is in finance and film producing. His co-founder, Dev Sen, is a rocket scientist who developed risk assessment software for Nasa. Cinelytic claims to have crunched data from more than 95,000 movies and 500,000 actors and professionals, but its chief selling point is that it can make forecasts in real time \u2013 expressed as percentage probabilities of certain levels of success. With its user-friendly interface, clients can play with the variables and assess the impact on box office right away.</p> <p>Let\u2019s make an action comedy starring Dwayne Johnson, say. It will be huge! But what if Johnson is not available? How would it look if you cast Gerard Butler instead? Not so huge, perhaps, but the budget might also be lower. How would it do if you released it over 1,000 screens, or 3,000? How would it do in Brazil or China? In effect, Cinelytic\u2019s AI treats the movie industry like fantasy football, assigning quantitative scores to individuals, according to factors such as recent or past box-office performance or social media profile.</p> <p>Others take a slightly different approach. <a href=\"https://www.scriptbook.io/#!/scriptbook/proof\" title=\"\">ScriptBook\u2019s AI primarily analyses scripts</a>, as opposed to actors or directors. \u201cMost people believe that cast is everything, but we\u2019ve learned that the story has the highest predictive value,\u201d says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nadster911?lang=en\" title=\"\">Nadira Azermai</a>, who founded the company in 2015. It doesn\u2019t take a computer-sized brain to think of a movie that had a stellar cast but still flopped. But a good story will succeed even without stars \u2013 and potentially more so with them, she says.</p> <p>Within six minutes, ScriptBook\u2019s AI reads a script and assigns it more than 400 parameters. \u201cAnything that is information: emotion analysis, the journey for the protagonist and antagonist, whether the film will cater to a wide audience or niche audience, whether it follows a traditional three-act structure, whether the action happens in the most important places.\u201d As more information becomes available, such as the cast, the prediction becomes more accurate, but if the computer says no to begin with, no additional information will change it to a yes.</p> <p>ScriptBook\u2019s success rates are comparable to those of Cinelytic: 83% to 86%, Azermai claims, whereas human decision-making is successful 27% to 31% of the time. In a retroactive study of Sony\u2019s output between 2015 and 2017, for example, it successfully identified 22 out of its 32 releases that lost money. It could have saved the company a fortune. It has achieved similar levels of accuracy with movies before they were released, even predicting the success of unconventional outliers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/17/get-out-review-fantastically-twisted-horror-satire-on-race-in-america\" title=\"\">Get Out</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/la-la-land-review-ryan-gosling-emma-stone\" title=\"\">La La Land</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/05/a-quiet-place-review-john-krasinski-emily-blunt\" title=\"\">A Quiet Place</a>. Azermai is not yet at liberty to reveal which companies ScriptBook has been working with, but she applauds Warners\u2019 announcement that it is working with Cinelytic. \u201cIt is an important message, because the majority of companies are still treating AI as a dirty little secret.\u201d</p> <p>One of the factors driving the AI revolution is undoubtedly Netflix, which, by its spectacular ascent over the past decade, has awakened the entertainment industry to the awesome power of data. Netflix has valued its \u201crecommendations\u201d algorithms (which suggest to viewers what to watch next) at <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-recommendation-engine-worth-1-billion-per-year-2016-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">$1bn (\u00a3760m) a year in terms of keeping subscribers engaged</a>. The company is notoriously secretive about its methods, but it is safe to assume it is tracking viewers\u2019 every move: what they watch, how long they watch it, what time of day it is, what they watch next, how many hits a new show receives in its first day, and so on. Because Netflix also streams other people\u2019s content, it is even better informed when it comes to producing its own. The studio\u2019s staggering output (Netflix put out 700 original TV shows and 80 features in 2018) would not be possible without AI assistance. As a result of Netflix\u2019s success, tech companies such as Apple and Amazon are getting into content creation and giving the old-school studios a run for their money.</p> <p>\u201cAll of a sudden you have this conservative, traditional industry versus companies who are believers in data,\u201d says Azermai. \u201cThere is a war on content, but one party is using the latest technology and the other is riding a donkey.\u201d</p> <p>The AI revolution will clearly benefit film-makers, but what is in it for us viewers? One potential drawback is that AI eliminates not only financial risk but creative risk, too. The fear is, if you fed in a vaguely challenging or experimental or atypical project into the machine \u2013 say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/14/mulholland-drive-review-david-lynch\" title=\"\">Mulholland Drive</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/13/under-the-skin-scarlett-johansson-peter-bradshaw\" title=\"\">Under the Skin</a> \u2013 the algorithm would discourage you from taking the gamble. Why not do a Dwayne Johnson action comedy instead?</p> <p>Added to which, the data these algorithms are processing are actually human beings, who are inherently erratic, fallible and unpredictable. Your asset might go into rehab, get divorced or decide to go off and make shoes for a year. In 1996 Robert Downey Jr was arrested driving his Porsche naked through Los Angeles throwing imaginary rats out of the window. What algorithm would have recommended casting him as Iron Man?</p> <p>\u201cAlready we\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re getting more and more remakes and sequels because that\u2019s safe, rather than something that\u2019s out of the box,\u201d says Tabitha Goldstaub, a tech entrepreneur and commentator who specialises in artificial intelligence. Her work has raised deeper concerns about AI. Far from being a dispassionate tool, it often reflects the biases and prejudices of its creators, she says. \u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s maths so it can\u2019t be biased, whereas in fact it\u2019s completely the opposite way around: it\u2019s maths, and therefore it\u2019s data, and whatever data you feed a machine will have bias in it. The world is biased, and so these machines exacerbate our own biases.\u201d</p> <p>She points to the fact that no women have been nominated for best director at this year\u2019s Oscars, and only five women have ever been nominated. The AI might well conclude that if you want to make an Oscar-winning movie, don\u2019t hire a female director. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but think: do you really want to leave these people in charge of creating an algorithm that predicts the next hits? It\u2019s quite scary.\u201d</p> <p>But there are signs that AI could help reduce bias. The producer Todd Garner cited an example on <a href=\"https://www.podcastone.com/episode/Tobias-Queisser\" title=\"\">his Producer\u2019s Guide podcast</a> recently. Garner\u2019s company produced the Marlon Wayans comedies White Chicks and Little Man, and did very well out of them. But when it took a new Wayans project to traditional studios and financiers, nobody bit, he says. \u201cBecause there was no way, they thought, that this movie would play internationally \u2026 so it\u2019s a purely domestic play [a US-only release]. Netflix came in and scooped it up immediately, gave us a lot more money to make the movie and the movie was huge for their site. Because Netflix had hosted White Chicks and other Wayans movies on their site, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/fifty-shades-of-gross-marlon-wayans-on-body-fungus-weird-sex-and-donald-trump\" title=\"\">they knew that Marlon Wayans has a worldwide audience</a>. If you don\u2019t have that data, your instinct is, well, African American movies don\u2019t play overseas, period.\u201d</p> <p>Now that AI is here, there is also the question of how much further it will infiltrate film-making. Screenwriting, for example. Things have moved on since Sunspring in 2016. Last year, Kevin Macdonald directed <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/lexus-launches-ad-scripted-entirely-using-artificial-intelligence/1499083\" title=\"\">a one-minute advert for Lexus</a> entirely written by an AI \u2013 that had been trained on 15 years\u2019 worth of luxury ads.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxyHuJSM_jI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OxyHuJSM_jI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As well as analytical tools, ScriptBook is developing a screenwriting AI, which it has given the dystopian sci-fi thriller name of Deepstory. \u201cIt really is a co-creator,\u201d says Azermai, reassuringly. \u201cWe envision a next-generation writers\u2019 room where whenever they don\u2019t know where to head to for the next scene, they would have Deepstory create it. The engine takes into account everything that you\u2019ve written, and it will deliver you the next scene, or the next 10 pages, or write it to the end.\u201d Azermai admits Deepstory still has much to learn. \u201cThe consistency in writing stays for another 10 pages and then the AI becomes a bit crazy \u2013 sometimes it kills the protagonist for some reason \u2013 but it\u2019s improving. Within five years we\u2019ll have scripts written by AI that you would think are better than human writing.\u201d</p> <p>The movies themselves have trained us to be suspicious of AIs. They make terrible substitute children (Spielberg\u2019s AI), and even worse romantic partners (Spike Jonze\u2019s Her). They often decide humans are expendable and take over (Kubrick\u2019s 2001) or they enslave us in some futuristic dystopia (Terminator, The Matrix). Could it be that by embracing AI, Hollywood is unwittingly building an equivalent of the Terminator movies\u2019 Skynet? Or, in a slightly less apocalyptic scenario, are we looking at a future where movies are personally tailored to individual viewers? Might we be approaching a sort of Turing test for machine-written fiction? Maybe we have passed it already and we just don\u2019t know it yet. Sounds like a plot for a great, metatextual Hollywood conspiracy thriller. If we got Dwayne Johnson it could be a smash. Let\u2019s crunch some numbers!</p>",

      "bodyText": "If Sunspring is anything to go by, artificial intelligence in film-making has some way to go. This short film, made as an entry to Sci-Fi London\u2019s 48-hour film-making competition in 2016, was written entirely by an AI. The director, Oscar Sharp, fed a few hundred sci-fi screenplays into a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (the type of software behind predictive text in a smartphone), then told it to write its own. The result was almost, but not quite, incoherent nonsense, riddled with cryptic nonsequiturs, bizarre turns of phrase and unfathomable stage directions such as \u201che is standing in the stars and sitting on the floor\u201d. All of which Sharp and his actors filmed with sincere commitment. \u201cIn a future with mass unemployment, young people are forced to sell blood,\u201d says a man in a shiny gold jacket. \u201cYou should see the boy and shut up. I was the one who was going to be a hundred years old,\u201d replies a woman fiddling with some electronics. The man vomits up an eyeball. A second man says: \u201cWell, I have to go to the skull.\u201d And so forth. An unwitting viewer might be unsure whether they were watching meaningless nonsense or a lost Tarkovsky script. This isn\u2019t how artificial intelligence is changing the movies \u2013 yet. But AI is changing the industry in other ways, to a greater extent than is being admitted. In early January, Warner Bros broke cover and announced it had signed up to an AI-driven project management system that would \u201cinform decision-making around content and talent valuation to support release strategies\u201d. In other words, Warners will be using AI to help it decide what movies to make. The system in question was launched last year by Cinelytic, a Los Angeles-based startup. Other clients listed on its website include Sony Pictures, Ingenious Media and STX Entertainment (the studio behind Hustlers and Playmobil: The Movie). Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox has partnered with Google to develop its own AI, named Merlin, which predicts audiences based on analysis of patterns and objects in movie trailers. Other new companies have also entered the AI game in the past few years, including Belgium-based ScriptBook and Israel\u2019s Vault AI. You can see the appeal, especially for a studio like Warner Bros. As well as putting out hits such as Joker and A Star Is Born, it has had its share of box-office flops, such as King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, The Kitchen, Shaft and The Goldfinch. These projects must have looked like hits on paper. How to tell the difference? Traditionally, Hollywood almost prides itself on its own unpredictability, accepting as a given William Goldman\u2019s adage \u201cno one knows anything\u201d. It is an industry that carries out extensive analysis, research and audience testing, but that still relies to a large extent on human intuition and gut instinct. It is also an industry where the majority of films made are never released, and less than half of those that are make their money back. Can the machines do better? Absolutely, says Cinelytic, which claims an accuracy of 85% in its box office forecasting. Cinelytic was founded in 2015 by Tobias Queisser, whose background is in finance and film producing. His co-founder, Dev Sen, is a rocket scientist who developed risk assessment software for Nasa. Cinelytic claims to have crunched data from more than 95,000 movies and 500,000 actors and professionals, but its chief selling point is that it can make forecasts in real time \u2013 expressed as percentage probabilities of certain levels of success. With its user-friendly interface, clients can play with the variables and assess the impact on box office right away. Let\u2019s make an action comedy starring Dwayne Johnson, say. It will be huge! But what if Johnson is not available? How would it look if you cast Gerard Butler instead? Not so huge, perhaps, but the budget might also be lower. How would it do if you released it over 1,000 screens, or 3,000? How would it do in Brazil or China? In effect, Cinelytic\u2019s AI treats the movie industry like fantasy football, assigning quantitative scores to individuals, according to factors such as recent or past box-office performance or social media profile. Others take a slightly different approach. ScriptBook\u2019s AI primarily analyses scripts, as opposed to actors or directors. \u201cMost people believe that cast is everything, but we\u2019ve learned that the story has the highest predictive value,\u201d says Nadira Azermai, who founded the company in 2015. It doesn\u2019t take a computer-sized brain to think of a movie that had a stellar cast but still flopped. But a good story will succeed even without stars \u2013 and potentially more so with them, she says. Within six minutes, ScriptBook\u2019s AI reads a script and assigns it more than 400 parameters. \u201cAnything that is information: emotion analysis, the journey for the protagonist and antagonist, whether the film will cater to a wide audience or niche audience, whether it follows a traditional three-act structure, whether the action happens in the most important places.\u201d As more information becomes available, such as the cast, the prediction becomes more accurate, but if the computer says no to begin with, no additional information will change it to a yes. ScriptBook\u2019s success rates are comparable to those of Cinelytic: 83% to 86%, Azermai claims, whereas human decision-making is successful 27% to 31% of the time. In a retroactive study of Sony\u2019s output between 2015 and 2017, for example, it successfully identified 22 out of its 32 releases that lost money. It could have saved the company a fortune. It has achieved similar levels of accuracy with movies before they were released, even predicting the success of unconventional outliers such as Get Out, La La Land and A Quiet Place. Azermai is not yet at liberty to reveal which companies ScriptBook has been working with, but she applauds Warners\u2019 announcement that it is working with Cinelytic. \u201cIt is an important message, because the majority of companies are still treating AI as a dirty little secret.\u201d One of the factors driving the AI revolution is undoubtedly Netflix, which, by its spectacular ascent over the past decade, has awakened the entertainment industry to the awesome power of data. Netflix has valued its \u201crecommendations\u201d algorithms (which suggest to viewers what to watch next) at $1bn (\u00a3760m) a year in terms of keeping subscribers engaged. The company is notoriously secretive about its methods, but it is safe to assume it is tracking viewers\u2019 every move: what they watch, how long they watch it, what time of day it is, what they watch next, how many hits a new show receives in its first day, and so on. Because Netflix also streams other people\u2019s content, it is even better informed when it comes to producing its own. The studio\u2019s staggering output (Netflix put out 700 original TV shows and 80 features in 2018) would not be possible without AI assistance. As a result of Netflix\u2019s success, tech companies such as Apple and Amazon are getting into content creation and giving the old-school studios a run for their money. \u201cAll of a sudden you have this conservative, traditional industry versus companies who are believers in data,\u201d says Azermai. \u201cThere is a war on content, but one party is using the latest technology and the other is riding a donkey.\u201d The AI revolution will clearly benefit film-makers, but what is in it for us viewers? One potential drawback is that AI eliminates not only financial risk but creative risk, too. The fear is, if you fed in a vaguely challenging or experimental or atypical project into the machine \u2013 say Mulholland Drive or Under the Skin \u2013 the algorithm would discourage you from taking the gamble. Why not do a Dwayne Johnson action comedy instead? Added to which, the data these algorithms are processing are actually human beings, who are inherently erratic, fallible and unpredictable. Your asset might go into rehab, get divorced or decide to go off and make shoes for a year. In 1996 Robert Downey Jr was arrested driving his Porsche naked through Los Angeles throwing imaginary rats out of the window. What algorithm would have recommended casting him as Iron Man? \u201cAlready we\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re getting more and more remakes and sequels because that\u2019s safe, rather than something that\u2019s out of the box,\u201d says Tabitha Goldstaub, a tech entrepreneur and commentator who specialises in artificial intelligence. Her work has raised deeper concerns about AI. Far from being a dispassionate tool, it often reflects the biases and prejudices of its creators, she says. \u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s maths so it can\u2019t be biased, whereas in fact it\u2019s completely the opposite way around: it\u2019s maths, and therefore it\u2019s data, and whatever data you feed a machine will have bias in it. The world is biased, and so these machines exacerbate our own biases.\u201d She points to the fact that no women have been nominated for best director at this year\u2019s Oscars, and only five women have ever been nominated. The AI might well conclude that if you want to make an Oscar-winning movie, don\u2019t hire a female director. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but think: do you really want to leave these people in charge of creating an algorithm that predicts the next hits? It\u2019s quite scary.\u201d But there are signs that AI could help reduce bias. The producer Todd Garner cited an example on his Producer\u2019s Guide podcast recently. Garner\u2019s company produced the Marlon Wayans comedies White Chicks and Little Man, and did very well out of them. But when it took a new Wayans project to traditional studios and financiers, nobody bit, he says. \u201cBecause there was no way, they thought, that this movie would play internationally \u2026 so it\u2019s a purely domestic play [a US-only release]. Netflix came in and scooped it up immediately, gave us a lot more money to make the movie and the movie was huge for their site. Because Netflix had hosted White Chicks and other Wayans movies on their site, they knew that Marlon Wayans has a worldwide audience. If you don\u2019t have that data, your instinct is, well, African American movies don\u2019t play overseas, period.\u201d Now that AI is here, there is also the question of how much further it will infiltrate film-making. Screenwriting, for example. Things have moved on since Sunspring in 2016. Last year, Kevin Macdonald directed a one-minute advert for Lexus entirely written by an AI \u2013 that had been trained on 15 years\u2019 worth of luxury ads. As well as analytical tools, ScriptBook is developing a screenwriting AI, which it has given the dystopian sci-fi thriller name of Deepstory. \u201cIt really is a co-creator,\u201d says Azermai, reassuringly. \u201cWe envision a next-generation writers\u2019 room where whenever they don\u2019t know where to head to for the next scene, they would have Deepstory create it. The engine takes into account everything that you\u2019ve written, and it will deliver you the next scene, or the next 10 pages, or write it to the end.\u201d Azermai admits Deepstory still has much to learn. \u201cThe consistency in writing stays for another 10 pages and then the AI becomes a bit crazy \u2013 sometimes it kills the protagonist for some reason \u2013 but it\u2019s improving. Within five years we\u2019ll have scripts written by AI that you would think are better than human writing.\u201d The movies themselves have trained us to be suspicious of AIs. They make terrible substitute children (Spielberg\u2019s AI), and even worse romantic partners (Spike Jonze\u2019s Her). They often decide humans are expendable and take over (Kubrick\u2019s 2001) or they enslave us in some futuristic dystopia (Terminator, The Matrix). Could it be that by embracing AI, Hollywood is unwittingly building an equivalent of the Terminator movies\u2019 Skynet? Or, in a slightly less apocalyptic scenario, are we looking at a future where movies are personally tailored to individual viewers? Might we be approaching a sort of Turing test for machine-written fiction? Maybe we have passed it already and we just don\u2019t know it yet. Sounds like a plot for a great, metatextual Hollywood conspiracy thriller. If we got Dwayne Johnson it could be a smash. Let\u2019s crunch some numbers!",

      "body": "<p>Back in October, moments before the 49ers embarked on their<em> </em>Monday Night Football clobbering of the Cleveland Browns, a group of 49ers assistant coaches crammed into an elevator and headed up to their box at Levi\u2019s Stadium. The elevator was silent; befitting of the game\u2019s magnitude. About halfway up the ride, one of the coach\u2019s phones buzzed, setting off his ringtone which, in a prophetic moment, happened to be DJ Khaled\u2019s All I Do Is Win. Laughter ensued and the camaraderie of the assistant coaches was on display. It\u2019s a promising crew that resembles most other NFL set-ups \u2026 with one notable exception.</p> <p>Turn on any American network television show these days \u2013 be it a sporting event or The Bachelor \u2013 and it won\u2019t take long for an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hU39FPGalQ\">omnipresent Microsoft commercial</a> featuring an emerging 49ers coach to appear. The spot\u2019s central figure is not head coach Kyle Shanahan, whose offensive wizardry has San Francisco one win away from a Super Bowl berth. Nor is it fiery defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, whose <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFLUK/status/1184152387973517313?s=20\">sideline antics</a> have become social media fodder this season.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hU39FPGalQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1hU39FPGalQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The coach is Katie Sowers, a third-year offensive assistant who works predominantly with the wide receivers. She stoically declares in the commercial, \u201cI\u2019m not here to be the token female. I\u2019m here to help us win.\u201d Sowers has helped the 49ers collect those wins in droves this season but she\u2019s also a revelation whose rise is impossible to ignore.</p> <p>Sowers\u2019 journey to the NFL involves a heavy dose of talent with a side of happenstance. She grew up in Hesston, Kansas, and was a gifted athlete from a young age. Despite the fact that nobody else in the family played football, Sowers and her twin sister, Liz, were drawn to the sport. Sowers loved the Dallas Cowboys but not in the typical way. She didn\u2019t care about the win-loss record or rivalries. Sowers wanted to don pads and wreak havoc <em>as </em>a Cowboy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/15/luke-kuechly-retirement-concussions\">The brilliant Luke Kuechly gave us a searing image of brain trauma</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The twins played the sport nonstop. In high school, Katie chatted with the varsity football coach about joining the team. She decided against it only because she excelled at volleyball and wanted a chance of a college scholarship. Football wasn\u2019t going to be it.</p> <p>It was actually basketball that turned out to be her meal ticket. After college was over and Sowers was figuring out her next steps, she had her \u201cA-ha\u201d moment. ESPN aired a clip of a women\u2019s football game, and that was all the inspiration Sowers needed. She immediately googled local options and soon tried out for the West Michigan Mayhem of the Women\u2019s Football Alliance. There is no salary in women\u2019s football. No agents. Nothing other than a group of women who adore the game.</p> <p>Sowers entered the Mayhem confused by the terminology and culture, a notion she laughs at today. While she played as a kid, she never had a formal coach. It was the veteran women of the Mayhem who taught Sowers the fundamentals of the game, knowledge that would prove invaluable. Sowers thrived as a quarterback in the WFA and played for Team USA in 2013.</p> <p>While in Kansas City, Sowers volunteered as a girls basketball coach. In 2013 she was slated to coach a sixth-grade team but due to an administrative glitch was asked to coach fifth-grade instead. In a twist of fate, one of the players was the daughter of Scott Pioli, the former Kansas City Chiefs general manager and soon to be Atlanta Falcons assistant general manager.</p> <p>Pioli admired Sowers\u2019 coaching skills and soon discovered her involvement in football.

      "bodyText": "Back in October, moments before the 49ers embarked on their Monday Night Football clobbering of the Cleveland Browns, a group of 49ers assistant coaches crammed into an elevator and headed up to their box at Levi\u2019s Stadium. The elevator was silent; befitting of the game\u2019s magnitude. About halfway up the ride, one of the coach\u2019s phones buzzed, setting off his ringtone which, in a prophetic moment, happened to be DJ Khaled\u2019s All I Do Is Win. Laughter ensued and the camaraderie of the assistant coaches was on display. It\u2019s a promising crew that resembles most other NFL set-ups \u2026 with one notable exception. Turn on any American network television show these days \u2013 be it a sporting event or The Bachelor \u2013 and it won\u2019t take long for an omnipresent Microsoft commercial featuring an emerging 49ers coach to appear. The spot\u2019s central figure is not head coach Kyle Shanahan, whose offensive wizardry has San Francisco one win away from a Super Bowl berth. Nor is it fiery defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, whose sideline antics have become social media fodder this season. The coach is Katie Sowers, a third-year offensive assistant who works predominantly with the wide receivers. She stoically declares in the commercial, \u201cI\u2019m not here to be the token female. I\u2019m here to help us win.\u201d Sowers has helped the 49ers collect those wins in droves this season but she\u2019s also a revelation whose rise is impossible to ignore. Sowers\u2019 journey to the NFL involves a heavy dose of talent with a side of happenstance. She grew up in Hesston, Kansas, and was a gifted athlete from a young age. Despite the fact that nobody else in the family played football, Sowers and her twin sister, Liz, were drawn to the sport. Sowers loved the Dallas Cowboys but not in the typical way. She didn\u2019t care about the win-loss record or rivalries. Sowers wanted to don pads and wreak havoc as a Cowboy. The twins played the sport nonstop. In high school, Katie chatted with the varsity football coach about joining the team. She decided against it only because she excelled at volleyball and wanted a chance of a college scholarship. Football wasn\u2019t going to be it. It was actually basketball that turned out to be her meal ticket. After college was over and Sowers was figuring out her next steps, she had her \u201cA-ha\u201d moment. ESPN aired a clip of a women\u2019s football game, and that was all the inspiration Sowers needed. She immediately googled local options and soon tried out for the West Michigan Mayhem of the Women\u2019s Football Alliance. There is no salary in women\u2019s football. No agents. Nothing other than a group of women who adore the game. Sowers entered the Mayhem confused by the terminology and culture, a notion she laughs at today. While she played as a kid, she never had a formal coach. It was the veteran women of the Mayhem who taught Sowers the fundamentals of the game, knowledge that would prove invaluable. Sowers thrived as a quarterback in the WFA and played for Team USA in 2013. While in Kansas City, Sowers volunteered as a girls basketball coach. In 2013 she was slated to coach a sixth-grade team but due to an administrative glitch was asked to coach fifth-grade instead. In a twist of fate, one of the players was the daughter of Scott Pioli, the former Kansas City Chiefs general manager and soon to be Atlanta Falcons assistant general manager. Pioli admired Sowers\u2019 coaching skills and soon discovered her involvement in football. The two formed an unlikely bond, one that not only altered Sowers\u2019 career but also her assumptions about NFL executives. Sowers, who is gay, thought Pioli would disapprove of her lifestyle. \u201cWhat I failed to realize I was grouping him into a box. Here\u2019s this high up NFL executive and how\u2019s he going to react?\u201d Sowers says. \u201cKnowing his heart and his desire to help people was something I never thought could be possible in everything I assumed about that culture.\u201d As Sowers would soon discover, Pioli is the backbone behind a litany of initiatives to foster opportunities for women in the coaching and scouting ranks. And he\u2019s a proven friend to the LGBTQ+ community. Former Patriots offensive lineman Ryan O\u2019Callaghan, who came out in 2017 after his playing career had ended, credits Pioli with crucial support when he privately revealed his sexuality to him in 2011. After getting to know Sowers, Pioli was determined to get her an opportunity. \u201cThere\u2019s a balance between helping someone get a foot in the door and helping someone find a job they\u2019re qualified for,\u201d Pioli said. In 2016 Pioli, then with the Falcons, convinced the coaching staff to grant her a fellowship for minority candidates. Sowers relished the opportunity but was also nervous about whether she\u2019d fit in. That skepticism was instantly squashed. \u201cI was embraced on day one,\u201d Sowers says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have someone in those leadership positions vouching for you. When you gain the respect of the influencers in the room, everyone follows and that was huge.\u201d Sowers had plenty of support in Atlanta, including from the team\u2019s offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan.

      "bodyText": "Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, has pledged to invest $1bn (\u00a3776m) in small businesses in India, despite a growing backlash against the online retailer by the country\u2019s powerful local traders. During a three-day visit to India, where Amazon has its sights set on dominating the burgeoning e-commerce market, Bezos laid out his ambitious plans for Amazon\u2019s investment in India over the next five years, including helping to digitise millions of small businesses. \u201cThis initiative will use Amazon\u2019s global footprint to create $10bn in Indian exports by 2025,\u201d said Bezos, who was speaking at a summit for small businesses in Delhi, organised by Amazon as part of the company\u2019s attempt to woo the country\u2019s powerful retail lobby. He pledged that the funding would impact up to 10m small and medium businesses in India, including manufacturers, resellers, small local shops and brands of all sizes, and \u201chelp Indian businesses grow by selling online worldwide\u201d. However, the pledge by Bezos came against the backdrop of mass protests against Amazon, organised by the country\u2019s powerful retail lobby in 300 cities across India, and after news that the company was being investigated by India\u2019s fair-trading watchdog for violating India\u2019s strict laws around foreign business practices. While the online commerce market in India is already worth about $39bn, and growing by the day, the country is still largely reliant on its 12m independent neighbourhood shops, which account for almost 90% of the country\u2019s retail sales. However, there are growing fears that further opening up the market to Amazon and its competitor Flipkart, owned by the US retail giant Walmart, could put that way of life at risk. As Bezos spoke to the Delhi summit, independent shop owners took to the streets with placards alleging that Amazon was already driving them out of business by drastically undercutting their prices and favouring large retailers. Sumit Agarwal of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which represents 90% of India\u2019s retailers and organised the protests, described Bezos as an \u201ceconomic terrorist\u201d and condemned Amazon for engaging in \u201cpredatory and competitive business which destroys small retailers\u201d. Amazon already has more than 60,000 employees in India and has committed $5.5bn in investment in the country, as well as building a vast new \u201ccampus\u201d in India\u2019s tech hub of Hyderabad to house more than 15,000 employees. However, its ambitions to fiercely dominate the online commerce market have been scuppered by new legislation. In 2018, India introduced laws barring foreign-owned e-commerce businesses from selling their own inventory and requiring them to be neutral marketplaces, forcing companies such as Amazon to only sell third-party goods from independent sellers. As part of their current model in India, Amazon partners with small local businesses, described as \u201cmom-and-pop stores\u201d, and sells their goods for a small commission. However, Amazon has already been accused of violating trade laws in India. On Monday, the Competition Commission of India, the retail regulator, ordered a formal investigation into allegations that Amazon was engaging in unfair trade practices, such as the use of deep discounts and giving preference to select sellers.

      "body": "<p>Automation in the modern world is usually thought of as done by robots or creepily intelligent software, but it is also the way, as this feistily interesting book argues, that bureaucracies composed of human beings increasingly operate. Officials are required to follow recipes (or algorithms) of sorting people into discrete categories and pursuing strictly defined courses of action with no allowance for ambiguity or complexity. They are condemned, if you will, to think inside the box.</p> <p>This is what David Boyle, an economist and former policy wonk for the Liberal Democrats, refers to simply as \u201ctickbox\u201d: what more usually is called \u201ctickbox culture\u201d or, in US English, \u201ccheckbox culture\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Automation in the modern world is usually thought of as done by robots or creepily intelligent software, but it is also the way, as this feistily interesting book argues, that bureaucracies composed of human beings increasingly operate. Officials are required to follow recipes (or algorithms) of sorting people into discrete categories and pursuing strictly defined courses of action with no allowance for ambiguity or complexity. They are condemned, if you will, to think inside the box. This is what David Boyle, an economist and former policy wonk for the Liberal Democrats, refers to simply as \u201ctickbox\u201d: what more usually is called \u201ctickbox culture\u201d or, in US English, \u201ccheckbox culture\u201d. For him it covers not only the targets and key performance indicators of official bureaucracy, but phenomena such as pervasive employee surveillance, the culture war over \u201cidentity politics\u201d, the rise of management consultancy, the fact that you can never get a simple resolution to your problem from a call centre, and why the trains don\u2019t work.

The Labour leadership candidate confirmed her position after comments emerged showing she argued last year against being able to abort on the grounds of disability later than if there is no disability. Long-Bailey was endorsed by Momentum, the leftwing grassroots group founded to support Jeremy Corbyn, as their favoured candidate for the leadership on Thursday, after more than 70% of 7,395 respondents backed her. She is thought to be a frontrunner, along with Keir Starmer, and the organisational support of Momentum is likely to boost her campaign. Her views on abortion came to light after the Red Roar website highlighted an interview she gave to representatives of Salford\u2019s Catholic cathedral during the 2019 election campaign. A spokesman for Long-Bailey, a Catholic, said she \u201cunequivocally supports a woman\u2019s right to choose\u201d and highlighted her vote in favour of extending the right to abortion in Northern Ireland. But she said she believed disability and non-disability should be valued equally, leading her to disagree that abortion on the grounds of disability should be allowed at a later date than abortions for other reasons. Asked by the Catholic cathedral whether she supported \u201cdiscrimination on the grounds of disability\u201d in abortion law, Long-Bailey said: \u201cIt is currently legal to terminate a pregnancy up to full-term on the grounds of disability while the upper limit is 24 weeks if there is no disability. \u201cI personally do not agree with this position and agree with the words of the Disability Rights Commission that \u2018the context in which parents choose whether to have a child should be one in which disability and non-disability are valued equally\u2019.\u201d Elsewhere in the interview, she defended the right of people with anti-abortion views to hold elected office and said she would play a part in ensuring the views of the Catholic church were heard in any Labour consultation on new laws and regulations on abortion. She also wrote about how her Catholic faith motivated her and taught her that \u201cthe only society we should be striving for is one based on love\u201d. \u201cIn those dark times, when I wonder if I am making the right decisions, my faith is often the only thing that keeps me going.

A spokesman for the Long-Bailey campaign said: \u201cRebecca unequivocally supports a woman\u2019s right to choose and has only ever voted in favour of extending the right to abortion, such as in Northern Ireland.\u201d He said her responses had been selectively quoted in news reports \u201cto propagate a misleading narrative\u201d. \u201cRebecca\u2019s response to the Deanery of Salford clarified the existing law and current Labour policy, stating that abortion procedures should be properly regulated, and that women\u2019s reproductive rights and the decriminalisation of abortion should be maintained. \u201cRebecca\u2019s response was also a reflection of her own personal agreement with the Disability Rights Commission \u2013 that \u2018the context in which parents choose whether to have a child should be one in which disability and non-disability are valued equally\u2019 \u2013 rather than her view on policy. \u201cDuring any proposed public consultation a wide range of views would of course be heard, and it is Rebecca\u2019s duty as an MP to ensure her constituents are able to respond.\u201d Following Momentum\u2019s endorsement, the group said it was planning to host hundreds of phone banks across the country and use peer-to-peer calling apps to support Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign.

      "body": "<p>Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel shared a boat from the UK to New York in 1910, as part of Fred Karno\u2019s music hall troupe. Stan later understudied for Charlie \u2013 before they went their separate, and separately legendary, ways. Is that a \u201cstrange tale\u201d? Not really \u2013 it\u2019s just a scrap of biography, a fleeting association about which little is known. But in this silent comedy for the <a href=\"https://mimelondon.com/\">London international mime festival</a>, Told By An Idiot mine it for beguiling oddity, as Chaplin, Laurel and Karno shuttle and pratfall around a transatlantic liner and episodes from their past and future vault into view like salmon from the sea.</p> <p>The effect is less tale, more short stories. It is assembled with minimal rhyme and reason, but with the follow-its-nose logic (and illogic) to which the company\u2019s fans \u2013 myself included \u2013 are well accustomed. Director Paul Hunter valued \u201cfiction over fact [and] fantasy over reality\u201d, the programme tells us \u2013 which explains the central sequence, in which Chaplin accidentally kills his underling with a frying pan and (after the obligatory manhandling-a-corpse slapstick sequence) hurls the hapless Lancastrian overboard.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALqmSkO_S-M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ALqmSkO_S-M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Occasionally, in a show with few spoken words and only a few more projected captions, the thread is hard to follow. But it remains a delight to submerge oneself in the wordless world Hunter and his company weave, powerfully summoning that moment when vaudeville and silent movies meet.

      "bodyText": "Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel shared a boat from the UK to New York in 1910, as part of Fred Karno\u2019s music hall troupe. Stan later understudied for Charlie \u2013 before they went their separate, and separately legendary, ways. Is that a \u201cstrange tale\u201d? Not really \u2013 it\u2019s just a scrap of biography, a fleeting association about which little is known. But in this silent comedy for the London international mime festival, Told By An Idiot mine it for beguiling oddity, as Chaplin, Laurel and Karno shuttle and pratfall around a transatlantic liner and episodes from their past and future vault into view like salmon from the sea. The effect is less tale, more short stories. It is assembled with minimal rhyme and reason, but with the follow-its-nose logic (and illogic) to which the company\u2019s fans \u2013 myself included \u2013 are well accustomed. Director Paul Hunter valued \u201cfiction over fact [and] fantasy over reality\u201d, the programme tells us \u2013 which explains the central sequence, in which Chaplin accidentally kills his underling with a frying pan and (after the obligatory manhandling-a-corpse slapstick sequence) hurls the hapless Lancastrian overboard. Occasionally, in a show with few spoken words and only a few more projected captions, the thread is hard to follow. But it remains a delight to submerge oneself in the wordless world Hunter and his company weave, powerfully summoning that moment when vaudeville and silent movies meet. On Ioana Curelea\u2019s gimcrack multi-platform set \u2013 now a sea vessel, now backstage at the theatre \u2013 it opens strongly, with a madcap embarkation scene involving much business with Karno\u2019s suitcase. (Is it heavy? Is it light?) Soon we flashback to Charlie\u2019s childhood, a Victorian melodrama of threatening bailiffs, drunken dads and woebegone (also drunken) mums.

It\u2019s pulled off with such gentle grace by Vitale, who brings Chaplin \u2013 that odd rolling walk; the knowingly innocent expression \u2013 to uncanny life. She performs with a featherlight touch the various tumbles, scrambles and slaps to the face required \u2013 in which the hand is conspicuously that of the great Jos Houben as \u201cphysical comedy consultant\u201d. Jerone Marsh-Reid is a similarly endearing presence as Laurel, whose gangly physicality contrasts nicely with the pocket-sized Chaplin, on whom he dotes. But wide-eyed naivety is the only expression we see him wear \u2013 and his stories aren\u2019t given prominence.

      "body": "<p>Some of the biggest companies in the world are funding climate misinformation by advertising on YouTube, according to a study from activist group Avaaz.</p> <p>The group found that more than 100 brands had adverts running on YouTube videos on the site that were actively promoting climate misinformation. The brands, including Samsung, L\u2019Oreal and Decathlon, were unaware that their adverts were being played before and during the videos.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not about free speech, this is about the free advertising YouTube is giving to factually inaccurate videos that risk confusing people about one of the biggest crises of our time,\u201d said Julie Deruy, a senior campaigner at the group. \u201cYouTube should not feature, suggest, promote, advertise or lead users to misinformation.\u201d</p> <p>For the report, Avaaz examined videos pushed to users when they search \u201cglobal warming\u201d, \u201cclimate change\u201d, or \u201cclimate manipulation\u201d on the site, focusing particularly on those giving high prominence by YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithms. It found that 16 of the top 100 videos on the first term contained misinformation, as did eight of the videos found under \u201cclimate change\u201d and 21 of those under \u201cclimate manipulation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYouTube has previously taken welcome steps to protect its users from anti-vaccine and conspiracy theories,\u201d Avaaz argued, \u201cbut has not acted with equal force against broader misinformation and disinformation content, including climate misinformation.\u201d</p> <p>The group called on YouTube to implement new policies to prevent the further spread of climate misinformation on its platform. It said the site should:</p> <ul> <li><p>Include climate misinformation in its \u201cborderline content\u201d policy, which limits the algorithmic distribution of videos that do not reach the bar required to fully remove them from the site.</p></li> <li><p>Demonetise misinformation, \u201censuring such content does not include advertising and is not financially incentivised. YouTube should start immediately with the option for advertisers to exclude their ads from videos with climate misinformation.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>Work with independent fact-checkers to inform users who have seen or interacted with verifiably false or misleading information.</p></li> <li><p>Provide transparency to researchers by releasing data showing how many views are driven to misinformation by its own recommendation algorithms.</p></li> </ul> <p>In a statement, YouTube said Avaaz\u2019s report had its own transparency problems. \u201cWe can\u2019t speak to Avaaz\u2019s methodology or results, and our recommendations systems are not designed to filter or demote videos or channels based on specific perspectives. YouTube has strict ad policies that govern where ads are allowed to appear and we give advertisers tools to opt out of content that doesn\u2019t align with their brand. We\u2019ve also significantly invested in reducing recommendations of borderline content and harmful misinformation, and raising up authoritative voices on YouTube.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2019 alone, the consumption on authoritative news publishers\u2019 channels grew by 60%. As our systems appear to have done in the majority of cases in this report, we prioritise authoritative voices for millions of news and information queries, and surface information panels on topics prone to misinformation \u2013 including climate change \u2013 to provide users with context alongside their content. We continue to expand these efforts to more topics and countries.\u201d</p> <p>A L\u2019Or\u00e9al spokeswoman said: \u201cThe information promoted by these videos is in direct contradiction with L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s commitments and the work we have been carrying out for many years to protect the environment. We are collaborating with YouTube teams asking them to use all the technological means at their disposal to better inform the platform\u2019s users about the nature of these videos and to limit their impact.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Some of the biggest companies in the world are funding climate misinformation by advertising on YouTube, according to a study from activist group Avaaz. The group found that more than 100 brands had adverts running on YouTube videos on the site that were actively promoting climate misinformation. The brands, including Samsung, L\u2019Oreal and Decathlon, were unaware that their adverts were being played before and during the videos. \u201cThis is not about free speech, this is about the free advertising YouTube is giving to factually inaccurate videos that risk confusing people about one of the biggest crises of our time,\u201d said Julie Deruy, a senior campaigner at the group. \u201cYouTube should not feature, suggest, promote, advertise or lead users to misinformation.\u201d For the report, Avaaz examined videos pushed to users when they search \u201cglobal warming\u201d, \u201cclimate change\u201d, or \u201cclimate manipulation\u201d on the site, focusing particularly on those giving high prominence by YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithms. It found that 16 of the top 100 videos on the first term contained misinformation, as did eight of the videos found under \u201cclimate change\u201d and 21 of those under \u201cclimate manipulation\u201d. \u201cYouTube has previously taken welcome steps to protect its users from anti-vaccine and conspiracy theories,\u201d Avaaz argued, \u201cbut has not acted with equal force against broader misinformation and disinformation content, including climate misinformation.\u201d The group called on YouTube to implement new policies to prevent the further spread of climate misinformation on its platform. It said the site should: Include climate misinformation in its \u201cborderline content\u201d policy, which limits the algorithmic distribution of videos that do not reach the bar required to fully remove them from the site. Demonetise misinformation, \u201censuring such content does not include advertising and is not financially incentivised. YouTube should start immediately with the option for advertisers to exclude their ads from videos with climate misinformation.\u201d Work with independent fact-checkers to inform users who have seen or interacted with verifiably false or misleading information. Provide transparency to researchers by releasing data showing how many views are driven to misinformation by its own recommendation algorithms. In a statement, YouTube said Avaaz\u2019s report had its own transparency problems. \u201cWe can\u2019t speak to Avaaz\u2019s methodology or results, and our recommendations systems are not designed to filter or demote videos or channels based on specific perspectives. YouTube has strict ad policies that govern where ads are allowed to appear and we give advertisers tools to opt out of content that doesn\u2019t align with their brand. We\u2019ve also significantly invested in reducing recommendations of borderline content and harmful misinformation, and raising up authoritative voices on YouTube. \u201cIn 2019 alone, the consumption on authoritative news publishers\u2019 channels grew by 60%. As our systems appear to have done in the majority of cases in this report, we prioritise authoritative voices for millions of news and information queries, and surface information panels on topics prone to misinformation \u2013 including climate change \u2013 to provide users with context alongside their content. We continue to expand these efforts to more topics and countries.\u201d A L\u2019Or\u00e9al spokeswoman said: \u201cThe information promoted by these videos is in direct contradiction with L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s commitments and the work we have been carrying out for many years to protect the environment. We are collaborating with YouTube teams asking them to use all the technological means at their disposal to better inform the platform\u2019s users about the nature of these videos and to limit their impact.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Russian opposition figures have raised questions about how Vladimir Putin\u2019s surprise choice for new prime minister has acquired millions of dollars in property, as the State Duma hurriedly confirmed Russia\u2019s first new premier since 2012. The Russian president\u2019s allies have rushed to support Mikhail Mishustin, the former head of Russia\u2019s tax service, who claimed to have been stunned and \u201cnot [to have] slept all night\u201d after Putin named him as the replacement for Dmitry Medvedev. Supporters have praised Mishustin\u2019s credentials as a technocrat and a \u201cself-made man\u201d. State television also boasted of Mishustin\u2019s accomplishments in modernising Russia\u2019s tax collection system, calling it \u201cthe best system in the world\u201d. Mishustin was confirmed by parliament on Thursday. No MPs in the State Duma voted against his candidacy, although Communist lawmakers abstained from the vote. Speaking before parliament, Mishustin said he wanted to \u201crestore trust\u201d with businesses, and he focused on social concerns, saying \u201cpeople should already now be feeling real changes for the better\u201d. Mishustin\u2019s appointment is part of a sweeping reorganisation of the government that will help enable Putin to maintain power after his expected exit from the presidency in 2024 under term limits. Analysts said Mishustin may play a role as a \u201ccaretaker\u201d figure but was unlikely to be Putin\u2019s long-term successor. Opponents of Putin have begun digging into Mishustin\u2019s record. Shortly after his nomination, the investigative site Proekt reported, state property registers began hiding Mishustin\u2019s name in connection with a house in Moscow\u2019s fashionable Rublyovka suburb as well an apartment in central Moscow. Proekt estimated the value of the properties at nearly $10m (\u00a37.6m). The owner is now listed as the Russian government, common for properties denoted as secret. Researchers for Alexei Navalny, the opposition politician and anti-corruption researcher, noted that Mishustin\u2019s wife had earned nearly 790m rubles (nearly \u00a310m) in the past nine years, according to government declarations. Little was known about her business, the investigative group said. \u201cMishustin has been a \u2018servant of the people\u2019 for 20 of the past 22 years,\u201d Navalny wrote in the investigation. \u201cSo why is he so damn rich?\u201d Corruption scandals hounded Medvedev in recent years, helping to spark protests by young Muscovites in 2017. The Kremlin hopes that Mishustin\u2019s record as a technocrat will protect him from similar attacks. Strict laws limit the official earnings of Russian government officials, but less so their families. Mishustin served as the head of the Russian investment company UFG from 2008-10 and as the laboratory head for a non-profit in the early 1990s. He first joined the tax service in 1998 and was appointed its head in 2010. Allies of Putin, including those considered his potential successor, also fell in behind Mishustin.

Getting there has been an extraordinary achievement and not only because their last tie involved the amateur side making an 11,000 mile (18,000km) round trip.</p> <p>Saint-Pierroise play in the R\u00e9union Premier League, a level comparable to the sixth tier of France\u2019s regionally divided football pyramid. They gained entry to this season\u2019s Coupe de France by winning the Coupe R\u00e9gionale de France (thereby completing a treble, having also won their local cup and league). That earned them an away tie in November against Jura Sud, a fourth-tier club in eastern France. The Storks \u2013 as Saint-Pierroise are nicknamed \u2013 won 1-0 thanks to a magnificent volleyed goal by Jean-Michel Fontaine, who fans of Fleetwood Town may or may not remember as a forward released after making three appearances in 2013.</p> <p>Next up for the islanders was a home tie against fifth-tier ES Thaon in front of more than 6,000 fans, who rejoiced when the hosts took an early lead. But then Saint-Pierroise had a man sent off and conceded a last-minute equaliser. Their resolve was severely tested. But they prevailed in a penalty shootout to reach the last 64 of the Coupe de France for the first time. Very few people expected them to go any farther when the draw handed them an away tie against Niort, a team from four tiers higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"14fe26e511ddd5003607cfc4fd0aba438a280bf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14fe26e511ddd5003607cfc4fd0aba438a280bf3/0_0_4958_3364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saint-Pierroise play in the R\u00e9union Premier League, a level comparable to the sixth tier of France\u2019s regionally divided football pyramid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saint-Pierroise play in the R\u00e9union Premier League, a level comparable to the sixth tier of France\u2019s regionally divided football pyramid</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Bouhet/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Saint-Pierroise sprung a huge shock by beating their Ligue 2 hosts 2-1. \u201cAt the final whistle I felt tears in my eyes,\u201d Fontaine said. \u201cWhat we are doing is truly crazy.\u201d And yet it was a deserved victory for the side managed by Christian Dafreville, a R\u00e9union-born former defender whose brief playing career in France amounted to eight appearances for Saint-\u00c9tienne in the 1980s. His team showed themselves to be cleverly organised and supremely determined and benefited from splashes of quality from the Madagascar international defender Pascal Razakanantenaina, the former Blackpool midfielder Elliot Grandin and the 21-year-old striker Ryan Ponti, who scored the winning goal and said he hopes this cup run will act as a springboard to a professional career.</p> <p>By the time Saint-Pierroise completed their 11-hour flight back home Niort\u2019s manager had been sacked and the draw for the next round had been made. At the same stage in 1989 Le Geldar, the team from French Guaiana, were pitted against a Nantes side featuring budding young stars such as Marcel Desailly and Didier Deschamps. They were crushed 11-0 (on aggregate, ties being two legs back then).</p> <p>Saint-Pierroise, by contrast, will face \u00c9pinal, a club 35 miles south of Nancy who are only the two tiers higher than them but boast a daunting home record.</p> <p>\u201cFrankly we\u2019re a bit disappointed,\u201d said Dafreville. \u201cWe would have liked to get a top\u2011flight team and finish our run like that ... On the other hand this draw leaves us with hope of progressing. But to do that we will have to prepare very well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Sunday Saint-Pierroise flew back to Paris to begin their preparations, then took a five-hour coach trip to their training base before, on Wednesday, drawing 2-2 in a friendly against Nancy\u2019s reserves. Meanwhile, R\u00e9union natives have been clamouring for tickets for Saturday\u2019s big game and expressed their dismay that \u00c9pinal gave the club only the mandatory 10% allocation for a ground with a capacity of 3,500.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been a bit taken aback by the level of demand,\u201d admitted an official from \u00c9pinal, who said anyone wishing to support Saint-Pierroise could buy tickets on general sale.</p> <p>So on Saturday, despite being 9,000km away and in an entirely different climate zone, the team from the Indian Ocean will at least feel a little bit at home as they try to break more new ground.</p>",

The former Liverpool attacker Florent Sinama\u2011Pongolle also began there and went back to play for them last year at the age of 34 before cutting short his stay in order to take up a punditry gig with French TV. But now all eyes are on Saint-Pierroise thanks to the exploits of the whole team, who have made history in this season\u2019s Coupe de France. On Saturday Saint-Pierroise will compete in the last 32 of France\u2019s most prestigious cup competition for the first time, becoming only the second club from a French overseas territory to reach that stage, following Le Geldar of French Guiana in 1989. Getting there has been an extraordinary achievement and not only because their last tie involved the amateur side making an 11,000 mile (18,000km) round trip. Saint-Pierroise play in the R\u00e9union Premier League, a level comparable to the sixth tier of France\u2019s regionally divided football pyramid. They gained entry to this season\u2019s Coupe de France by winning the Coupe R\u00e9gionale de France (thereby completing a treble, having also won their local cup and league). That earned them an away tie in November against Jura Sud, a fourth-tier club in eastern France. The Storks \u2013 as Saint-Pierroise are nicknamed \u2013 won 1-0 thanks to a magnificent volleyed goal by Jean-Michel Fontaine, who fans of Fleetwood Town may or may not remember as a forward released after making three appearances in 2013. Next up for the islanders was a home tie against fifth-tier ES Thaon in front of more than 6,000 fans, who rejoiced when the hosts took an early lead. But then Saint-Pierroise had a man sent off and conceded a last-minute equaliser. Their resolve was severely tested. But they prevailed in a penalty shootout to reach the last 64 of the Coupe de France for the first time. Very few people expected them to go any farther when the draw handed them an away tie against Niort, a team from four tiers higher. But Saint-Pierroise sprung a huge shock by beating their Ligue 2 hosts 2-1. \u201cAt the final whistle I felt tears in my eyes,\u201d Fontaine said. \u201cWhat we are doing is truly crazy.\u201d And yet it was a deserved victory for the side managed by Christian Dafreville, a R\u00e9union-born former defender whose brief playing career in France amounted to eight appearances for Saint-\u00c9tienne in the 1980s. His team showed themselves to be cleverly organised and supremely determined and benefited from splashes of quality from the Madagascar international defender Pascal Razakanantenaina, the former Blackpool midfielder Elliot Grandin and the 21-year-old striker Ryan Ponti, who scored the winning goal and said he hopes this cup run will act as a springboard to a professional career. By the time Saint-Pierroise completed their 11-hour flight back home Niort\u2019s manager had been sacked and the draw for the next round had been made. At the same stage in 1989 Le Geldar, the team from French Guaiana, were pitted against a Nantes side featuring budding young stars such as Marcel Desailly and Didier Deschamps. They were crushed 11-0 (on aggregate, ties being two legs back then). Saint-Pierroise, by contrast, will face \u00c9pinal, a club 35 miles south of Nancy who are only the two tiers higher than them but boast a daunting home record. \u201cFrankly we\u2019re a bit disappointed,\u201d said Dafreville. \u201cWe would have liked to get a top\u2011flight team and finish our run like that ... On the other hand this draw leaves us with hope of progressing. But to do that we will have to prepare very well.\u201d On Sunday Saint-Pierroise flew back to Paris to begin their preparations, then took a five-hour coach trip to their training base before, on Wednesday, drawing 2-2 in a friendly against Nancy\u2019s reserves. Meanwhile, R\u00e9union natives have been clamouring for tickets for Saturday\u2019s big game and expressed their dismay that \u00c9pinal gave the club only the mandatory 10% allocation for a ground with a capacity of 3,500. \u201cWe have been a bit taken aback by the level of demand,\u201d admitted an official from \u00c9pinal, who said anyone wishing to support Saint-Pierroise could buy tickets on general sale. So on Saturday, despite being 9,000km away and in an entirely different climate zone, the team from the Indian Ocean will at least feel a little bit at home as they try to break more new ground.",

The data comes a day after the European parliament raised concerns that EU citizens risked discrimination after Brexit in seeking housing and employment. Home Office statistics for December show that just over 2.7 million EU citizens and their family members have applied for settled status, a special immigration category set up for nationals from member states. The figures underline a huge take-up of the scheme, which was launched nationally in March 2019, but also show the scale of the task that still lies ahead for the Home Office. Although there is no official data on how many EU citizens live in the UK, it is estimated to be between 3 million and 3.6 million. The Liberal Democrats said the figures raised concerns as they showed \u201cmore than 1 million EU citizens have now been given the weaker pre-settled status\u201d which is allocated to those who have been in the UK less than five years. Lawyers have raised concerns that the Home Office may be issuing pre-settled status by default to some citizens who do not, at first glance, seem to qualify for settled status.

He said of EU citizens in the UK: \u201cThe UK is their home and the EU settlement scheme has already granted status to 2.5 million people so they can stay. \u201cWe have done more than other EU member states to support EU citizens and it\u2019s time other countries made the same generous offer to the million UK nationals who live among them.\u201d EU nationals have until June next year to apply to the Home Office for settled status (SS). According to the data, just over 300,000 of the 2,756,100 people who applied for settled status, are still waiting for a conclusion from the Home Office.

The confusion, he claimed, arose from the existence of different metrics to measure air quality.</p> \n<p>He said the tournament had engaged a wide range of respected opinion, under the direction of the Environmental Protection Authority and with the guidance of the Australian Institute of Sport.</p> \n<p>\u201cAir quality is a very complex and confusing issue,\u201d Tiley said. \u201cIt\u2019s made more complex and is more confusing by going on an app, because there are different apps and websites that will give you different readings.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through the journey on extreme heat and we know when players respond to extreme heat, it\u2019s in many different ways. We\u2019ve had conditions where players have pulled out of matches. I do think air quality for sport and for tennis is a conversation we\u2019re going to have more of in the future. It is potentially the new normal.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done the best we can in communicating with the [men\u2019s and women\u2019s] tours. One thing I can say is this is about trusting the medical advice and the scientific advice. We care deeply about the players. I met with Dalila the same day, we\u2019re going to have a follow-up catch-up tomorrow and just reiterate if there\u2019s anything we can do and making sure she\u2019s seeing the medical team and making sure she\u2019s being taken care of.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/15/sport-climate-crisis-australian-open-roger-federer-olympic-games\">Sport and the climate crisis: time for the travelling circus to just stay put | Marina Hyde</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cAbsolutely we understand the anger. We\u2019ve invited the players to come in at any time and have a conversation. Our medical team were satisfied with the condition in which the players were competing as per all the research and the data and the science they have, but they also make an assessment. You could have been two hours into those matches and 25 people presenting themselves with a medical condition that may be related to the pollutants. If that\u2019s the case, inform me, we stop.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tiley is adamant the tournament will start on time on Monday, and will finish on time on Sunday 2 February. \u201cWe have three environments in which we can complete it,\u201d he said, referring to the roof cover available on Rod Laver, Margaret Court and Melbourne Arena. \u201cIt may look differently, but the tournament will happen.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cbd88ee5-4b0d-4f66-a0cd-f501970ea3d9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n

      "bodyText": "The troubled 2020 Australian Open will start and finish on time, even if matches have to be moved from the exposed outside courts to under the cover of the three main stadiums to escape the choking effects of bushfire-polluted air, according to the tournament director, Craig Tiley. Responding on Thursday to concerns raised by several players who have suffered with respiratory problems during qualifying matches this week, Tiley said: \u201cThere is a lot of speculation about the Australian Open not happening. The Australian Open is happening.\u201d Tiley, who is also the chief executive of Tennis Australia and one of the sport\u2019s most influential powerbrokers, was coming to the conversation after it hit crisis level, as one player collapsed on court on day one of qualifying and others, including Britain\u2019s Liam Broady, complained loudly their health was being compromised playing in conditions that were perceived as a threat to other sections of the public. \u201cThe more I think about the conditions we played in a few days ago, the more it boils my blood,\u201d Broady wrote on social media. \u201cOn tour we let so many things go that aren\u2019t right but, at some point, we have to make a stand. All players need protection, not just a select few.\u201d The Canadians Eugenie Bouchard and Brayden Schnur were similarly vocal. Schnur, who experienced \u201csuper dryness\u201d in his throat while playing on Wednesday, said Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal should do more to protect the interests of lower-ranked players. \u201cIt\u2019s got to come from the top guys,\u201d he said. \u201cRoger and Rafa are a little bit selfish in thinking about themselves and their careers.\u201d Nicolas Mahut, the marathon man of Wimbledon legend, posted a photo of himself on Instagram wearing a mask, captioned: \u201cReady for my first round.\u201d Vasek Pospisil, another outspoken Canadian, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for a players\u2019 union. This is getting absurd.\u201d That will resonate with a lot of players, chief among them Pospisil\u2019s political ally Novak Djokovic, whose heartfelt wish as president of the ATP players\u2019 council it has been for a long time. Others to suffer and speak out have included the Slovenian Dalila Jakupovic, who collapsed and quit after an uncontrollable coughing fit, and Dustin Brown, who received medical treatment and said the courtside doctor told him he had \u201ca virus coming on\u201d. Brown, who once inquired about playing Davis Cup for Great Britain, commented on Twitter: \u201cIn 35 years it\u2019s the first time I had to use an asthma spray to help me breathe better.\u201d Black humour, anger and frustration aside, Tiley said he understood the players\u2019 concerns and had met several of them, as well as their board representatives. The confusion, he claimed, arose from the existence of different metrics to measure air quality. He said the tournament had engaged a wide range of respected opinion, under the direction of the Environmental Protection Authority and with the guidance of the Australian Institute of Sport. \u201cAir quality is a very complex and confusing issue,\u201d Tiley said. \u201cIt\u2019s made more complex and is more confusing by going on an app, because there are different apps and websites that will give you different readings. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through the journey on extreme heat and we know when players respond to extreme heat, it\u2019s in many different ways. We\u2019ve had conditions where players have pulled out of matches. I do think air quality for sport and for tennis is a conversation we\u2019re going to have more of in the future. It is potentially the new normal. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the best we can in communicating with the [men\u2019s and women\u2019s] tours. One thing I can say is this is about trusting the medical advice and the scientific advice. We care deeply about the players. I met with Dalila the same day, we\u2019re going to have a follow-up catch-up tomorrow and just reiterate if there\u2019s anything we can do and making sure she\u2019s seeing the medical team and making sure she\u2019s being taken care of. \u201cAbsolutely we understand the anger. We\u2019ve invited the players to come in at any time and have a conversation. Our medical team were satisfied with the condition in which the players were competing as per all the research and the data and the science they have, but they also make an assessment. You could have been two hours into those matches and 25 people presenting themselves with a medical condition that may be related to the pollutants. If that\u2019s the case, inform me, we stop.\u201d Tiley is adamant the tournament will start on time on Monday, and will finish on time on Sunday 2 February. \u201cWe have three environments in which we can complete it,\u201d he said, referring to the roof cover available on Rod Laver, Margaret Court and Melbourne Arena. \u201cIt may look differently, but the tournament will happen.\u201d On the prospect of moving players from scheduled matches on the uncovered outside courts, he said: \u201cIf we had to work it out, we would. And we don\u2019t expect that to happen because we as yet haven\u2019t seen anywhere else in the world where there has been above that [danger level] 200 on the PM2.5 concentrate [metric] consecutively over two weeks.\u201d As reassuring as these promises appear, there will be lingering worries among players, as well as the parents and families of young ball kids, and the officials. The perception outside the Melbourne bubble remains sceptical and worried. Speaking before Tiley\u2019s latest explanation but after talking to him on ESPN.com, John McEnroe said: \u201cThis is a terrible situation down there, and I firmly believe they\u2019re worried about the fans and the players.

He was 30 lengths clear with a circuit to run and though Fearless Warrior closed to within six lengths at the line, the third horse home was still 16 lengths behind the winner.</p> \n<p>At the inevitable stewards\u2019 inquiry, all nine of the beaten jockeys were asked to explain themselves and \u201cindicated that they considered the early pace was very quick and not sustainable, therefore feeling that the leader would weak and come back to them in the latter stages\u201d, although Sean Davis and Tom Greatrex did express \u201csome concern\u201d that Wanaasah \u201cwas getting a mid-race breather whilst maintaining its lead\u201d.</p> \n<p>The jockeys also \u201cstated they had asked their respective mounts for a finishing effort in the back straight and \u2026 all were of the opinion that no horse would\u2019ve finished any closer, had they been asked to quicken from further out.\u201d</p> \n<p>The last point is the one where many punters may beg to differ, and the explanations were noted \u2013 rather than accepted \u2013 by the stewards, pending routine analysis of the betting patterns on the race by the British Horseracing Authority. Contrary to some reports, this is not \u2013 as yet \u2013 a formal investigation, and seems most likely to conclude that there was nothing more going on here than a wholesale brain-fade by the beaten jockeys.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That, though, is not an excuse and it is difficult to see how at least eight of the riders \u2013 Dobie being the possible exception \u2013 can escape retrospective bans under the rule that covers \u201casking for an effort or making some other permissible manoeuvre too late as a result of serious misjudgement or inattention\u201d.

He was 30 lengths clear with a circuit to run and though Fearless Warrior closed to within six lengths at the line, the third horse home was still 16 lengths behind the winner. At the inevitable stewards\u2019 inquiry, all nine of the beaten jockeys were asked to explain themselves and \u201cindicated that they considered the early pace was very quick and not sustainable, therefore feeling that the leader would weak and come back to them in the latter stages\u201d, although Sean Davis and Tom Greatrex did express \u201csome concern\u201d that Wanaasah \u201cwas getting a mid-race breather whilst maintaining its lead\u201d. The jockeys also \u201cstated they had asked their respective mounts for a finishing effort in the back straight and \u2026 all were of the opinion that no horse would\u2019ve finished any closer, had they been asked to quicken from further out.\u201d The last point is the one where many punters may beg to differ, and the explanations were noted \u2013 rather than accepted \u2013 by the stewards, pending routine analysis of the betting patterns on the race by the British Horseracing Authority. Contrary to some reports, this is not \u2013 as yet \u2013 a formal investigation, and seems most likely to conclude that there was nothing more going on here than a wholesale brain-fade by the beaten jockeys. That, though, is not an excuse and it is difficult to see how at least eight of the riders \u2013 Dobie being the possible exception \u2013 can escape retrospective bans under the rule that covers \u201casking for an effort or making some other permissible manoeuvre too late as a result of serious misjudgement or inattention\u201d. Rules are rules, after all, but in the end, it seems more likely that their public embarrassment on Wednesday will do more to deter any repeat performance in future than the 10-day \u201centry point\u201d ban. Today\u2019s action is down to just three meetings after Wincanton succumbed to waterlogging following an inspection this morning, and Zolfo (2.10) is well worth a bet at around 4-1 to complete a four-timer on the card at Market Rasen. He stopped the clock in a very decent time when bringing up his hat-trick at the same course last time and is only 5lb higher today. Willie Mullins breaks new ground with his first runner at the track in the Listed Alan Swinbank Mares\u2019 bumper and the punters, not surprisingly, have taken the hint but 15-8 is very short for a horse with no form under Rules and Midnight Callisto (2.45) will be a live runner at around 10-1 if she can recapture the form of her win at Fontwell in November. At Its Own Expense (2.20) and Subway Surf (2.55) should both go well at Ludlow, while the veteran Foxy Forever (5.30) is fairly priced at around 7-1 at Newcastle.",

A moody evocation of riot brewing on the south London streets sits alongside a love song to the National Health Service, which saved the life of his own prematurely born son.</p> <p>It was the arrival of this baby \u2013 \u201cjust the 1kg of him / all big head, bulging eyes and blue veins\u201d \u2013 that prompted both his acceptance that he was here to stay, and his investigation of the possibility that paradise might be portable. \u201cI thought I\u2019d look at the utopian idea of paradise, which is so important in this country, and then it began to mean a lot of different things \u2013 hope for my son, and the paradise that was denied to the people of Grenfell who had come looking to build theirs here and died because they weren\u2019t in a position to do so,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7c33a8e0d63790af0148c0e48cec9390d74b1164\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c33a8e0d63790af0148c0e48cec9390d74b1164/0_0_328_499/328.jpg\" alt=\"A Portable Paradise\" width=\"328\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A musician and cultural activist as well as a poet, Robinson is no stranger to public interventions. In 2018, he launched a Twitter appeal for 100 poems protesting about the mistreatment of the Windrush generation. He also recorded an eight-minute music track for BBC Radio 3, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06b5f5r\" title=\"\">Survivor (For the Grenfell</a></em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06b5f5r\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06b5f5r\" title=\"\">Survivors)</a></em>. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in tower blocks so I know what it\u2019s like to live there and the community who do,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not all immigrants and not all poor, but they\u2019re all trying to build a better life and get out of there. It wasn\u2019t that I was poor, I just didn\u2019t have lots of housing opportunities. So when Grenfell happened I felt it viscerally.\u201d</p> <p>Robinson\u2019s own relationship with England doesn\u2019t follow an obvious narrative. Now 52, he was born to Trinidadian parents in the east London borough of Hackney \u201cdue to the system of opportunistic parents who always had a plan for you to go to university here\u201d, he chuckles. When he was three years old, they returned to Trinidad, where his father became a PR executive for an oil company \u2013 \u201cone of the first black men to rise that high\u201d \u2013 and his mother worked as a nurse. His father encouraged him with comic book versions of the classics, while his mother is \u201can incredible storyteller. To a certain extent my poetry came out of her storytelling at the dinner table.\u201d</p> <p>He went to one of Trinidad\u2019s top schools, where expectations were high and his teachers included the playwright and later government minister Ralph Maraj. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to make a living as an artist in Trinidad because it\u2019s so small, so a lot of the teachers were artists who had returned from studying abroad.\u201d At 19 he returned to the UK, initially to live with his grandmother in Ilford, Essex. \u201cNow that was a real culture shock.

      "bodyText": "\u201cSince I was 19 I\u2019ve been living in England and thinking I\u2019d go home, but there was a point, around six years go, when I realised I\u2019m here now: I\u2019m black British.\u201d So says Roger Robinson, who this week won the TS Eliot prize for A Portable Paradise, a poetry collection born of this realisation. Furious laments for the victims of Grenfell Tower are followed by a crisp snapshot of idealistic young Jamaicans disembarking from the Empire Windrush in 1948, and a didactic sequence about the legacy of slavery today. A moody evocation of riot brewing on the south London streets sits alongside a love song to the National Health Service, which saved the life of his own prematurely born son. It was the arrival of this baby \u2013 \u201cjust the 1kg of him / all big head, bulging eyes and blue veins\u201d \u2013 that prompted both his acceptance that he was here to stay, and his investigation of the possibility that paradise might be portable. \u201cI thought I\u2019d look at the utopian idea of paradise, which is so important in this country, and then it began to mean a lot of different things \u2013 hope for my son, and the paradise that was denied to the people of Grenfell who had come looking to build theirs here and died because they weren\u2019t in a position to do so,\u201d he says. A musician and cultural activist as well as a poet, Robinson is no stranger to public interventions. In 2018, he launched a Twitter appeal for 100 poems protesting about the mistreatment of the Windrush generation. He also recorded an eight-minute music track for BBC Radio 3, Survivor (For the Grenfell Survivors). \u201cI\u2019ve lived in tower blocks so I know what it\u2019s like to live there and the community who do,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not all immigrants and not all poor, but they\u2019re all trying to build a better life and get out of there. It wasn\u2019t that I was poor, I just didn\u2019t have lots of housing opportunities. So when Grenfell happened I felt it viscerally.\u201d Robinson\u2019s own relationship with England doesn\u2019t follow an obvious narrative. Now 52, he was born to Trinidadian parents in the east London borough of Hackney \u201cdue to the system of opportunistic parents who always had a plan for you to go to university here\u201d, he chuckles. When he was three years old, they returned to Trinidad, where his father became a PR executive for an oil company \u2013 \u201cone of the first black men to rise that high\u201d \u2013 and his mother worked as a nurse. His father encouraged him with comic book versions of the classics, while his mother is \u201can incredible storyteller. To a certain extent my poetry came out of her storytelling at the dinner table.\u201d He went to one of Trinidad\u2019s top schools, where expectations were high and his teachers included the playwright and later government minister Ralph Maraj. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to make a living as an artist in Trinidad because it\u2019s so small, so a lot of the teachers were artists who had returned from studying abroad.\u201d At 19 he returned to the UK, initially to live with his grandmother in Ilford, Essex. \u201cNow that was a real culture shock. I couldn\u2019t feel at home there.\u201d He soon found that Brixton was more congenial, forming a bond with the south London district that remains strong, even since he has forsaken its tower blocks for a three-bedroom house in Northampton, where he lives with his wife and their six-year-old son. \u201cBeware these hot nights in Brixton,\u201d opens one observational poem, which is charged with the threat of urban unrest. \u201cAshes to Fire\u201d was partly inspired by a night in 2011 when Robinson was dropped off in Brixton on his way home from a gig just as the London riots were starting. In a collection notable for its tonal and generic variety, this poem stands at one extreme \u2013 a thrumming reminder that he started out as a dub poet, and that dub \u201cis the poetry of working-class suffering and protest\u201d. He has also released five albums, and is the lead vocalist for his band, King Midas Sound, for which \u2013 surprisingly, given his rich bass speaking voice \u2013 he often sings in a high tenor that spills into falsetto. He began to make his name on the London poetry scene in the 1990s, eking out a living by doing workshops in London schools. \u201cIt was a time when many schools were thinking about role modelling,\u201d he says. \u201cI was trying to convince kids \u2013 mostly young black boys who were not doing well at school \u2013 that poetry could touch their lives and reading could be useful to them.\u201d He looks momentarily bashful behind his grizzled beard then adds, \u201cI dress relatively decently now but I used to be a bit more urban swaggering.\u201d His belief in mentoring was rooted in his own experience. \u201cI have had many mentors and one of them was [Booker prize-winner and poet] Bernardine Evaristo , who said: \u2018You\u2019ve got talent but you need to hone your craft.\u2019\u201d By his mid 20s he knew that he wanted to be an artist, and that if he was going to succeed he would have to live frugally. \u201cMy mentors taught me that if you control your economics you can control your output.\u201d Evaristo was working for the writers\u2019 support agency Spread the Word and, crucially, offered him the chance to attend free workshops, which he snapped up.

It\u2019s about American football, but it isn\u2019t <em>about</em> American football. It\u2019s about young people from troubled backgrounds trying to put their pasts behind them to achieve something incredible. When it works, it\u2019s thrilling. When it doesn\u2019t work \u2013 and it often doesn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s like watching a Shakespearean tragedy. All four seasons have been tremendous.</p> <p>But what\u2019s becoming apparent now is that it was no fluke. Cheer replicates \u2013 even improves upon \u2013 the thrill of Last Chance U. It\u2019s perfect. We\u2019re 16 days into January, and it\u2019s impossible to imagine that anyone else will make a documentary series as good this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41474b6483c19d145f5020d4194a10622cf0d21f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41474b6483c19d145f5020d4194a10622cf0d21f/0_0_3375_2025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watch in fear as they fly into the air like ragdolls ...

Cheer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rather than rah-rahing at the side of football matches, the subjects of Cheer take part in competitive cheerleading, which is arguably the most nerve-racking thing a person could ever watch. It\u2019s a cross between high-level gymnastics and circus performing, with cheerleaders being flung metres into the air like rag dolls. Every time \u2013 every single time \u2013 they fell earthwards during the series, my sphincter clenched with fear. With good reason, because sometimes they land with a sickening crunch and end up horribly injured, but nevertheless that\u2019s a lot of clenching.</p> <p>In time-honoured Last Chance U tradition, Cheer follows one high-ranking team \u2013 that of Navarro college in Texas \u2013 as they prepare for a nationwide competition. We see the agony of not being picked, the gruel of training, we learn the tragic backstories of some of the subjects and we become fully invested in the team as an entity.</p> <p>What Cheer lacks, arguably to its advantage, is the dark heart of Last Chance U. That show was underpinned by its two toxic head coaches, Buddy Stephens and Jason Brown. They were screaming, furious, too-masculine figures who tore about like a pair of sentient heart attacks destroying as much as they created. But Cheer\u2019s head coach is Monica Aldama, who is a much more reassuring presence. Make no mistake, Aldama has a cruel streak \u2013 in one episode, she deliberately pushes a cheerleader to the brink of injury for defying her \u2013 but she proves time and time again that she isn\u2019t like Stephens or Brown. She truly seems to care about the squad as people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2838ccf215d3d4c0b2b4268a0a0b4e5fd2c55f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2838ccf215d3d4c0b2b4268a0a0b4e5fd2c55f4/154_0_3375_2025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inevitably, things go south a lot ... Cheer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inevitably, things go south a lot ... Cheer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This essential positivity bleeds through Cheer. Unlike many of the Last Chance U subjects, who have long since buried themselves under layers of machismo, the Cheer subjects are open and eloquent about their feelings. They pull together in times of trouble, and they\u2019re ready to talk it out when things start to go south.</p> <p>Inevitably, they go south a lot. My pet theory about Whiteley documentaries is that, deep down, they\u2019re all about parents. Last Chance U was about the moment you realise that a parental figure is mistreating you. Cheer is even more explicit. It seems like nobody at Navarro had a decent upbringing. Some have parents who are disinterested or out of their depth. Some are overbearing. Some are outright absent. All these people have broken families, and we watch as they discover that the cheer team represents an opportunity for them to build one of their own. It is an incredibly touching thing to witness.</p> <p>And, of course, it\u2019s deliberate. Whiteley has an uncanny gift for knowing exactly when to drop a backstory into an episode to recalibrate our assumptions or explain a behavioural tic. He\u2019s also able to structure the raw material of his footage into something that feels like a movie. When a catcher slips and a cheerleader smashes her head into the ground, we know objectively that it\u2019s just a random accident. Whiteley\u2019s gift is that he makes it seem inevitable, like it was always going to be a major plot point from the very beginning. I have no idea how he does it. It\u2019s like a magic trick.</p> <p>So Last Chance U was no fluke. Cheer has proved that this is just the level Whiteley works at. If you haven\u2019t seen Cheer, fix that immediately. If you have, you should wait with bated breath to see what Whiteley does next. I know that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.</p>",

When it doesn\u2019t work \u2013 and it often doesn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s like watching a Shakespearean tragedy. All four seasons have been tremendous. But what\u2019s becoming apparent now is that it was no fluke. Cheer replicates \u2013 even improves upon \u2013 the thrill of Last Chance U. It\u2019s perfect. We\u2019re 16 days into January, and it\u2019s impossible to imagine that anyone else will make a documentary series as good this year. Rather than rah-rahing at the side of football matches, the subjects of Cheer take part in competitive cheerleading, which is arguably the most nerve-racking thing a person could ever watch. It\u2019s a cross between high-level gymnastics and circus performing, with cheerleaders being flung metres into the air like rag dolls. Every time \u2013 every single time \u2013 they fell earthwards during the series, my sphincter clenched with fear. With good reason, because sometimes they land with a sickening crunch and end up horribly injured, but nevertheless that\u2019s a lot of clenching. In time-honoured Last Chance U tradition, Cheer follows one high-ranking team \u2013 that of Navarro college in Texas \u2013 as they prepare for a nationwide competition. We see the agony of not being picked, the gruel of training, we learn the tragic backstories of some of the subjects and we become fully invested in the team as an entity. What Cheer lacks, arguably to its advantage, is the dark heart of Last Chance U. That show was underpinned by its two toxic head coaches, Buddy Stephens and Jason Brown. They were screaming, furious, too-masculine figures who tore about like a pair of sentient heart attacks destroying as much as they created. But Cheer\u2019s head coach is Monica Aldama, who is a much more reassuring presence. Make no mistake, Aldama has a cruel streak \u2013 in one episode, she deliberately pushes a cheerleader to the brink of injury for defying her \u2013 but she proves time and time again that she isn\u2019t like Stephens or Brown. She truly seems to care about the squad as people. This essential positivity bleeds through Cheer. Unlike many of the Last Chance U subjects, who have long since buried themselves under layers of machismo, the Cheer subjects are open and eloquent about their feelings. They pull together in times of trouble, and they\u2019re ready to talk it out when things start to go south. Inevitably, they go south a lot. My pet theory about Whiteley documentaries is that, deep down, they\u2019re all about parents. Last Chance U was about the moment you realise that a parental figure is mistreating you. Cheer is even more explicit. It seems like nobody at Navarro had a decent upbringing. Some have parents who are disinterested or out of their depth. Some are overbearing. Some are outright absent. All these people have broken families, and we watch as they discover that the cheer team represents an opportunity for them to build one of their own. It is an incredibly touching thing to witness. And, of course, it\u2019s deliberate. Whiteley has an uncanny gift for knowing exactly when to drop a backstory into an episode to recalibrate our assumptions or explain a behavioural tic. He\u2019s also able to structure the raw material of his footage into something that feels like a movie. When a catcher slips and a cheerleader smashes her head into the ground, we know objectively that it\u2019s just a random accident. Whiteley\u2019s gift is that he makes it seem inevitable, like it was always going to be a major plot point from the very beginning. I have no idea how he does it. It\u2019s like a magic trick. So Last Chance U was no fluke. Cheer has proved that this is just the level Whiteley works at. If you haven\u2019t seen Cheer, fix that immediately. If you have, you should wait with bated breath to see what Whiteley does next. I know that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Senate prepares to open president\u2019s impeachment trial With a somber, ceremonial march through the halls of Capitol Hill, the House of Representatives on Wednesday transmitted its two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump to the US Senate, setting the stage for a trial to begin with opening arguments next Tuesday. Although Trump is expected to be exonerated by the Republican-controlled upper chamber, the trial could nonetheless unearth fresh, damaging evidence of his misconduct. Before and after. Tom McCarthy and Miranda Bryant run down a timeline of the events that have led to Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2013 and explain what will happen now that the impeachment articles have reached the Senate. Pen palaver. Republicans are outraged by the House Speaker Nancy decision to use multiple pens \u2013 engraved commemoratively with her signature \u2013 to sign the articles of impeachment. She then gave the pens to her allies, apparently as souvenirs of the historic moment. Parnas says Trump \u2018knew exactly what was going on in Ukraine\u2019 Lev Parnas, the Ukrainian-born businessman at the heart of the Trump-Ukraine scandal, has told MSNBC that the president \u201cknew exactly what was going on\u201d in the scheme to pressure Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Speaking to the interviewer Rachel Maddow with his lawyer at his side, Parnas insisted he had been doing the bidding of his close associate and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and of Trump himself. \u201cI was on the ground doing their work,\u201d Parnas said. Marie Yovanovitch. Diplomats and Democrats have responded with outrage to the emergence of messages between Parnas and the Trump donor Robert Hyde, in which Hyde implied he had the then US ambassador to Kyiv under surveillance before she was recalled by the White House. China plays down trade agreement despite Trump\u2019s boasts Trump called it \u201cthe biggest deal anybody has ever seen\u201d. But Beijing\u2019s response to the first phase of a new trade deal between the US and China was more muted, with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, describing it simply as \u201cprogress\u201d in the ongoing economic conflict between the superpowers. The deal, signed at the White House on Wednesday, further opens the Chinese market to US firms but leaves in place most of the $360bn in US tariffs on Chinese goods. \u2018Regret and unhappiness\u2019. The state-run Chinese tabloid Global Times said in an editorial: \u201cThe first phase of the agreement \u2026 leaves both sides with regret and unhappiness, which is exactly the response that a fair agreement will elicit.\u201d Progressives urge an end to Warren-Sanders dispute Liberal Democrats and supporters of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are desperately urging the two camps to make peace, after audio emerged from the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate in which the two candidates each accused the other of calling them a liar. Progressives fear the row could damage both campaigns, clearing a path to the presidential nomination for a centrist candidate such as Joe Biden. Liar, liar. Warren approached Sanders after the debate and declined to shake his outstretched hand, saying: \u201cI think you called me a liar on national TV.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not do it right now,\u201d Sanders responded. \u201cYou called me a liar.\u201d Cheat sheet Lawyers for Harvey Weinstein are making a fresh attempt to have his looming rape trial moved out of New York, where they claim the proceedings have been sullied by a \u201cdeluge\u201d of negative press coverage. A team of Japanese scientists has cultured a species of microbe resembling eukaryotes, the ancestor that gave rise to the first complex life on Earth, in what has been called a \u201cmonumental\u201d advance, shedding new light on an early evolutionary milestone. A new lawsuit filed by the attorney general of the US Virgin Islands alleges that Jeffrey Epstein continued to sexually abuse and traffic young women and girls to his private island as recently as 2018. The singer Andy Madadian, known as the Persian Bono, has become the first Iranian artist ever to be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles.

      "body": "<p>In 2015, a strident <a href=\"https://www.globalwaterintel.com/global-water-intelligence-magazine/16/4/opinion/exorcising-the-r-word\">editorial</a> appeared in Global Water Intelligence, a trade magazine for the water industry, under the title: Exorcising the \u201cR\u201d word. \u201cIt would be a travesty,\u201d the writer declared, to let \u201cthe ill-informed propaganda of a few NGOs\u201d interfere with private sector involvement in the water business.</p> <p>The unspeakable \u201cR\u201d word that had provoked such a defensive stance? Remunicipalisation: the taking back of privatised assets and services into public ownership at a local level.</p> <p>This dangerous idea, the Global Water Intelligence piece said, would be \u201cunlikely to be taken seriously by intelligent decision-makers in the industry\u201d, because of all the \u201cvalid and rational arguments behind private sector participation\u201d in providing water.</p> <p>What the article did not say, but was implicit in its attack, was that water ownership is a battle the private sector seems to have been losing. Since 2000 there have been at least 110 <a href=\"https://futureispublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/%E2%80%A2TNI_working-paper_09_online.pdf\">cases</a> of remunicipalisation in the water and sanitation sector in France alone. In 2008, the capital reclaimed its water from the private sector \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.epsu.org/sites/default/files/article/files/Redraft_DH_remunicipalization.pdf\">saving</a> \u20ac35m in its first year, reducing tariffs by 8%, reinvesting profits into maintenance rather than paying them out to shareholders, and <a href=\"https://neweconomics.opendemocracy.net/privatised-water-system-failed-time-look-alternatives/\">increasing</a> free access to water and sanitation for the residents of Paris.</p> <p>The agency, Eau de Paris, even installed free <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/10/paris-wants-to-install-sparkling-water-fountains-in-every-arrondissement/544197/\">fountains providing sparkling water</a> \u2013 a comically French idea, perhaps, but cheap, and good for the environment, preventing thousands of plastic bottles from heading to landfill sites. It also illustrated an important point: when our urban infrastructure is owned by the public rather than profit-making corporations, <em> </em>everyone<em> \u2013 </em>not just shareholders \u2013 can<em> </em>have nice things.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's a moral question \u2013 we\u2019re often talking about natural monopolies, like water, where competition doesn\u2019t make sense</p> <footer> <cite>Cat Hobbs, We Own It</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The word remunicipalisation does not lend itself to catchy slogans. It is, perhaps, somewhat alienatingly wonkish: in-sourcing civic infrastructure is not generally thought of as sexy politics. But its popularity is on the rise worldwide. The Transnational Institute (TNI), a thinktank in Amsterdam, has been banging the drum for years. Its latest report, <a href=\"https://futureispublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TNI_the-future-is-public_online.pdf\">The Future Is Public</a>, identifies more than 1,400 cases of remunicipalisation since the turn of the millennium, in more than 2,400 cities across 58 countries.</p> <p>The local services brought back into public ownership range from social care programmes in Selangor, Malaysia to privatised housing in Berlin, Germany; from waste services in Winnipeg, Canada to public transport cleaning in Seoul, South Korea. The report brims with success stories: the Chileans benefiting from dramatically lower drug prices since 40 new public pharmacies were created; the 141 new publicly-owned telecommunication providers in Chattanooga, Tennessee providing internet service to locations where private companies had decided it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble. There has been a 47% cut to electricity use in street lighting in the Bulgarian city of Dobrich since it was remunicipalised in 2018, when the local government installed energy-efficient LED bulbs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3f0dc918ac60b829a8eee4ff03e0929d09ef5e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3f0dc918ac60b829a8eee4ff03e0929d09ef5e8/0_166_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Water fountains, which include a sparkling option, installed as part of the Paris participatory budget.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water fountains, which include a sparkling option, installed as part of the Paris participatory budget.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert K Chin/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The benefits of remunicipalisation fall into two broad categories: first, correcting what has gone wrong in our cities after decades of privatisation, profit-extraction and waste; and second, forging a new sense of the public good.</p> <p>\u201cThe privatisation and outsourcing of the last 30-40 years has failed,\u201d says Cat Hobbs of the Oxford-based campaigning organisation We Own It. . \u201cIt tends to cost us more, it means that we get worse services, we have less control over them, and there is less democratic accountability to us, the public.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s also a moral question. We\u2019re often talking about natural monopolies like water, where competition doesn\u2019t make sense, and the market doesn\u2019t really belong. When we talk about \u2018people not profit\u2019, everyone understands that.\u201d</p> <p>The alternative, she argues, is one in which public ownership at the local level can ensure there are better, more stable jobs for communities, prioritising sustainability rather than dividends for shareholders. From social care to libraries to refuse collection, privatisation has cut these services to the bone.</p> <p>Remunicipalisation could resonate particularly well in the UK, because it speaks to some of the same political shifts that led to Brexit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24d24128de600dfe002d5f8fedc99411bcb5ef98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24d24128de600dfe002d5f8fedc99411bcb5ef98/0_32_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters hold up a banner at the Occupy London Stock Exchange protest camp on the steps of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, London, November 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters hold up a banner at the Occupy London Stock Exchange protest camp on the steps of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, London, November 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Winning/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe know that part of Brexit is about people wanting decisions to be taken near to where they live,\u201d Hobbs says. \u201cIt\u2019s about a sense of accountability and economic sovereignty, and taking back control.\u201d</p> <p>Why not help people actually take back control, in a way that transcends not just the 2016 referendum vote, but also how people voted in the recent UK election? Perhaps some of the questions being asked about Labour\u2019s \u201clost heartlands\u201d \u2013 about how you rebuild a civic sphere, and a sense of local community and participation in post-industrial cities \u2013 could be answered through remunicipalisation.</p> <p>\u201cSimply parcelling off public services to whichever multinational company can do it the cheapest is not a way of showing we value our communities,\u201d says Hobbs. \u201cThis is core to a decent society.\u201d</p> <p>But if remunicipalisation is a local movement, it is a global phenomenon, with the sharing of radical ideas and best practice among progressive city halls across the world.

      "bodyText": "In 2015, a strident editorial appeared in Global Water Intelligence, a trade magazine for the water industry, under the title: Exorcising the \u201cR\u201d word. \u201cIt would be a travesty,\u201d the writer declared, to let \u201cthe ill-informed propaganda of a few NGOs\u201d interfere with private sector involvement in the water business. The unspeakable \u201cR\u201d word that had provoked such a defensive stance? Remunicipalisation: the taking back of privatised assets and services into public ownership at a local level. This dangerous idea, the Global Water Intelligence piece said, would be \u201cunlikely to be taken seriously by intelligent decision-makers in the industry\u201d, because of all the \u201cvalid and rational arguments behind private sector participation\u201d in providing water. What the article did not say, but was implicit in its attack, was that water ownership is a battle the private sector seems to have been losing. Since 2000 there have been at least 110 cases of remunicipalisation in the water and sanitation sector in France alone. In 2008, the capital reclaimed its water from the private sector \u2013 saving \u20ac35m in its first year, reducing tariffs by 8%, reinvesting profits into maintenance rather than paying them out to shareholders, and increasing free access to water and sanitation for the residents of Paris. The agency, Eau de Paris, even installed free fountains providing sparkling water \u2013 a comically French idea, perhaps, but cheap, and good for the environment, preventing thousands of plastic bottles from heading to landfill sites. It also illustrated an important point: when our urban infrastructure is owned by the public rather than profit-making corporations, everyone \u2013 not just shareholders \u2013 can have nice things. The word remunicipalisation does not lend itself to catchy slogans. It is, perhaps, somewhat alienatingly wonkish: in-sourcing civic infrastructure is not generally thought of as sexy politics. But its popularity is on the rise worldwide. The Transnational Institute (TNI), a thinktank in Amsterdam, has been banging the drum for years. Its latest report, The Future Is Public, identifies more than 1,400 cases of remunicipalisation since the turn of the millennium, in more than 2,400 cities across 58 countries. The local services brought back into public ownership range from social care programmes in Selangor, Malaysia to privatised housing in Berlin, Germany; from waste services in Winnipeg, Canada to public transport cleaning in Seoul, South Korea. The report brims with success stories: the Chileans benefiting from dramatically lower drug prices since 40 new public pharmacies were created; the 141 new publicly-owned telecommunication providers in Chattanooga, Tennessee providing internet service to locations where private companies had decided it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble. There has been a 47% cut to electricity use in street lighting in the Bulgarian city of Dobrich since it was remunicipalised in 2018, when the local government installed energy-efficient LED bulbs. The benefits of remunicipalisation fall into two broad categories: first, correcting what has gone wrong in our cities after decades of privatisation, profit-extraction and waste; and second, forging a new sense of the public good. \u201cThe privatisation and outsourcing of the last 30-40 years has failed,\u201d says Cat Hobbs of the Oxford-based campaigning organisation We Own It. . \u201cIt tends to cost us more, it means that we get worse services, we have less control over them, and there is less democratic accountability to us, the public. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a moral question. We\u2019re often talking about natural monopolies like water, where competition doesn\u2019t make sense, and the market doesn\u2019t really belong. When we talk about \u2018people not profit\u2019, everyone understands that.\u201d The alternative, she argues, is one in which public ownership at the local level can ensure there are better, more stable jobs for communities, prioritising sustainability rather than dividends for shareholders. From social care to libraries to refuse collection, privatisation has cut these services to the bone. Remunicipalisation could resonate particularly well in the UK, because it speaks to some of the same political shifts that led to Brexit. \u201cWe know that part of Brexit is about people wanting decisions to be taken near to where they live,\u201d Hobbs says. \u201cIt\u2019s about a sense of accountability and economic sovereignty, and taking back control.\u201d Why not help people actually take back control, in a way that transcends not just the 2016 referendum vote, but also how people voted in the recent UK election? Perhaps some of the questions being asked about Labour\u2019s \u201clost heartlands\u201d \u2013 about how you rebuild a civic sphere, and a sense of local community and participation in post-industrial cities \u2013 could be answered through remunicipalisation. \u201cSimply parcelling off public services to whichever multinational company can do it the cheapest is not a way of showing we value our communities,\u201d says Hobbs. \u201cThis is core to a decent society.\u201d But if remunicipalisation is a local movement, it is a global phenomenon, with the sharing of radical ideas and best practice among progressive city halls across the world. This sharing is the policy arm of the Fearless Cities organisation, and the book of the same name, which unites the growing municipalist movement. Fearless Cities is best seen as a revanchist programme, trying to claw back some of the territory taken over the by the privatisation orthodoxy that began spreading globally during the Reagan and Thatcher era. Institutions such as the IMF, WTO and the World Bank pushed outsourcing of government services, and tough conditions on loans that had the effect of encouraging privatisation and fire-sales of public assets. The 2008 global financial crisis, however, shook the assumption that the private sector would produce the best results in cities. It is telling that the first political response to the crash began in 2011 with the Occupy movement \u2013 in the public spaces of world cities such as Athens, Madrid, London and New York. These \u201cmovements of the squares\u201d soon found political expression at a national level, via new parties like Podemos and Syriza, and in Bernie Sanders\u2019 and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s political successes. But it is no coincidence that the greatest successes of these movements have occurred in the same cities where they began: the reclaiming of public assets by new city governments drawn from those street movements. In Spain, where new \u201cmunicipal platforms\u201d swept to power in 2015 in Barcelona, Madrid, Cadiz, Valencia and several other cities, the Future Is Public report found 119 examples of remunicipalisation \u2013 behind only the US and France in number \u2013 ranging from energy and waste to funeral services and school canteens. As in France, water has been a particular triumph: there have been 27 remunicipalisations in Catalonia alone since 2010, under the banner Agua \u00e9s Vida (\u201cwater is life\u201d).

When two high-risk tackle technique warnings have been issued, a player will automatically receive a one-match suspension.

If the trial at senior level works, a more drastic innovation, outlawing tackles above waist level, may not be included in the law book: it is being trialled at youth level and in women\u2019s competitions and effectively eradicates doubt while reducing the risk of offloading.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/15/stuart-hogg-scotland-gregor-townsend-six-nations\">Johnny Sexton named Ireland captain for Six Nations campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another attempt to reduce the number of collisions is the 50:22 kick, which is being tested in America\u2019s rugby championship, South Africa\u2019s Varsity Cup and Italy\u2019s Top 12.

Once a team have reached the number allowed, a yellow card is automatically shown to the next offender. Someone will have to keep count and does an offence considered to merit an immediate yellow (or red) card reduce the tally to zero?</p> <p>It could take a team 75 minutes or more to reach the tally but does that mean that if they give away three penalties in quick succession defending their line that there is no yellow card?

McCall did not quibble about Carr\u00e9\u2019s dismissal even though the insistence of the referee, Alexandre Ruiz, that the prop had made contact with the head of the Ospreys\u2019 full-back Dan Evans was not backed up by one camera angle. The disciplinary committee that gave the prop a three-week ban backed the official. That Carr\u00e9 went high, in a double challenge with Nick Isiekwe, was not in doubt and the prevailing trend is for referees to send off offenders rather than send them to the sin-bin and leave it to the citing officer to decide whether an incident merits greater punishment. That will change under a World Rugby law experiment that will be trialled in Super Rugby and the Top 14 in France from the beginning of next month. Referees will issue players with warnings for high tackles during this year\u2019s Super Rugby competition. When two high-risk tackle technique warnings have been issued, a player will automatically receive a one-match suspension. Under it, Carr\u00e9 would probably have remained on the field at the Liberty Stadium. The crackdown on high tackles has been prompted by a determination to lower concussion rates: during the last Under-20 Championship, when the two-warning system was reduced, head injuries fell by more than 50%. If the trial at senior level works, a more drastic innovation, outlawing tackles above waist level, may not be included in the law book: it is being trialled at youth level and in women\u2019s competitions and effectively eradicates doubt while reducing the risk of offloading. Another attempt to reduce the number of collisions is the 50:22 kick, which is being tested in America\u2019s rugby championship, South Africa\u2019s Varsity Cup and Italy\u2019s Top 12. If a player kicks the ball from his own half and it bounces into touch in the opposition\u2019s 22, his side get the throw-in. The aim is to tempt teams to go for touch rather than keep the ball in play and cut the chance of concussion by lowering the tackle count. Another amendment being looked at is the introduction of an infringement limit for teams, measured in penalties and free-kicks. Once a team have reached the number allowed, a yellow card is automatically shown to the next offender. Someone will have to keep count and does an offence considered to merit an immediate yellow (or red) card reduce the tally to zero? It could take a team 75 minutes or more to reach the tally but does that mean that if they give away three penalties in quick succession defending their line that there is no yellow card? A referee is the best judge of the mood of a match but their discretion continues to be eroded. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

As Alex Feis-Bryce, head of SurvivorsUK \u2013 himself a survivor who, aged 18, was drugged and raped like Sinaga\u2019s victims \u2013 puts it: \u201cA lot of men feel completely emasculated after being raped. That\u2019s what silences them for so long.\u201d Add in the fact that men are taught that talking about feelings and emotional struggles is somehow unmanly, and it\u2019s little wonder that many survivors are driven to damaging self-medication, such as alcohol or drug abuse, or, like Hancock, they end up incarcerated. As Craig \u2013 who was abused from the age of 11 \u2013 tells me, men do want to talk, \u201cbut they just need to be told it\u2019s OK\u201d. It\u2019s up to his team to overcome entrenched gender norms by providing survivors with stability, making them feel safe and allowing them to process what they\u2019ve gone through and have meaningful lives. For some survivors, the process takes longer than others and noteveryone seeks the same experience. Many prefer to talk by phone: as Neil Henderson, the CEO of Safeline, a male survivors\u2019 helpline, told me: \u201cIt\u2019s the disinhibition effect, that if you tell me something I\u2019ll react even if I try not to, but you can\u2019t see a reaction on the phone.\u201d For some, that one phone call is enough: just to receive validation that they are not to blame, that it\u2019s not their fault, that they\u2019re not abnormal. When high-profile cases happen, the numbers surge: in the aftermath of the Sinaga sentencing, calls jumped by 5,000%. Some have carried the burden for so long: at the end of last year a 93-year-old phoned to talk for the first time about being abused as a six-year-old. The work done by such organisations transforms lives, but there are no statutory services for male survivors and male rape is subsumed into the government\u2019s violence against women and girls strategy. The funding and resources aren\u2019t enough, and so there\u2019s a postcode lottery. While a Mancunian survivor has an organisation to turn to, what about so many in small towns, let alone the countryside? And here, again, we see the consequences of gender norms imprisoning men: in the UK the biggest killer of men under 45 is suicide, often because they feel unable to get the support they need. \u201cTo support boys and men, we need to adopt a new language: that it\u2019s OK to be vulnerable,\u201d Craig tells me. \u201cI know now my own vulnerability is my strength \u2026 that holding it means no one else is holding it against me. It\u2019s my weapon to cut through dark times.\u201d Male survivors are suffering, largely in silence: but it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t want to talk. How we build a society that frees them to do so: that is the challenge we must all answer. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

In his lawsuit, he has argued that Saudi spies used Pegasus to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/24/jamal-khashoggi-omar-abdulaziz-dissident-saudis-interview\">read his conversations with Jamal Khashoggi</a>, a Washington Post columnist later murdered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/21/death-of-dissident-jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman\">in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul</a>.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that Abdulaziz and Khashoggi exchanged hundreds of messages in the months before he died.</p> <p>NSO had attempted to get the case thrown out of court by arguing that it lacked \u201cgood faith\u201d and was abusing Israel\u2019s judicial system, according to a copy of the ruling on 22 December.</p> <p>However, the judge, Guy Hyman, found no grounds for dismissal. Separately, while he agreed that the trial related to sensitive security issues, he did not accept that meant it should be held in secret.</p> <p>\u201cThe scope [of the case] is very broad, especially in matters of the roots of constitutional values \u200b\u200band fundamental rights,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ruling, therefore, in my view, must be public.\u201d </p> <p>NSO should also pay Abdulaziz\u2019s legal costs of 23,000 shekels (about \u00a35,100), he added.</p> <p>Alaa Mahajna, the lawyer representing Abdulaziz in Israel, welcomed the ruling and said the decision would push the trial forward.</p> <p>\u201cIt will force NSO to provide a defence and not just hide behind procedural delay tactics,\u201d he said. \u201cTo my knowledge, this is the most advanced stage any private lawsuit against spyware developers has ever reached.\u201d</p> <p>In his lawsuit, Abdulaziz has claimed 600,000 shekels in damages. He argued that the intercepted communications between him and Khashoggi \u2013 including discussions about how to push for democratic change in Saudi Arabia \u2013 were critical elements in the decision to kill Khashoggi.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the deceased Khashoggi\u2019s political activities were not new, and officials from the Saudi government knew of them a long time ago, the tightening collaboration between the plaintiff and the deceased in developing joint projects was the main reason for the decision to kill him,\u201d the lawsuit claimed.</p> <p>An NSO spokesperson said the company would appeal against the decision. \u201cThe latest judgement was part of an interim proceeding which did not address the merit of [Abdulaziz\u2019s] allegations; we remain confident that, once considered, the court will reject them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The spokesperson would not comment on specifics of the case but said Khashoggi was never targeted by one of the firm\u2019s products.</p> <p>On Thursday, an Israeli court ruled that a separate case related to NSO should be held behind closed doors. In that lawsuit, Amnesty International and other rights groups have sought to force Israel\u2019s ministry of defence to revoke some of the spyware company\u2019s export licences.</p> <p>Amnesty claims that multiple rights activists, and one of its own staff members, have been targeted by NSO products.

      "bodyText": "An Israeli judge has rejected an attempt by the spyware firm NSO Group to dismiss a case brought against it by a prominent Saudi activist who alleged that the company\u2019s cyberweapons were used to hack his phone. The decision could add pressure on the company, which faces multiple accusations that it sold surveillance technology, named Pegasus, to authoritarian regimes and other governments that have allegedly used it to target political activists and journalists. A Tel Aviv court ruled that the case brought by Omar Abdulaziz, a dissident based in Canada, could go ahead. In his lawsuit, he has argued that Saudi spies used Pegasus to read his conversations with Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist later murdered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. The Guardian understands that Abdulaziz and Khashoggi exchanged hundreds of messages in the months before he died. NSO had attempted to get the case thrown out of court by arguing that it lacked \u201cgood faith\u201d and was abusing Israel\u2019s judicial system, according to a copy of the ruling on 22 December. However, the judge, Guy Hyman, found no grounds for dismissal. Separately, while he agreed that the trial related to sensitive security issues, he did not accept that meant it should be held in secret. \u201cThe scope [of the case] is very broad, especially in matters of the roots of constitutional values and fundamental rights,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ruling, therefore, in my view, must be public.\u201d NSO should also pay Abdulaziz\u2019s legal costs of 23,000 shekels (about \u00a35,100), he added. Alaa Mahajna, the lawyer representing Abdulaziz in Israel, welcomed the ruling and said the decision would push the trial forward. \u201cIt will force NSO to provide a defence and not just hide behind procedural delay tactics,\u201d he said. \u201cTo my knowledge, this is the most advanced stage any private lawsuit against spyware developers has ever reached.\u201d In his lawsuit, Abdulaziz has claimed 600,000 shekels in damages. He argued that the intercepted communications between him and Khashoggi \u2013 including discussions about how to push for democratic change in Saudi Arabia \u2013 were critical elements in the decision to kill Khashoggi. \u201cWhile the deceased Khashoggi\u2019s political activities were not new, and officials from the Saudi government knew of them a long time ago, the tightening collaboration between the plaintiff and the deceased in developing joint projects was the main reason for the decision to kill him,\u201d the lawsuit claimed. An NSO spokesperson said the company would appeal against the decision. \u201cThe latest judgement was part of an interim proceeding which did not address the merit of [Abdulaziz\u2019s] allegations; we remain confident that, once considered, the court will reject them,\u201d he said. The spokesperson would not comment on specifics of the case but said Khashoggi was never targeted by one of the firm\u2019s products. On Thursday, an Israeli court ruled that a separate case related to NSO should be held behind closed doors. In that lawsuit, Amnesty International and other rights groups have sought to force Israel\u2019s ministry of defence to revoke some of the spyware company\u2019s export licences. Amnesty claims that multiple rights activists, and one of its own staff members, have been targeted by NSO products. Meanwhile, the ministry\u2019s legal team argued that the case should be held in secret on national security grounds. While NSO has not commented on specific cyberattacks cited in the Amnesty lawsuit, it has said it would \u201cdo whatever is necessary\u201d to ensure its technology is not abused to undermine human rights. NSO faces a further case in the US, brought against it in October by WhatsApp, which accuses the company of a series of sophisticated cyber-attacks that breached its messaging platform. While Abdulaziz claims that his phone was hacked after he clicked a fake link in an SMS message that he thought was from a courier service, WhatsApp believes that hundreds of others had their mobile phones hacked last year via its software. Last month, the Guardian reported that a least two dozen Pakistani government officials were allegedly targeted in this way, the first public instance of how Pegasus could have been used for \u201cstate-on-state\u201d espionage. WhatsApp\u2019s legal team said last week that NSO had not yet responded to the California lawsuit, or hired a lawyer to represent it. According to an affidavit filed by WhatsApp, this was despite the fact that it had hand-delivered the complaint to NSO\u2019s offices in Israel. The documents, WhatsApp said, included a request for contact details and a note informing NSO of its \u201cduty to preserve all documents that may be relevant to this litigation\u201d. NSO previously said it would vigorously contest claims by WhatsApp and its parent company, Facebook, and the company spokesperson said it still intended to defend itself. \u201cNSO\u2019s technology is only licensed, as a lawful solution, to government intelligence and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of preventing and investigating terror and serious crime,\u201d the spokesperson said. Separately, NSO has put a new human rights policy in place to \u201cprevent and mitigate\u201d abuse of its spyware. The policy states that NSO customers have contractual obligations to limit the use of the company\u2019s products to the \u201cprevention and investigation of serious crimes, including terrorism, and to ensure the products will not be used to violate human rights\u201d.",

They can point to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-11/democrats-can-win-back-obama-trump-voters-in-2020\">a study by two Johns Hopkins University political scientists</a> which found that the 6 million Obama-Trump voters in the last election were motivated more by economic anxiety than racial resentment, and were attracted to Trump\u2019s economic populism and opposition to free-trade agreements.</p> <p>Sanders, according to this line of thinking, is the only Democratic candidate whose consistent anti-trade, tax-the-rich populism can appeal to such voters.

      "bodyText": "Despite my center-right politics, I have a strange liking for Bernie Sanders. Of all the Democratic presidential jobseekers on stage at this week\u2019s Iowa debate, he struck me as the most authentic, the least likely to bend his convictions to pollsters or consultants, and the candidate with the best sense of humor. Sanders\u2019 self-proclaimed democratic socialism once would have been an absolute bar to his presidential aspirations, given the historic antipathy of most Americans toward the doctrine. More than a century ago, the German sociologist Werner Sombart predicted that widespread prosperity would forestall the development of socialism in the United States. As he memorably argued: \u201cOn the shoals of roast beef and apple pie, socialist utopias founder.\u201d But socialism now strikes many Americans as worth considering, in view of the widening economic inequality since the financial crisis of 2007-08. According to a recent Gallup poll, socialism is as popular as capitalism among Americans between the ages of 18 and 39 \u2013 and Sanders\u2019 support is driven by young people. Sanders has proved to be more politically resilient than many critics thought. Despite being the oldest candidate in the race, at 78, and having suffered a heart attack in October, he has recovered from his dip in the polls and now stands among the frontrunners in the upcoming contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. He also raised more money in the last quarter than any other Democratic candidate and has the highest favorability ratings. The current kerfuffle over whether he told his competitor, Elizabeth Warren, that a woman couldn\u2019t win the presidency \u2013 she says he did, he says he didn\u2019t \u2013 seems unlikely to have a serious impact on his candidacy. Sanders and Warren compete for many of the same left-leaning voters, so it\u2019s unsurprising that tensions between them are rising despite the non-aggression pact they made back in 2018. A recent Sanders campaign script instructs volunteers to tell Warren-sympathetic voters that \u201cpeople who support her are highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what,\u201d and that \u201cshe\u2019s bringing no new bases into the Democratic party\u201d. Warren supporters have reacted with predictable outrage, and the Massachusetts senator herself told reporters that she was \u201cdisappointed to hear Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me\u201d. But Sanders proponents make the case that the Vermont senator is more likely than other candidates (including Warren) to win over the working-class voters in swing states who gave Trump his electoral college victory in 2016. They can point to a study by two Johns Hopkins University political scientists which found that the 6 million Obama-Trump voters in the last election were motivated more by economic anxiety than racial resentment, and were attracted to Trump\u2019s economic populism and opposition to free-trade agreements.

This explains his long opposition to gun safety measures (he voted repeatedly against the Brady bill and measures to hold gun manufacturers liable for the damage done by their products), his comparatively late conversion to the cause of gay marriage (he opposed it in Vermont as late as 2006), and his nativist opposition to certain immigration reforms (on the grounds that they would undercut wages for American workers). If Sanders wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, it\u2019s a safe bet that African American voters in South Carolina will hear quite a lot from his Democratic competitors about his vote for the so-called \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d that allowed the white supremacist Dylann Roof to get the gun he used to kill nine African Americans at a South Carolina church. And although former vice-president Joe Biden has caught heat for writing what became the 1994 crime bill \u2013 which, many progressives claim, resulted in mass minority incarceration \u2013 Sanders voted for it as well. Democratic primary voters may also wonder how effective Sanders would be as president.

The popularity of cycling has soared in Britain in recent years. Graham Stapleton, the Halfords chief executive, said: \u201cPeople want to get healthier. People are looking for alternative modes of transport with the climate on their minds.\u201d He said electric bikes had lured older customers back to cycling. In the run-up to Black Friday Halfords launched what it called the UK\u2019s cheapest e-bike, priced at \u00a3379. The UK government confirmed in June that e-bikes would be eligible for the Cycle to Work scheme, in which staff can get bikes \u2013 tax-free \u2013 via their employers. Halfords\u2019 free bike-build service was attracting customers, Stapleton said, and the retailer had trained more than 1,000 technicians to service e-bikes and cars. The car parts and bike firm, which has more than 400 stores, reported 1.3% growth in UK like-for-like sales for the latest quarter, with car parts sales down 2.7%. Its 300 autocentres, which offer car servicing and repairs, contributed 4.6% growth. The company stuck to its profit outlook of \u00a350m-\u00a355m for the full year, compared with \u00a351m in the previous year. In the year to date, sales have fallen 1.2% at established stores. The upbeat figures for the Christmas quarter are a change from last year, when Halfords issued two profit warnings and blamed flagging consumer confidence for a slump in sales. Cycling sales suffered last summer as the previous year\u2019s sustained heatwave was not repeated. Halfords said motoring sales over the festive period had again been affected by weak consumer confidence, which had put customers off buying bigger technology items such as high-end audio equipment, dash cams and satnavs, while sales of essentials including bulbs, blades and batteries held up.",

He finished the runner-up in the British F3 championship and Warwick describes him as a special talent. The award came with a \u00a3200,000 prize but while Hoggard acknowledges what an enormous help it has been, it is not nearly enough. Thus far he has been supported by his mum and dad, who have given all they can to meet the costs of British F3 \u2013 around \u00a3300,000. Hoggard wants to move to the F3 championship, two steps below F1. A drive which will cost at least \u00a31m.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible for mum and dad to fund it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was hard enough to fund British F3. They have brought me as far as they can but it is such a steep incline in budget.

Billy Monger, the double amputee driver with a high public and media profile, has still to secure sponsorship or a seat for this season.</p> <p>Further down the ladder the issues remain the same. Emily Linscott is a talented 17-year-old, who had wins in Britcar GT4 last year as well as podium finishes in the US Lucas Oil series. Thus far she too has been backed by her parents and wants to move to British F3 but the family can far from afford the step up.</p> <p>She, too, is trying to find sponsorship, knowing that victory on track is dependent on winning this numbers game. \u201cDefinitely finance is the biggest constraint,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe I have the skill to race but what\u2019s holding me back is we don\u2019t have anywhere near the money needed. My family have given their all but unless you have the money there is only so far you can go.\u201d</p> <p>Popular conception has it that exceptional drivers will be picked up by development programmes. In some cases this is true but there are caveats. The first being that to be noticed you have to be racing and some cannot get that far. While equally, as the Jaguar Formula E driver Mitch Evans noted, even then it is not a free ride.</p> <p>\u201cI had offers from a number of top teams, including Red Bull and Ferrari, to go on their junior schemes but I still had to provide some money,\u201d he revealed in 2015. \u201cA lot of driver development schemes are smoke and mirrors in terms of the drivers paying to be there. A lot of it is just about getting a foot in an F1 team in a roundabout way.\u201d</p> <p>His words were given no little weight on Wednesday when Williams announced their test driver for the 2020 F1 season. Their choice, the Israeli Roy Nissany, has an underwhelming record, finishing 22nd in F2 in 2018. He is perhaps best known as being the son of Chanoch Nissany, who was the first Israeli to take part in an F1 weekend, testing for Minardi at the Hungaroring in 2005 where he almost 13 seconds off the pace and reportedly complained that his car had too much grip. His son is backed by the Canadian-Israeli billionaire Sylvan Adams and now has a place at the Williams team. What Hoggard and Linscott would give for such largesse.</p> <p>Hamilton has said he wants part of his post-racing legacy to include finding ways to encourage and support young drivers without wealthy parents into racing and in their careers. He also wants racing, including the FIA and F1, to consider the structures of the sport to make it more accessible.</p> <p>As things stand a mountainous task lies ahead and sadly for young talent across the globe, their chances may have long since slipped away.</p>",

The reality is few do, their careers curtailed long before the heady heights of F3. Johnathan Hoggard, who is 19, won the Aston Martin Autosport young driver of the year award at the end of last season. He finished the runner-up in the British F3 championship and Warwick describes him as a special talent. The award came with a \u00a3200,000 prize but while Hoggard acknowledges what an enormous help it has been, it is not nearly enough. Thus far he has been supported by his mum and dad, who have given all they can to meet the costs of British F3 \u2013 around \u00a3300,000. Hoggard wants to move to the F3 championship, two steps below F1. A drive which will cost at least \u00a31m. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for mum and dad to fund it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was hard enough to fund British F3. They have brought me as far as they can but it is such a steep incline in budget. Before, the goal was F1 but I am having to think a bit more realistically about where we are and what we have available.\u201d He is working hard to try to find sponsorship but that too is thin on the ground. Billy Monger, the double amputee driver with a high public and media profile, has still to secure sponsorship or a seat for this season. Further down the ladder the issues remain the same. Emily Linscott is a talented 17-year-old, who had wins in Britcar GT4 last year as well as podium finishes in the US Lucas Oil series. Thus far she too has been backed by her parents and wants to move to British F3 but the family can far from afford the step up. She, too, is trying to find sponsorship, knowing that victory on track is dependent on winning this numbers game. \u201cDefinitely finance is the biggest constraint,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe I have the skill to race but what\u2019s holding me back is we don\u2019t have anywhere near the money needed. My family have given their all but unless you have the money there is only so far you can go.\u201d Popular conception has it that exceptional drivers will be picked up by development programmes. In some cases this is true but there are caveats. The first being that to be noticed you have to be racing and some cannot get that far. While equally, as the Jaguar Formula E driver Mitch Evans noted, even then it is not a free ride. \u201cI had offers from a number of top teams, including Red Bull and Ferrari, to go on their junior schemes but I still had to provide some money,\u201d he revealed in 2015. \u201cA lot of driver development schemes are smoke and mirrors in terms of the drivers paying to be there. A lot of it is just about getting a foot in an F1 team in a roundabout way.\u201d His words were given no little weight on Wednesday when Williams announced their test driver for the 2020 F1 season. Their choice, the Israeli Roy Nissany, has an underwhelming record, finishing 22nd in F2 in 2018. He is perhaps best known as being the son of Chanoch Nissany, who was the first Israeli to take part in an F1 weekend, testing for Minardi at the Hungaroring in 2005 where he almost 13 seconds off the pace and reportedly complained that his car had too much grip. His son is backed by the Canadian-Israeli billionaire Sylvan Adams and now has a place at the Williams team. What Hoggard and Linscott would give for such largesse. Hamilton has said he wants part of his post-racing legacy to include finding ways to encourage and support young drivers without wealthy parents into racing and in their careers. He also wants racing, including the FIA and F1, to consider the structures of the sport to make it more accessible. As things stand a mountainous task lies ahead and sadly for young talent across the globe, their chances may have long since slipped away.",

Scores of neighbourhoods in the city of 6.7 million people, as well as six nearby towns, have been affected by the crisis, which has dragged on for nearly two weeks.

Last year, Yoram Roth, the Berliner who is the majority shareholder and chairman of the <a href=\"https://www.fotografiska.com/about/\" title=\"\">Fotografiska</a> (a centre for contemporary photography), announced he would be stepping in to save it.</p> <p>Roth says he is committed to preserving the institution\u2019s historic character: \u201cI\u2019m deeply in love with the place. I want the building to look as though no one has touched it. You could restore it so that it looks flawlessly new, which I\u2019d find soulless. To restore it so that it looks untouched will cost a lot more but it\u2019s worth it because that\u2019s what makes this place magical.\u201d </p> <p>While some worried that the new owner may want to build condominiums on the valuable real estate out front, which currently houses a beer garden, Roth says that is out of the question. \u201cIf you put apartments everywhere, by right the owners can demand a certain quietude after 10pm, which runs into conflict with club culture. People come to Berlin to consume culture, whether that\u2019s history, nightclubs or the opera. We have to support and maintain our club culture and Cl\u00e4rchens is part of that.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://berlin-for-claerchens.de/en/#unterschriften\">petition</a> attached to <a href=\"https://berlin-for-claerchens.de/en/\">an open letter</a> asking Roth to allow the Regehrs to continue overseeing operations has so far gathered 7,049 signatures. However, Roth says that he plans to work with a new, unnamed partner. Although he plans to host events and partially reopen Cl\u00e4rchens for the summer season, there is no fixed date for the venue fully reopening. More than 100 staff members will be let go with no guarantee of return.</p> <p>While the final festivities were bittersweet, David and Lisa insisted on a party rather than a funeral. As the night wore on, the two could be seen hugging regulars and greeting them by name.</p> <p>\u201cThese last two evenings are a celebration of this time and this place,\u201d Lisa says. \u201cSo many guests have taken our hands and said, \u2018Thank you so much for all the good times all these years.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The last year has been so crazy \u2013 it\u2019s been packed every night,\u201d said Lisa Regehr, a dancer who has run the ballroom along with her husband, David and his business partner Christian Schulz. When the couple arrived in 2004, many of the windows were boarded up and debris littered the floor of the Spiegelsaal. Bringing it back from the brink of dereliction wasn\u2019t easy, but they maintain it was worth it. \u201cThere may be people who are more financially successful than us but we never did this for the money. We\u2019ve always viewed this place as a living work of art,\u201d says David. \u201cUnder the GDR, everyone came here because this was one of the only places where you could dance.\u201d There will be dancing in Cl\u00e4rchens\u2019 future, although no one is sure what that will look like. Last year, Yoram Roth, the Berliner who is the majority shareholder and chairman of the Fotografiska (a centre for contemporary photography), announced he would be stepping in to save it. Roth says he is committed to preserving the institution\u2019s historic character: \u201cI\u2019m deeply in love with the place. I want the building to look as though no one has touched it. You could restore it so that it looks flawlessly new, which I\u2019d find soulless. To restore it so that it looks untouched will cost a lot more but it\u2019s worth it because that\u2019s what makes this place magical.\u201d While some worried that the new owner may want to build condominiums on the valuable real estate out front, which currently houses a beer garden, Roth says that is out of the question. \u201cIf you put apartments everywhere, by right the owners can demand a certain quietude after 10pm, which runs into conflict with club culture. People come to Berlin to consume culture, whether that\u2019s history, nightclubs or the opera. We have to support and maintain our club culture and Cl\u00e4rchens is part of that.\u201d A petition attached to an open letter asking Roth to allow the Regehrs to continue overseeing operations has so far gathered 7,049 signatures. However, Roth says that he plans to work with a new, unnamed partner. Although he plans to host events and partially reopen Cl\u00e4rchens for the summer season, there is no fixed date for the venue fully reopening. More than 100 staff members will be let go with no guarantee of return. While the final festivities were bittersweet, David and Lisa insisted on a party rather than a funeral. As the night wore on, the two could be seen hugging regulars and greeting them by name. \u201cThese last two evenings are a celebration of this time and this place,\u201d Lisa says. \u201cSo many guests have taken our hands and said, \u2018Thank you so much for all the good times all these years.\u2019\u201d Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "body": "<p>Middle-aged women have long been treated as the punchlines of jokes in popular culture \u2013 as the crazy witches at the end of the street, or worse, as invisible members of society who cease to exist once their reproductive years are over. But a host of artists have recently focused their attention on the experiences of women in midlife, from Darcey Steinke\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/books/review-flash-count-diary-menopause-darcey-steinke.html\">Flash Count Diary</a> to Susan P Matterns\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/susan-mattern/the-slow-moon-climbs/\">The Slow Moon Climbs</a>.</p> <p>This new wave of attention is joined by photographer Elinor Carucci\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.monacellipress.com/book/midlife/\">Midlife</a>. In her introduction to the book, Kristen Roupenian writes that Carucci\u2019s photographs invoke the \u201cintense, exhausting self-monitoring that can feel like an inescapable part of owning a female body\u201d.</p> <p>I met with Carucci in the kitchen of her lower Manhattan home, where so many of her photographs have been taken.

There\u2019s a kind of bravery to showing your true ageing body. <br><br><strong>Elinor Carucci</strong>: I don\u2019t really see it as me being brave. I mean, I was the class clown because I wasn\u2019t a good-looking teenager; my nickname was Wall because I didn\u2019t develop. I became really funny and I was always making fun of my body.

First of all, I think I make better decisions.<br><br><strong>EC:</strong> Because you know that you can\u2019t afford to lose time?<br><br><strong>AN:</strong> Because the unimportant things are very much clearer now. When you see someone on their deathbed and they wish they hadn\u2019t worked so much, they wish they hadn\u2019t let those bad relationships fester, they wish they\u2019d made peace with their estranged siblings, they wish they hadn\u2019t cared so much about what people thought of them, they wish they had just tried the crazy things.<br><strong><br>EC:</strong> The hysterectomy did some of that to me.

The conversations that we have about elder care and death care parallel ideas about conception or the origin of life. The two always come together.<br><br>I saw my sister give birth to my nephew and I suddenly thought about my own life and time differently. It shocked me, the birth.

      "bodyText": "Middle-aged women have long been treated as the punchlines of jokes in popular culture \u2013 as the crazy witches at the end of the street, or worse, as invisible members of society who cease to exist once their reproductive years are over. But a host of artists have recently focused their attention on the experiences of women in midlife, from Darcey Steinke\u2019s Flash Count Diary to Susan P Matterns\u2019 The Slow Moon Climbs. This new wave of attention is joined by photographer Elinor Carucci\u2019s Midlife. In her introduction to the book, Kristen Roupenian writes that Carucci\u2019s photographs invoke the \u201cintense, exhausting self-monitoring that can feel like an inescapable part of owning a female body\u201d. I met with Carucci in the kitchen of her lower Manhattan home, where so many of her photographs have been taken. We talked for more than two hours while her twin teenagers visited with friends in a room down the hall. Ann Neumann: What became very clear to me in menopause is how much of a woman\u2019s value to society is determined by her appearance. Whatever currency my appearance once gave me, it was quickly changing, making room for other interests and concerns. There\u2019s a kind of bravery to showing your true ageing body. Elinor Carucci: I don\u2019t really see it as me being brave. I mean, I was the class clown because I wasn\u2019t a good-looking teenager; my nickname was Wall because I didn\u2019t develop. I became really funny and I was always making fun of my body. People say the work is brave and I take the compliment but I feel it\u2019s more like an attempt at connection. AN: But there\u2019s also a lot of beauty in the photographs: you\u2019re beautiful. EC: Thank you, Ann, thank you. AN: And I know that helps your career. EC: It does. AN: How do you think of your own beauty? EC: I am a feminist, but I still want to look beautiful. I still want to look younger. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re either a feminist who doesn\u2019t care about the way you look, or you\u2019re a stupid, shallow woman who does. AN: When I turned 50 last year, I realized that I was relieved of the effort to participate in all the behavior that surrounds reproduction, looking a particular kind of attractive. I was afraid of becoming invisible, but also relieved that it was approaching. EC: You really look so much younger than 50. AN: Thank you! But also think about that! EC: As a compliment that we give each other \u2026 I know. I\u2019m thinking about it a lot, but still I had to say it. AN: Ha! And then I say: \u201cThank you!\u201d EC: We all want to look beautiful and there\u2019s a reason for it. What has to change really is the opportunities we\u2019re given as women \u2013 professional, economic. But I will probably want to be beautiful for the rest of my life. AN: So the way we define beauty is culturally constructed. EC: Very much so. AN: Even the types of attention that women\u2019s work and men\u2019s work receive can be different. We receive publicity and recognition through different routes. Routes that don\u2019t confer the same respect. EC: And don\u2019t translate into the same amount of money. I\u2019m sorry to talk about money. AN: No, money\u2019s important! We\u2019ve already talked about the attention we receive, the attention that our work is given \u2026 But what about the attention that we women give to things and how this changes? EC: I\u2019m just speaking my mind more. I approach and talk to people more. I say to my kids: \u201cI\u2019m not crazy guys, I\u2019m just reaching out to the world.\u201d I have fewer years as I grow older. Just let me enjoy the world. AN: In the afterword to Midlife, you write that red is the color of an \u201cangry loss\u201d that you feel. \u201cMy blood looked the same,\u201d despite all of the other losses: being reproductive, being needed as a mother, being attractive, being visible, being relevant. \u201cI am unnecessary, I am a woman without a uterus.\u201d I felt this loss too. What recourse do we have as ageing women? Is the only corrective to thinking that our lives are less valuable now to say: \u201cNo they\u2019re not.\u201d I\u2019m vital, I\u2019m doing important work? EC: Making the book was my fight. The pictures are as good [as before], the sex is as good (it\u2019s a little different, but you know), I\u2019m still a mother \u2013 maybe a better mother? Maybe I\u2019m a better teacher. I really wanted to celebrate this time and even my marriage. AN: So we need to move away from thinking that youth is the best years of our lives? EC: I think it\u2019s a really beautiful thing [for my husband and I] to go through all these years, to now go to Trader Joe\u2019s together and buy things for all of us. AN: I believe you. There\u2019s so much domesticity in your work. EC: The everyday. I am a very homey person. That\u2019s where I find everything. In home and in my parent\u2019s home and a little bit when I shoot for magazines, in other people\u2019s homes. I feel that in the microcosm of family, everything exists, all of our emotions and feelings. AN: I loved that about your book because it\u2019s about these eras within our lives and how we move through them and we embody these different roles. And embodiment means so much to me as someone who writes about death and dying, to see people at the end of their lives doing this measure of who they are, and what they are, and what it all means. EC: What does it all mean, then? AN: What do I think is the meaning of life? EC: What do you feel from them at the end of their lives? AN: Oh, everything! Every emotion, so much regret, so much anger, so much love and concern and fear. Often great calmness. I think about this a lot. It\u2019s changed me to do hospice work, to write about the dying. First of all, I think I make better decisions. EC: Because you know that you can\u2019t afford to lose time? AN: Because the unimportant things are very much clearer now. When you see someone on their deathbed and they wish they hadn\u2019t worked so much, they wish they hadn\u2019t let those bad relationships fester, they wish they\u2019d made peace with their estranged siblings, they wish they hadn\u2019t cared so much about what people thought of them, they wish they had just tried the crazy things. EC: The hysterectomy did some of that to me. It did have some of those effects on me. AN: Whenever we\u2019re talking about life and the beginning of life and the making of life \u2013 motherhood, essentially \u2013 we\u2019re talking about death. We\u2019re talking about mortality, and that has very much been brought home to me in my work. The conversations that we have about elder care and death care parallel ideas about conception or the origin of life. The two always come together. I saw my sister give birth to my nephew and I suddenly thought about my own life and time differently. It shocked me, the birth. It\u2019s brutal and beautiful and emotionally profound: the shit, the pain, the blood, the gorgeous new life. EC: The smell. The smell! AN: Very primal. Like a death.

      "body": "<p>Some time at the end of the last century, I made a mistake. Friends of mine, a Croatian couple, asked me to find them a book called The Art of Selling, and take it to them in Zagreb when I was next there. This was pre-internet and Amazon and all that caper, so it took some finding. Upon slapping it triumphantly on my friends\u2019 kitchen table, I was told this wasn\u2019t the book they were after; far from it. They had asked me for The Art of Sailing. Imagine their disappointment.</p> <p>However, in a lifetime of unforced errors, this one was more or less alone in that it actually turned out for the best. My friends read The Art of Selling, liked it, saw a market for it, translated it into Croatian, sold lots of copies, and their publishing business was born. I saw them last week; these days they are engaged in the translation of erotic fiction into Croatian. This, as you can imagine, has its challenges. The word \u201cmanhood\u201d is one. \u201cWhat\u2019s that all about?\u201d my friend Zrinka asked me.</p> <p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d I shrugged. There is a Croatian word for manhood but in this context it sounds absurd. Also, she tells me there is no translation for having sex that is neither lewd nor technical-sounding, like the word \u201ccopulation\u201d, which she is often forced to use.

But ever since I begat daughters I have bemoaned the lack of a sweet word for girls\u2019 bits. Willy is a lovely word: sweet, affectionate, harmless and a bit funny. It\u2019s so bad, and telling, that we don\u2019t have such a thing for girls? What\u2019s our nice little word for vagina? There isn\u2019t one really, is there?

      "bodyText": "Stephanie Davis started taking running seriously only two years ago, raced in her first marathon in September 2018 and fits in training with a full\u2011time job. But the 29-year-old is now targeting an unlikely Olympic spot after being confirmed in the women\u2019s elite field for the London Marathon. And who would dare bet against her? After all, in December Davis ran the ninth fastest marathon by a British woman \u2013 her time of 2hr 27min 40sec not only improving her personal best by five minutes but making her one of only four GB athletes with the Olympic qualifying standard of 2:29. The final step before booking the sporting trip of a lifetime is to finish among the top two Britons in London. \u201cIt has still not sunk in because it has all come so quickly,\u201d Davis said. \u201cMy coach tends to give me mini\u2011motivational pep talks before and after training sessions. I haven\u2019t had an international vest yet but with the Olympics just a few months away I can\u2019t avoid the target.\u201d Davis ran for the University of Edinburgh and continued to stay fit when she moved to London but it was only when she joined her local club, Clapham Chasers, that she started training more seriously. Her coach, Philip Krissi, encouraged her to run her first marathon in 2018, which she finished in 2:41, despite racing conservatively because she feared she would \u201cget to six miles to go, hit a wall and die\u201d. When she followed it up by running the London Marathon last year in 2:32, despite a hip injury in the buildup, she knew she was capable of more. Even so, this April will mark the first time she has started in an elite field rather than with the masses. \u201cIt will be a whole new learning curve but I am a very competitive person, which is what brought me that 2:27 in Valencia. \u201cI thought beforehand that going under 2:30 was possible, so I got into a group where the pacer was meant to be doing 2:29-2:30. However, he went too fast and we were 50 seconds quicker at halfway but I was just really determined not to be dropped.\u201d Unlike many of her rivals, Davis will not be heading away for altitude training \u2013 and says she runs only 60-70 miles a week, around half that of many elite athletes, to avoid injury. \u201cBut I also do a lot of cross-training, including swimming and going on the elliptical, and cycle to work every day.\u201d Davis also credits her employer, Lazard Asset Management, with allowing her to work flexibly so she can train in the morning and evening. Her friends are also coming round to having a potential Olympic athlete in their midst, too. \u201cFor a while they were like: \u2018Oh, she\u2019s got so boring, she doesn\u2019t want to come out any more and goes to bed early every night.\u2019 But now they totally get it.\u201d",

Oscar hasn\u2019t moved a muscle, but he didn\u2019t move a muscle when I fell downstairs either. I peer into his bed. He stares at me blankly. After a few more minutes, I turn off: Oscar shifts slightly and his head briefly emerges. Does that mean the podcast works? Possibly. I am certainly thinking of using it for my insomnia.

Despite Microsoft\u2019s repeated warnings to Windows 7 users, there may still be <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-many-pcs-are-still-running-windows-7-today/\">a couple of hundred million users</a>, many of them in businesses. What should people do next?</p> <p>To begin with, Windows 7 will not stop working, it will just stop receiving security updates. Users will therefore be more vulnerable to malware attacks, particularly from \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware\">ransomware</a>\u201d.

It will run most, if not all, of your existing software, and you will have to do the least amount of relearning. Decades of Windows experience will still be useful.</p> <p>Microsoft offered Windows 7 users a free in-place upgrade to Windows 10 during the year after its launch, and it would have been sensible to take it. Since then, you have been able to download a copy of Windows 10 and <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/\">use Microsoft\u2019s media creation tool to upgrade Windows 7 either directly or from a thumb-drive</a>. So far, most users who have tried this and entered their Windows 7 product key have had their copy of Windows 10 authenticated. I can\u2019t say whether that will continue to work. However, Microsoft wants people off Windows 7 and on to Windows 10, so it\u2019s worth a go. Just skip the part where it asks for a product key, and leave it for later.</p> <p>If you install Windows 10, you can use it for a month. After that, you will get a \u201cwatermark\u201d on your desktop that says it isn\u2019t authenticated, and Microsoft will nag you to do it. You will also lose personalisation options, so you won\u2019t be able to change the wallpaper, themes, lock screen and so on, but it will continue to work. Using an unauthenticated copy of Windows 10 is not a long-term solution, and it\u2019s a bad idea for businesses, which can <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4527878/faq-about-extended-security-updates-for-windows-7\">pay for extended updates</a>. However, if you\u2019re a Windows 7 home user, it gives you more time to decide what to do.</p> <p>If Windows 10 runs well on your PC, you might decide to pay to authenticate it. If it doesn\u2019t run well, you can still try a different option, such as <a href=\"https://linuxmint.com/\">Linux Mint</a>, <a href=\"https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop\">Ubuntu LTS</a> or <a href=\"https://www.neverware.com/freedownload\">CloudReady</a>.</p> <p>Alternatively, keep Windows 7 for offline use, and use a \u201clive Linux\u201d for internet access.</p> <p>Many people are familiar with the idea of running Linux from a \u201clive CD\u201d or DVD, which doesn\u2019t interfere with the current desktop operating system. There are not many DVD drives around nowadays, so the modern equivalent is to run it from a thumb-drive. You can create one with a tool such as <a href=\"https://rufus.ie/\">Rufus</a> or <a href=\"https://www.linuxliveusb.com/\">LinuxLive USB Creator</a>.

If I do stay with Windows 7, what should I worry about, and how can I protect myself? I have been running Kaspersky Total Security for several years, which has worked well so far. Marcy Microsoft Windows 7 \u2013 launched in 2009 \u2013 came to the end of its supported life on Tuesday. Despite Microsoft\u2019s repeated warnings to Windows 7 users, there may still be a couple of hundred million users, many of them in businesses. What should people do next? To begin with, Windows 7 will not stop working, it will just stop receiving security updates. Users will therefore be more vulnerable to malware attacks, particularly from \u201cransomware\u201d. We saw how dangerous that can be when WannaCry took over unpatched PCs in the NHS and other places. It was so bad that Microsoft released a patch for XP, even though it was out of support. There are reasons to be fearful, because of the way the malware industry works. On the second Tuesday of every month, Microsoft releases security patches that should be installed automatically by Windows Update. The malware industry analyses these patches to find the holes, and then looks for ways to exploit them. A lot of the code in Windows 10 goes back to Windows 7 and earlier versions. As a result, some of the security holes in Windows 10 will also be present in Windows 7, but they won\u2019t be patched. Malware writers don\u2019t normally target out-of-date operating systems, because they don\u2019t usually have many users. In this case, as with XP, there could be millions of relatively easy targets. The British government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) told the BBC: \u201cWe would urge those using the software after the deadline to replace unsupported devices as soon as possible, to move sensitive data to a supported device and not to use them for tasks like accessing bank and other sensitive accounts.\u201d That\u2019s good advice. Defensive computing The NCSC\u2019s website suggests some \u201cshort-term steps to take when you can\u2019t move off out-of-date platforms and applications straight away\u201d. It\u2019s aimed mainly at government departments and businesses, and isn\u2019t specific to Windows 7. The core advice boils down to this: avoid coming into contact with any malware, and make sure you have nothing to lose. The first is basically impossible in a world where malware can be served via advertisements (\u201cmalvertising\u201d) even on respectable websites. The second is tedious but essential. While you can\u2019t patch Windows 7, you can make sure your other software is patched. That applies to browsers in particular. Fortunately, the main browser suppliers will keep updating them, and Google has said: \u201cWe will continue to fully support Chrome on Windows 7 for a minimum of 18 months from Microsoft\u2019s end of life date, until at least 15 July 2021.\u201d Eventually, however, they\u2019ll stop testing their browsers on Windows 7 because it\u2019s expensive and will only serve a shrinking number of users. If you can\u2019t avoid malware completely, try to avoid untrusted or insecure websites. Major name-brand websites should be reasonably safe, including your bank\u2019s. Sources of free, pirated or \u201cadult\u201d stuff are generally less so. But, sooner or later, your bank will decide that it\u2019s too risky to deal with people who have vulnerable computers, and prevent you from logging on. Running good anti-virus software and a firewall should help minimise the risk, so it may be worth paying for something like Kaspersky Total Security. However, no security software is foolproof, and it won\u2019t patch your unpatched operating system. You must also be super-suspicious about emails, and never click unsolicited attachments. According to Precisesecurity.com, spam and phishing emails caused 67% of ransomware infections in 2019, causing $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) worth of damage. The best defence against ransomware and other serious attacks is not having anything to lose. Keep copies of all your valuable data on external hard drives and thumb-drives and possibly online, and as little as possible on your Windows 7 PC. Make daily backups to a storage device that is not otherwise attached to your PC, and keep a current disk image handy. You\u2019ll never have to pay a ransom if you can just wipe the infected drive and restore your PC from a backup.

Both have slow Intel Celeron N4000 processors and 4GB of memory, and they are called \u201ccloudbooks\u201d because of their limited 64GB of storage. Like Chromebooks, they are designed to work online. Unlike Chromebooks, they can run Microsoft Office and other Windows programs. A better buy would be an Asus X540MA with a Pentium Silver N5000, 4GB of memory and 1TB hard drive for \u00a3239.99 at eBuyer. Alternatively, you could buy a refurbished laptop or desktop already running Windows 10. For example, Tier1Online has a small ex-corporate HP desktop with a Core i3-3220 processor, 4GB of memory, 500GB hard drive and one-year guarantee for \u00a399. It has lots of ThinkPad laptops at prices from \u00a3169 (X240 with an i3-4010U and 4GB) or less to \u00a3249 (X1 Carbon with an i5-4210U, 8GB and a 128GB SSD) or more. Tier1Online will also add extra memory and SSDs to most of its machines, if required. You can extend the guarantee to three years for \u00a340. You can also buy refurbished laptops from Morgan and various suppliers on Amazon or eBay. GetOnline@Home is a government-backed scheme that offers extra discounts to people on benefits, and there are other sources. If all else fails, you may be able to get a free laptop running Windows 10 from a recycling group such as Freegle or Freecycle, or from a friend of a friend. Windows 7 hasn\u2019t been current since 2012, when Windows 8 was launched. Processors have advanced a lot since then, and SSDs have mostly replaced hard drives. Somebody else\u2019s cast-off PC may be newer and faster than the one you\u2019ve been using for five or 10 years. Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>A genuinely innovative artwork requires time to fulfil its effect. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jeff-vandermeer\" title=\"\">Jeff VanderMeer</a>\u2019s <em>Dead Astronauts</em> is one such work \u2013 bewildering, perplexing, original \u2013 and I would recommend that readers allow it the concentration it demands. The opening third poses as a quest narrative, a fantastical variant of the classic western: three battle-scarred gunslingers set out across an ecologically ravaged landscape in pursuit of an enemy. Our heroes are Grayson, a black woman and sole survivor of a disastrously failed mission to explore deep space; Chen, an indentured worker bound in perpetuity to an invasive corporation known only as the Company; and Moss, whose name was once Sarah, now a complex, composite organism who has been partially absorbed into the structure of the worlds they move through. The enemy they seek to defeat is the Company itself, and more specifically its agent, a deranged Dr Moreau-type biologist named Charlie X. The three are helped along their journey by Charlie\u2019s failed experiments: the blue fox, the duck with the broken wing, the leviathan called Botch, a hive-mind of salamanders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This kind of formal innovation is pure catnip, an indication that as a mode of expression the novel is still vigorous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The astronauts project themselves through time, engaging the Company across multiple iterations in a repeating battle that most resembles a deadly game scenario. They hope eventually to stumble upon its origin story: the company before it became the Company, when it could still be destroyed. In some versions of reality there is nothing left but the Company, its grinding machinery still energised by poisoned rivers. In other realities, the Company has been destroyed and the City that serves it has been reduced to a ruin, polluted and rendered alien by vast, voiceless creatures from the quantum void. Especially treacherous are the versions of reality where life appears to be going on as normal: \u201cEverything the Company did destroyed someone, killed someone, even if it helped someone else. The rest was subterfuge, and no suit to protect against it.\u201d</p> <p>The critique of corporate capitalism is clear to see, and this first act, strange and abstracted though it is, is not without precedent. Fans of weird literature are sure to find echoes of Gene Wolfe\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/nov/23/the-book-of-the-new-sun-science-fiction-ulysses\" title=\"\">The Book of the New Sun</a></em>, Zachary Jernigan\u2019s underappreciated Jeroun books, even Stephen King\u2019s Dark Tower series. It is not in VanderMeer\u2019s game plan, however, to let us get too cosy, and as the novel progresses it begins to shed its archetypes, fragmenting into a series of variously interconnected accounts from different narrators. We experience his world from the point of view of Botch, a gigantic mutated fish feeding off Charlie X\u2019s discarded experiments. We encounter Charlie himself, a boy then man abused by his monstrous father, driven finally to madness and \u2013 like Victor Frankenstein \u2013 beyond redemption:</p> <blockquote> <p>It wasn\u2019t Charlie X\u2019s fault, in a way, even though it was all his fault. Charlie X just thought in the old way. Plants couldn\u2019t feel pain, animals were objects to be manipulated as products or resources \u2026 and it mattered little if the pure part of beauty was blood. It had become a death cult, under a veneer of what was inevitable and necessary, and anything else was illogical.</p> </blockquote> <p>When we finally meet Sarah we discover her homeless in a world that feels disturbingly familiar, much closer to our own time than to any far future. The Company exists but still in prototype, a fume-belching, coal-fired anachronism. Sarah believes she can see demons, and it comes as no surprise when she is visited by three astronauts from the future. The mysterious visitors are looking for Charlie X\u2019s journal, which Sarah has found beneath a bridge on a rubbish-strewn river bank.</p> <blockquote> <p>Then come diagrams of creatures that look like autopsies or recipes. Some almost whimsical. A plant that becomes a sea anemone that becomes a squid. Others like levels of hell. Bear-men and men like bears. Scenes of slaughter you pass quickly. More \u201cinstructions\u201d in sentences and paragraphs in a language you don\u2019t understand. Spanish in high school and some knowledge of Russian, so you know other alphabets. But this matches nothing you\u2019ve ever seen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Images and leitmotifs recur, a dizzying interplay of references \u2013 the burning shed, the tunnel, the bridge \u2013 that remain mysterious and yet act as an anchor, a cumulative weight of symbolism that gradually awakens the reader to a blasted form of thematic coherence. We are offered glimpses of scenes and characters familiar from VanderMeer\u2019s previous novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/15/borne-by-jeff-vandermeer-review\" title=\"\">Borne</a></em>, to which <em>Dead Astronauts</em> is loosely linked.</p> <p>The typographical games that characterise these latter sections \u2013 paler and heavier typeface, isolated strips of text on an otherwise black page, figures in the margins reminiscent of biblical verse-numbering, only counting backwards \u2013 recall Mark Z Danielewski\u2019s 2000 metafictional horror novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/15/fiction.reviews\" title=\"\">House of Leaves</a></em> or more recently Nicola Barker\u2019s 2017 dystopia <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/14/happy-nicola-barker-review-science-fiction-dystopian-vision\" title=\"\">H(a)ppy</a></em>. How far readers will tolerate such self-conscious gamesmanship will come down to individual taste. For this reader at least, this kind of formal innovation is pure catnip, an indication that as a mode of literary expression the novel is still vigorous, still developing and still important.</p> <p>Far from being pointless or posturing, such devices serve as a reminder that the novel is not simply a narrative, it is also text, and that language can have an agenda apart from story. The effect of language as raw material exerts itself in ways that are not always easily explicable but \u2013 like poetry \u2013 reach beyond organised thought and into sensation.<em> Dead Astronauts </em>transmits its core concerns around environmental breakdown through the splintering of narrative into its component parts. The blue fox\u2019s story, which occupies much of the last quarter of the novel, includes many pages of text that consist of the same dozen words or phrases, repeated many times with only minor variations. There is a temptation to skip over such passages, yet in their obsessive reiterations they begin gradually to take on the quality of music, a whispered continuo that is both creepy and beguiling, conveying their message with a subtextual intensity that would be difficult to achieve through more conventional means.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/20/are-we-alone-sf-science-fiction-speculative-jeff-vandermeer\">Are we alone? SF is as sure a guide as any</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Climate fiction is an important strand in contemporary literature, so much so that in its repeating imagery, its insistent narrative of imminent catastrophe, it may begin to seem over-familiar and thus lose its urgency. As a writer of fantasy, VanderMeer has always eschewed the more derivative aspects of world-building, preferring instead to employ speculative conceits as a means of stretching the envelope of the possible. From his 2014 Southern Reach trilogy onwards, it has become clear there is no subject more important to him than the degrading and disastrous effect of human activity on fragile ecosystems. Employing stylistic and linguistic devices that reach beyond narrative, the author deliberately deconstructs the very concept of familiarity and forces us up against his subject matter in a way that demands we not only engage with it, but recognise its vast importance to our lives and futures.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Dead Astronauts by Jeff VanderMeer is published by Fourth Estate (RRP \u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "A genuinely innovative artwork requires time to fulfil its effect. Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s Dead Astronauts is one such work \u2013 bewildering, perplexing, original \u2013 and I would recommend that readers allow it the concentration it demands. The opening third poses as a quest narrative, a fantastical variant of the classic western: three battle-scarred gunslingers set out across an ecologically ravaged landscape in pursuit of an enemy. Our heroes are Grayson, a black woman and sole survivor of a disastrously failed mission to explore deep space; Chen, an indentured worker bound in perpetuity to an invasive corporation known only as the Company; and Moss, whose name was once Sarah, now a complex, composite organism who has been partially absorbed into the structure of the worlds they move through. The enemy they seek to defeat is the Company itself, and more specifically its agent, a deranged Dr Moreau-type biologist named Charlie X. The three are helped along their journey by Charlie\u2019s failed experiments: the blue fox, the duck with the broken wing, the leviathan called Botch, a hive-mind of salamanders. The astronauts project themselves through time, engaging the Company across multiple iterations in a repeating battle that most resembles a deadly game scenario. They hope eventually to stumble upon its origin story: the company before it became the Company, when it could still be destroyed. In some versions of reality there is nothing left but the Company, its grinding machinery still energised by poisoned rivers. In other realities, the Company has been destroyed and the City that serves it has been reduced to a ruin, polluted and rendered alien by vast, voiceless creatures from the quantum void. Especially treacherous are the versions of reality where life appears to be going on as normal: \u201cEverything the Company did destroyed someone, killed someone, even if it helped someone else. The rest was subterfuge, and no suit to protect against it.\u201d The critique of corporate capitalism is clear to see, and this first act, strange and abstracted though it is, is not without precedent. Fans of weird literature are sure to find echoes of Gene Wolfe\u2019s The Book of the New Sun, Zachary Jernigan\u2019s underappreciated Jeroun books, even Stephen King\u2019s Dark Tower series. It is not in VanderMeer\u2019s game plan, however, to let us get too cosy, and as the novel progresses it begins to shed its archetypes, fragmenting into a series of variously interconnected accounts from different narrators. We experience his world from the point of view of Botch, a gigantic mutated fish feeding off Charlie X\u2019s discarded experiments. We encounter Charlie himself, a boy then man abused by his monstrous father, driven finally to madness and \u2013 like Victor Frankenstein \u2013 beyond redemption: It wasn\u2019t Charlie X\u2019s fault, in a way, even though it was all his fault. Charlie X just thought in the old way. Plants couldn\u2019t feel pain, animals were objects to be manipulated as products or resources \u2026 and it mattered little if the pure part of beauty was blood. It had become a death cult, under a veneer of what was inevitable and necessary, and anything else was illogical. When we finally meet Sarah we discover her homeless in a world that feels disturbingly familiar, much closer to our own time than to any far future. The Company exists but still in prototype, a fume-belching, coal-fired anachronism. Sarah believes she can see demons, and it comes as no surprise when she is visited by three astronauts from the future. The mysterious visitors are looking for Charlie X\u2019s journal, which Sarah has found beneath a bridge on a rubbish-strewn river bank. Then come diagrams of creatures that look like autopsies or recipes. Some almost whimsical. A plant that becomes a sea anemone that becomes a squid. Others like levels of hell. Bear-men and men like bears. Scenes of slaughter you pass quickly. More \u201cinstructions\u201d in sentences and paragraphs in a language you don\u2019t understand. Spanish in high school and some knowledge of Russian, so you know other alphabets. But this matches nothing you\u2019ve ever seen. Images and leitmotifs recur, a dizzying interplay of references \u2013 the burning shed, the tunnel, the bridge \u2013 that remain mysterious and yet act as an anchor, a cumulative weight of symbolism that gradually awakens the reader to a blasted form of thematic coherence. We are offered glimpses of scenes and characters familiar from VanderMeer\u2019s previous novel, Borne, to which Dead Astronauts is loosely linked. The typographical games that characterise these latter sections \u2013 paler and heavier typeface, isolated strips of text on an otherwise black page, figures in the margins reminiscent of biblical verse-numbering, only counting backwards \u2013 recall Mark Z Danielewski\u2019s 2000 metafictional horror novel House of Leaves or more recently Nicola Barker\u2019s 2017 dystopia H(a)ppy. How far readers will tolerate such self-conscious gamesmanship will come down to individual taste. For this reader at least, this kind of formal innovation is pure catnip, an indication that as a mode of literary expression the novel is still vigorous, still developing and still important. Far from being pointless or posturing, such devices serve as a reminder that the novel is not simply a narrative, it is also text, and that language can have an agenda apart from story. The effect of language as raw material exerts itself in ways that are not always easily explicable but \u2013 like poetry \u2013 reach beyond organised thought and into sensation. Dead Astronauts transmits its core concerns around environmental breakdown through the splintering of narrative into its component parts. The blue fox\u2019s story, which occupies much of the last quarter of the novel, includes many pages of text that consist of the same dozen words or phrases, repeated many times with only minor variations. There is a temptation to skip over such passages, yet in their obsessive reiterations they begin gradually to take on the quality of music, a whispered continuo that is both creepy and beguiling, conveying their message with a subtextual intensity that would be difficult to achieve through more conventional means. Climate fiction is an important strand in contemporary literature, so much so that in its repeating imagery, its insistent narrative of imminent catastrophe, it may begin to seem over-familiar and thus lose its urgency. As a writer of fantasy, VanderMeer has always eschewed the more derivative aspects of world-building, preferring instead to employ speculative conceits as a means of stretching the envelope of the possible. From his 2014 Southern Reach trilogy onwards, it has become clear there is no subject more important to him than the degrading and disastrous effect of human activity on fragile ecosystems. Employing stylistic and linguistic devices that reach beyond narrative, the author deliberately deconstructs the very concept of familiarity and forces us up against his subject matter in a way that demands we not only engage with it, but recognise its vast importance to our lives and futures. \u2022 Dead Astronauts by Jeff VanderMeer is published by Fourth Estate (RRP \u00a314.99).

The Royal Liverpool University Hospital, and the Metropolitan Midland, outside Birmingham, were Carillion\u2019s two most high-profile contracts. The National Audit Office will publish a report on Friday into the cost to taxpayers of ensuring that the two hospitals are finally delivered.

Nancy<strong> </strong>Pelosi signed the articles (with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/15/pen-t-up-anger-republicans-pounce-on-pelosi-over-ceremonial-writing-tools\">contentious ceremonial pens</a>), which were placed in folders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/15/trump-articles-impeachment-march-capitol\">moved in a procession at sunset from the House to the Senate</a>.

McConnell asked his fellow senators to rise above partisanship. \u201cThis is a difficult time for our country \u2013 but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate.\u201d Trump was impeached<strong> </strong>for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over a scheme in which he is alleged to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/15/lev-parnas-ukraine-donald-trump-rudy-giuliani\">pressured Ukraine to announce false investigations</a> of the former vice-president, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter and then fought an inquiry into the scheme. He is the third president in US history to face an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/14/trump-impeachment-pelosi-articles-senate-whats-next\">impeachment trial in the Senate</a> but his removal from office is a distant likelihood, with Republican loyalists vowing to protect him. The White House released a statement saying \u201cPresident Trump has done nothing wrong\u201d and \u201cexpects to be fully exonerated\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Oxford diversity jumps \u2013 </strong>A record 70% of Oxford University\u2019s undergraduates next year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jan/16/record-numbers-of-state-school-pupils-given-oxford-places\">will come from state schools</a>. Five years ago state school applicants to Oxford received just 56% of undergraduate offers and 43% went to those educated at independent schools, despite a substantial imbalance in the numbers applying. The university found itself regularly criticised for ignoring well-qualified, state-educated students, especially from black or disadvantaged backgrounds. Target Oxbridge \u2013 a diversity recruitment programme which has the author Zadie Smith as a patron \u2013 says it has helped a record number of British students of black heritage gain places at Oxford and Cambridge. Naomi Kellman, one of its founders, said: \u201cWe started with just six students in 2012, and so it is amazing to see the programme now supporting over 70 black British students to secure Oxbridge offers.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Only safe pint a shared pint? </strong>Alcohol is the leading cause of drug harm, outstripping heroin and crack cocaine, according to the former government adviser David Nutt.

Archaea still exist but many species are found in inhospitable environments and are incredibly difficult to grow in the lab.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Difficult time for our country\u2019 Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray with the stories shaping the day. The US House of Representatives has sent articles of impeachment against Donald Trump to the Senate, setting in motion a trial that could unearth damaging evidence of misconduct against the president as the 2020 election contest heats up. Nancy Pelosi signed the articles (with contentious ceremonial pens), which were placed in folders and moved in a procession at sunset from the House to the Senate. The Senate invited House members to return to formally \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles on Thursday. The Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the chamber would hold opening arguments on Tuesday. McConnell asked his fellow senators to rise above partisanship. \u201cThis is a difficult time for our country \u2013 but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate.\u201d Trump was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over a scheme in which he is alleged to have pressured Ukraine to announce false investigations of the former vice-president, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter and then fought an inquiry into the scheme. He is the third president in US history to face an impeachment trial in the Senate but his removal from office is a distant likelihood, with Republican loyalists vowing to protect him. The White House released a statement saying \u201cPresident Trump has done nothing wrong\u201d and \u201cexpects to be fully exonerated\u201d. * * * Oxford diversity jumps \u2013 A record 70% of Oxford University\u2019s undergraduates next year will come from state schools. Five years ago state school applicants to Oxford received just 56% of undergraduate offers and 43% went to those educated at independent schools, despite a substantial imbalance in the numbers applying. The university found itself regularly criticised for ignoring well-qualified, state-educated students, especially from black or disadvantaged backgrounds. Target Oxbridge \u2013 a diversity recruitment programme which has the author Zadie Smith as a patron \u2013 says it has helped a record number of British students of black heritage gain places at Oxford and Cambridge. Naomi Kellman, one of its founders, said: \u201cWe started with just six students in 2012, and so it is amazing to see the programme now supporting over 70 black British students to secure Oxbridge offers.\u201d * * * Only safe pint a shared pint? Alcohol is the leading cause of drug harm, outstripping heroin and crack cocaine, according to the former government adviser David Nutt. The professor was sacked as chair of the drugs advisory committee in October 2009 for his views. According to Nutt, the optimal dose of alcohol is 5gm a day, which is about a third of a glass of wine or half a pint of light beer. \u201cOrder a pint or glass of wine and three straws and share it with two friends,\u201d he recommends. \u201cWe see a continual attempt to undermine the concept of alcohol harm by saying it has health benefits\u201d yet it is the leading cause of death in men under the age of 24, Nutt said. He has argued that prohibition of recreational drugs has frequently led to more dangerous substances that kill more people arriving on the black market, such as fentanyl and spice. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a death in prison from cannabis, but last year there were over 60 deaths from spice.\u201d * * * Poll predicts tighter Labour race \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey is expected to win the backing of Momentum after a poll placed her ahead of closest rival for the Labour leadership, Keir Starmer. The shadow business secretary came out ahead of the shadow Brexit secretary based on first preferences in the poll, conducted by Survation of more than 3,800 LabourList readers. Starmer receives most second preferences but they are not enough to eliminate Long-Bailey\u2019s first-round lead. The poll will be viewed as a boost for Long-Bailey, who was well behind in a previous poll by YouGov for the Party Members Project that had her losing to Starmer by 61% to 39% in the last round. * * * Breakthrough clue to complex life\u2019s origins \u2013 Scientists have succeeded in culturing an elusive species of archaea microbes, believed to a precursor to the Earth\u2019s first sophisticated living cells, known as eukaryotes. The theory goes that for the first two billion years life on Earth comprised two microbial kingdoms \u2013 bacteria and archaea \u2013 until they somehow merged to create eukaryotes, which went on to form the basis of all complex life from plants to humans. Archaea still exist but many species are found in inhospitable environments and are incredibly difficult to grow in the lab.

The DofE scheme, best known for intrepid, all-weather expeditions into the countryside, has drawn up the checklist of 25 experiences. Other suggestions include public speaking, learning a foreign language, work experience, spending time getting to know an older person and volunteering for a charity. DofE has drawn up \u201cThe Experience List: 25 of the best character hacks for teens\u201d. Ruth Marvel, DofE\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWhether taking part in the DofE or not, all young people should have access to the kind of experiences on the list.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Who can lead Labour back to government? The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour party has been narrowed to five candidates. Political editor Heather Stewart looks at the challenge ahead for the party as it faces five more years of opposition. Plus: John Abraham on the warming of the oceans.

Business The UK-based electric van maker Arrival has secured an \u00a385m investment from South Korean car firms Hyundai and Kia \u2013 a cash injection that values the business at \u00a33bn, defying the struggles of the British automotive industry. It has a factory in Banbury but plans to build \u201cmicrofactories\u201d near major markets such as Los Angeles and New York that it says would be profitable producing only a few thousands vans a year. Arrival\u2019s first product is a battery-powered electric van priced at the same level as comparable petrol or diesel vehicles and targeted at urban delivery.

      "body": "<p>Rimini is best-known for its vast swathe of Adriatic beach \u2013 and as the birthplace of revered film director Federico Fellini. The visionary behind La Dolce Vita and 8\u00bd is regarded by fans and critics as one of the world\u2019s greatest film-makers. I explored \u201chis\u201d city, including its Old Town, where Fellini grew up, taking in history and architecture that spans Roman to Renaissance, art nouveau to right-about-now in its compact, wanderable streets.</p> <p>Fellini was born 100 years ago this month and spent his first 19 years in Rimini. The city, or his memories of it, has a starring role in several of his films \u2013 Amarcord (local dialect for \u201cI Remember\u201d) and I Vitelloni (The Layabouts) in particular, but appears in scenes in many others. He didn\u2019t do any shooting here, but lovingly reconstructed his home town at the <a href=\"https://cinecittastudios.it/\" title=\"\">Cinecitt\u00e0 </a><a href=\"https://cinecittastudios.it/\" title=\"\">studios</a> in Rome, and found surrogate stretches of beach just outside the capital. This year, Rimini will be celebrating its most famous son in a way that will leave a lasting legacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2020-01-15T15:50:32.html\" data-alt=\"Rimini map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2020-01-15T15:50:32.html\">Rimini map</a> </figure>  <p>Aromas of sausage, truffle and coffee wafted through the winter air as I walked cobbled streets towards Piazza Cavour, the heart of Rimini since the middle ages. Along one side are the facades of the 17th-century town hall, the medieval <a href=\"http://www.rimini-tourism.com/en/rimini-attractions/historic-edifices-and-archeological-sites/podesta-palace.html\" title=\"\">Palazzo del Podest\u00e0</a> and the 700-year-old <a href=\"http://www.riminiturismo.it/visitatori/scopri-il-territorio/arte-e-cultura/ville/palazzo-dellarengo\" title=\"\">Palazzo dell\u2019Arengo</a> \u2013 the latter two due to open on 14 March as a new contemporary art museum. In Amarcord, his 1973 Oscar-winner, Fellini has a strange parade for a fascist leader descend from the tower here. Amarcord is the film most closely associated with his view of Rimini, which he described in a 1960s essay entitled My Home Town, as \u201cconfused, frightening, tender, with that great breath of its own and its empty open sea\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce3f7f7186195ee14d9d4d6322d3963896b15b36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce3f7f7186195ee14d9d4d6322d3963896b15b36/163_751_4649_4647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fellini, with megaphone, directing Amarcord.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fellini, with megaphone, directing Amarcord.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dominating the end of the square, the neoclassical <a href=\"http://www.teatrogalli.it/\" title=\"\">Teatro Amintore Galli</a> sits on recently unearthed Roman remains. The theatre was opened by renowned composer Giuseppe Verdi in 1857 and reopened, after extensive restoration, just over a year ago \u2013 75 years after it suffered major damage during a second world war air raid.</p> <p>In Amarcord, Fellini turns the theatre into a church, introducing the other institution which, alongside fascism, shaped his 1930s upbringing. These terrors of his teens no longer hold such sway, but Rimini\u2019s extraordinary Renaissance cathedral, the <a href=\"http://www.diocesi.rimini.it/parrocchie-e-chiese/parrocchie/basilica-cattedrale-tempio-malatestiano/\" title=\"\">Tempio </a><a href=\"http://www.diocesi.rimini.it/parrocchie-e-chiese/parrocchie/basilica-cattedrale-tempio-malatestiano/\" title=\"\">Malatestiano</a> (with a disturbing Giotto crucifixion and a Piero della Francesca fresco) was still unsettling. I found its uncomfortable combination of empty and embellished, absorbing and belittling, very much as Fellini described it \u201cinspiring \u2026 and slightly sinister\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61922e591c92812b66562ef2f45a13d182c45323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61922e591c92812b66562ef2f45a13d182c45323/189_304_5080_3048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tempio Malatestiano, Rimini\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tempio Malatestiano</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilberto Urbinati</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From Piazza Cavour, I wandered down the arcaded former fish market - its thick stone slabs now flower stalls and meeting spots \u2013 to a cluster of cafes and restaurants. Some were traditional, with older men deep into their newspapers; others were very much of the 21st century, such as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Lahorafeliz.rimini/\" title=\"\">La Hora Feliz</a>, where a cocktail and an all-you-can-eat<em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/dec/19/italy-students-food-apericena-aperitivo-buffet-bars\" title=\"\">apericena</a></em> buffet of mussels, beans, prosciutto, ricotta, meat, fish and pastas costs \u20ac11.</p> <p>Fellini\u2019s masterpieces frequently feature in lists of the top films of all time but his stature rests also on his impact. His episodic, carnivalesque style has been cited as an influence by directors including Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Sofia Coppola and Pedro Almod\u00f3var. And when Stanley Kubrick was asked for a list of his favourite films, he put I Vitelloni at number one.</p> <p>Sadly, Fellini\u2019s favourite bar is now an H&amp;M but there are plenty of other places to sit and gaze at the world with a Fellinian eye. I watched as a monochrome man shuffled past, all in grey but for a multicoloured scarf like a beacon in a black-and-white print. A child danced across the square. I almost expected a perfect peacock to settle on the Renaissance fountain, as it does in Amarcord.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ae6c9994a3f503c8d56688d5540e5e78bda10208\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae6c9994a3f503c8d56688d5540e5e78bda10208/0_73_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cinema Fulgor, Rimini, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cinema Fulgor</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Visitors who time things right can see that scene on the big screen at the city\u2019s art-nouveau <a href=\"https://www.cinemafulgorrimini.it/en/\" title=\"\">Cinema Fulgor</a>, which shows Amarcord at least once every three weeks. It\u2019s the only Fellini film seen regularly in Rimini because it\u2019s the one that\u2019s affordable: its copyright is owned by the region. Cinema Fulgor turns 100 this year and has been recently refurbished to designs by Fellini\u2019s friend and triple-Oscar-winning production designer Dante Ferretti. It has become a Fellini fantasy, with a red velvet-and-gold auditorium and a staircase of curves reminiscent of some of Fellini\u2019s most memorable female characters.</p> <p>There\u2019s a new exhibition about the director \u2013 with photos, film clips, costumes, props and cartoons drawn by him \u2013 in the city\u2019s Renaissance castle. A \u201cdark presence\u201d to young Fellini (it was then the city prison), Castel Sismondo hosts <a href=\"https://www.mostrafellini100.it/index-en.html\" title=\"\">Fellini 100: Immortal Genius</a> until 13 April, a sizable taster show in advance of the opening of the Federico Fellini International Museum in December 2020. This will occupy the castle, the upper floors of Cinema Fulgor and the outdoor space between them. Here, Amarcord will come full circle: A recreation of the Cinecitt\u00e0 reconstructed Rimini set will soon appear on the streets of its original model.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8735b5736e526c9be4118b45f0a470a17f7f89e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8735b5736e526c9be4118b45f0a470a17f7f89e1/0_0_1360_816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Castel Sismondo, Rimini, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Castel Sismondo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilio Salvatori</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wandering into the city\u2019s other main square, Piazza Tre Martiri, I found the tiny green-domed Renaissance chapel of St Anthony. It was here that an adolescent Fellini and his friends watched country women pray before mounting their bicycles, and gazed at the \u201coutlining, swelling \u2026 biggest and finest bums in the whole of Romagna\u201d (a scene recreated in Amarcord). Rimini remains a city of cyclists.</p> <p>The railway station is on the edge of the old town, and opposite is a new Bike Park, for cycle storage, but which will soon also rent bicycles. A 15-minute walk away, by the coast, <a href=\"https://www.biketourrimini.it/\">Bike Tour Rimini</a> is a good place to hire cycles. Bikes are included in the room rate at Soggiorni Diffusi, a B&amp;B spread across three separate houses just across the Roman bridge in Borgo San Giuliano, the now-gentrified fishermen\u2019s quarter. My favourite house was I Felliniani, complete with Fellini mural and three Fellini-themed rooms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2bbffb8545bbd92670d9bf01eb80bf62cf6146c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bbffb8545bbd92670d9bf01eb80bf62cf6146c9/0_0_3547_2128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fellini-inspired murals in Piazzetta Gabena, Borgo San Giuliano, Rimini, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fellini-inspired murals in Piazzetta Gabena, Borgo San Giuliano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilberto Urbinati</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a wander through the borgo, spotting more Fellini murals (including the kiss in the Trevi Fountain from 1960s La Dolce Vita), I went to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nudecrud/\" title=\"\">Nud e Crud</a> for a Rimini speciality, a <em>piad</em><em>a</em>.

      "bodyText": "Rimini is best-known for its vast swathe of Adriatic beach \u2013 and as the birthplace of revered film director Federico Fellini. The visionary behind La Dolce Vita and 8\u00bd is regarded by fans and critics as one of the world\u2019s greatest film-makers. I explored \u201chis\u201d city, including its Old Town, where Fellini grew up, taking in history and architecture that spans Roman to Renaissance, art nouveau to right-about-now in its compact, wanderable streets. Fellini was born 100 years ago this month and spent his first 19 years in Rimini. The city, or his memories of it, has a starring role in several of his films \u2013 Amarcord (local dialect for \u201cI Remember\u201d) and I Vitelloni (The Layabouts) in particular, but appears in scenes in many others. He didn\u2019t do any shooting here, but lovingly reconstructed his home town at the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios in Rome, and found surrogate stretches of beach just outside the capital. This year, Rimini will be celebrating its most famous son in a way that will leave a lasting legacy. Aromas of sausage, truffle and coffee wafted through the winter air as I walked cobbled streets towards Piazza Cavour, the heart of Rimini since the middle ages. Along one side are the facades of the 17th-century town hall, the medieval Palazzo del Podest\u00e0 and the 700-year-old Palazzo dell\u2019Arengo \u2013 the latter two due to open on 14 March as a new contemporary art museum. In Amarcord, his 1973 Oscar-winner, Fellini has a strange parade for a fascist leader descend from the tower here. Amarcord is the film most closely associated with his view of Rimini, which he described in a 1960s essay entitled My Home Town, as \u201cconfused, frightening, tender, with that great breath of its own and its empty open sea\u201d. Dominating the end of the square, the neoclassical Teatro Amintore Galli sits on recently unearthed Roman remains. The theatre was opened by renowned composer Giuseppe Verdi in 1857 and reopened, after extensive restoration, just over a year ago \u2013 75 years after it suffered major damage during a second world war air raid. In Amarcord, Fellini turns the theatre into a church, introducing the other institution which, alongside fascism, shaped his 1930s upbringing. These terrors of his teens no longer hold such sway, but Rimini\u2019s extraordinary Renaissance cathedral, the Tempio Malatestiano (with a disturbing Giotto crucifixion and a Piero della Francesca fresco) was still unsettling. I found its uncomfortable combination of empty and embellished, absorbing and belittling, very much as Fellini described it \u201cinspiring \u2026 and slightly sinister\u201d. From Piazza Cavour, I wandered down the arcaded former fish market - its thick stone slabs now flower stalls and meeting spots \u2013 to a cluster of cafes and restaurants. Some were traditional, with older men deep into their newspapers; others were very much of the 21st century, such as La Hora Feliz, where a cocktail and an all-you-can-eat apericena buffet of mussels, beans, prosciutto, ricotta, meat, fish and pastas costs \u20ac11. Fellini\u2019s masterpieces frequently feature in lists of the top films of all time but his stature rests also on his impact. His episodic, carnivalesque style has been cited as an influence by directors including Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Sofia Coppola and Pedro Almod\u00f3var. And when Stanley Kubrick was asked for a list of his favourite films, he put I Vitelloni at number one. Sadly, Fellini\u2019s favourite bar is now an H&amp;M but there are plenty of other places to sit and gaze at the world with a Fellinian eye. I watched as a monochrome man shuffled past, all in grey but for a multicoloured scarf like a beacon in a black-and-white print. A child danced across the square. I almost expected a perfect peacock to settle on the Renaissance fountain, as it does in Amarcord. Visitors who time things right can see that scene on the big screen at the city\u2019s art-nouveau Cinema Fulgor, which shows Amarcord at least once every three weeks. It\u2019s the only Fellini film seen regularly in Rimini because it\u2019s the one that\u2019s affordable: its copyright is owned by the region. Cinema Fulgor turns 100 this year and has been recently refurbished to designs by Fellini\u2019s friend and triple-Oscar-winning production designer Dante Ferretti. It has become a Fellini fantasy, with a red velvet-and-gold auditorium and a staircase of curves reminiscent of some of Fellini\u2019s most memorable female characters. There\u2019s a new exhibition about the director \u2013 with photos, film clips, costumes, props and cartoons drawn by him \u2013 in the city\u2019s Renaissance castle. A \u201cdark presence\u201d to young Fellini (it was then the city prison), Castel Sismondo hosts Fellini 100: Immortal Genius until 13 April, a sizable taster show in advance of the opening of the Federico Fellini International Museum in December 2020. This will occupy the castle, the upper floors of Cinema Fulgor and the outdoor space between them. Here, Amarcord will come full circle: A recreation of the Cinecitt\u00e0 reconstructed Rimini set will soon appear on the streets of its original model. Wandering into the city\u2019s other main square, Piazza Tre Martiri, I found the tiny green-domed Renaissance chapel of St Anthony. It was here that an adolescent Fellini and his friends watched country women pray before mounting their bicycles, and gazed at the \u201coutlining, swelling \u2026 biggest and finest bums in the whole of Romagna\u201d (a scene recreated in Amarcord). Rimini remains a city of cyclists. The railway station is on the edge of the old town, and opposite is a new Bike Park, for cycle storage, but which will soon also rent bicycles. A 15-minute walk away, by the coast, Bike Tour Rimini is a good place to hire cycles. Bikes are included in the room rate at Soggiorni Diffusi, a B&amp;B spread across three separate houses just across the Roman bridge in Borgo San Giuliano, the now-gentrified fishermen\u2019s quarter. My favourite house was I Felliniani, complete with Fellini mural and three Fellini-themed rooms. After a wander through the borgo, spotting more Fellini murals (including the kiss in the Trevi Fountain from 1960s La Dolce Vita), I went to Nud e Crud for a Rimini speciality, a piada. It\u2019s a flatbread traditionally filled with prosciutto, squacquerone (local soft cheese) and rocket. Fortified, I set off on the 15-minute stroll to the coast. Out of season the broad, sandy beach was empty, and very Fellini. \u201cVanishing into Rimini\u2019s winter mists, lowered shutters, locked up boarding houses \u2026 the sound of the sea \u2026 from which come our monsters and ghosts,\u201d he wrote. In summer, the beach is lost to sunbeds and sunseekers but his spirit remains year-round at the Grand Hotel, the still-splendid art-nouveau property on the waterfront. It was here that the young Fellini got his first glimpse of la dolce vita and here that \u2013 as a famous director, visiting from Rome \u2013 he always stayed. I visited his favourite suite (guests can book it) with its red velvet furniture and view of the hotel gardens. This is where, in 1993, Fellini suffered the stroke that led to his death in Rome, a few months later. His body is buried in Rimini\u2019s cemetery, and I arrived at the grave, a dramatic abstraction of the prow of a ship, as darkness was falling. As I stood there, a cat, a sleek white-and-tabby, strolled up, rubbed itself against the grave and leapt into the monument before reappearing to look down at me from the high prow of the ship. Pure Fellini. \u2022 The trip was provided by Emilia-Romagna Tourism. Soggiorni Diffusi has doubles from \u20ac80 B&amp;B; Grand Hotel has doubles from \u20ac129 B&amp;B.

Fire-hit regions of NSW\u2019s Snowy Valley and south coast, and Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland and north-east, received as much as 15mm of desperately needed rain on Wednesday and Thursday, while severe thunderstorms caused flooding in Melbourne. However, more than 80 fires in NSW and 18 in Victoria continued to burn on Thursday, and lightning started two new fires in Victoria\u2019s Great Otway national park, on the state\u2019s south coast. The NSW Rural Fire Service and Victorian Country Fire Authority said the rain they had received was not enough to put out existing fires. A spokesman for the CFA said they had seen rain activity but \u201cunfortunately it had minimal impact in suppressing the fire activity across east and north-east Victoria\u201d. \u201cAlthough this rain won\u2019t extinguish all fires, it will certainly go a long way towards containment,\u201d the RFS said. Australia\u2019s unprecedented bushfire season has so far burnt through more than 10m hectares of land, killed 28 people and destroyed thousands of homes nationwide. More rain is forecast for Thursday and Friday, with a total of 10mm in Albury, near the giant cross-border fire burning up into the NSW Snowy Valley, and 10mm in Omeo in East Gippsland on Thursday. Up to 15mm was forecast at Perisher Valley in the Snowy Valley and 10-15mm for the NSW south coast on Thursday. Severe thunderstorm warnings have been issued for nearly the whole of eastern NSW. In Victoria, a thunderstorm warning was issued for Corryong, near the north-eastern cross-border fire, one of the largest bushfire complexes in the country. As of Thursday, it was still burning across state lines, from Corryong in Victoria\u2019s northern country into the NSW Snowy Valley. The huge fire is the result of multiple fires merging last week during hot, dry and windy weather. Across 24 hours, 15mm fell at Buchan and 1.8mm at Orbost in East Gippsland, where fires forced the evacuation of thousands in December and January. Only 2mm fell at Adaminaby in NSW, near the Adaminaby Complex fire, which is part of the same cross-border fire. But 10mm fell across Ulladulla, on the NSW south coast near the Currowan fire. And 48mm fell at Faulconbridge, just south of the Gospers Mountain megafire, which at 512,626 hectares is larger than Long Island and Manhattan combined, and more than three times the size of Greater London. The town of Bilpin, which was hit by the Gospers Mountain fire, received 11m. In Melbourne, a day of heavy smoke, hazardous air quality and health warnings was suddenly replaced on Wednesday afternoon by severe thunderstorms, and the possibility of giant hail. In the suburb of St Albans, 54mm of rain fell in 30 minutes, and flash flooding was reported across the city and the south of Victoria. The rain brought joy to firefighters, farmers and residents across the states, regardless of the amount. But on Tuesday, the Bureau of Meteorology had warned that sudden heavy rain could be \u201ca double-edged sword\u201d that could cause flooding and landslides in fire-ravaged areas. \u201cBurnt-out areas of NSW and Victoria are now vulnerable to landslips and trees coming down,\u201d the bureau meteorologist Sarah Scully said.",

The commitment will be part of the biggest shakeup of British agriculture in 40 years and requires a regular report to MPs outlining supply sources and household expenditure on food, as well as consumer confidence in food safety. The move reflects concerns over potential disruptions post-Brexit, as more than a quarter of Britain\u2019s food comes from the EU and nearly a fifth from other countries. The revision is one of a handful to the agriculture bill, introduced to parliament on Thursday more than a year after the previous government was forced to abandon the legislation amid Brexit turmoil. Other changes include a stronger emphasis on the soil, at risk from overuse, erosion and nutrient loss; farmers are to receive help maintaining healthy soils, as well as with improvements to the tracing of livestock movements between farms. There will be powers to regulate fertiliser use and organic farming after Brexit. Missing from the bill is a binding commitment to prevent trade deals allowing the import of food produced to lower standards than those to which British farmers must adhere. This has been a key demand of farmers concerned that after Brexit they will be undercut by cheap imports from the US and Asia, with lower food safety and animal welfare regulations. Theresa Villiers, secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, called the revised bill \u201cone of the most important environmental reforms for many years\u201d and said it would protect nature and biodiversity and help meet goals on the climate crisis. \u201c[This] will transform British farming, enabling a balance between food production and the environment which will safeguard our countryside and farming communities for the future,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will move away from the EU\u2019s bureaucratic common agricultural policy and towards a fairer system which rewards our hard-working farmers for delivering public goods, celebrating their world-leading environmental work and innovative, modern, approach to food production.\u201d At the heart of the bill is a shift away from the EU system, where farmers receive subsidies based on the amount of land they farm, to a process whereby farmers are paid for the public goods provided, including clean water, clean air, healthy soils and habitats for wildlife. There will be a seven-year transition period for farmers to move from the current regulations under CAP, the EU\u2019s common agricultural policy, to a system of environmental land management contracts. Under these contracts, individual farmers will agree with the government a tailor-made set of goals with details on the measures they will take to manage their land and protect the environment.

Farming leaders were disappointed at the lack of a legal commitment to ensure trade deals did not allow entry to cheap, low quality, imports. Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, said: \u201cFarmers across the country still want to see legislation underpinning the government\u2019s assurances that they will not allow the imports of food produced to standards that would be illegal here through future trade deals.

      "body": "<p>When Gene and Sandy Ralston returned to their truck after a day on the Beardsley reservoir in northern California in March 2002, they discovered several handwritten notes taped to the doors and windscreen: \u201cCall Lieutenant Lunney as soon as you get back to town. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p> <p>The Ralstons, a married couple from rural Idaho, had been scientists until the late 1980s, when they began helping out on local search and rescue missions. By the winter of 2002, they had volunteered on more than a dozen searches for victims of drowning across the US, and had developed an uncanny ability to find bodies. They had just helped Lt Lunney\u2019s sheriff\u2019s department locate the remains of a man who had drowned in the reservoir three-and-a-half years earlier, after falling off his boat while fishing. Divers had brought him back to the surface that afternoon.</p> <p>As the notes instructed, the Ralstons drove to the nearby town of Sonora to meet Lunney. Their expertise was needed by some other folks, he said, although he wasn\u2019t allowed to tell them who. The next morning, the Ralstons were briefed by FBI agents on a series of kidnappings for ransom that had turned into murders. The families of four victims of abduction had wired more than $1.2m between them to an account in New York, which then transferred the money to a bank in Dubai. But the bodies of the victims were now thought to be lying at the bottom of a reservoir just east of Yosemite national park. The killers, the FBI said, were possibly connected to the Russian mafia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jan/31/bring-up-the-bodies-the-retired-couple-who-find-drowning-victims-podcast\">Bring up the bodies: the retired couple who find drowning victims \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was the Ralstons\u2019 first homicide case. Until this moment, they had only used their specialised sonar system to scour the lake- and riverbeds for victims of accidents or suicides. Before they agreed to help find the bodies, Gene called his cousin, a recently retired FBI agent, for advice. \u201cHe said the Russians weren\u2019t really into murdering people,\u201d Gene told me. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t really have to worry about them doing any retaliation if we went ahead with the search.\u201d</p> <p>Gene and Sandy are modest, unassuming people, but bring a relentlessness to their often monotonous work. They call it \u201cmowing the lawn\u201d \u2013 towing their sonar equipment back and forth through the water, piloting their boat in slow, overlapping strips. Typically, a corpse descends through water with its chest facing the surface. When the feet hit the bottom, the knees buckle and the body spills on to its back, arms outstretched. That is the shape the Ralstons usually look for with their sonar. They knew a murder victim would look different, though. \u201cWe call it \u2018packaged\u2019 \u2013 tied up and weighted,\u201d Gene said.</p> <p>It took them two weeks to find the four murder victims, who were, as suspected, lying at the bottom of the New Melones reservoir. \u201cGene and Sandy got up early, went out and located the first body on their own,\u201d James Davidson, one of the FBI\u2019s primary investigators on the case, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s how determined they were.\u201d</p> <p>TV police dramas have popularised the image of a diver in a scuba suit emerging from a pond with a crucial piece of evidence. But the New Melones reservoir is more than 90 metres deep in some places, far beyond what is considered a safe depth for non-specialist divers. In order to retrieve the bodies, the FBI had to fly in a small, unmanned submarine \u2013 known as a remotely operated vehicle, or ROV \u2013 from the headquarters of its dive team in New York. The ROV had a mechanical arm that hooked the bodies and brought them within nine metres of the surface, where they were met by a team of divers. When the bodies surfaced, agents could see that they had been bound to gym weights with cable ties.</p> <p>The last recovery proved the hardest. All sorts of rubbish had been dumped into the water from a bridge and it was tricky to sort through the sonar images of fridges and washing machines strewn across the bottom of the reservoir. When Gene and Sandy finally found something that looked like a body, the ROV operator dismissed it as a rock. Gene told him to nudge it gently. \u201cIt was like bumping into a beehive,\u201d Gene said. \u201cAll kinds of little bugs took off. Why are the bugs there? Because it\u2019s a food source.\u201d</p> <p>An FBI agent and scuba diver named Tony Tindal was part of the team that met each of the bodies as the ROV returned from the bottom. \u201cI felt like someone needed to be with them,\u201d Tindal said. \u201cThey\u2019re brought up from their cold, chilly graves, all the way up to the surface, and now they\u2019re ready to tell their story.\u201d</p> <p>That story revealed details about the awful way these people died and also hard evidence that directly implicated the perpetrators, who turned out to be an independent group without any connection to the mafia. Among other things, the same type of cable ties used to bind the victims\u2019 bodies to the weights were found at the home of one of the suspects. Six people were eventually sentenced for their participation in the plot, which included another kidnapping and murder in the autumn of 2001, and two of them are currently on death row. \u201cThe crimes that were committed against these victims, how egregious the suspects were,\u201d Tindal said. \u201cIt was just meant to be that Sandy and Gene were where they were at the right time.\u201d</p> <p>The Ralstons are now in their 70s and spend most of every year travelling to search sites or on the water, looking for bodies. They have clocked more than 31,000 miles on their motorhome in a single year. In almost two decades of searching, they have found 120 victims of drowning in lakes and rivers across the US and Canada. They are considered among the best underwater search and recovery specialists in North America, and have worked for agencies from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to Nasa (hunting for the wreckage of the space shuttle Columbia, which disintegrated on atmospheric entry in February 2003, killing all seven crew members). They have helped solve crimes and generations-old mysteries.</p> <p>When the Ralstons\u2019 home phone rings with a search request, though, it is usually a family member of a missing person \u2013 someone reaching out after an official search has been called off. By the time the Ralstons arrive at the scene of a disappearance, no one expects the missing person to be found alive. What Gene and Sandy offer is not the hope of rescue, but the solace of finality. They have spent years crisscrossing North America in the service of grief.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Drowning is surprisingly silent and swift. People fighting to avoid suffocating in water quickly exhibit what is known as the \u201cinstinctive drowning response\u201d, an involuntary physiological reaction that renders them unable to wave or yell for help. Every part of the bodily system is recruited for a singular purpose: to keep the mouth above water. This effort can only be sustained for somewhere between 20 and 60 seconds before a person slips below the surface for good.</p> <p>Ten people die from drowning every day in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 in lakes, rivers, swimming pools, the ocean. Men drown much more frequently than women. In Canada, eight out of 10 fatal drownings are men, according to the Canadian Lifesaving Society.</p> <p>The bodies of the drowned sometimes surface on their own, but this depends on the qualities of the water. The putrefaction of flesh produces gases, primarily in the chest and gut, that inflate a corpse like a balloon. In warm, shallow water, decomposition works quickly, surfacing a corpse within two or three days. But cold water slows decay, and people who drown in deep lakes, 30 metres or below, may never surface. The weight of the water pins down their bodies.</p> <p>There are scuba divers and underwater cameras, dogs trained to detect the gases released by a body underwater \u2013 but none of these are good at searching large areas or probing deep water. Suspended sediment in water, whether it is created by soft mud or decaying plants, makes it difficult to see with artificial light, so divers often have to grope along the floor in darkness. The farthest down the Ralstons have found a body, though, is 174 metres \u2013 a 33-year-old man on the floor of Fran\u00e7ois Lake in British Columbia. He had been missing for 29 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c1113b9572cb35cc74a021635ffbda5b4e45ca7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1113b9572cb35cc74a021635ffbda5b4e45ca7c/0_161_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gene Ralston displays an image of a past body they found using side-scan sonar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gene Ralston displays an image of a past body they found using side-scan sonar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leah Nash/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unless there is a suspicion of wrongdoing, most local authorities will only spend a week or two searching for a drowning victim. Then it is up to the family of the missing person, or volunteers. Some families spend thousands of dollars a day on commercial diving services. Others drag the bottom of lakes with grappling hooks. Sometimes they chance upon the victim; often they work until their resources and spirits are spent.</p> <p>Gene and Sandy are anomalies in the world of search and rescue. They pursue this work full-time, but they work for free, only charging travel expenses. They take a scientist\u2019s methodical approach to everything they do. Gene even has a system when it comes to remembering his wedding anniversary, which is on 26 August. \u201cMy birthday is the 16th, Sandy\u2019s birthday is the 29th, so there are 13 days in between those two dates, and the same month of April, which is four, the fourth month, so there\u2019s two of us, two times four is eight and that is the eighth month and two times 13 is 26, the day,\u201d he said.</p> <p>They are fastidious about covering every inch of a search area before moving on. To get clear images, Sandy has to pilot their boat at no more than 2.5mph (2.16 knots), which is slower than walking on flat ground. A search can go for 10 hours a day and last for weeks. The onboard bathroom consists of a plastic bedpan stowed in a hatch by the boat\u2019s motor. \u201cAfter the fifth or sixth day of searching, you get almost zombie-like,\u201d Gene said. He says underwater searches consist of long periods of boredom interrupted by brief moments of terror.</p> <p>Successful underwater searches also require investigative acumen, and the Ralstons have become seasoned detectives. They are adept at interviewing witnesses and pinpointing search areas using whatever scant evidence is available. In June 2019, the Ralstons located the body of Daniel McGuckin under 98 metres of water in Lake Powell in Utah; they were the only ones to look at the GPS data of the houseboat McGuckin had jumped off before disappearing.</p> <p>Knowing where someone goes under, what search and rescue teams call the \u201cpoint of last seen\u201d, is often crucial. The rule of thumb, the Ralstons said, is that a person will sink to the bottom of a lake within a radius equal to the depth of the water. In 2004, the Ralstons found the bodies of 27-year-old twin brothers who had drowned in a California reservoir after their fishing boat sank in high winds; they were lying just metres apart.</p> <p>Occasionally, the Ralstons feel as if they are operating under divine guidance. There have been several times when they lowered their equipment almost directly on top of a body. It happened twice in a single day in 2001, on Hayden Lake in Idaho, where they found the bodies of two men, one who had drowned 19 months earlier, and one who had drowned the previous week. \u201cIt was like picking a page out of a book somewhere and that page having the quote that you want,\u201d Gene said. Once, on the Clearwater River in northern Canada, he woke at dawn, raised the curtain on their motorhome window and spotted the body of a 19-year-old boy in a shallow only five metres from shore. \u201cThat blew our minds,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Ralstons have helped the US military locate the wreckage of a pair of F18 fighter jets that collided over the Columbia River in Oregon. They have also helped a living person search for their favourite prosthetic leg, although that is still lying at the bottom of Idaho\u2019s Lake Lowell. The oldest body the Ralstons has ever recovered had been lying at the bottom of Idaho\u2019s Priest Lake for as long as 100 years; they had been searching for the body of a local firefighter who had disappeared while sailing. No one witnessed the accident, so the Ralstons had to scan an immense area. The greatest number of bodies they have found in a single day is four, in Idaho\u2019s American Falls Lake, in August 2010. A man had got into trouble while swimming and so someone jumped in the water to help. After the second man began to struggle, a third followed, and when he too ended up in distress, in jumped a fourth. All of them drowned.</p> <p>The only body the Ralstons ever found wearing a lifejacket was that of a man trying to ride his modified motorcycle at night across Canyon Ferry Lake in Montana. The bike stalled halfway across and the rider became tangled. He sank with his bike.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Ralstons never set out to become experts at finding drowning victims. The story of how they got where they are today is what Gene would call a \u201csix-pack-of-beer story\u201d, the unit of storytelling that comes after \u201cthe really long story\u201d. Gene has a gentle, grandfatherly way about him, as quick with a corny joke as he is with a detailed account of the physics of propagating soundwaves in water. Sandy wears bright, solid colours that make her white hair and blue eyes stand out, but she is more reserved than Gene. She hurries him along to the point, either by summing up the story herself or ushering him forward with a flick of her fingers.</p> <p>The Ralstons, who both have postgraduate degrees in the biological sciences, started dating in about 1970 while on a trip to Mexico organised by the College of Idaho\u2019s biology programme. The group travelled around the country for more than two months studying the vegetation. They camped wherever they found a good place to pull off the highway. Gene helped Sandy adjust to the rustic conditions. \u201cHe was a farm kid and I was a city kid,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought he was a pretty cool-looking guy.\u201d They married 47 years ago, in August 1972, on the top of a mountain in Idaho called Heaven\u2019s Gate.</p> <p>In 1979, the Ralstons started their own environmental consulting firm, surveying waterways for fish and evaluating the environmental impacts of proposed dam projects across Idaho and neighbouring states. Then, in March 1983, the Ralstons helped the sheriff in Boise, Idaho, find a middle-aged woman who had jumped off a bridge into the Boise River. \u201cSpotted her body draped over a tree that had washed into the river,\u201d Gene said. \u201cThat was really the first body I remember recovering, and that started the whole process. Got a really, really nice thank you from the family.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next 16 years, the Ralstons volunteered for Idaho\u2019s search and rescue operation, and recovered a couple more bodies on the Boise River. Then, in the spring of 1999, Gene heard about the search for a young man who had drowned after his rowing boat capsized on the Wolf Creek reservoir in Oregon. The man\u2019s family had hired a search team who claimed to have equipment on loan from the military that was \u201c100% effective\u201d at locating drowning victims. Gene asked if he could join them on the search to see what the hype was all about.</p> <p>The team was using \u201cside-scan sonar\u201d. Explaining how it works, Gene compares it to the best method for finding a small screw or pin that has fallen on the ground. \u201cTake a flashlight and lay down and roll it on the floor. You\u2019ll see the shadow of the pin before you see the pin itself.\u201d Instead of light, sonar emits pulses of sound, which travel easily through water, reflecting back off solid objects \u2013 rocks, human bodies, sunken treasure. Software then translates those reflections into images displayed on a computer aboard the boat. The sonar device is housed in a torpedo-shaped casing almost two metres long, weighing 70kg and is towed behind the boat close to the bottom of the lake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>This kind of sonar was developed in the early 60s and was used by the US military to find a missing nuclear submarine off the coast of Boston in 1963. In the 70s, the celebrated undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau used the technology to find shipwrecks and even to try to capture an image of the Loch Ness monster. In 1985, side-scan sonar also played a role in locating the Titanic about 370 miles south-east of Newfoundland, Canada, more than two miles below the surface of the Atlantic.</p> <p>It was immediately clear to Gene, when he saw the sonar at work on the Wolf Creek reservoir, that the technology was revolutionary \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t impressed with the people operating it. The sonar picked up an image of the missing man on the first afternoon out. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a body should look like, but it sure looked like arms and legs and a body to me,\u201d Gene said. But they continued searching for another four days. Eventually, they located the body again \u2013 then charged the family $30,000.</p> <p>Gene and Sandy already had some experience with people desperate to find the body of a loved one. They knew people would pay anything, do anything, to find some measure of resolution. When they decided to buy their own sonar rig, they resolved that their time and expertise would be free. They ordered the equipment in spring 2000, including 275 metres of electromechanical cable so they could lower the sonar array to the bottom of even the deepest lakes. All told, Gene estimated it cost them $100,000.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 is the word,\u201d the Ralstons\u2019 longtime friend John Zeman said when I asked him about the couple working for free. \u201cBut they\u2019re not for modern things. Sandy, she\u2019s always watching for a sale and Gene, he likes a truck with crank [non-automatic] windows. They\u2019re just people that aren\u2019t materialistic at all. There are no frills.\u201d</p> <p>The Ralstons\u2019 first search with the new equipment was for a 24-year-old named Brandon Larsen, who drowned in August 2000 while swimming off his friends\u2019 boat in Bear Lake, Utah. \u201cHe apparently was a bit of a jokester, so to speak, and his friends thought he was just kidding when he was splashing around, calling for help,\u201d Gene said. \u201cThen all of a sudden, he just disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>The Ralstons arrived six weeks later and found Larsen\u2019s body at a depth of 45 metres the next day. \u201cThe day of the recovery, they were there, probably 12 or 15 of them \u2013 family members, friends \u2013 in the parking lot. Lots of hugs went around and a few tears shed,\u201d Gene said. Returning Larsen\u2019s body to his family also bound the family to the Ralstons. Larsen\u2019s father is still in regular contact with them, and the Ralstons had planned to attend his sister\u2019s wedding last April until they were called to another search.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Within two weeks of finding Larsen, the Ralstons began to receive telephone calls from families in desperate situations who had heard about them on the radio. The first was from a mother whose 18-year-old daughter had been abducted, raped, tortured and murdered a dozen years earlier. Her body had been found, but they were still trying to bring the killer to justice. The mother hoped the Ralstons could help with the investigation by locating her daughter\u2019s car in a lake in Wyoming. \u201cI could hear a lot of pain in her voice,\u201d Gene said. \u201cIt affected us a lot. I couldn\u2019t wait to get there.\u201d (In the end, the Ralstons were unable to find the car.) Another call came from the family of a young man who had jumped off the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland, on the opposite side of the country. \u201cI don\u2019t remember how they found out about us from that far away,\u201d Gene said. \u201cWe had no idea that it would develop into such a nationwide, and continent-wide practically, situation for us.\u201d</p> <p>In lighter moments, the Ralstons refer to anything that happened prior to the autumn of 2000 as \u201cBSS\u201d \u2013 before side-scan sonar. In those BSS days, they used to go on one or two big scuba-diving trips a year to dive in places like the Caribbean, or to fish for salmon off the west coast of Canada. \u201cUsed to \u2013 as in, the good old days,\u201d Sandy said.</p> <p>The more successful searches the Ralstons carried out, the more they were covered by the press, and the more calls they received. By 2004, the couple had stopped promoting their environmental consulting business because it interfered with how quickly they could respond to search requests. \u201cI would have to tell a family that we couldn\u2019t come for two or three weeks and that bothered me,\u201d Gene said.</p> <p>Their last consulting job was in 2005. The Ralstons don\u2019t have a great amount of money, but they are frugal. \u201cWhat better use for what money you have than to help somebody else out when everybody else has given up on helping them?\u201d Gene said.</p> <p>For the families and friends, coping with the loss of a loved one who has drowned without a trace is a special kind of pain. \u201cThe human brain can\u2019t let go unless there is evidence of transformation from life to death,\u201d says Pauline Boss, a professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota and a family therapist, who has spent the last half-century researching what it means to reunite families with the bodies of the deceased. Without recovering a body, a haunting anguish takes the place of grief and eventual closure. Some people report catching glimpses of their lost loved ones in everyday situations \u2013 in the aisles of the supermarket, say \u2013 for years after they go missing. \u201cYou need to see that the person is no longer breathing,\u201d Boss said. \u201cOr you need to see the bones.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01e48097c9b67866a5deed2f3da725b5a6638154\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e48097c9b67866a5deed2f3da725b5a6638154/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gene and Sandy Ralston aboard the Kathy G on Lake Billy Chinook in Jefferson County, Oregon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gene and Sandy Ralston aboard the Kathy G on Lake Billy Chinook in Jefferson County, Oregon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leah Nash/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To add to the cruelties of what Boss calls \u201cambiguous loss\u201d, the law, too, struggles to recognise death in the absence of a body. Courts, banks, insurance companies and creditors need the corpse as proof. \u201cThat [situation] freezes the person who is missing, it freezes all of their assets and it freezes all of their loved ones or anybody else who\u2019s depending upon them,\u201d says Robert Jarvis, a law professor at the Shepard Broad College of Law in Florida, who has published several articles on how the law treats those who are only presumed dead.</p> <p>In December 2006, the Ralstons went looking for the body of a young man named Shane Pierce who had drowned in a boating accident on a Kentucky lake that September. Without a body, Shane\u2019s family hadn\u2019t been able to get a death certificate, and without a death certificate, they had to continue making the payments for their son\u2019s truck and for the mortgage on his house. \u201cIt almost sunk us,\u201d Shane\u2019s father, Roger Pierce, told me. The family also couldn\u2019t sell the boat their son was driving the day he drowned, because it was registered in his name. The windshield of the boat was smashed where he had apparently hit his head and been knocked unconscious before being thrown from the boat.</p> <p>\u201cMan, that was tough,\u201d Roger said. \u201cThe boat stood out here in my driveway and every time I looked at it, I\u2019d think of Shane.\u201d At least five different search and rescue groups had tried to find Shane\u2019s body before the Ralstons showed up. \u201cGene and Sandy started their search and found Shane in six minutes,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t hooked up with Gene and Sandy, I don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d</p> <p>The Ralstons helped Gina Hoogendoorn find her father, Rick Herren, who had been missing for 15 years. The couple found his body on the bottom of Wyoming\u2019s Flaming Gorge reservoir in the spring of 2012. Hoogendoorn was 18 when her father disappeared and, after an initial search, local officials told her family they would have to get used to the idea of never finding him. She described the feeling of not knowing where her father was, of having nowhere to go to visit and remember him, as \u201can unbelievable hurt\u201d.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until she was 33, when she happened to catch a TV show about a drowning victim whose body was recovered years after they went missing, that Hoogendoorn realised she could still try to find her father\u2019s body. She looked online and found the Ralstons. She called and described her story to Gene. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018Yep. We\u2019ll be down. We\u2019ll be down at the end of the week.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Once the Ralstons were out on the reservoir it took them eight minutes to locate the body. Divers with the sheriff\u2019s office did the recovery a month later. \u201cThey brought him off the boat and set him down and me and my brother and my mom just loved on him,\u201d Hoogendoorn said. The water was deep and cold so his body was relatively well preserved. \u201cHe still had form to him and so I could feel his chest, and it felt like his chest,\u201d Hoogendoorn went on. \u201cHis shoulder felt like a shoulder, and it was very, very surreal to be able to hug him again. It was the most happy, saddest day of my life. We got to find him, then I had to say goodbye again.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In April 2019, I went searching for a body with the Ralstons and John Zeman, their longtime friend. We were on Washburn Pond, a horseshoe-shaped band of water in a sparsely populated area of Washington state. The Ralstons\u2019 boat is seven metres long and made from aluminium. There is just enough space in the cabin for the Ralstons to sit shoulder-to-shoulder, with a couple of people behind them. The name \u201cKathy G\u201d has been stencilled in pink letters under one of the cabin\u2019s windows since 2008 \u2013 the boat is named after a young woman whose body the Ralstons found in a lake in Alaska that spring; her family donated money that enabled the Ralstons to buy a new motor.</p> <p>We were looking for the body of a 20-year-old named Alexander Bravo Marroquin, who had disappeared 12 days earlier when a canoe he was in with his brother capsized. The local authorities had called the Ralstons after conducting an extensive search. As we set out on the water, we passed a band of yellow police tape strung up on a shrub to mark where Bravo Marroquin\u2019s brother remembered swimming to shore. As Sandy slowly piloted the boat, Gene watched images generated by the sonar scrolling down a large computer monitor. He was in his usual uniform: a collared flannel shirt tucked into a crisp pair of blue jeans. Sandy was wearing a baggy sweatshirt with an illustration of a cat in flippers and a scuba mask.</p> <p>\u201cSpotted something suspicious,\u201d Zeman announced, about 15 minutes after leaving the boat launch.</p> <p>\u201cNot a body that I can tell,\u201d Gene responded as we passed over it again, from the opposite direction. The shape on the monitor looked too round and too small. But Gene marked the location using GPS.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to do a 90?\u201d asked Sandy.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose we can do it \u2013 there\u2019s something there,\u201d Gene said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cfc546553d19edbcd8dc5bfbc9c28bbf06dd562f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfc546553d19edbcd8dc5bfbc9c28bbf06dd562f/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ralstons\u2019 seven-metre aluminium boat, Kathy G.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ralstons\u2019 seven-metre aluminium boat, Kathy G.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leah Nash/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sandy turned the boat around to come at the object from a perpendicular angle. We watched in silence as images of the lake bottom slowly ticked down the screen in shades of yellow. About 50 metres from land, the distance it would take a strong amateur swimmer to cover in about a minute, the distinct shape of a human body appeared headfirst in the monitor\u2019s top left corner.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Gene murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d The body looked out of place on the barren lakebed. Gene took the wheel of the boat while Sandy and Zeman went on deck to drop a marker by the body \u2013 two plastic milk crates, which make a clear image on the sonar, attached to a white buoy. Then we hurried back to shore.</p> <p>A couple of hours later, a dive team from the sheriff\u2019s department went to recover Bravo Marroquin\u2019s body. As we stood on the deck of the Kathy G and watched the divers go down, a series of guttural bird calls rang out high above us. \u201cSandhill cranes,\u201d Gene said. \u201cI love that sound.\u201d Four birds with long thin necks and expansive wingspans soared over the pond.</p> <p>I looked back down and saw the divers reach the surface. They were holding the body. His nose and forehead, along with a shock of thick dark hair, broke the surface of the water. When we got back to shore, the divers laid him out on the concrete slabs of the boat launch. Bravo Marroquin was the oldest of five siblings and his family had held a lakeside vigil every day since he went missing. About 20 of them had stood quietly at one end of a gravel parking lot by the lake earlier that morning. Now they were able to touch and pray with his body.</p> <p>The Ralstons had decided a while back that they were going to stop after they recovered their 100th body. But Bravo Marroquin was the 114th, and they would go on to find six more in 2019. They no longer accept cross-country search missions, but Gene said that they would continue to answer calls in the western US for as long as their health permitted. \u201cHow do you say no to someone in that position?\u201d he said. Gene turned 74 the day they found Bravo Marroquin on the bottom of Washburn Pond.</p> <p>The Ralstons told me about another of the families they had helped. In the late summer of 2017, they spent more than five weeks searching for the body of a 26-year-old Irishman named David Gavin. He and some friends had taken a break from their roadtrip to jump off a bridge over the Kinbasket reservoir in British Columbia, Canada. He surfaced briefly, but then went down again and didn\u2019t come back up. Gavin\u2019s family had flown in from Ireland days after the accident and had set up a makeshift camp on a dusty gravel road overlooking the bridge. After a few days, the Royal Canadian Mounted police called off the official search, but a RCMP diver gave the Ralstons\u2019 phone number to the Gavins. David\u2019s father, Mick, credited the Ralstons with keeping the search and his family going that summer. \u201cIf they left, we had nothing else,\u201d Mick told me. \u201cThey knew that, and they could see it in our eyes and talked to us every day. They couldn\u2019t pull back from it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think what we do, having been around so much death, has to have had an influence on us,\u201d Gene said to me at one point. Some recoveries were harder to forget than others. \u201cOne in particular was a little 12-year-old boy that was struck by a boat in Shasta Lake [in California]. That haunts me every once in a while,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Gene mentioned an expression often used by those in the emergency-response community: I wish my brain could forget what my eyes have seen. \u201cSandy has a way of dealing with that a little better, puts it out of her mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn several of the very first searches, there was always a coroner there and they always seemed to be a woman and very comfortable around what they were doing,\u201d Sandy said. \u201cI guess I adopted that.\u201d Finding and recovering bodies was just one of those jobs that needed doing.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Gene and Sandy Ralston returned to their truck after a day on the Beardsley reservoir in northern California in March 2002, they discovered several handwritten notes taped to the doors and windscreen: \u201cCall Lieutenant Lunney as soon as you get back to town. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d The Ralstons, a married couple from rural Idaho, had been scientists until the late 1980s, when they began helping out on local search and rescue missions. By the winter of 2002, they had volunteered on more than a dozen searches for victims of drowning across the US, and had developed an uncanny ability to find bodies. They had just helped Lt Lunney\u2019s sheriff\u2019s department locate the remains of a man who had drowned in the reservoir three-and-a-half years earlier, after falling off his boat while fishing. Divers had brought him back to the surface that afternoon. As the notes instructed, the Ralstons drove to the nearby town of Sonora to meet Lunney. Their expertise was needed by some other folks, he said, although he wasn\u2019t allowed to tell them who. The next morning, the Ralstons were briefed by FBI agents on a series of kidnappings for ransom that had turned into murders. The families of four victims of abduction had wired more than $1.2m between them to an account in New York, which then transferred the money to a bank in Dubai. But the bodies of the victims were now thought to be lying at the bottom of a reservoir just east of Yosemite national park. The killers, the FBI said, were possibly connected to the Russian mafia. This was the Ralstons\u2019 first homicide case. Until this moment, they had only used their specialised sonar system to scour the lake- and riverbeds for victims of accidents or suicides. Before they agreed to help find the bodies, Gene called his cousin, a recently retired FBI agent, for advice. \u201cHe said the Russians weren\u2019t really into murdering people,\u201d Gene told me. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t really have to worry about them doing any retaliation if we went ahead with the search.\u201d Gene and Sandy are modest, unassuming people, but bring a relentlessness to their often monotonous work. They call it \u201cmowing the lawn\u201d \u2013 towing their sonar equipment back and forth through the water, piloting their boat in slow, overlapping strips. Typically, a corpse descends through water with its chest facing the surface. When the feet hit the bottom, the knees buckle and the body spills on to its back, arms outstretched. That is the shape the Ralstons usually look for with their sonar. They knew a murder victim would look different, though. \u201cWe call it \u2018packaged\u2019 \u2013 tied up and weighted,\u201d Gene said. It took them two weeks to find the four murder victims, who were, as suspected, lying at the bottom of the New Melones reservoir. \u201cGene and Sandy got up early, went out and located the first body on their own,\u201d James Davidson, one of the FBI\u2019s primary investigators on the case, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s how determined they were.\u201d TV police dramas have popularised the image of a diver in a scuba suit emerging from a pond with a crucial piece of evidence. But the New Melones reservoir is more than 90 metres deep in some places, far beyond what is considered a safe depth for non-specialist divers. In order to retrieve the bodies, the FBI had to fly in a small, unmanned submarine \u2013 known as a remotely operated vehicle, or ROV \u2013 from the headquarters of its dive team in New York. The ROV had a mechanical arm that hooked the bodies and brought them within nine metres of the surface, where they were met by a team of divers. When the bodies surfaced, agents could see that they had been bound to gym weights with cable ties. The last recovery proved the hardest. All sorts of rubbish had been dumped into the water from a bridge and it was tricky to sort through the sonar images of fridges and washing machines strewn across the bottom of the reservoir. When Gene and Sandy finally found something that looked like a body, the ROV operator dismissed it as a rock. Gene told him to nudge it gently. \u201cIt was like bumping into a beehive,\u201d Gene said. \u201cAll kinds of little bugs took off. Why are the bugs there? Because it\u2019s a food source.\u201d An FBI agent and scuba diver named Tony Tindal was part of the team that met each of the bodies as the ROV returned from the bottom. \u201cI felt like someone needed to be with them,\u201d Tindal said. \u201cThey\u2019re brought up from their cold, chilly graves, all the way up to the surface, and now they\u2019re ready to tell their story.\u201d That story revealed details about the awful way these people died and also hard evidence that directly implicated the perpetrators, who turned out to be an independent group without any connection to the mafia. Among other things, the same type of cable ties used to bind the victims\u2019 bodies to the weights were found at the home of one of the suspects. Six people were eventually sentenced for their participation in the plot, which included another kidnapping and murder in the autumn of 2001, and two of them are currently on death row. \u201cThe crimes that were committed against these victims, how egregious the suspects were,\u201d Tindal said. \u201cIt was just meant to be that Sandy and Gene were where they were at the right time.\u201d The Ralstons are now in their 70s and spend most of every year travelling to search sites or on the water, looking for bodies. They have clocked more than 31,000 miles on their motorhome in a single year. In almost two decades of searching, they have found 120 victims of drowning in lakes and rivers across the US and Canada. They are considered among the best underwater search and recovery specialists in North America, and have worked for agencies from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to Nasa (hunting for the wreckage of the space shuttle Columbia, which disintegrated on atmospheric entry in February 2003, killing all seven crew members). They have helped solve crimes and generations-old mysteries. When the Ralstons\u2019 home phone rings with a search request, though, it is usually a family member of a missing person \u2013 someone reaching out after an official search has been called off. By the time the Ralstons arrive at the scene of a disappearance, no one expects the missing person to be found alive. What Gene and Sandy offer is not the hope of rescue, but the solace of finality. They have spent years crisscrossing North America in the service of grief. * * * Drowning is surprisingly silent and swift. People fighting to avoid suffocating in water quickly exhibit what is known as the \u201cinstinctive drowning response\u201d, an involuntary physiological reaction that renders them unable to wave or yell for help. Every part of the bodily system is recruited for a singular purpose: to keep the mouth above water. This effort can only be sustained for somewhere between 20 and 60 seconds before a person slips below the surface for good. Ten people die from drowning every day in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 in lakes, rivers, swimming pools, the ocean. Men drown much more frequently than women. In Canada, eight out of 10 fatal drownings are men, according to the Canadian Lifesaving Society. The bodies of the drowned sometimes surface on their own, but this depends on the qualities of the water. The putrefaction of flesh produces gases, primarily in the chest and gut, that inflate a corpse like a balloon. In warm, shallow water, decomposition works quickly, surfacing a corpse within two or three days. But cold water slows decay, and people who drown in deep lakes, 30 metres or below, may never surface. The weight of the water pins down their bodies. There are scuba divers and underwater cameras, dogs trained to detect the gases released by a body underwater \u2013 but none of these are good at searching large areas or probing deep water. Suspended sediment in water, whether it is created by soft mud or decaying plants, makes it difficult to see with artificial light, so divers often have to grope along the floor in darkness. The farthest down the Ralstons have found a body, though, is 174 metres \u2013 a 33-year-old man on the floor of Fran\u00e7ois Lake in British Columbia. He had been missing for 29 years. Unless there is a suspicion of wrongdoing, most local authorities will only spend a week or two searching for a drowning victim. Then it is up to the family of the missing person, or volunteers. Some families spend thousands of dollars a day on commercial diving services. Others drag the bottom of lakes with grappling hooks. Sometimes they chance upon the victim; often they work until their resources and spirits are spent. Gene and Sandy are anomalies in the world of search and rescue. They pursue this work full-time, but they work for free, only charging travel expenses. They take a scientist\u2019s methodical approach to everything they do. Gene even has a system when it comes to remembering his wedding anniversary, which is on 26 August. \u201cMy birthday is the 16th, Sandy\u2019s birthday is the 29th, so there are 13 days in between those two dates, and the same month of April, which is four, the fourth month, so there\u2019s two of us, two times four is eight and that is the eighth month and two times 13 is 26, the day,\u201d he said. They are fastidious about covering every inch of a search area before moving on. To get clear images, Sandy has to pilot their boat at no more than 2.5mph (2.16 knots), which is slower than walking on flat ground. A search can go for 10 hours a day and last for weeks. The onboard bathroom consists of a plastic bedpan stowed in a hatch by the boat\u2019s motor. \u201cAfter the fifth or sixth day of searching, you get almost zombie-like,\u201d Gene said. He says underwater searches consist of long periods of boredom interrupted by brief moments of terror. Successful underwater searches also require investigative acumen, and the Ralstons have become seasoned detectives. They are adept at interviewing witnesses and pinpointing search areas using whatever scant evidence is available. In June 2019, the Ralstons located the body of Daniel McGuckin under 98 metres of water in Lake Powell in Utah; they were the only ones to look at the GPS data of the houseboat McGuckin had jumped off before disappearing. Knowing where someone goes under, what search and rescue teams call the \u201cpoint of last seen\u201d, is often crucial. The rule of thumb, the Ralstons said, is that a person will sink to the bottom of a lake within a radius equal to the depth of the water. In 2004, the Ralstons found the bodies of 27-year-old twin brothers who had drowned in a California reservoir after their fishing boat sank in high winds; they were lying just metres apart. Occasionally, the Ralstons feel as if they are operating under divine guidance. There have been several times when they lowered their equipment almost directly on top of a body. It happened twice in a single day in 2001, on Hayden Lake in Idaho, where they found the bodies of two men, one who had drowned 19 months earlier, and one who had drowned the previous week. \u201cIt was like picking a page out of a book somewhere and that page having the quote that you want,\u201d Gene said. Once, on the Clearwater River in northern Canada, he woke at dawn, raised the curtain on their motorhome window and spotted the body of a 19-year-old boy in a shallow only five metres from shore. \u201cThat blew our minds,\u201d he said. The Ralstons have helped the US military locate the wreckage of a pair of F18 fighter jets that collided over the Columbia River in Oregon. They have also helped a living person search for their favourite prosthetic leg, although that is still lying at the bottom of Idaho\u2019s Lake Lowell. The oldest body the Ralstons has ever recovered had been lying at the bottom of Idaho\u2019s Priest Lake for as long as 100 years; they had been searching for the body of a local firefighter who had disappeared while sailing. No one witnessed the accident, so the Ralstons had to scan an immense area. The greatest number of bodies they have found in a single day is four, in Idaho\u2019s American Falls Lake, in August 2010. A man had got into trouble while swimming and so someone jumped in the water to help. After the second man began to struggle, a third followed, and when he too ended up in distress, in jumped a fourth. All of them drowned. The only body the Ralstons ever found wearing a lifejacket was that of a man trying to ride his modified motorcycle at night across Canyon Ferry Lake in Montana. The bike stalled halfway across and the rider became tangled. He sank with his bike. * * * The Ralstons never set out to become experts at finding drowning victims. The story of how they got where they are today is what Gene would call a \u201csix-pack-of-beer story\u201d, the unit of storytelling that comes after \u201cthe really long story\u201d. Gene has a gentle, grandfatherly way about him, as quick with a corny joke as he is with a detailed account of the physics of propagating soundwaves in water. Sandy wears bright, solid colours that make her white hair and blue eyes stand out, but she is more reserved than Gene. She hurries him along to the point, either by summing up the story herself or ushering him forward with a flick of her fingers. The Ralstons, who both have postgraduate degrees in the biological sciences, started dating in about 1970 while on a trip to Mexico organised by the College of Idaho\u2019s biology programme. The group travelled around the country for more than two months studying the vegetation. They camped wherever they found a good place to pull off the highway. Gene helped Sandy adjust to the rustic conditions. \u201cHe was a farm kid and I was a city kid,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought he was a pretty cool-looking guy.\u201d They married 47 years ago, in August 1972, on the top of a mountain in Idaho called Heaven\u2019s Gate. In 1979, the Ralstons started their own environmental consulting firm, surveying waterways for fish and evaluating the environmental impacts of proposed dam projects across Idaho and neighbouring states. Then, in March 1983, the Ralstons helped the sheriff in Boise, Idaho, find a middle-aged woman who had jumped off a bridge into the Boise River. \u201cSpotted her body draped over a tree that had washed into the river,\u201d Gene said. \u201cThat was really the first body I remember recovering, and that started the whole process. Got a really, really nice thank you from the family.\u201d Over the next 16 years, the Ralstons volunteered for Idaho\u2019s search and rescue operation, and recovered a couple more bodies on the Boise River. Then, in the spring of 1999, Gene heard about the search for a young man who had drowned after his rowing boat capsized on the Wolf Creek reservoir in Oregon. The man\u2019s family had hired a search team who claimed to have equipment on loan from the military that was \u201c100% effective\u201d at locating drowning victims. Gene asked if he could join them on the search to see what the hype was all about. The team was using \u201cside-scan sonar\u201d. Explaining how it works, Gene compares it to the best method for finding a small screw or pin that has fallen on the ground. \u201cTake a flashlight and lay down and roll it on the floor. You\u2019ll see the shadow of the pin before you see the pin itself.\u201d Instead of light, sonar emits pulses of sound, which travel easily through water, reflecting back off solid objects \u2013 rocks, human bodies, sunken treasure. Software then translates those reflections into images displayed on a computer aboard the boat. The sonar device is housed in a torpedo-shaped casing almost two metres long, weighing 70kg and is towed behind the boat close to the bottom of the lake. This kind of sonar was developed in the early 60s and was used by the US military to find a missing nuclear submarine off the coast of Boston in 1963. In the 70s, the celebrated undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau used the technology to find shipwrecks and even to try to capture an image of the Loch Ness monster. In 1985, side-scan sonar also played a role in locating the Titanic about 370 miles south-east of Newfoundland, Canada, more than two miles below the surface of the Atlantic. It was immediately clear to Gene, when he saw the sonar at work on the Wolf Creek reservoir, that the technology was revolutionary \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t impressed with the people operating it. The sonar picked up an image of the missing man on the first afternoon out. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what a body should look like, but it sure looked like arms and legs and a body to me,\u201d Gene said. But they continued searching for another four days. Eventually, they located the body again \u2013 then charged the family $30,000. Gene and Sandy already had some experience with people desperate to find the body of a loved one. They knew people would pay anything, do anything, to find some measure of resolution. When they decided to buy their own sonar rig, they resolved that their time and expertise would be free. They ordered the equipment in spring 2000, including 275 metres of electromechanical cable so they could lower the sonar array to the bottom of even the deepest lakes. All told, Gene estimated it cost them $100,000. \u201cI don\u2019t know if \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 is the word,\u201d the Ralstons\u2019 longtime friend John Zeman said when I asked him about the couple working for free. \u201cBut they\u2019re not for modern things. Sandy, she\u2019s always watching for a sale and Gene, he likes a truck with crank [non-automatic] windows. They\u2019re just people that aren\u2019t materialistic at all. There are no frills.\u201d The Ralstons\u2019 first search with the new equipment was for a 24-year-old named Brandon Larsen, who drowned in August 2000 while swimming off his friends\u2019 boat in Bear Lake, Utah. \u201cHe apparently was a bit of a jokester, so to speak, and his friends thought he was just kidding when he was splashing around, calling for help,\u201d Gene said. \u201cThen all of a sudden, he just disappeared.\u201d The Ralstons arrived six weeks later and found Larsen\u2019s body at a depth of 45 metres the next day. \u201cThe day of the recovery, they were there, probably 12 or 15 of them \u2013 family members, friends \u2013 in the parking lot. Lots of hugs went around and a few tears shed,\u201d Gene said. Returning Larsen\u2019s body to his family also bound the family to the Ralstons. Larsen\u2019s father is still in regular contact with them, and the Ralstons had planned to attend his sister\u2019s wedding last April until they were called to another search. * * * Within two weeks of finding Larsen, the Ralstons began to receive telephone calls from families in desperate situations who had heard about them on the radio. The first was from a mother whose 18-year-old daughter had been abducted, raped, tortured and murdered a dozen years earlier. Her body had been found, but they were still trying to bring the killer to justice. The mother hoped the Ralstons could help with the investigation by locating her daughter\u2019s car in a lake in Wyoming. \u201cI could hear a lot of pain in her voice,\u201d Gene said. \u201cIt affected us a lot. I couldn\u2019t wait to get there.\u201d (In the end, the Ralstons were unable to find the car.) Another call came from the family of a young man who had jumped off the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland, on the opposite side of the country. \u201cI don\u2019t remember how they found out about us from that far away,\u201d Gene said. \u201cWe had no idea that it would develop into such a nationwide, and continent-wide practically, situation for us.\u201d In lighter moments, the Ralstons refer to anything that happened prior to the autumn of 2000 as \u201cBSS\u201d \u2013 before side-scan sonar. In those BSS days, they used to go on one or two big scuba-diving trips a year to dive in places like the Caribbean, or to fish for salmon off the west coast of Canada. \u201cUsed to \u2013 as in, the good old days,\u201d Sandy said. The more successful searches the Ralstons carried out, the more they were covered by the press, and the more calls they received. By 2004, the couple had stopped promoting their environmental consulting business because it interfered with how quickly they could respond to search requests. \u201cI would have to tell a family that we couldn\u2019t come for two or three weeks and that bothered me,\u201d Gene said. Their last consulting job was in 2005. The Ralstons don\u2019t have a great amount of money, but they are frugal. \u201cWhat better use for what money you have than to help somebody else out when everybody else has given up on helping them?\u201d Gene said. For the families and friends, coping with the loss of a loved one who has drowned without a trace is a special kind of pain. \u201cThe human brain can\u2019t let go unless there is evidence of transformation from life to death,\u201d says Pauline Boss, a professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota and a family therapist, who has spent the last half-century researching what it means to reunite families with the bodies of the deceased. Without recovering a body, a haunting anguish takes the place of grief and eventual closure. Some people report catching glimpses of their lost loved ones in everyday situations \u2013 in the aisles of the supermarket, say \u2013 for years after they go missing. \u201cYou need to see that the person is no longer breathing,\u201d Boss said. \u201cOr you need to see the bones.\u201d To add to the cruelties of what Boss calls \u201cambiguous loss\u201d, the law, too, struggles to recognise death in the absence of a body. Courts, banks, insurance companies and creditors need the corpse as proof. \u201cThat [situation] freezes the person who is missing, it freezes all of their assets and it freezes all of their loved ones or anybody else who\u2019s depending upon them,\u201d says Robert Jarvis, a law professor at the Shepard Broad College of Law in Florida, who has published several articles on how the law treats those who are only presumed dead. In December 2006, the Ralstons went looking for the body of a young man named Shane Pierce who had drowned in a boating accident on a Kentucky lake that September. Without a body, Shane\u2019s family hadn\u2019t been able to get a death certificate, and without a death certificate, they had to continue making the payments for their son\u2019s truck and for the mortgage on his house. \u201cIt almost sunk us,\u201d Shane\u2019s father, Roger Pierce, told me. The family also couldn\u2019t sell the boat their son was driving the day he drowned, because it was registered in his name. The windshield of the boat was smashed where he had apparently hit his head and been knocked unconscious before being thrown from the boat. \u201cMan, that was tough,\u201d Roger said. \u201cThe boat stood out here in my driveway and every time I looked at it, I\u2019d think of Shane.\u201d At least five different search and rescue groups had tried to find Shane\u2019s body before the Ralstons showed up. \u201cGene and Sandy started their search and found Shane in six minutes,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t hooked up with Gene and Sandy, I don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d The Ralstons helped Gina Hoogendoorn find her father, Rick Herren, who had been missing for 15 years. The couple found his body on the bottom of Wyoming\u2019s Flaming Gorge reservoir in the spring of 2012. Hoogendoorn was 18 when her father disappeared and, after an initial search, local officials told her family they would have to get used to the idea of never finding him. She described the feeling of not knowing where her father was, of having nowhere to go to visit and remember him, as \u201can unbelievable hurt\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until she was 33, when she happened to catch a TV show about a drowning victim whose body was recovered years after they went missing, that Hoogendoorn realised she could still try to find her father\u2019s body. She looked online and found the Ralstons. She called and described her story to Gene. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018Yep. We\u2019ll be down. We\u2019ll be down at the end of the week.\u2019\u201d Once the Ralstons were out on the reservoir it took them eight minutes to locate the body. Divers with the sheriff\u2019s office did the recovery a month later. \u201cThey brought him off the boat and set him down and me and my brother and my mom just loved on him,\u201d Hoogendoorn said. The water was deep and cold so his body was relatively well preserved. \u201cHe still had form to him and so I could feel his chest, and it felt like his chest,\u201d Hoogendoorn went on. \u201cHis shoulder felt like a shoulder, and it was very, very surreal to be able to hug him again. It was the most happy, saddest day of my life. We got to find him, then I had to say goodbye again.\u201d * * * In April 2019, I went searching for a body with the Ralstons and John Zeman, their longtime friend. We were on Washburn Pond, a horseshoe-shaped band of water in a sparsely populated area of Washington state. The Ralstons\u2019 boat is seven metres long and made from aluminium. There is just enough space in the cabin for the Ralstons to sit shoulder-to-shoulder, with a couple of people behind them. The name \u201cKathy G\u201d has been stencilled in pink letters under one of the cabin\u2019s windows since 2008 \u2013 the boat is named after a young woman whose body the Ralstons found in a lake in Alaska that spring; her family donated money that enabled the Ralstons to buy a new motor. We were looking for the body of a 20-year-old named Alexander Bravo Marroquin, who had disappeared 12 days earlier when a canoe he was in with his brother capsized. The local authorities had called the Ralstons after conducting an extensive search. As we set out on the water, we passed a band of yellow police tape strung up on a shrub to mark where Bravo Marroquin\u2019s brother remembered swimming to shore. As Sandy slowly piloted the boat, Gene watched images generated by the sonar scrolling down a large computer monitor. He was in his usual uniform: a collared flannel shirt tucked into a crisp pair of blue jeans. Sandy was wearing a baggy sweatshirt with an illustration of a cat in flippers and a scuba mask. \u201cSpotted something suspicious,\u201d Zeman announced, about 15 minutes after leaving the boat launch. \u201cNot a body that I can tell,\u201d Gene responded as we passed over it again, from the opposite direction. The shape on the monitor looked too round and too small. But Gene marked the location using GPS. \u201cDo you want to do a 90?\u201d asked Sandy. \u201cI suppose we can do it \u2013 there\u2019s something there,\u201d Gene said. Sandy turned the boat around to come at the object from a perpendicular angle. We watched in silence as images of the lake bottom slowly ticked down the screen in shades of yellow. About 50 metres from land, the distance it would take a strong amateur swimmer to cover in about a minute, the distinct shape of a human body appeared headfirst in the monitor\u2019s top left corner. \u201cWow,\u201d Gene murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d The body looked out of place on the barren lakebed. Gene took the wheel of the boat while Sandy and Zeman went on deck to drop a marker by the body \u2013 two plastic milk crates, which make a clear image on the sonar, attached to a white buoy. Then we hurried back to shore. A couple of hours later, a dive team from the sheriff\u2019s department went to recover Bravo Marroquin\u2019s body. As we stood on the deck of the Kathy G and watched the divers go down, a series of guttural bird calls rang out high above us. \u201cSandhill cranes,\u201d Gene said. \u201cI love that sound.\u201d Four birds with long thin necks and expansive wingspans soared over the pond. I looked back down and saw the divers reach the surface. They were holding the body. His nose and forehead, along with a shock of thick dark hair, broke the surface of the water. When we got back to shore, the divers laid him out on the concrete slabs of the boat launch. Bravo Marroquin was the oldest of five siblings and his family had held a lakeside vigil every day since he went missing. About 20 of them had stood quietly at one end of a gravel parking lot by the lake earlier that morning. Now they were able to touch and pray with his body. The Ralstons had decided a while back that they were going to stop after they recovered their 100th body. But Bravo Marroquin was the 114th, and they would go on to find six more in 2019. They no longer accept cross-country search missions, but Gene said that they would continue to answer calls in the western US for as long as their health permitted. \u201cHow do you say no to someone in that position?\u201d he said. Gene turned 74 the day they found Bravo Marroquin on the bottom of Washburn Pond. The Ralstons told me about another of the families they had helped. In the late summer of 2017, they spent more than five weeks searching for the body of a 26-year-old Irishman named David Gavin. He and some friends had taken a break from their roadtrip to jump off a bridge over the Kinbasket reservoir in British Columbia, Canada. He surfaced briefly, but then went down again and didn\u2019t come back up. Gavin\u2019s family had flown in from Ireland days after the accident and had set up a makeshift camp on a dusty gravel road overlooking the bridge. After a few days, the Royal Canadian Mounted police called off the official search, but a RCMP diver gave the Ralstons\u2019 phone number to the Gavins. David\u2019s father, Mick, credited the Ralstons with keeping the search and his family going that summer. \u201cIf they left, we had nothing else,\u201d Mick told me. \u201cThey knew that, and they could see it in our eyes and talked to us every day. They couldn\u2019t pull back from it.\u201d \u201cI think what we do, having been around so much death, has to have had an influence on us,\u201d Gene said to me at one point. Some recoveries were harder to forget than others. \u201cOne in particular was a little 12-year-old boy that was struck by a boat in Shasta Lake [in California]. That haunts me every once in a while,\u201d he said.

Despite efforts by Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, to alleviate the tensions by co-opting major ethnic groups into the restructure of the ruling party, Hribernik said a further spike in civil unrest is likely in the next six months if elections are delayed or cancelled. In Sudan, the absence of functioning institutions, he added, means \u201copposition groups and Darfur militias have little opportunity but to pursue civil unrest\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Doctors at Matt Hancock\u2019s local hospital accused bosses of misleading senior staff about their unprecedented demand for fingerprint samples in a bid to identify a whistleblower, it has emerged. Minutes of a meeting seen by the Guardian show that after managers at West Suffolk hospital used \u201cbullying and intimidatory\u201d tactics to seek out the whistleblower who revealed details of a botched operation to a patient\u2019s widower, they were accused of deliberately misrepresenting their actions in communications with staff. At the meeting last month, held the day before the revelations were first published in the Guardian, consultants already upset by the issue indicated that their anger had been compounded when the trust insisted in a statement that the demand was only \u201cvoluntary\u201d when in their view it was \u201ccoercive\u201d. According to the minutes, Dr Paul Molyneux, the trust\u2019s deputy medical director, read out a section of the trust\u2019s letter demanding both fingerprints and samples of handwriting, which made clear that non-compliance would be seen as proof of blowing the whistle. One doctor dismissed the trust\u2019s statement about its behaviour that was sent to senior staff, including board members, as \u201cnot factually correct\u201d. An inquest begins on Thursday into the death of a patient at the centre of the \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. Susan Warby died aged 57, five weeks after an operation for a burst bowel at the hospital in Bury St Edmunds, which is used by the health secretary\u2019s constituents. After her death, in August 2018, her widower, Jon, was sent an anonymous letter highlighting errors in her procedure. Allegations of what went wrong in her surgery are expected to be outlined at the inquest at Ipswich coroners court on Thursday and Friday. Ahead of the inquest, new details emerged about the lengths the trust went to try to uncover the mole, and the resentment this created amongst medics: The anonymous whistleblowing letter was first passed to the police and then handed to the coroner. The trust spent \u00a3968 on a handwriting expert and \u00a31,512 on a fingerprint expert to try identify the letter writer. The investigation was overseen by Louisa Pepper, a former assistant police chief constable, who sits as a non-executive director on the trust\u2019s board. A senior consultant said the trust should see the letter as a \u201ccry for help\u201d rather than an attempt to \u201cweaponise a patient\u201d as alleged by the trust\u2019s medical director, Nick Jenkins. The trust\u2019s chair, Sheila Childerhouse, accepted that the trust needed to reflect on the issue and asked whether it highlighted a \u201csystemic problem\u201d. On 11 December, the Guardian reported that Hancock failed to respond to concerns about the trust\u2019s treatment of staff. The day before the story was published, the issue was a raised at a medical staff (consultants) committee meeting. Senior staff had been warned to expect a story in the Guardian about the incident in a message from chief executive Dr Stephen Dunn. In the message, Dunn repeated a claim the trust initially made to the Guardian, that the demand for biometric data was only \u201cvoluntary\u201d. At the time one doctor told the Guardian that the Dunn\u2019s statement was \u201creceived very badly\u201d by staff. Another doctor said: \u201cIt\u2019s bollocks.

Since then the university has expanded its widening participation efforts and outreach to schools with no or few Oxbridge applicants, while individual colleges led by Wadham and Lady Margaret Hall launched more radical schemes.

      "body": "<p>On Saturday morning, Peter got up and went to the supermarket. He carried his shopping home, and took care of his laundry and ironing. In the afternoon, he browsed a few record stores and later he cooked himself dinner; always something adventurous on a Saturday night. Afterwards, he hit Netflix. And in all those hours, in common with many of Peter\u2019s Saturdays, not to mention his Sundays, he had no meaningful interaction with another human being. \u201cThe only person I spoke to,\u201d he says, \u201cwas the lady who came over to verify my bottles of beer at the supermarket self-checkout.\u201d</p> <p>During the week, Peter, 62, is too busy to be lonely. His commute from Brighton to London means that his working life is \u201ca tunnel\u201d he enters on a Monday and from which no daylight is glimpsed until Friday. But just when Peter re-emerges, he is stymied by an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Instead of providing respite from the stress of office life, a chance to reconnect with family and friends, the weekend looms as a vast emotional and social wilderness that must be traversed before work takes hold again.</p> <p>Peter dreads the weekend. But he is far from alone in this. He is one of nearly 200 respondents, from Falmouth to Jakarta, who replied to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/28/have-you-experienced-weekend-loneliness-share-your-experiences\">a callout on the Guardian\u2019s website</a> for readers to share their experience of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/loneliness\" title=\"\">weekend loneliness</a>. The youngest respondent was 16; the eldest in her 70s, and between them, the pain and isolation recurred in countless iterations.</p> <p>Despite all this, the phenomenon of weekend loneliness has scarcely been studied. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s been researched at all,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/pamela.qualter.html\" title=\"\">Pamela Qualter</a>, professor of psychology for education at the University of Manchester. She led the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2yzhfv4DvqVp5nZyxBD8G23/who-feels-lonely-the-results-of-the-world-s-largest-loneliness-study\" title=\"\">Loneliness Experiment</a> last year, and \u201cfound that there didn\u2019t seem to be a time of day [nor] a season when people felt especially lonely. But we didn\u2019t ask about the weekend.\u201d So what does weekend loneliness look like, who experiences it \u2013 and what might be done to alleviate it?</p> <p>\u201cWe define loneliness as the difference between the desire or expectation of what life should be like, and the reality,\u201d says Kellie Payne, research and policy manager at the <a href=\"https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/\" title=\"\">Campaign to End Loneliness</a>. For those who experience loneliness primarily \u2013 or only \u2013 at the weekend, this painful discrepancy is intensified by the sense of being at odds not only with the world outside the door, but with one\u2019s capable, sociable weekday self.</p> <p>A personal, internal division emerges. Liz is 41, with a rewarding job and family nearby \u2013 but she is living two lives. \u201cIn the week, I am a contented, fulfilled person. At the weekend, I feel like a lonely outcast,\u201d she says. Increasingly, she finds herself out of step with her social group where she lives in Somerset. She runs her own training business from home, so weekdays are busy. But this is exactly when her married friends want to meet for coffee \u201cand a moan about their husbands\u201d.</p> <p>Liz would like to see these friends at the weekend, too, but when Saturday comes, \u201cit\u2019s unsaid \u2013 but it\u2019s like they\u2019ve closed the doors to me. Weekends are for couples. It would be unheard of to invite me to a dinner party, because I\u2019m single,\u201d she says. \u201cI wake up on a Saturday and feel down. It\u2019s a struggle to pull myself out of bed if I have nothing planned.\u201d When Monday dawns, \u201cit is always a relief\u201d.</p> <p>For Liz, the loneliness of the weekend is exacerbated by an additional, painful sense that she is not only alone but locked out \u2013 \u201cbanned from the weekend\u201d, as she puts it. Between Monday and Friday, she enjoys her neighbourhood, but at the weekend, the streets and parks seem to transform. They become questioning, forbidding, to the extent that Liz wonders if she has \u201cabsorbed\u201d her loneliness from her environment, now full of couples, families, groups.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that I\u2019ll sit on my own in a cafe easily in the week,\u201d she says. But the same cafe at the weekend is a space she cannot enter. Even walking the dog takes on a different cast. \u201cI don\u2019t feel conscious at all during the week\u201d \u2013 but on a Sunday morning, the same walk feels acutely sad.</p> <p>\u201cAs psychologists we talk about the looking-glass self,\u201d Qualter says. \u201cHow your feelings about yourself are influenced by how you think others see you. The public space changes, becomes occupied by other people \u2026 It\u2019s no longer your space. You feel uncomfortable because you don\u2019t fit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hear this a lot,\u201d says <a href=\"https://sallybrowntherapy.com/\" title=\"\">Sally Brown</a>, a life coach and counsellor. \u201cIt\u2019s like people have two personas. The weekday persona is busy and confident. But the weekend persona is lost and vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>But is Liz really projecting her loneliness on to others, and imagining the way they see her \u2013 or does society read people who are alone in too predictable a manner? Peter believes he passes through his Brighton weekends undisturbed because he is regarded as a harmless eccentric. \u201cThe bachelor is something of a social misfit, but an acceptable one,\u201d he remarks.</p> <p>A person who enters a public space alone will often be read as best left alone. Mark is 32 and recently returned to London after a couple of years travelling. Going to the pub to watch football one weekend, he took a seat at an empty table for six. Quickly the pub filled. But Mark sat alone and undisturbed for 20 minutes before anyone asked if they could take one of the five free seats around him. \u201cI guess they think you are going to be bringing extra people, or you\u2019re weird,\u201d he says wryly.</p> <p>Brown, who sees many clients in their 30s and 40s, thinks this disconnect is \u201crelated to those transitional times when your peer group may have moved on to a stage you haven\u2019t yet reached\u201d. And, of course, may not wish to reach. Mark\u2019s friends, like Liz\u2019s, are mostly in relationships. \u201cIt can happen really fast. All of a sudden, your group isn\u2019t there any more. You are second-tier friendship, relegated to week nights. You\u2019re not in the couples\u2019 dinner party or playdate scene. You start to lack confidence in connecting, so hesitate to suggest things. You assume you are not welcome at the weekend and withdraw \u2026 It becomes a toxic circle.\u201d</p> <p>Brown\u2019s belief that loneliness at the weekend arises out of life\u2019s transitions resonates with Kate. At 61, hers is a different kind of shift to Mark\u2019s or Liz\u2019s. Kate sees herself moving \u201cfrom motherhood to single life again\u201d. She uses the word \u201ctransition\u201d, especially when she reminds herself, while she sits alone on Saturday nights, that she has raised her girls well, that the loneliness is just another challenge to overcome.</p> <p>Kate, who lives in Cardiff, has two grown daughters whom she raised alone. Her weeks are busy with work and friends, and sometimes her children, if they happen to be nearby. But her weekends, like Peter\u2019s, are \u201cvery long and quiet \u2026 I will not use my voice or speak with another human until Monday.\u201d</p> <p>For Kate, the silence of the weekend is wrapped in another sort of silence. She cannot speak of her loneliness to anyone, least of all her children.</p> <p>\u201cThey would be devastated,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a way, promoting their education, encouraging them to be social and confident \u2026 That has been to the detriment of me. The more they achieve, the further from home they have moved. But I wouldn\u2019t change it, because it was my duty as a mother.\u201d</p> <p>Seven times during the course of an hour-and-a-half\u2019s conversation, Kate worries that sharing her loneliness with her children would \u201cburden\u201d them. The word feels heavier each time it lands.</p> <p>While silence protects her daughters, and preserves their sense of Kate, and Kate\u2019s sense of herself, as \u201cstrong and capable, someone they can talk to\u201d, it compounds her remoteness. Although she exchanges WhatsApp messages with both children every weekend, these seem to make no impact on Kate\u2019s underlying isolation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c279a0b644e8368b744155c9bfb6ee0020a4aec3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c279a0b644e8368b744155c9bfb6ee0020a4aec3/0_0_1281_769/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The idea of being retired is horrific \u2013 then all days will be like weekends.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The idea of being retired is horrific \u2013 then all days will be like weekends.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Monika Jurczyk/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She has a \u201cwonderful relationship\u201d with both daughters, but their closeness makes the pain worse \u2013 because how can they not see?</p> <p>I wonder if Kate\u2019s daughters ever ask her what she did at the weekend, and Kate says she has been wondering about this, too. They don\u2019t. \u201cAt some level \u2013 not consciously \u2013 they are worried about the answer.\u201d In the meantime, her children\u2019s absence weighs \u201clike a bereavement\u201d and the loneliness hits hardest at certain predictable moments.</p> <p>Just as Peter sits down to his adventurous dinner, picks up his cutlery and feels instantly lonely \u2013 despite his efforts in the kitchen \u2013 so Kate reels from her plate.</p> <p>She is at the opposite end of the culinary spectrum to Peter. \u201cOne of my favourite go-to meals is a couple of boiled eggs and a piece of toast,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a classic comfort meal that Kate routinely enjoys. But last weekend, she sat down, cracked open the egg, \u201cand I thought: \u2018I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 I have had that meal so many times, I just couldn\u2019t eat it.\u201d She threw the food into the bin.</p> <p>Kate is approaching retirement. \u201cBut the idea of being retired is horrific \u2013 because all the days will be like weekends.\u201d So what can she, or anyone, do to try to stem their weekend loneliness?</p> <p>Sarah, who is 44 and lives in Surrey, asks herself this very question. \u201cWhat can you do to alleviate your loneliness? We\u2019re all struggling. Everyone I know has less money to spend.\u201d She, too, is a single parent; and as her daughter, 18, becomes more independent, Sarah feels increasingly lonely at weekends. \u201cWhat exacerbates the loneliness is that I\u2019m a very sociable person,\u201d she says.</p> <p>To counter this, she keeps herself in a state of perpetual readiness for last-minute invitations. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be seen as someone who will say yes \u2013 because you get asked again. I\u2019ve been very lucky to be an emergency plus-one in quite a few situations,\u201d Sarah says. She is aware that this won\u2019t sound lucky to everyone.</p> <p>She has filled in for her best friend on a trip with her friend\u2019s husband to Secret Cinema. And she has made up the numbers at a wedding. \u201cThere is a kind of currency to being a couple,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the word I want to use \u2013 a currency that makes couples worth more in social situations.\u201d (Conversely, of course, the cost of living is lower for them, too.) So does being available at the last minute represent a kind of personal devaluation?</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s fair to say,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d much rather be turning up with someone. But I really appreciate it when I\u2019m included. I love it. I think it\u2019s important to be the person who says: \u2018Yes, sure, I can sit next to whoever.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sarah and I are speaking on a Saturday afternoon. If she were not talking to me, she says, she would be writing an email or doing housework. She has a natural positivity and a bright voice that belie the sadness she feels on her most solitary weekends. If her daughter goes to university next year, the weekends, and weekdays, will further quieten. Like Kate and Peter, Sarah is conscious of the life change that looms.</p> <p>So she is quietly hatching plans \u2013 to move, maybe, depending on her daughter\u2019s movements. And in the meantime, she offers to babysit for friends, hopes for a leisure revolution for single people, and says yes to as many invitations as possible.</p> <p>\u201cIt comes down to keeping the communication lines open, and initiating,\u201d Brown, the life coach, says. Some of her clients have resolved their divided lives by adding structure to their weekends. Loneliness creates passivity in friendships, Brown warns. \u201cThere is a sense of \u2018I can\u2019t make this happen \u2026 It has got to happen to me\u2019\u201d, which can make people who are lonely less inclined to make an effort.</p> <p>With some clients, Brown has mapped on paper their social circles and groups. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many people they come up with.\u201d Others\u2019 \u201cproactive approach\u201d include cultivating regular haunts (because being among fellow regulars can feel a bit like being among friends) and attending groups or clubs through the website Meetup.</p> <p>\u201cThat journey can involve some extra loneliness if you find a group you don\u2019t fit with,\u201d Brown warns. I think of Peter, who dropped out of a walking group after a woman berated him for describing himself as \u201ca sad old bachelor\u201d. (\u201cYou mustn\u2019t say that,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou must say you\u2019re alone and happy.\u201d) Or Kate, waiting for her children to ask what she did at the weekend. Or Mark, who sometimes finds Meetups \u201ca group of lonely, desperate guys\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about keeping going,\u201d Brown advises. \u201cIf after two weeks you\u2019re not connecting, move on.\u201d Loneliness is complex, she notes. \u201cIt can impact those who crave time to themselves after a week at work\u201d; a double bind in which company is both a salve and an impediment.</p> <p>Peter, for instance, used to volunteer, but, he says, \u201cit cut into what little weekend time I had\u201d, which makes me suspect that as well as hankering for connection, he also cherishes his time alone. \u201cPeople talk about the difference between being alone and being lonely,\u201d he says. \u201cI am slap bang in the middle of that.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kate is thinking of fostering children. When Peter retires, he might travel the UK and explore a new culinary continent: veganism. Liz has been broadening her group of friends, \u201cmeeting new people who aren\u2019t so stuck in the couple thing\u201d. Mark is considering a move to a livelier part of London. And Sarah reminds herself, on her loneliest Saturday evenings, when no last-minute invitations materialise, \u201cto look at all the positives. It\u2019s really hard, but try to embrace the aloneness, the solitude.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names and personal details have been changed.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "On Saturday morning, Peter got up and went to the supermarket. He carried his shopping home, and took care of his laundry and ironing. In the afternoon, he browsed a few record stores and later he cooked himself dinner; always something adventurous on a Saturday night. Afterwards, he hit Netflix. And in all those hours, in common with many of Peter\u2019s Saturdays, not to mention his Sundays, he had no meaningful interaction with another human being. \u201cThe only person I spoke to,\u201d he says, \u201cwas the lady who came over to verify my bottles of beer at the supermarket self-checkout.\u201d During the week, Peter, 62, is too busy to be lonely. His commute from Brighton to London means that his working life is \u201ca tunnel\u201d he enters on a Monday and from which no daylight is glimpsed until Friday. But just when Peter re-emerges, he is stymied by an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Instead of providing respite from the stress of office life, a chance to reconnect with family and friends, the weekend looms as a vast emotional and social wilderness that must be traversed before work takes hold again. Peter dreads the weekend. But he is far from alone in this. He is one of nearly 200 respondents, from Falmouth to Jakarta, who replied to a callout on the Guardian\u2019s website for readers to share their experience of weekend loneliness. The youngest respondent was 16; the eldest in her 70s, and between them, the pain and isolation recurred in countless iterations. Despite all this, the phenomenon of weekend loneliness has scarcely been studied. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s been researched at all,\u201d says Pamela Qualter, professor of psychology for education at the University of Manchester. She led the BBC\u2019s Loneliness Experiment last year, and \u201cfound that there didn\u2019t seem to be a time of day [nor] a season when people felt especially lonely. But we didn\u2019t ask about the weekend.\u201d So what does weekend loneliness look like, who experiences it \u2013 and what might be done to alleviate it? \u201cWe define loneliness as the difference between the desire or expectation of what life should be like, and the reality,\u201d says Kellie Payne, research and policy manager at the Campaign to End Loneliness. For those who experience loneliness primarily \u2013 or only \u2013 at the weekend, this painful discrepancy is intensified by the sense of being at odds not only with the world outside the door, but with one\u2019s capable, sociable weekday self. A personal, internal division emerges. Liz is 41, with a rewarding job and family nearby \u2013 but she is living two lives. \u201cIn the week, I am a contented, fulfilled person. At the weekend, I feel like a lonely outcast,\u201d she says. Increasingly, she finds herself out of step with her social group where she lives in Somerset. She runs her own training business from home, so weekdays are busy. But this is exactly when her married friends want to meet for coffee \u201cand a moan about their husbands\u201d. Liz would like to see these friends at the weekend, too, but when Saturday comes, \u201cit\u2019s unsaid \u2013 but it\u2019s like they\u2019ve closed the doors to me. Weekends are for couples. It would be unheard of to invite me to a dinner party, because I\u2019m single,\u201d she says. \u201cI wake up on a Saturday and feel down. It\u2019s a struggle to pull myself out of bed if I have nothing planned.\u201d When Monday dawns, \u201cit is always a relief\u201d. For Liz, the loneliness of the weekend is exacerbated by an additional, painful sense that she is not only alone but locked out \u2013 \u201cbanned from the weekend\u201d, as she puts it. Between Monday and Friday, she enjoys her neighbourhood, but at the weekend, the streets and parks seem to transform. They become questioning, forbidding, to the extent that Liz wonders if she has \u201cabsorbed\u201d her loneliness from her environment, now full of couples, families, groups. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that I\u2019ll sit on my own in a cafe easily in the week,\u201d she says. But the same cafe at the weekend is a space she cannot enter. Even walking the dog takes on a different cast. \u201cI don\u2019t feel conscious at all during the week\u201d \u2013 but on a Sunday morning, the same walk feels acutely sad. \u201cAs psychologists we talk about the looking-glass self,\u201d Qualter says. \u201cHow your feelings about yourself are influenced by how you think others see you. The public space changes, becomes occupied by other people \u2026 It\u2019s no longer your space. You feel uncomfortable because you don\u2019t fit.\u201d \u201cI hear this a lot,\u201d says Sally Brown, a life coach and counsellor. \u201cIt\u2019s like people have two personas. The weekday persona is busy and confident. But the weekend persona is lost and vulnerable.\u201d But is Liz really projecting her loneliness on to others, and imagining the way they see her \u2013 or does society read people who are alone in too predictable a manner? Peter believes he passes through his Brighton weekends undisturbed because he is regarded as a harmless eccentric. \u201cThe bachelor is something of a social misfit, but an acceptable one,\u201d he remarks. A person who enters a public space alone will often be read as best left alone. Mark is 32 and recently returned to London after a couple of years travelling. Going to the pub to watch football one weekend, he took a seat at an empty table for six. Quickly the pub filled. But Mark sat alone and undisturbed for 20 minutes before anyone asked if they could take one of the five free seats around him. \u201cI guess they think you are going to be bringing extra people, or you\u2019re weird,\u201d he says wryly. Brown, who sees many clients in their 30s and 40s, thinks this disconnect is \u201crelated to those transitional times when your peer group may have moved on to a stage you haven\u2019t yet reached\u201d. And, of course, may not wish to reach. Mark\u2019s friends, like Liz\u2019s, are mostly in relationships. \u201cIt can happen really fast. All of a sudden, your group isn\u2019t there any more. You are second-tier friendship, relegated to week nights. You\u2019re not in the couples\u2019 dinner party or playdate scene. You start to lack confidence in connecting, so hesitate to suggest things. You assume you are not welcome at the weekend and withdraw \u2026 It becomes a toxic circle.\u201d Brown\u2019s belief that loneliness at the weekend arises out of life\u2019s transitions resonates with Kate. At 61, hers is a different kind of shift to Mark\u2019s or Liz\u2019s. Kate sees herself moving \u201cfrom motherhood to single life again\u201d. She uses the word \u201ctransition\u201d, especially when she reminds herself, while she sits alone on Saturday nights, that she has raised her girls well, that the loneliness is just another challenge to overcome. Kate, who lives in Cardiff, has two grown daughters whom she raised alone. Her weeks are busy with work and friends, and sometimes her children, if they happen to be nearby. But her weekends, like Peter\u2019s, are \u201cvery long and quiet \u2026 I will not use my voice or speak with another human until Monday.\u201d For Kate, the silence of the weekend is wrapped in another sort of silence. She cannot speak of her loneliness to anyone, least of all her children. \u201cThey would be devastated,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a way, promoting their education, encouraging them to be social and confident \u2026 That has been to the detriment of me. The more they achieve, the further from home they have moved. But I wouldn\u2019t change it, because it was my duty as a mother.\u201d Seven times during the course of an hour-and-a-half\u2019s conversation, Kate worries that sharing her loneliness with her children would \u201cburden\u201d them. The word feels heavier each time it lands. While silence protects her daughters, and preserves their sense of Kate, and Kate\u2019s sense of herself, as \u201cstrong and capable, someone they can talk to\u201d, it compounds her remoteness. Although she exchanges WhatsApp messages with both children every weekend, these seem to make no impact on Kate\u2019s underlying isolation. She has a \u201cwonderful relationship\u201d with both daughters, but their closeness makes the pain worse \u2013 because how can they not see? I wonder if Kate\u2019s daughters ever ask her what she did at the weekend, and Kate says she has been wondering about this, too. They don\u2019t. \u201cAt some level \u2013 not consciously \u2013 they are worried about the answer.\u201d In the meantime, her children\u2019s absence weighs \u201clike a bereavement\u201d and the loneliness hits hardest at certain predictable moments. Just as Peter sits down to his adventurous dinner, picks up his cutlery and feels instantly lonely \u2013 despite his efforts in the kitchen \u2013 so Kate reels from her plate. She is at the opposite end of the culinary spectrum to Peter. \u201cOne of my favourite go-to meals is a couple of boiled eggs and a piece of toast,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a classic comfort meal that Kate routinely enjoys. But last weekend, she sat down, cracked open the egg, \u201cand I thought: \u2018I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 I have had that meal so many times, I just couldn\u2019t eat it.\u201d She threw the food into the bin. Kate is approaching retirement. \u201cBut the idea of being retired is horrific \u2013 because all the days will be like weekends.\u201d So what can she, or anyone, do to try to stem their weekend loneliness? Sarah, who is 44 and lives in Surrey, asks herself this very question. \u201cWhat can you do to alleviate your loneliness? We\u2019re all struggling. Everyone I know has less money to spend.\u201d She, too, is a single parent; and as her daughter, 18, becomes more independent, Sarah feels increasingly lonely at weekends. \u201cWhat exacerbates the loneliness is that I\u2019m a very sociable person,\u201d she says.

      "body": "<p>Members of progressive Jewish communities are demanding a rabbis\u2019 code of ethics following mounting concern that a Jewish religious leader who was accused of bullying and manipulative behaviour has been promoted to run one of the UK\u2019s leading synagogues.</p> <p>An open letter signed by scores of people demands that rabbis and cantors adhere to standards of behaviour, covering financial malpractice, bullying, harassment, inappropriate sexual behaviour and intellectual dishonesty. It says expulsion from clerical bodies should be available as a sanction for serious breaches of the code.</p> <p>The letter follows dismay that the West London Synagogue (WLS), the flagship of the UK Reform Judaism movement, has appointed Rabbi David Mitchell as its joint senior rabbi to replace Baroness Julia Neuberger, who is retiring in March. Members of the synagogue\u2019s congregation include historian Sir Simon Schama and the actor Maureen Lipman.</p> <p>From 2012, complaints were made by some members of the synagogue\u2019s staff of inappropriate behaviour by Mitchell \u2013 charges he denies.

      "bodyText": "Members of progressive Jewish communities are demanding a rabbis\u2019 code of ethics following mounting concern that a Jewish religious leader who was accused of bullying and manipulative behaviour has been promoted to run one of the UK\u2019s leading synagogues. An open letter signed by scores of people demands that rabbis and cantors adhere to standards of behaviour, covering financial malpractice, bullying, harassment, inappropriate sexual behaviour and intellectual dishonesty. It says expulsion from clerical bodies should be available as a sanction for serious breaches of the code. The letter follows dismay that the West London Synagogue (WLS), the flagship of the UK Reform Judaism movement, has appointed Rabbi David Mitchell as its joint senior rabbi to replace Baroness Julia Neuberger, who is retiring in March. Members of the synagogue\u2019s congregation include historian Sir Simon Schama and the actor Maureen Lipman. From 2012, complaints were made by some members of the synagogue\u2019s staff of inappropriate behaviour by Mitchell \u2013 charges he denies. Several employees say they left their jobs as a result of bullying, derogatory comments and inappropriate references to sensitive personal information. In a statement seen by the Guardian, one said that as a young person she had confided in Mitchell about her depression and self-harm. \u201cHe then used this confidential, private and deeply sensitive information against me when I was working at WLS as his subordinate,\u201d she claimed. Another complainant described a \u201ctoxic atmosphere with synagogue management seeking to quash rather than respond to any complaints\u201d. She said she suffered from anxiety and depression and \u201ccried in the toilets nearly every day for around six months\u201d. Individuals said they initially made complaints about Mitchell\u2019s alleged behaviour internally. When it appeared no action had been taken, five made complaints in 2016 to Westminster council\u2019s safeguarding unit. In a letter responding to the allegations, the council said it had \u201ctaken your concerns exceptionally seriously and we are truly struck by your experiences\u201d but that they did not warrant further investigation by the safeguarding unit. It added: \u201cWLS have reassured us they will be addressing the safeguarding claims.\u201d Jill Todd, the synagogue\u2019s chair, invited the complainants to discuss their concerns, saying in an email that it would \u201chelp us to be assured that we are taking the appropriate action at West London Synagogue especially regarding your own personal concerns about David\u201d. However, ahead of scheduled meetings at WLS a few days later, the five say they were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements as a condition of being told the outcome of their complaints. The agreements committed them to keep the facts of the case and their own opinions \u201cstrictly confidential\u201d or face the threat of legal action. None signed. One complainant said they were subsequently told by WLS staff that Mitchell had been stripped of management responsibilities and removed as the synagogue\u2019s director of education. Another complainant said they were given assurances that he would not be appointed as senior rabbi. \u201cWe then left the matter alone, but now he has been promoted we are extremely worried,\u201d said one of the five. In a statement provided by WLS, Mitchell said: \u201cI strenuously deny that I have acted inappropriately. I want to apologise for anything that I have done which has inadvertently hurt or angered others. Since these issues were first raised I have learned, with coaching and mentoring, to become a better manager of people and I am still learning.\u201d WLS confirmed that complaints were made in 2016 and said the synagogue was advised by Westminster council\u2019s safeguarding team that they should be dealt with under internal management procedures. \u201cWe took professional advice at the time to ensure that all our legal duties were discharged, all appropriate actions taken and that internal procedures were followed correctly. The complainants were notified of the outcome at the time,\u201d it said in a statement. It would be inappropriate to provide details of an individual case, it added, \u201calthough we can reconfirm that the appointment committee for the post of Senior rabbi was aware at the time of the appointment that historic complaints had previously been made about Rabbi David.\u201d One source told the Guardian there were \u201csystemic problems\u201d at the synagogue. \u201cThis is not just about David Mitchell, but about the culture at WLS,\u201d they said.

      "body": "<p>Reaction in China to the US trade deal has been muted, with state media playing down news of the agreement signed in Washington and adopting a conciliatory tone.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Donald Trump and the Chinese vice-premier, Liu He, signed an initial pact that hits pause on more than two years of escalating trade tensions. China pledged to buy more US products while the US called off additional tariffs on Chinese goods, among other measures agreed between the two sides.</p> <p>While the US president hailed the pact as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/15/us-china-trade-deal-donald-trump\">\u201cthe biggest deal anybody has ever seen,\u201d</a> Chinese officials and state media described it in much more cautious terms.</p> <p>President Xi Jinping described the new agreement as a sign that the US and China can resolve their differences with dialogue, stating in a message delivered by Liu that the two countries had \u201cmade progress\u201d and should \u201cproperly address each others\u2019 concerns\u201d to push bilateral ties on the \u201cright track\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/15/us-china-trade-deal-donald-trump\">Trump signs China trade pact and boasts of 'the biggest deal ever seen'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The comments are in sharp contrast with Beijing\u2019s previous determination to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/fight-to-end-china-media-ramps-up-rhetoric-us-trade-war\">fight to the end</a>\u201d to defend its interests in the trade war.</p> <p>The often nationalistic state-run tabloid Global Times, whose stance on the trade stand-off have often been the most aggressive, said in an editorial: \u201cThe first phase of the agreement \u2026 certainly leaves both sides with regret and unhappiness, which is exactly the response that a fair agreement will elicit. Arguing who lost and who won is superficial.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, Chinese media ran state reports that echoed Xi\u2019s comments, with state broadcaster CCTV characterising the deal as \u201cboosting people\u2019s confidence\u201d that issues between China and the US can finally be settled.</p> <p>\u201cOn the whole, the United States won a small victory,\u201d said economist Shen Hong of the independent thinktank Beijing Tianze Economic Research Institute. \u201cIf the trade war continued it would definitely be more unfavourable for China.</p> <p>\u201cThis is better for China. It means the Chinese government finally realises that such compromises are good for China.\u201d</p> <p>As part of the deal Beijing has promised to increase purchases of US products and services by an additional $200bn over the next two years. While the pact halts new tariffs, it leaves in place the bulk of levies on $360bn worth of Chinese products. Retaliatory Chinese tariffs on over $100bn in US goods also remain unchanged.</p> <p>Observers say that China\u2019s muted response does not mean Beijing sees itself as having capitulated. Emphasising the idea of \u201cmutual benefit\u201d and \u201cwin-win\u201d cooperation is a common trope in Chinese diplomatic language, often employed when talking about the Belt and Road Initiative.</p> <p>\u201cHowever its relatively muted reaction does indicate it is concerned about how [the deal] will be received domestically,\u201d said Yun Jiang, co-editor of China Neican, a newsletter analysing Chinese policy, and a former official with Australia\u2019s Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest things is to not appear to be capitulating to the US. This is a possibility because the government has spent a lot of effort to drum up nationalistic sentiments.\u201d</p> <p>Observers have pointed out that the deal left out several of the thornier issues that have formed the basis of US-China trade frictions, from industrial subsidies for Chinese companies, forced technology transfers and stricter enforcement mechanisms.</p> <p>China\u2019s pledge to buy more US goods also came with a key caveat. Liu said Chinese purchases of $40bn worth of US farm goods a year over the next two years would be \u201cbased on market conditions\u201d.</p> <p>The US appeared optimistic about further talks, with the vice-president, Mike Pence, telling Fox Business Network that talks for a second-phase deal had begun.</p> <p>Chinese state media cautioned that these negotiations could prove even more difficult. The broadcaster CCTV said: \u201cThe more problems are resolved, the more intense the game becomes.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Reaction in China to the US trade deal has been muted, with state media playing down news of the agreement signed in Washington and adopting a conciliatory tone. On Wednesday, Donald Trump and the Chinese vice-premier, Liu He, signed an initial pact that hits pause on more than two years of escalating trade tensions. China pledged to buy more US products while the US called off additional tariffs on Chinese goods, among other measures agreed between the two sides. While the US president hailed the pact as \u201cthe biggest deal anybody has ever seen,\u201d Chinese officials and state media described it in much more cautious terms. President Xi Jinping described the new agreement as a sign that the US and China can resolve their differences with dialogue, stating in a message delivered by Liu that the two countries had \u201cmade progress\u201d and should \u201cproperly address each others\u2019 concerns\u201d to push bilateral ties on the \u201cright track\u201d. The comments are in sharp contrast with Beijing\u2019s previous determination to \u201cfight to the end\u201d to defend its interests in the trade war. The often nationalistic state-run tabloid Global Times, whose stance on the trade stand-off have often been the most aggressive, said in an editorial: \u201cThe first phase of the agreement \u2026 certainly leaves both sides with regret and unhappiness, which is exactly the response that a fair agreement will elicit. Arguing who lost and who won is superficial.\u201d On Thursday, Chinese media ran state reports that echoed Xi\u2019s comments, with state broadcaster CCTV characterising the deal as \u201cboosting people\u2019s confidence\u201d that issues between China and the US can finally be settled. \u201cOn the whole, the United States won a small victory,\u201d said economist Shen Hong of the independent thinktank Beijing Tianze Economic Research Institute. \u201cIf the trade war continued it would definitely be more unfavourable for China. \u201cThis is better for China. It means the Chinese government finally realises that such compromises are good for China.\u201d As part of the deal Beijing has promised to increase purchases of US products and services by an additional $200bn over the next two years. While the pact halts new tariffs, it leaves in place the bulk of levies on $360bn worth of Chinese products. Retaliatory Chinese tariffs on over $100bn in US goods also remain unchanged. Observers say that China\u2019s muted response does not mean Beijing sees itself as having capitulated. Emphasising the idea of \u201cmutual benefit\u201d and \u201cwin-win\u201d cooperation is a common trope in Chinese diplomatic language, often employed when talking about the Belt and Road Initiative. \u201cHowever its relatively muted reaction does indicate it is concerned about how [the deal] will be received domestically,\u201d said Yun Jiang, co-editor of China Neican, a newsletter analysing Chinese policy, and a former official with Australia\u2019s Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. \u201cThe biggest things is to not appear to be capitulating to the US. This is a possibility because the government has spent a lot of effort to drum up nationalistic sentiments.\u201d Observers have pointed out that the deal left out several of the thornier issues that have formed the basis of US-China trade frictions, from industrial subsidies for Chinese companies, forced technology transfers and stricter enforcement mechanisms. China\u2019s pledge to buy more US goods also came with a key caveat. Liu said Chinese purchases of $40bn worth of US farm goods a year over the next two years would be \u201cbased on market conditions\u201d. The US appeared optimistic about further talks, with the vice-president, Mike Pence, telling Fox Business Network that talks for a second-phase deal had begun. Chinese state media cautioned that these negotiations could prove even more difficult. The broadcaster CCTV said: \u201cThe more problems are resolved, the more intense the game becomes.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

As for closing the area down, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is very realistic as it is also a very profitable district, so it would be very expensive to do that.\u201d What she says is \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d is that the women\u2019s situation must be bettered, that those who live around the area are disturbed less and that criminality is not given an easy ride. \u201cWe call it brancheren \u2013 interfering with the economic branches of the city,\u201d said Halsema. \u201cIn the last five or six years, the inner city has become an economic zone, while it is also cultural heritage. We need to rethink the main cultural significance of our inner city and what it means for the people who live in Amsterdam and Holland. We need to have the guts to interfere in the economic structures of the city. I think we are in time.\u201d",

Everyone\u2019s suffering.</p> \n<p>How do we find hope in this?</p> \n<p>Australia has, of course, known national miseries before. Living memories of the annihilating Great Depression grow faint, but the recorded histories are indelible.</p> \n<p>So devastating was the impact of global economic events upon this country that in the early 1930s, rates of national unemployment rose to <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Completed_inquiries/2002-04/poverty/report/c04\">30% of the population</a> \u2013 a tally second only to Germany.</p> \n<p>In a country that had not yet built a welfare state, government assistance was discretionary and families were fed by charity and soup kitchens. In New South Wales, communities of homeless families sheltered in coastal caves. The experience was no less apocalyptic for being economic, not environmental.</p> \n<p>Then came a world war. Australian deployed troops from 1939 to fight the existential threat of fascism and not with any certainty of victory. There were 100 air raids on our soil; Darwin lay in ruins. We buried 27,000 soldiers. We convalesced a generation more.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s from our country\u2019s own material reckoning with these historical horrors that our present hope must spring.</p> \n<p>The economic phenomenon John Maynard Keynes <a href=\"http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300071h/printall.html\">predicted</a> of government spending in the war economy came to pass; the obligation on the government to meet wartime demands of productivity remedied the malaise of unemployment and deprivation that defined the early decade.</p> \n<p>In 1945, towards the war\u2019s end, the prime minister, Labor\u2019s John Curtin, applied the insights gained into a <a href=\"http://www.billmitchell.org/White_Paper_1945/index.html\">White Paper</a> on full employment.</p> \n<p>War economy, it said, \u201chas taught us valuable lessons which we can apply to the problems of peacetime, when full employment must be achieved in ways consistent with a free society\u201d.</p> \n<p>The resulting expansion in infrastructure spending and public works over the next three decades created an economic engine so powerful that Australia was able to absorb two million post-war migrants with unemployment averaging around <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Completed_inquiries/2002-04/poverty/report/c04\">a frictional 2%</a>.</p> \n<p>The devastation of the fires offers a similar opportunity for government investment and public works consistent with these principles of economic growth.</p> \n<p>The obligation of rebuilding scorched forests and shattered communities is one in which government can do more than speak to theoretical \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/21/port-augusta-can-show-the-world-what-just-transition-for-workers-looks-like?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">transition</a>\u201d processes for blue-collar workers in fossil fuel industries.</p> \n<p>This window is one in which the demands of our crisis can provide good, stable government employment in reforestation and forestry management, in a regional redevelopment based around low-emission, fireproof infrastructure \u2013 and employ even more Australians in conception and design processes that can then be exported internationally.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/11/terror-hope-anger-kindness-the-complexity-of-life-as-we-face-the-new-normal\">Terror, hope, anger, kindness: the complexity of life as we face the new normal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The imperative of fireproofing communities while meeting climate mitigation targets offers a screaming opportunity to build a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/09/bushfire-proof-houses-black-saturday-innovations?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\"> fireproof kit-home</a> manufacturing and construction industry, of employing and investing in precision and regenerative agriculture, of expanding low-emissions transport infrastructure. And government-led industry enables not only leadership on fair workplace conditions and wages, but also the responsibility of adhering to strict safety and emission standards in everything we design, develop and produce.</p> \n<p>The sad history of privatisation in this country demonstrates that the alternative of just leaving reconstruction to market forces is a logic of prioritising private profits for corporations over meeting the diverse challenges of public need, especially when it comes to climate. Nation-building, or rebuilding on a post-fire, multi-billion-dollar scale demands a governmental vehicle to realise our best ambitions.</p> \n<p>Will we demand it?</p> \n<p>I suggest if we want to see our country and our people not only served but represented than we must. Because if there\u2019s a second optimism we can seize from the fires, it\u2019s the example of a collective selflessness that has come to define Australians through this crisis.</p> \n<p>From the unpaid, relentless firefighters to the neighbourhood volunteers, the heaving instinct to charity to the painful empathy that we realise in our grief and sadness, we\u2019ve learned a nation-building truth about ourselves.</p> \n<p>There may indeed be one instinct alone that culturally defines what it means to be Australian. It\u2019s community.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist</p></li> \n</ul>",

      "bodyText": "I started to avoid too much of the bushfire coverage after I heard the stories of the NSW Rural Fire Service volunteers traumatised by the sound of koalas screaming as they burned to death. We had already had our \u201cwatch and act\u201d notice at our small cottage in the countryside, the fearful hours of soaking compost heaps and woodpiles with the hose, tearing anything too plastic and flammable out of the garden, packing our bags. The evacuation alert sounded and I stood in the spare room, emotionally reckoning with the chance that our clothes, books, artworks, photographs, ornaments and beloved pieces of furniture I may never see again. My spleen emptied and I trembled. Seven minutes later, the wind had changed, the fire was under control, the evacuation was called off \u2026 but I was still flooded with adrenalin and shaking. Some stories you can\u2019t avoid. The photographs of tennis players collapsing from smoke inhalation at the Australian Open have become, in the worst way, iconic. The catalogue of birds and lizards, frogs and mammals burnt, frightened, starving and threatened are too provocative to contemplate, a childhood terror ignited that there would come trouble that Blinky Bill could not escape, that something is killing Dot\u2019s kangaroo. The human suffering is carved into the lines around exhausted firefighters eyes, the grime on their uniforms, they parched lips. It doesn\u2019t need details. Our last months as a nation are summarised in the burnt fur of our innocent icons, the images of our children, still and terrified, wearing oxygen masks under our thick, smoky skies. I learned this week that in the remains of the flattened town where a friend\u2019s father\u2019s house burned down, there\u2019s a man living in a chicken coop because there are no other options. I couldn\u2019t read on. The toxin that saps the Australian body is a hybrid of crisis fatigue and grief fatigue. Everyone\u2019s suffering. How do we find hope in this? Australia has, of course, known national miseries before. Living memories of the annihilating Great Depression grow faint, but the recorded histories are indelible. So devastating was the impact of global economic events upon this country that in the early 1930s, rates of national unemployment rose to 30% of the population \u2013 a tally second only to Germany. In a country that had not yet built a welfare state, government assistance was discretionary and families were fed by charity and soup kitchens. In New South Wales, communities of homeless families sheltered in coastal caves. The experience was no less apocalyptic for being economic, not environmental. Then came a world war. Australian deployed troops from 1939 to fight the existential threat of fascism and not with any certainty of victory. There were 100 air raids on our soil; Darwin lay in ruins. We buried 27,000 soldiers. We convalesced a generation more. But it\u2019s from our country\u2019s own material reckoning with these historical horrors that our present hope must spring. The economic phenomenon John Maynard Keynes predicted of government spending in the war economy came to pass; the obligation on the government to meet wartime demands of productivity remedied the malaise of unemployment and deprivation that defined the early decade. In 1945, towards the war\u2019s end, the prime minister, Labor\u2019s John Curtin, applied the insights gained into a White Paper on full employment. War economy, it said, \u201chas taught us valuable lessons which we can apply to the problems of peacetime, when full employment must be achieved in ways consistent with a free society\u201d. The resulting expansion in infrastructure spending and public works over the next three decades created an economic engine so powerful that Australia was able to absorb two million post-war migrants with unemployment averaging around a frictional 2%. The devastation of the fires offers a similar opportunity for government investment and public works consistent with these principles of economic growth. The obligation of rebuilding scorched forests and shattered communities is one in which government can do more than speak to theoretical \u201ctransition\u201d processes for blue-collar workers in fossil fuel industries. This window is one in which the demands of our crisis can provide good, stable government employment in reforestation and forestry management, in a regional redevelopment based around low-emission, fireproof infrastructure \u2013 and employ even more Australians in conception and design processes that can then be exported internationally. The imperative of fireproofing communities while meeting climate mitigation targets offers a screaming opportunity to build a fireproof kit-home manufacturing and construction industry, of employing and investing in precision and regenerative agriculture, of expanding low-emissions transport infrastructure. And government-led industry enables not only leadership on fair workplace conditions and wages, but also the responsibility of adhering to strict safety and emission standards in everything we design, develop and produce. The sad history of privatisation in this country demonstrates that the alternative of just leaving reconstruction to market forces is a logic of prioritising private profits for corporations over meeting the diverse challenges of public need, especially when it comes to climate. Nation-building, or rebuilding on a post-fire, multi-billion-dollar scale demands a governmental vehicle to realise our best ambitions. Will we demand it? I suggest if we want to see our country and our people not only served but represented than we must. Because if there\u2019s a second optimism we can seize from the fires, it\u2019s the example of a collective selflessness that has come to define Australians through this crisis. From the unpaid, relentless firefighters to the neighbourhood volunteers, the heaving instinct to charity to the painful empathy that we realise in our grief and sadness, we\u2019ve learned a nation-building truth about ourselves. There may indeed be one instinct alone that culturally defines what it means to be Australian. It\u2019s community. Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "New Zealand\u2019s famous kiwi birds are suffering from dehydration as drought affects many northern areas of the country, with conservationists warning chicks may soon perish too. There are 68,000 kiwi left in New Zealand but their number is declining at a rate of 2% a year. A century ago there were millions but attacks by dogs, cats, possums, stoats and rats have led to a huge decline. Now, record-breaking hot summers are threatening the bird which struggles in hot temperatures due to its thick cloak of warm feathers. Parched earth and empty or stagnant water sources in parts of Northland, 170km north of Auckland, are making them severely dehydrated, disoriented and vulnerable to attack. In Whang\u0101rei, parts of which have had record low rainfall this summer, kiwi conservationists are asking locals to leave out tubs of water for the birds, which are venturing out of the bush seeking food and water. But the nocturnal searches are putting the ancient flightless birds at risk of being attacked by introduced predators or hit by traffic. Others become disoriented when they leave the bush and get trapped in exposed areas as dawn breaks \u2013 the heat of which they are not prepared for. Rob Webb, from the Whang\u0101rei native bird recovery centre, has found five severely dehydrated kiwi this summer; two died. He said the birds need urgent help. \u201cYou put the bird into the sun and feel it after five minutes \u2013 you feel them and their feathers are hot,\u201d Webb told local media. \u201cIt\u2019s like walking into the heat with a big winter coat on all done up.\u201d The high summer temperatures have coincided with the Northland brown kiwis\u2019 breeding season, with chicks especially vulnerable. Last year was the fourth-hottest year on record in New Zealand, and the Northland regional council said many parts of the region were now \u201con the cusp\u201d of drought after record low rainfall in 2019. Water restrictions are in place in some areas and no significant rainfall is forecast for the coming months. Paul O\u2019Shea, an administrator for Kiwis for Kiwi, a conservation group set up to save the bird from extinction, said they are part of New Zealand\u2019s identity, and their survival was paramount. \u201cNew Zealanders are a shy and reclusive bunch \u2013 the kiwi is a bird we identify with,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s as vital to protect the kiwi in New Zealand as it is to protect the orangutan in Borneo, the Sumatran tiger in Indonesia, and the panda in China.

In recent years homeless people have died on the streets during long, cold winters. \u201cThe bottom line is sadly we don\u2019t have any strategic housing plan as a country, there\u2019s no strategic plan in terms of making a difference,\u201d said Bernie Smith, the chief executive officer of Monte Cecilia Housing Trust, which houses homeless families in south Auckland. \u201cThere\u2019s a hell of a lot of money going into motels and transitional housing, but very little going into building homes.\u201d The highest demand for a state house was in Auckland, with more than 5,000 families waiting, followed by Wellington and Waikato. The opposition National party said the government should be \u201cashamed\u201d that tens of thousands of Kiwis were without a home. \u201cSuch a sharp increase in just two short years can only be explained by poor government policy,\u201d said Simon O\u2019Connor, the National party\u2019s housing spokesman. \u201cLabour was too quick to meddle in the rental market when it should have been focused on building houses. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re in this mess today is because KiwiBuild tanked, Labour\u2019s new rental standards scared off landlords at the affordable end of the market, and its decision to end tenancy reviews increased pressure on social housing supply. \u201cNew Zealanders want housing solutions, but all they\u2019re getting from this government is excuses.\u201d The government said its open and empathetic approach to leadership had led to thousands asking for help, hence the boost in demand \u2013 a position supported by the chief executive of Community Housing Aotearoa, Scott Figenshow. \u201cThe government have created a culture where it is OK for people to be coming forward with their housing needs, so the fact the registry is increasing means that as a country we are doing a better job at documenting the needs,\u201d said Figenshow. New Zealand needed to take a \u201chuman rights approach\u201d to housing and the increasing cost of rent, near stagnant wages and other financial pressures such as the newly introduced petrol tax meant increasingly New Zealanders new homeless were employed and productive but still unable to afford a roof over their heads. \u201cThe most important thing Jacinda has tried to do is put the fact that a right for housing is something we should strive for right back at the centre of things,\u201d Figenshow said. \u201cFor so long under National it was punitive: \u2018If you\u2019re not housed its your fault.\u2019 Now the government is working very hard to change that, but it takes time for that to flow down to people in severe hardship. But there\u2019s definitely some positive signs.\u201d The associate minister for housing, Kris Faafoi, said that in two years the government had delivered 3,300 public housing places, with another 2,500 places under construction which are expected to be delivered \u201cby the middle of this year\u201d. Close to NZ$200m was earmarked to address \u201cchronic homelessness\u201d in last year\u2019s wellbeing budget. \u201cHomelessness is a complex and growing problem,\u201d he said. \u201cEnding homelessness is a priority for the government. Every New Zealander has a right to a warm, dry, secure and safe place to live.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump \u201cknew exactly what was going on\u201d in a scheme to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden, according to an associate of the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Lev Parnas, a businessman and Republican donor indicted for campaign finance violations, made the explosive allegations during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Wednesday night. When Parnas was in Ukraine, attempting to pressure Ukrainian officials to help dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter, he was doing so on behalf of the president and Giuliani, Parnas said, speaking with his lawyer at his side. Parnas said: \u201cI was on the ground doing their work.\u201d Parnas also said other members of the Trump administration knew about the Ukraine pressure campaign. He said William Barr, the attorney general, \u201cwas basically on the team\u201d. And the former national security adviser John Bolton, who recently indicated he would testify in the Senate impeachment trial if he was subpoenaed, also \u201c100%\u201d knew about the scheme, Parnas said. The extent of Trump\u2019s involvement in an alleged scheme to pressure Ukrainian officials will be at the heart of the impeachment trial, which will begin next week. Trump has denied misconduct. On Tuesday, House investigators released a trove of text messages, notes and other documents obtained from Parnas\u2019s lawyers. The records include a letter Giuliani sent requesting a private meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, then Ukraine\u2019s president-elect. The request was made with Trump\u2019s \u201cknowledge and consent\u201d, Giuliani wrote. House prosecutors are expected to present newly obtained evidence from Parnas over the course of the trial, which could unearth new evidence of misconduct by Trump. On behalf of Giuliani, Parnas said he told a Ukrainian official that unless the administration announced an intention to investigate the Bidens, Mike Pence would not attend the Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration. The next day, \u201cto my awareness\u201d, said Parnas, Trump called to inform Ukrainian officials that Pence would cancel his trip to Ukraine. Holding back military aid to Ukraine in order to turn up the pressure was something Trump \u201cdecided to do\u201d after officials repeatedly resisted announcing investigations into the Bidens, Parnas said. Trump has insisted he did not know Parnas and Igor Fruman, another Giuliani associate, who was indicted along with Parnas for making illegal campaign donations. Photos posted by Parnas to Facebook show himself and Fruman with Trump and president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody.\u201d But the president \u201clied\u201d, Parnas told Maddow. \u201cMe and him didn\u2019t watch football games together; we didn\u2019t eat hot dogs.

      "bodyText": "The former foreign minister Julie Bishop has taken a job with financing group Greensill, which specialises in the controversial practice of reverse factoring. Reverse factoring, also known as supply chain finance, is a practice where suppliers to big business can get paid early by a company such as Greensill in return for a fee. The Greensill founder, Lex Greensill, would like to expand the idea to take in wages, and in November met with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to suggest it could be applied to the 150,000 people working for the commonwealth public service. However, concerns reverse factoring could encourage big business to delay paying suppliers have sparked inquiries by the small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell, and the competition watchdog, which Guardian Australia can reveal has this week been interviewing small business representatives over the practice. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s has also fingered it as contributing to the multibillion-dollar financial implosions of big companies including UK government contractor Carillion and Spanish renewable energy group Abengoa. And on Wednesday, the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, banned the state\u2019s Water Corporation from using reverse factoring after the company told suppliers it would cost them 0.52% of their bills to be paid within a month. However, big businesses remain keen on the product because it can free up large amounts of cash, and Lex Greensill has defended it as \u201ccompletely optional\u201d for suppliers. Bishop\u2019s post-politics life after deciding not to contest last year\u2019s election has already drawn political fire. Last year she joined the board of one of the government\u2019s biggest aid contractors, Palladium, a move which together with the former defence minister Christopher Pyne\u2019s decision to take a job at EY ignited concerns about compliance with ministerial standards that ask former ministers not to lobby government about any matter with which they have had \u201cofficial dealings\u201d over the previous 18 months. Greensill said Bishop started her job at the company on 1 December. She \u201cwill provide strategic advice to Greensill and serve as chair of Greensill Asia Pacific as the company accelerates its expansion in the region,\u201d the company said. Lex Greensill said the company would \u201cdraw on Julie\u2019s unparalleled experience and expertise \u2013 particularly her international credentials cemented during five years as Australia\u2019s foreign minister\u201d. Labor\u2019s small business spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said Bishop\u2019s appointment was \u201cseriously concerning and draws attention to the inaction by the federal government in this area\u201d. \u201cThe increasing prevalence of reverse factoring is a significant challenge for small business, as payment times are extended, and small businesses are offered a third-party financier to pay the invoice on time but with a fee, meaning small businesses aren\u2019t receiving full reimbursement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is increasingly clear that the Liberals take small business for granted, setting the conditions that allow big businesses to treat small businesses like piggy banks.\u201d Last year, Labor raised the issue with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Guardian Australia can reveal that the ACCC has been conducting inquiries and this week an ACCC team interviewed Ken Phillips, who heads industry group Independent Contractors Australia and is a vocal opponent of reverse factoring. Phillips is calling on state and federal governments to use their power as large customers of big business to enforce 30-day payment terms and stamp out reverse factoring.",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Thursday\u2019s blog: The House Democrats who will prosecute Donald Trump delivered articles of impeachment to the Senate. Read more about the seven impeachment managers here. Senate leader Mitch McConnell invited the managers to present the articles at noon tomorrow. At 2 pm, Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the Senate trial, will be sworn in. The trial will begin in earnest on Tuesday. Trump signed a China trade pact. Read The Guardian\u2019s analysis of the deal here. Lawmakers and diplomats have called for an investigation into whether former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was being surveilled, in light of new exchanges between Lev Parnas and his associates released by House investigators. CNN releases audio of the testy post-debate exchange between Warren and Sanders. After the Democratic debate ended yesterday, Bernie Sanders outstretched his hand. Elizabeth Warren snatched hers away, and the two progressive candidates, who recently broke an apparent agreement not to turn negative against each other, engaged in what appeared to be a testy exchange. CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper released audio of the conversation. \u201cI think you called me a liar on national TV\u201d Warren said to Sanders. \u201cLet\u2019s not do it right now,\u201d Sanders responded. \u201cYou called me a liar\u201d. Meanwhile, Tom Steyer caught awkwardly between the quarreling progressives, said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get int the middle... I just wanted to say \u2018Hi,\u2019 Bernie.\u201d \u201cYeah, ok. Good,\u201d Sanders said. Lev Parnas: \u201cPresident Trump knew exactly what was going on.\u201d Parnas, the Rudy Giuliani associate who has been implicated in an alleged scheme to pressure the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son, sat down with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow for an interview. In a preview of the interview, which will air at 9pm Eastern time, Parnas said that Trump \u201cwas aware of all my movements. I wouldn\u2019t do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani, or the president.\u201d Pages of text messages, notes and other documents that House investigators released yesterday show that Parnas and his associates may have been carrying out surveillance of the US ambassador to Ukraine. One of the released documents was a letter that Giuliani wrote, requesting a Volodymyr Zelenskiy, then the president-elect of Ukraine, with Trump\u2019s \u201cknowledge and consent\u201d. The Senate is prepared to enforce strict measures that would limit journalists\u2019 access during the impeachment trial. According to Roll Call: The standing committees, press gallery staff, Capitol Police, sergeant-at-arms and Senate Rules Committee have been in negotiations for months about enhanced security for an eventual Senate trial. In recent weeks, Capitol Police personnel have come to the Senate Daily Press Gallery with tape measures in preparation for the installation of magnetometers and possibly removing reporter workspaces to make room for lines of reporters waiting to enter the chamber one by one, long before a final decision was made... The planned restriction on the press will surpass those in place for the Clinton impeachment trial and even the highly charged confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, when hundreds of protesters led to daily media crackdowns \u2014 even though none of the protesters were credentialed media. But the move has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. \u201cThe press will play a critical role in making sure the American public are able to witness the Senate fulfill its Constitutional obligation,\u201d said Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat representing Pennsylvania. \u201cLet them do their jobs as they do every day with the same level of access to lawmakers.\u201d \u201cU.S. senators are grown, women and grown men. If they don\u2019t want to make a comment, they know how to say \u2018no comment,\u2019\u201d John Kennedy, a Republican Senator from Louisiana told Politico. \u201cWe aren\u2019t children.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s supporters have taken issue with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s choice to use commemorative pens to sign the resolution to transfer articles of impeachment to the Senate, saying it undercuts her insistence that impeachment is a solemn undertaking. But it\u2019s worth noting that Trump is himself a fan of commemorative pens. He handed out his own souvenir pens after signing the China trade deal today. And... the articles have been transferred. Senate leader Mitch McConnell announced that the Senate will exhibit the articles tomorrow at noon, to read the articles on the Senate floor. At 2 pm, chief justice John Roberts will arrive in the Senate and be sworn in. But the trial will begin in earnest on Tuesday, McConnell, announced. In his message, McConnell asked his fellow senators to rise above partisanship. \u201cThis is a difficult time for our country\u2014but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate. I\u2019m confident this body can rise above short-termism and factional fever, and serve the long-term best interests of our nation,\u201d he said. Why does Pelosi have so many pens? The House speaker signed the resolution using not just one pen, but trays full of them. They\u2019re commemorative pens, emblazoned with her signature. After painstakingly signing the document using each of the pens, Pelosi handed them to her impeachment managers and key committee members as souvenirs. Though critics are questioning Pelosi\u2019s choice to use souvenir pens, they\u2019re not entirely unexpected. Souvenir pens were used during Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial as well. Back then, Senators who signed an oath book kept their pens even though they were printed with a misspelling: \u201cUntied States Senator\u201d. \u201cToday, we will make history,\u201d Pelosi said, speaking at the engrossment ceremony on Capitol Hill. \u201cWhen the managers walk down the hall, we will cross a threshold in history. Delivering articles of impeachment against the president of the United States for abuse of power and obstruction of the House.\u201d And very soon, \u201cas soon as tomorrow\u201d, the Senators will take an oath to deliver impartial justice in the trial of Donald Trump, the Speaker said. Behold... the articles: The Capitol is packed with reporters awaiting the procession of the House clerk to the Senate. The communications director for Mitch McConnell, senate majority leader, said on Twitter that Republicans will instruct House Democrats to present the articles of impeachment tomorrow when they deliver them to the Senate this evening. This timeline explains how we got to this stage of impeachment: The press is gathering ahead of the Democrats planned delivery of the articles of impeachment to the Senate. However, it sounds like the Republicans don\u2019t actually plan on accepting them tonight. Senate leaders have said they will tell the House members to return tomorrow to present the articles if they deliver them at 5pm ET as planned, according to CNN. Democrats have said they intend to stick with the 5pm plan. We will see how this all shakes out in the next hour. A Michigan state senator, who has suggested he could run for governor, has apologized after telling a reporter that a group of boys could have \u201ca lot of fun\u201d with her. State senator Peter Lucido, a Republican, told the reporter, Allison Donahue, he could speak to her for a story after he was done honoring a group of students from an all-boys school who were standing nearby. \u201cWhat was meant to be an opportunity for Lucido to respond to the report, turned into him making comments that objectified and humiliated me in front of a group of young boys,\u201d Donahue said in a first-person account of the experience: \u201cYou should hang around! You could have a lot of fun with these boys, or they could have a lot of fun with you.\u201d The teenagers burst into an Old Boys\u2019 Network-type of laughter, and I walked away knowing that I had been the punchline of their \u201clocker room\u201d talk. Except it wasn\u2019t the locker room; it was the Senate chamber. And this isn\u2019t high school. It\u2019s my career. After Lucido initially told the Detroit Free Press that he did not feel he owed the reporter an apology and saying he felt the quotes were taken out of context and had been blown out of proportion, he apologized. It was not immediately clear if he apologized directly to Donahue, the AP reported. \u201cI apologize for the misunderstanding yesterday and for offending Allison Donahue,\u201d Lucido said. Photos Guardian world affairs editor, Julian Borger, wrote about unrest among former diplomats following revelations that associates of Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer may have carried out surveillance on the US ambassador to Ukraine. John Herbst, who was ambassador to Kyiv before Yovanovitch, cautioned that it was not clear whether the implied surveillance actually happened or was an idle boast. \u201cIf it\u2019s real, it\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Herbst said. \u201cMasha Yovanovitch is a real pro. She was used to being surveilled by the FSB [Russian intelligence], but if she\u2019s being surveilled by a private American, that is truly dark side activity.\u201d As of midday on Wednesday, the state department had yet to issue a statement on the new revelations, and canceled two briefings to Congress, one of them on diplomatic security. More anecdotes from the highly-anticipated, A Very Stable Genius, written by the Washington Post journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, have emerged today. One section of the book claims the president doesn\u2019t know about Pearl Harbor: \u201cHey, John, what\u2019s this all about? What\u2019s this a tour of?\u201d Trump asks his then-Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, as the men prepare to take a private tour of the USS Arizona Memorial, which commemorates the December 1941 Japanese surprise attack in the Pacific that pulled the United States into World War II. \u201cTrump had heard the phrase \u2018Pearl Harbor\u2019 and appeared to understand that he was visiting the scene of a historic battle, but he did not seem to know much else,\u201d write the authors, later quoting a former senior White House adviser who concludes: \u201cHe was at times dangerously uninformed.\u201d More from A Very Stable Genius here: It\u2019s been (another) historic day on Capitol Hill - and the day is yet young. Stay tuned for an afternoon and evening of continuing drama in US politics. Main events so far: The House has just voted to send the two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump to the Senate to begin the president\u2019s trial on charges of abuse of office and obstruction of Congress. The US and China signed the first phase of a new trade deal. Judge temporarily blocks Trump\u2019s refugee policy. Nancy Pelosi announces the team of House managers to prosecute the case against Donald Trump during the impeachment trial in the Senate. They will physically process through the Capitol with the articles to present to the Senate after 5pm. More on the White House call with reporters from the Guardian\u2019s Washington bureau chief, David Smith: The White House declined to rule out going to court in an attempt to block John Bolton, the former national security adviser, and other witnesses testifying at Donald Trump\u2019s Senate impeachment trial. In a conference call with reporters, a senior administration official said: We\u2019re not going to get out ahead of the president; it would only be president who exerts executive privilege. I think it\u2019s fair to say, though, that it would be extraordinary to have the national security adviser testifying about his communications directly with the president about foreign policy and national security matters. So that\u2019s a bridge that we would cross if we have to, when we get to it, but that would be an extraordinary situation. Asked if the White House would consider bringing a formal lawsuit in federal court to exert executive privilege, rather than allowing the Senate to have the final say, the official replied: \u201cThat\u2019s getting way out ahead of things. We don\u2019t think that there\u2019s gonna be any need for witnesses in this trial.\u201d The official therefore predicted it is \u201cextraordinarily unlikely\u201d that the trial will be go beyond two weeks. \u201cWe think that this case is overwhelming for the president.\u201d But the official conceded that if the Senate does agree to call witnesses, Trump could yet push for the whistleblower and Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter to appear. \u201cThe president hasn\u2019t had any rights in this process so far,\u201d the official said. \u201cSo if we go on to a longer process with witnesses, the president will have a right to have witnesses as well.\u201d During the impeachment vote, senior Trump administration officials held a briefing call with reporters about impeachment. The officials said they expect the trial to move quickly, possibly concluding before the State of the Union address scheduled for 4 February. They did not give information about who would represent the White House in the trial. The House has voted to formally appoint a team of seven impeachment managers, which will set in motion the official transfer of articles of impeachment from the House to the Senate. The House is now voting on the resolution to back the House impeachment managers named this morning. If approved, the resolution would set in motion the Senate impeachment trial. If you are wondering what happens after that, Guardian national affairs reporter, Tom McCarthy, wrote a great guide: Representatives are on the House floor debating the impeachment package, which includes the list of managers announced earlier today and a decision to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate. The debate was strained and partisan, reflecting the weeks of acrimonious hearings that preceded a vote on the articles of impeachment in December. Congressman Jerry Nadler, the chair of the Judiciary committee who will serve as a manager, said Trump \u201cbetrayed our country when he used the powers of his office\u201d and urged the Senate to take seriously the new evidence referred by the House. The managers were prepared to exercise their \u201cbroad authority\u201d to submit new additional evidence to the Senate as part of the trial, he vowed. \u201cOur founders feared this day,\u201d declared House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California. He became more and more emotional throughout his comments, praising the president and writing-off the impeachment inquiry as being about personality. There is a live stream at the top of the live blog. It should be a relatively short debate before the vote, which is expected in about 20 minutes. More from the East Room of the White House, where the signing of a trade deal with China has involved Donald Trump spending about 20 minutes not talking much about trade or China. Instead, he shared stories about the people in the room ... and some who weren\u2019t. Donald Trump is speaking at the White House before signing a trade deal with China. Impeachment is on his mind. Trump tells senators in the room they can leave for the impeachment vote, which is about to take place. Trump then heaps praise on guests in the room, including billionaire Sheldon Adelson, conservative commentator Lou Dobbs and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Details on the trade deal: A federal judge has temporarily blocked Donald Trump\u2019s policy which would allow local governments to determine whether or not they would admit refugees. The policy was announced the same day in September that the president unveiled a record low cap on refugees of 18,000 people. The local government policy had backfired on the president, with 42 out of 50 state governors, including conservative ones, saying they would continue to admit refugees. Seven state governors hadn\u2019t announced their plans and the remaining governor, Greg Abbott of Texas, was the only one to say outright that the state would not accept refugees. In response to a lawsuit filed against the policy change, judge Peter J Messitte of Maryland wrote in an order it was likely \u201cunlawful.\u201d \u201cGiving states and local governments the power to consent to the resettlement of refugees \u2014 which is to say veto power to determine whether refugees will be received in their midst \u2014 flies in the face of clear Congressional intent,\u201d Messitte wrote. Donald Trump \u201cabused\u201d, \u201charassed\u201d and \u201cpestered\u201d his homeland security secretary over immigration policy, demanding that the US border be closed, according to A Very Stable Genius, written by the Washington Post journalists Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig. The book, obtained by the Guardian, details the president\u2019s obsessive tunnel vision on illegal immigration and how it impacted one of the leaders of the department charged with restricting immigration. \u201cIn some instances, the volatile president was verbally and emotionally abusive toward Nielsen,\u201d the authors write. \u201c\u2018Kirstjen, you\u2019re just not tough enough,\u2019 Trump would tell her. Trump complained Nielsen did not \u201clook the part\u201d of homeland security secretary. \u201cHe made fun of her and believed that at about five feet four inches she was not physically intimidating. \u2018She\u2019s so short,\u2019 Trump would tell others about Nielsen. She and Kelly would try to make light of it. Kelly would rib her and say, \u2018But you\u2019ve got those little fists of fury!\u2019\u201d The president has weighed-in on Pelosi\u2019s press conference: And the White House: The only thing Speaker Pelosi has achieved with this sham, illegitimate impeachment process, is to prove she is focused on politics instead of the American people. The Speaker lied when she claimed this was urgent and vital to national security because when the articles passed, she held them for an entire month in an egregious effort to garner political support. She failed and the naming of these managers does not change a single thing. President Trump has done nothing wrong. He looks forward to having the due process rights in the Senate that Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats denied to him, and expects to be fully exonerated. In the meantime, after President Trump signs the historic China Trade Deal greatly benefiting the people of this country, he will continue working and winning for all Americans, while the Democrats will continue only working against the President. Reporting from Pelosi\u2019s press conference in DC, Guardian senior political reporter, Lauren Gambino, has details on the announcement: After a cloak-and-dagger selection process \u2013 during which members lobbied for a position on the team \u2013 the newly-selected managers appeared at a press conference ahead of a vote to formally approve their appointment. The team includes: House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff; House Judiciary chair Jerry Nadler; Zoe Lofgren, who has participated in three impeachment proceedings; Democratic caucus chair, Hakeem Jeffries; Val Demmings, who was Orlando\u2019s first female chief of police; Jason Crow, a veteran Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan; and Sylvia Garcia, one of the first two Latinas elected from Texas in 2018. The team includes woman, two African Americans and one Latina - a stark contrast from the teams appointed to make the case for removing Andrew Johnson from office in 1868 and Bill Clinton from office in 1999. \u201cThe House has demonstrated its courage and patriotism,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cOur managers reflect those values, and will now honor their responsibility to defend democracy for the people with great seriousness, solemnity and moral strength.\u201d The House will start debate on a resolution to approve the impeachment managers and take a vote shortly after that. Then the articles are formally transmitted to the Senate in a process that\u2019s rich in pomp and circumstances. The managers will escort the articles in a wooden box across the Capitol and physically deliver them to the Senate. While announcing the impeachment managers, Pelosi defends the month gap between the House voting for impeachment and today\u2019s transmission of the articles of impeachment to the Senate. \u201cTime has been our friend in all of this,\u201d Pelosi says. Schiff is the lead manager, Pelosi says, while going down the list to highlight the accomplishments of each manager. This will be the third impeachment hearing for Lofgren, who was a Congressional aide during Nixon\u2019s impeachment, notes Pelosi. \u201cThe emphasis is on litigators, the emphasis is on comfort level in the courtroom,\u201d Pelosi says. Nancy Pelosi is addressing the press with seven Democrats, her impeachment managers, standing by her side. The team is: Adam Schiff, of California Zoe Lofgren, of California Jerry Nadler, of New York Hakeem Jeffries, of New York Slyvia Garcia, of Texas Val Demings, of Florida Jason Crow, of Colorado The US and China will sign the first phase of a trade deal today. While Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin declared this morning its \u201can enormous win,\u201d there has been a more temperate response from analysts. Live updates and analysis on the agreement are available on our business live blog: Politico is reporting that after a monthslong delay, the Trump administration will release $8bn in disaster aid to Puerto Rico for the damage it suffered after two hurricanes in 2017. Congress allocated $20bn to aid the recovery there, but the island has received just $1.5bn of that money. The Trump administration has been under increased pressure to release the money after a string of earthquakes struck the island in the past several weeks. Nancy Pelosi on Thursday called on the administration to \u201ccease and desist that illegal activity.\u201d In September 2018, Trump was attacked for saying his government\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria was an \u201cunsung success.\u201d The night before the House was set to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, House Democrats released a fresh trove of documents which shed new light on charges that Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Democrats as he withheld military aid to the country. Pages of text messages, notes and other records added pressure on Republicans to include witness testimony and other evidence in the Senate impeachment trial. It also renewed Democrats calls for the White House to share documents it has withheld from Congress. The documents from Lev Parnas, a close associate of Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, show the two men\u2019s close relationship as Giuliani worked to get the Ukrainian government to announce investigation\u2019s targeting Trump\u2019s political rivals. The rough itinerary for the impeachment proceedings today: 10am ET: House speaker Nancy Pelosi announces the impeachment managers, the individuals tasked with making a case against the president to the Senate, which functions as a jury in the trial. 12.30 pm to 1.30 pm ET: following a 10 minute debate, the House will vote on the impeachment managers. 5pm ET: a ceremony filled with pomp and circumstance held by Pelosi and the managers will see the articles of impeachment hand-delivered to the Senate. Hello and good morning Today, the House will vote on sharing the two articles of impeachment with the Senate, which would allow the trial of Donald Trump to begin this week. At 10am, Nancy Pelosi will announce the managers of the trial and a couple hours later, there will be a short debate before a vote in the House. At 5pm, a ceremony to formally send the articles of impeachment to the Senate will take place. The early phase of the trial would involve swearing-in senators as jurors and other procedures before more substantive action begins early next week. It also means half the Democratic field for president will be locked into the trial, strictly limiting their campaigning. Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar will be tied to the case because they are senators. The three were in Des Moines, Iowa last night for the final Democratic debate before the Iowa caucuses. More on that here:",

The motion argues that the change of court would avoid the \u201ccarnival-like atmosphere\u201d that it complains has tainted the view of potential jurors since the trial began on 6 January.</p> <p>Arthur Aidala, one of Weinstein\u2019s defense attorneys, wrote in the motion: \u201cReporters and camera crews fill the entrance to the courthouse and line the hallways leading into the courtroom, celebrity press conferences denouncing the defendant occur on the courthouse steps, and protests and demonstrations are audible inside the courtroom during proceedings.\u201d</p> <p>The legal move is a repeat of Weinstein\u2019s attempt last year to persuade the courts to order a change of venue on grounds that he could not get a fair trial in what he calls the \u201cworld\u2019s media capital\u201d. That effort <a href=\"https://apnews.com/e99fbb16fb9c473a80442ee4f0ed7f70\">failed in October</a> when a five-judge panel of the state supreme court dismissed the request without explanation.</p> <p>This latest motion is a long shot given the previous failure. The trial judge, James Burke, has expressed his displeasure on several occasions that Weinstein\u2019s legal team has repeatedly introduced motions that have already been dismissed.</p> <p>But the tactic is an indication of the aggressive approach that the defense team is taking, led by a Chicago-based attorney, Donna Rottuno. The constant stream of motions demanding changes in trial proceedings might also be designed as a way of planting seeds that could form the basis of later appeals were Weinstein convicted on any of the charges.</p> <p>Weinstein, 67, faces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/harvey-weinstein-trial-new-york-metoo-movement\">five counts</a>. The two most serious counts of predatory sexual assault carry the most severe punishment of up to life in prison, and he also faces two counts of rape and one of a criminal sex act relating to two accusers.</p> <p>A total of six women are likely to testify to having been the victims of alleged sexual crimes by the defendant once the trial proper begins next week. Their stories form a tiny portion of the total of 105 women who have come forward to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/10/more-than-100-women-protest-trump-harvey-weinstein-anti-rape-anthem-new-york\">accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct</a> to a varying degree of seriousness.</p> <p>So far the proceedings have been devoted to selecting the 12-person jury. A pool containing hundreds of potential jurors has been whittled down to about 175 by eliminating those who have work conflicts or who have said they do not feel able to be impartial in the Weinstein case.</p> <p>The latest Weinstein motion cites the large number of potential jurors who have suggested that their minds are already made up, calling it \u201calarming\u201d. The filing says: \u201cWe have no doubt that 12 living breathing human beings will be seated in the jury box at the commencement of the trial, but that will not constitute the fair and impartial jury to which Mr Weinstein is constitutionally entitled.\u201d</p> <p>Prosecutors at the New York trial have so far been disdainful of Weinstein\u2019s legal tactics, which have included a demand that jury selection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/14/harvey-weinstein-trial-jury-selection\">be held in private</a>. The lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, has called comments made by the defendant\u2019s lawyers to the media outside the courtroom \u201cabominable\u201d.</p> <p>The second stage of jury selection, known as voir dire, begins on Thursday. In it individual potential jurors will be grilled by both defense and prosecution legal teams in an attempt to flush out any hidden biases.</p> <p>Each side will be able to block three people from the final jury without justification through \u201cperemptory challenges\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Harvey Weinstein, the fallen movie mogul facing possible life imprisonment for an alleged history of sexual crimes, is making a renewed attempt to have his trial moved out of New York City on the grounds that the opening phase of the proceedings have been sullied by a \u201cdeluge\u201d of negative press reporting. Weinstein\u2019s legal team produced an 87-page motion on Wednesday that called on the judge at the New York state supreme court in Manhattan to shift the location to upstate New York or Long Island. The motion argues that the change of court would avoid the \u201ccarnival-like atmosphere\u201d that it complains has tainted the view of potential jurors since the trial began on 6 January. Arthur Aidala, one of Weinstein\u2019s defense attorneys, wrote in the motion: \u201cReporters and camera crews fill the entrance to the courthouse and line the hallways leading into the courtroom, celebrity press conferences denouncing the defendant occur on the courthouse steps, and protests and demonstrations are audible inside the courtroom during proceedings.\u201d The legal move is a repeat of Weinstein\u2019s attempt last year to persuade the courts to order a change of venue on grounds that he could not get a fair trial in what he calls the \u201cworld\u2019s media capital\u201d. That effort failed in October when a five-judge panel of the state supreme court dismissed the request without explanation. This latest motion is a long shot given the previous failure. The trial judge, James Burke, has expressed his displeasure on several occasions that Weinstein\u2019s legal team has repeatedly introduced motions that have already been dismissed. But the tactic is an indication of the aggressive approach that the defense team is taking, led by a Chicago-based attorney, Donna Rottuno. The constant stream of motions demanding changes in trial proceedings might also be designed as a way of planting seeds that could form the basis of later appeals were Weinstein convicted on any of the charges. Weinstein, 67, faces five counts. The two most serious counts of predatory sexual assault carry the most severe punishment of up to life in prison, and he also faces two counts of rape and one of a criminal sex act relating to two accusers. A total of six women are likely to testify to having been the victims of alleged sexual crimes by the defendant once the trial proper begins next week. Their stories form a tiny portion of the total of 105 women who have come forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct to a varying degree of seriousness. So far the proceedings have been devoted to selecting the 12-person jury. A pool containing hundreds of potential jurors has been whittled down to about 175 by eliminating those who have work conflicts or who have said they do not feel able to be impartial in the Weinstein case. The latest Weinstein motion cites the large number of potential jurors who have suggested that their minds are already made up, calling it \u201calarming\u201d. The filing says: \u201cWe have no doubt that 12 living breathing human beings will be seated in the jury box at the commencement of the trial, but that will not constitute the fair and impartial jury to which Mr Weinstein is constitutionally entitled.\u201d Prosecutors at the New York trial have so far been disdainful of Weinstein\u2019s legal tactics, which have included a demand that jury selection be held in private. The lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, has called comments made by the defendant\u2019s lawyers to the media outside the courtroom \u201cabominable\u201d. The second stage of jury selection, known as voir dire, begins on Thursday. In it individual potential jurors will be grilled by both defense and prosecution legal teams in an attempt to flush out any hidden biases. Each side will be able to block three people from the final jury without justification through \u201cperemptory challenges\u201d.",

Teenagers who want to grow in confidence and resilience are being urged to try \u201ccharacter building\u201d activities such as trying veganism, performing random acts of kindness, taking a digital detox, attending a music festival and going dancing. The DofE scheme, best known among its millions of graduates for its intrepid, all-weather expeditions into the wilds of the British countryside, has drawn up the checklist of 25 experiences. Other suggested activities on the list include: public speaking, learning a foreign language, doing work experience, spending time getting to know an older person, volunteering for a charity, campaigning for something you believe in, spending time in nature, engaging in politics, learning about climate change and becoming a mentor to someone younger. While most teenagers will be able to tick off at least some of the activities on the list, leaders of the DofE scheme are calling on the government to do more to support character building in schools to help develop resilience in all young people. The Experience List: 25 of the best character hacks for teens grew out of a DofE poll of 1,000 teenagers aged 14 to 18 across the UK that found more than half (51%) had never had a part-time job and more than two in five (44%) believed they were not given enough opportunities to build confidence and resilience. The poll also revealed that one in five (20%) of those surveyed had never been for a walk or hike in the countryside and more than half (52%) had never volunteered for their community.

Other political leaders including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/dec/22/adoptionandfostering.health\">Tony Blair</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/feb/22/michael-gove-relaunches-adoption-rules\">Michael Gove</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/02/david-cameron-urges-faster-adoptions-doubling-number-of-early-placements\">David Cameron</a> have all previously sought to increase adoption rates and improve services.</p> <p>As part of its latest adoption push, the DfE has published new advice for councils, clarifying that age, income, sexual orientation and marital status should not be used as reasons to reject prospective adopters.</p> <p>The letter to children\u2019s services directors from Michelle Donelan, the minister for children and families, also states that agencies should not prioritise trying to find the \u201cperfect\u201d ethnic match. The latest data shows that of the 2,700 children waiting for adoption, almost 40% have waited over 18 months. Of these, 24% were from BAME backgrounds.</p> <p>\u201cChildren\u2019s needs should be at the forefront of decisions,\u201d she writes. \u201cI urge you not to shy away from putting children forward for adoption where you think it would be in their best interests.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Elvin, the chief executive of the Adolescent and Children\u2019s Trust, the UK\u2019s largest fostering and adoption charity, said: \u201cI had hoped that politicians had moved beyond this insulting language and unthinking devotion to adoption.</p> <p>\u201cChildren in foster care are not \u2018waiting for a permanent, loving home\u2019: they are living in one. Long-term stability is vital and it is achieved in different ways for different children.</p> <p>\u201cFor some it is returning to birth parents, for some it is going to live with a relative who has selflessly come forward, for some it is long-term foster care, for some it is residential care and for some it is adoption. There is no hierarchy to these options, it depends on the individual child\u2019s circumstance.\u201d</p> <p>Cathy Ashley, the chief executive of Family Rights Group, added: \u201cAdoption is the right solution for some children. However, far more children who cannot live with their parents flourish in the care of wider family, yet the latter receives negligible recognition, support or finance.\u201d</p> <p>Sue Armstrong-Brown, the chief executive of Adoption UK, welcomed the government\u2019s renewed commitment to adoption. \u201cThis means investing to value adopters and the love and stability they provide for the most complex and vulnerable children in society.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has written to directors of children\u2019s services across England urging them to prioritise adoption for children in the care system and to ensure that prospective adopters are not turned away when they are actually eligible. Ministers say they want a renewed focus on adoption from all local authorities and have called on councils to review their practices following a drop in the number of assessments recommending adoption as the best option for a vulnerable child. Figures published by the Department for Education (DfE) last month revealed the number of adoptions in England has fallen by a third in the past four years, dropping to 3,570 in the year up to the end of March 2018 from a peak of 5,360 in 2015. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said if councils believed adoption was in the best interests of a child he would back them 100%. \u201cAdoption can transform the lives of children waiting in care for a permanent, loving home,\u201d he said. The government intervention was welcomed by Adoption UK, the national charity for adopters, but others in the sector expressed dismay at what one described as the government\u2019s \u201cunthinking devotion to adoption\u201d while neglecting other forms of care including kinship care, where a child is cared for by relatives. Critics say only a small minority of children in the care system are suitable for adoption, yet adoption appears once again to be at the top of a hierarchy of care. Other political leaders including Tony Blair, Michael Gove and David Cameron have all previously sought to increase adoption rates and improve services. As part of its latest adoption push, the DfE has published new advice for councils, clarifying that age, income, sexual orientation and marital status should not be used as reasons to reject prospective adopters. The letter to children\u2019s services directors from Michelle Donelan, the minister for children and families, also states that agencies should not prioritise trying to find the \u201cperfect\u201d ethnic match. The latest data shows that of the 2,700 children waiting for adoption, almost 40% have waited over 18 months. Of these, 24% were from BAME backgrounds. \u201cChildren\u2019s needs should be at the forefront of decisions,\u201d she writes. \u201cI urge you not to shy away from putting children forward for adoption where you think it would be in their best interests.\u201d Andy Elvin, the chief executive of the Adolescent and Children\u2019s Trust, the UK\u2019s largest fostering and adoption charity, said: \u201cI had hoped that politicians had moved beyond this insulting language and unthinking devotion to adoption. \u201cChildren in foster care are not \u2018waiting for a permanent, loving home\u2019: they are living in one. Long-term stability is vital and it is achieved in different ways for different children. \u201cFor some it is returning to birth parents, for some it is going to live with a relative who has selflessly come forward, for some it is long-term foster care, for some it is residential care and for some it is adoption. There is no hierarchy to these options, it depends on the individual child\u2019s circumstance.\u201d Cathy Ashley, the chief executive of Family Rights Group, added: \u201cAdoption is the right solution for some children. However, far more children who cannot live with their parents flourish in the care of wider family, yet the latter receives negligible recognition, support or finance.\u201d Sue Armstrong-Brown, the chief executive of Adoption UK, welcomed the government\u2019s renewed commitment to adoption. \u201cThis means investing to value adopters and the love and stability they provide for the most complex and vulnerable children in society.\u201d",
