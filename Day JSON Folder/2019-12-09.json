Ah memories! Trevor Brooking\u2019s header, Willie Young on Paul Allen, a nice big riff in <em>Fever Pitch</em>, all that. Nearly 40 years on, that remains West Ham\u2019s last trophy. Since then, they\u2019ve mainly spent their time packing their teams with top talent and finding themselves inexplicably involved in relegation battles.</p> <p><strong>The Hammers are in bother again. </strong>They\u2019ve won just one of their last nine league matches, an eyebrow-raising victory at Chelsea a couple of Saturdays ago. It\u2019s a dismal run that\u2019s seen them plummet down the table. They\u2019ve gone 3-0 down in their last two home fixtures. They\u2019re just a single point better off than Southampton in the relegation spots, and look what a mess they\u2019ve been.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019d definitely file West Ham under Too Good To Go Down ... but then the club has been here before, too many times, so nobody will be taking anything for granted.</strong> They could desperately do with three points that\u2019d whizz them up to 13th place at least, a result that would change the picture and the mood totally. It might also be what\u2019s required to save Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s job, which is hanging from a shoogly peg.</p> <p><strong>Oh look! </strong>Here come Arsenal. The Gunners are in turmoil, having sacked off Unai Emery, then failed to get a honeymoon bounce under caretaker Freddie Ljungberg. They\u2019re on a nine-game winless streak in all competitions, and can\u2019t defend for toffee right now, having shipped two goals in their last five matches, and failed to keep a clean sheet in their last 11. It\u2019s their worst run since 1977, and their worst start to a season since 1994-95. They\u2019re only four clear of the dropzone themselves. A win here would buy the club some precious time and space in which to do some calm thinking.</p> <p><strong>Two teams not currently in best of nick, then. </strong>Which could either make for some shoddy viewing, or glorious entertainment! We\u2019re plumping for the latter. Can the Hammers replicate their Declan Rice-inpsired 1-0 win of last season? Or could the Gunners revisit their 5-1 victory here in 2016? Anything could happen, and it should be fun finding out. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>8pm BST.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T18:59:41.926Z\">at 6.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Nick Ames on Arsenal\u2019s turnaround and what it all means ... A Ljungberg warning! That\u2019s your lot, then, folks. Thanks for reading this MBM! Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s version. \u201cIt was difficult to understand. We dominated the game for 60 minutes, and then we lost the game. Maybe we should have scored the second goal, it was so important. You must understand the boos, because in the last five games here we did not win. Of course we try to do it. I think we were the better team than Arsenal for 60 minutes, but fans cannot be happy. You cannot concede three goals in every game. Maybe we are not in our best moment, but we will continue fighting. I can fix it.\u201d He\u2019s then pressed by Sky on whether he\u2019ll be given the chance to do so. \u201cIt does not depend on me,\u201d is his sharp response, at which point he walks off. An extremely satisfied Freddie Ljungberg talks to Sky. \u201cIt means so much for the players, they have been living under enormous pressure for the last couple of weeks. We\u2019ve seen that in their performances. But we believe in how we want to play football, and I could see around the hour mark that West Ham were starting to tire. We played it a bit crisper, a bit faster, and all of a sudden we sliced them open. The boys were amazing. They stepped up, quicker passing. You need to work hard, in attack and defence, and they did that today. It\u2019s down to the players, I\u2019m just there to guide them a little bit. We still have a lot to work on. We enjoy tonight and start working again tomorrow.\u201d Our man Jacob Steinberg was at the London Stadium to witness that turnaround. Here\u2019s his report. Arsenal celebrate a deserved win - eventually deserved - with wide smiles, backslaps and hugs. Freddie Ljungberg in the middle of it all. And no wonder, they\u2019re back in the top half of the table, in ninth with 22 points, just two behind fifth-placed Manchester United. West Ham however remain in trouble, stuck in 16th place after taking 16 points from 16 games. They\u2019re just one point above the dropzone, having lost seven of their last nine. Their next game is at Southampton on Saturday evening; Saints will leapfrog them if they win. Arsenal were awful for the first 59 minutes, then sensational for the following nine. Their three-goal second-half blast has lifted the mood around the club, while heaping further pressure on Manuel Pellegrini, who has the boos of the few Hammers fans left in the stadium ringing in his ears. 90 min +5: \u201cWe are staying up!\u201d chant some self-deprecating Arsenal supporters. Or are they merely baiting the remaining West Ham fans? It could be either or both, couldn\u2019t it. 90 min +4: Aubameyang dribbles down the inside left, checks back, makes space to shoot near the penalty spot, and watches his effort ping off the heel of Fredericks and over the bar. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. \u201cFreddie deserves some big props for this turnaround,\u201d writes Adrian Caddy. \u201cWe\u2019d been crying out for Emery to pick a front three with Aubameyang in his best position flanked by Pepe and Martinelli. All three have delivered.\u201d 90 min +2: Arsenal ping it around, and their fans entertain themselves with some repetitive whoops of joy. 90 min: Holland curls one into the Arsenal box from the right. It\u2019s an inviting cross, and Chambers does very well to get in ahead of Haller. He takes a whack for his troubles. As he rolls around, it\u2019s announced there will be seven added minutes. 88 min: More seats flipping up in the stands. It\u2019s the remaining Arsenal fans making all the noise. Pepe is replaced by Reiss Nelson, and receives both a warm ovation from his fans and a hug and a huge smile from Freddie Ljungberg. 86 min: Matteo Guendouzi comes on in his place. \u201cAfter the dismal performance in the first half I must confess that I was preparing a very snarky note to send out to slag the Gunners,\u201d admits Mary Waltz. \u201cI still have low expectations for Arsenal\u2019s remainder of this season but for today they deserve an apology and a tip of the hat from me.\u201d 85 min: Xhaka falls to the turf again, still dizzy, and he\u2019s going to have to go off. He walks off with a wry smile. 83 min: Noble must have been taking notes from Xhaka earlier, because he plays a dismal hospital ball infield from the right, allowing Pepe to tear upfield with great intent. The West Ham captain is fortunate that Pepe\u2019s control lets him down as he enters the area, allowing Balbuena to recover. 82 min: Masuaku makes ground down the left and wedges a cute cross into the mixer, but Sokratis is on hand to clear, winning the battle with Antonio and Haller. 80 min: Xhaka is good to continue. Quite a few seats are now flipped up, plenty of West Ham fans having seen enough. 79 min: Xhaka takes a Masuaku crossfield pass flush in the grid. He\u2019s flat on his back. The trainer comes on to run the rule over him. While we wait, Nathan Holland comes on for Robert Snodgrass. 77 min: Pepe nutmegs Masuaku and enters the box on the right. Pepe goes over Masuaku\u2019s leg, claiming a penalty. He was looking for it, and doesn\u2019t get it. 75 min: Speaking of Brazilians, Martinelli looks the real deal. He powers his way down the inside-right channel, winning a ball he really had no right to earn, and spins to set up Torreira, just inside the box. Torreira gives the ball a good old whack, and his effort is well blocked by Balbuena. 73 min: West Ham can\u2019t get the ball. Arsenal were barely capable of stringing two passes together for the first hour. Now they\u2019re stroking it around with the insouciant arrogance of Brazil during the last ten minutes of the 1970 World Cup final. 71 min: That nine-minute, three-goal Arsenal salvo has stunned West Ham. It could be the end of Manuel Pellegrini. Sebastian Heller comes on for Filipe Anderson. Will that substitution turn out to be one of the manager\u2019s last decisions as West Ham boss? The scoring\u2019s not over. Aubameyang backheels a pass down the right, releasing Pepe into a little bit of grass. Pepe checks and chips a delicate cross back towards the striker, who had kept moving. Aubameyang bicycle kicks into the bottom right. Martin got a hand on the shot, but couldn\u2019t keep it out. 68 min: Filipe Anderson dribbles down the left and loops a cross towards Fornals, who, falling backwards, can\u2019t keep his header, intended for the top right, down. A real sense that the scoring isn\u2019t over. Arsenal were a complete shambles less than ten minutes ago. Now they\u2019re in the lead, and scoring magical goals! Aubameyang slips a pass wide right for Pepe, who shuffles into the box, makes a little bit of space away from Masuaku, and curls an unstoppable shot across Martin and into the top left! The keeper had absolutely no chance with that. 65 min: Balbuena tears down the right, reaches the end of the road and stands one up into the box. Antonio goes over, unable to connect with his head. The West Ham fans want a penalty, but Antonio makes no claim whatsoever. 63 min: That\u2019s really rattled West Ham, who are struggling to clear their lines all of a sudden. Ozil plays a cute right-to-left chip for Martinelli, who can\u2019t quite sort his feet out just inside the area. Had he managed it, he\u2019d have been one on one with Martin. 62 min: That was such a lovely, incisive move, and what a finish by Martinelli! That came out of nowhere, and suddenly the Gunners are pinging the ball around in a very pretty fashion. What a strange game football can be. Pulitzer, please! So having said Arsenal were doing nothing, they suddenly spring into life! Torreira slips a pass down the left for Kolasinac to stride onto. Kolasinac enters the box and pulls back for Martinelli, the young man slamming a glorious first-time shot into the bottom right! 58 min: Arsenal are playing with an almost total lack of confidence. Aubameyang tears down the right and, upon reaching the byline, larrups a dismal cross miles into the sky and out of play on the other wing. The home fans enjoyed that very much. 57 min: Snodgrass causes trouble down the right and cuts back for Rice, who shapes a lovely hard sidefoot towards the bottom right from 20 yards. Leno does extremely well to keep hold of the ball. Rice really struck that, it was a proper whistler. 55 min: Xhaka plays a useless blind pass in from the right to nobody. That allows Snodgrass to zip down the inside-right channel and take a shot that clips off Kolasinac and loops over Leno, nearly dropping into the bottom left. Instead it\u2019s a corner, and Xhaka repairs the damage, sort of, by jumping into a challenge for a high ball backwards, and somehow winning a goal kick. Xhaka really is very entertaining to watch, although I appreciate his unique appeal will be selective. 53 min: Martinelli earns a corner with a determined run down the inside-right channel. Meeting the set piece, Torreira blooters over from an overly ambitious range. Here\u2019s Dean Kinsella: \u201cI\u2019ve been watching top flight English football since Bertie Mee was the Arsenal manager and I\u2019m pretty sure that was the worst half of a game I\u2019ve seen them play in all those 50 or so years. And West Ham were only marginally better by dint of at least trying to play.\u201d 52 min: A minute of the warmest applause for West Ham fan Peter Taylor, who recently passed away. 51 min: Nope, he can\u2019t go on. He limps off, to be replaced by Arthur Masuaku. Ozil then takes the free kick, just to the right of the box. It\u2019s easily slapped clear by Ogbonna. A very poor delivery. 49 min: Pepe drops a shoulder to trick Cresswell, who looks like he\u2019s tweaked something and doesn\u2019t fancy a footrace down the right. So the full-back clatters the winger. Booked. But before any free kick can be taken, the West Ham physio comes on to check if Cresswell can continue. 47 min: Snodgrass gets West Ham on the front foot early doors. He takes the set piece himself. Rice can\u2019t get a header on target. The ball breaks to Noble, who lifts a wild shot miles over the bar. Aubameyang makes his way back upfield holding his head, looking a little woozy. Xhaka checks he\u2019s good to continue. The striker says he\u2019s fine, though he doesn\u2019t look particularly happy. Right, back to the big game ... and West Ham get the ball rolling for the second half. [Taps mike, adopts thick Lancastrian burr] \u201cHey, does anybody remember Kettering Tyres?\u201d Anyway, you requested adjudication on the Crown Paints / Candy thing. Here\u2019s your answer. I mean, obviously. They can\u2019t get it, but trot off down the tunnel looking fairly content. They\u2019re 45 minutes away from a confidence-restoring win. Arsenal by contrast look miserable; they\u2019ve been a lightweight non-event. \u201cYou know how we always used to get irritated by the \u2018hey guys, remember Spangles?\u2019 crowd who would forever be banging on about irrelevant minutiae from the 70s?\u201d asks Tom Atkins, in the rhetorical style. \u201cYou always become the thing you hate the most. That said, Villa is Mita Copiers, Man City always Brother, and Ipswich obviously Fisons. I also think we need an adjudication on Crown Paints vs Candy for Liverpool.\u201d 45 min +3: It\u2019s all West Ham, who are pressing for a second goal that would put the visitors in all sorts of bother. 45 min +1: There will be five additional minutes, Tierney\u2019s injury, VAR, all that. The first sees Aubameyang welt a shot miles over the bar from a very ambitious distance. Arsenal haven\u2019t worked Martin at all. 45 min: Snodgrass is blocked off by Kolasinac as he dribbles down the right. He wants a penalty, but he\u2019s not getting it. It all looked a bit theatrical as he fell backwards, his spine arcing in the dramatic style. 44 min: A bit of space for Pepe, who has been Arsenal\u2019s liveliest player, despite Cresswell\u2019s attention. He makes good down the right and crosses low. Martin, who hasn\u2019t had much to do, gathers confidently. 42 min: Torreira attempts a back-heel a couple of yards from his own box. He nearly lets Antonio in on goal, but gets away with it. That was ludicrous, and it\u2019s no wonder Arsenal are shipping goals like they\u2019re going out of fashion. 40 min: This is preposterous. VAR takes nearly two minutes to work out whether Ogbonna had headed the ball onto his outstretched fist, en route to the goal via Maitland-Niles\u2019 back. It was nowhere near, but it took them about 200 replays to decide. Anyway, it\u2019s all good. Whither spontaneous joy? Cresswell wins a corner down the left. He hoicks it long. Some pinball. Noble takes a whack. More pinball. Rice flicks the ball towards Fornals, to the right of the six-yard box. He dinks it back in. Ogbonna wants it the most, and his desire wins out. His header, towards the top left, twangs off Maitland-Niles\u2019 back and into the top right, past the wrong-footed Leno. 36 min: Pepe\u2019s down for a while. That was a rare old whack. Cresswell got the ball, but took his man on the follow-through. The landing looked ugly, with Pepe\u2019s leg trapped, his knee twisting. But there\u2019s good news, as Pepe slowly gathers himself and gets back on his feet. He\u2019ll be good to continue ... and he glances towards Cresswell with great intensity. This might not be over. 34 min: Antonio swerves his way down the left and has a batter from a tight angle. Leno does extremely well to save. Arsenal make their way up the other end through Pepe, who is unceremoniously stopped by an extremely robust challenge from Cresswell, sliding in from the left. 33 min: Pepe dribbles with purpose down the right but can\u2019t find anyone with his cutback. Aubameyang drops a shoulder out on the left, and stands one up for Ozil, who heads over harmlessly from six yards. He was leaning back to reach that, perhaps Pepe behind him would have been a better bet. I wonder if the flag might have gone up for offside had that flown in. VAR would certainly have taken a look. 31 min: Tierney\u2019s injury has disrupted whatever rhythm this game previously had. It\u2019s all a bit scrappy. \u201cPermit me to launch myself into Operation Showing Your Age.\u201d Jump in, Mike Morris, the water\u2019s lovely. \u201cEverton shall forever be sponsored by NEC while Liverpool have to make do with Candy, for some reason. Man United\u2019s eternal sponsor is Sharp, JVC for Arsenal, and Tottenham are sponsored by Holsten Pils. Now excuse me while I nostalgically yearn for football being four square passes, and then back to the goalie from the halfway line.\u201d 29 min: Tierney walks off, using that lovely yellow-and-black shirt as a sling. The poor lad\u2019s replaced by Saed Kolasinac, who wasn\u2019t even on the bench until Hector Bellerin pulled a hamstring in the warm-up. 28 min: Tierney is down, having tussled with Antonio in the middle of a melee as Leno gathered. Nobody\u2019s fault, just an accident as the pair locked arms. It appears the young full-back has popped his shoulder. That\u2019s a sore one, and he\u2019s not going to be able to continue. 26 min: Snodgrass loops it long. Ogbonna rises to head at the far post, but can only send the ball backwards. It drops to Fornals, who opens his body for a sidefoot volley. His attempt is weak and dribbles into the arms of Leno. 25 min: Snodgrass and Tierney battle down the West Ham right. Tierney clips his Scotland team-mate on the toe, and this is a free kick just to the right of the box. Snodgrass will take this himself. 24 min: Snodgrass is booked for a fairly agricultural slide on Martinelli, who was hoping to skitter off up the left flank. Nope! Not allowed! 22 min: Instead of hoicking the ball into the mixer, Noble plays it down the inside-right channel for Anderson to chase. Anderson can\u2019t control, running the ball out of play. He tangles with Xhaka, coming in from the side, maybe a little behind. West Ham want the penalty, because there\u2019s contact as the pair fall. They\u2019re not getting it. VAR isn\u2019t interested either, but you have seen them awarded. One of those. 21 min: Torreira clatters into Snodgrass, the pair competing for a 50-50 out on the right. It\u2019s a free kick for West Ham in a dangerous position. A chance to load the Arsenal box. 19 min: Arsenal knock it around a bit. Aubameyang thinks he\u2019s been blocked off illegally while pelting down the right, but the referee\u2019s not having any of it, much to the home support\u2019s amusement. 17 min: West Ham are clearly minded to give Maitland-Niles, a late replacement for Bellerin, a workout. Most of their work is out on the left. Cresswell probes, and nearly breaks clear, but the defender sticks to his task and eventually wins out, with a little help from Pepe. 15 min: Pepe tries to flick his way out of a tight spot out on the West Ham left. Cresswell\u2019s not having it, blocks him, and wins a throw. From that, Anderson jigs into the box looking dangerous, but there\u2019s one too many yellow shirt to beat, and eventually he dribbles into trouble. 14 min: West Ham string together a few passes for the first time. It\u2019s very easy on the eye, and the move ends with Cresswell nearly releasing Fornals down the left. Nearly, but not quite. 12 min: Arsenal have enjoyed 85 percent of possession so far. West Ham seem fairly happy to sit back and keep their shape, hoping to nick the ball and hit the visitors on the break. 10 min: A positive early touch by young Martinelli, who drops a shoulder and wins a corner on the left. Nothing comes of the set piece, but both teams look well up for attack. 8 min: A decent run by Fornals down the left, though it comes to nought. West Ham look to be in a fairly positive mood. \u201cFor Everton, it has to be Hafnia,\u201d argues Stephen Carr. \u201cThey made tinned meat.\u201d Such a shame that wasn\u2019t on their shirt during the Dogs of War era. 6 min: West Ham spring to life, Noble and Anderson driving down the middle and setting up Antonio, who lashes high over the bar. Then they come again and force a corner down the right. Torreira is smacked upside the head and it\u2019s a free kick, though Cresswell takes a shot anyway. Did he hit the post?! The camera didn\u2019t track the ball, but there was an almighty thud. He gave it some welly. Anyway, it wouldn\u2019t have counted so the point is moot. 4 min: It\u2019s a quiet start, the crowd noise notwithstanding. \u201cIn reference to JVC being the Arsenal sponsor, as a younger football fan I always think of O2 as the quintessential Arsenal kit, when Thierry Henry used to tear teams apart,\u201d writes Pat Smith Willocks. \u201cSimilarly, I think Carlsberg as the Liverpool kit, and Capital One for Sheffield United under Neil Warnock, featuring a young Phil Jagielka who has been my idol ever since.\u201d It\u2019s a good game, this. I\u2019d plump for Hitachi for Liverpool, Crown Paints at a push, with Laver the timber merchant for the Blades. But then I\u2019m getting on a bit. 2 min: Arsenal stroke it around the back awhile, getting a feel of the ball. They go nowhere, but that\u2019s not really the point, as they play the patient game, hoping to take some of the heat out of the stadium. Here we go, then! Arsenal get the ball rolling. \u201cI am a Scot living in Canada and it\u2019s the first I\u2019d heard of a shoogly peg. I had to look it up. Love it. But surely the English have their own term for living precariously? Or they sure will pretty damn soon.\u201d Topical satire\u2019s Brian Cruickshank, there, ladies and gentlemen, with a little bit of politics. Speaking of which ... VOTE LABOUR. Or Green, SNP, Plaid, Lib Dem, etc. The teams are out! A derby atmosphere at the London Stadium. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes, and a rousing rendition of Bubbles. But before we begin, Hammers fan Ian Sargeant wishes to address the aforementioned old Too Good To Go Down saw. \u201cThey said that in 2002/3 when we had some real young stars (Cole, Carrick, Defoe, Johnson) along side the likes of James, Kanoute, di Canio and Sinclair. We also said it at a pre-season friendly v Wycombe the following term - all those bar Paolo were on the pitch and we went 2-0 down in 15 minutes.\u201d A late change to the Arsenal team. Hector Bellerin tweaked a hamstring in the warm-up, and he\u2019ll be replaced by Ainsley Maitland-Niles at right-back. Sead Kolasinac takes Maitland-Niles\u2019 place on the bench. Manuel Pellegrini talks. \u201cWhen Antonio played the last game against Chelsea, he was a very important striker for us with his power and speed. Unfortunately for him he had more pain and couldn\u2019t play against Wolverhampton but now he is 100 percent fit. Here at home we have had one point from the last four, so we will try to win. I hope we can add three points. We can play better against big teams. We must look for the future.\u201d West Ham United will be playing in their famous claret and blue. Plus the addition of some Rainbow Laces, in support of Stonewall\u2019s campaign to make the game more inclusive for LGBT people. Arsenal will play in yellow, with bruised-banana zig-zags. A delightful homage to this bonny sweater from the early 1990s. Arsenal should never have changed that badge. The Arsenal sponsor for those of a certain vintage, too. The pre-match thoughts of Freddie Ljungberg, who is talking a good attack-minded game. \u201cThere are a lot of games going on in December, so there is fatigue and stuff. We want to get a little energy into the team and shake things up a little bit. Martinelli has done really well in the Europa League, scoring goals for us. He works hard and is very quick, I think he will do really well. Pepe did really well in the second half in the last game. I want him to be who he is, go one against one, and be difficult to read. At the same time I want him to do his defensive work, that\u2019s important playing away from home.\u201d West Ham make one change to the team named for the defeat at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Sebastien Haller drops to the bench, having scored just four times so far this season, and only one in his last 12. Michail Antonio returns to take his place. The 18-year-old striker Gabriel Martinelli starts his first Premier League game for Arsenal. He replaces Alexandre Lacazette. That\u2019s one of four changes to the side that went down at home to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Calum Chambers and Kieran Tierney replace David Luiz and Sead Kolasinac at the back, while Nicolas Pepe takes Joe Willock\u2019s spot. West Ham United: Martin, Fredericks, Balbuena, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Snodgrass, Noble, Rice, Fornals, Felipe Anderson, Antonio. Subs: Zabaleta, Roberto, Sanchez, Haller, Diop, Masuaku, Holland. Arsenal: Leno, Bellerin, Chambers, Papastathopoulos, Tierney, Torreira, Xhaka, Pepe, Ozil, Martinelli, Aubameyang. Subs: Lacazette, Maitland-Niles, Luiz, Nelson, Martinez, Guendouzi, Saka. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). Welcome to the re-run of the 1980 FA Cup final. That\u2019s how all the kids are styling this, right? Ah memories! Trevor Brooking\u2019s header, Willie Young on Paul Allen, a nice big riff in Fever Pitch, all that. Nearly 40 years on, that remains West Ham\u2019s last trophy. Since then, they\u2019ve mainly spent their time packing their teams with top talent and finding themselves inexplicably involved in relegation battles. The Hammers are in bother again. They\u2019ve won just one of their last nine league matches, an eyebrow-raising victory at Chelsea a couple of Saturdays ago. It\u2019s a dismal run that\u2019s seen them plummet down the table. They\u2019ve gone 3-0 down in their last two home fixtures. They\u2019re just a single point better off than Southampton in the relegation spots, and look what a mess they\u2019ve been. You\u2019d definitely file West Ham under Too Good To Go Down ... but then the club has been here before, too many times, so nobody will be taking anything for granted. They could desperately do with three points that\u2019d whizz them up to 13th place at least, a result that would change the picture and the mood totally. It might also be what\u2019s required to save Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s job, which is hanging from a shoogly peg. Oh look! Here come Arsenal. The Gunners are in turmoil, having sacked off Unai Emery, then failed to get a honeymoon bounce under caretaker Freddie Ljungberg. They\u2019re on a nine-game winless streak in all competitions, and can\u2019t defend for toffee right now, having shipped two goals in their last five matches, and failed to keep a clean sheet in their last 11. It\u2019s their worst run since 1977, and their worst start to a season since 1994-95. They\u2019re only four clear of the dropzone themselves. A win here would buy the club some precious time and space in which to do some calm thinking. Two teams not currently in best of nick, then. Which could either make for some shoddy viewing, or glorious entertainment! We\u2019re plumping for the latter. Can the Hammers replicate their Declan Rice-inpsired 1-0 win of last season? Or could the Gunners revisit their 5-1 victory here in 2016? Anything could happen, and it should be fun finding out. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm BST.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has threatened to take the BBC\u2019s licence fee away, as he called into question its status as a publicly funded broadcaster. The prime minister suggested the licence fee, which is guaranteed to continue until at least 2027, was a general tax that could no longer be justified when other media organisations have found other ways of funding themselves. Johnson\u2019s threat to the publicly funded status of the BBC came on a difficult day for his campaign, as he came under fire over his response to a photo of a sick four-year-old sleeping on the floor of A&amp;E. The prime minister made the pronouncement as he took questions from workers at a haulage firm in the Labour stronghold of Washington in the north-east, arguing in favour of Brexit alongside the former Labour MP Gisela Stuart. Asked why he would not get rid of TV licence fees, Johnson said: \u201cAt this stage we are not planning to get rid of all licence fees, though I am certainly looking at it. I\u2019m under pressure not to extemporise policy on the hoof. \u201cBut you have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a TV media organisation still makes sense in the long term given the way other media organisations manage to fund themselves. \u201cThe system of funding out of effectively a general tax bears reflection.

A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cAs we\u2019ve said before, the licence fee ensures a universal BBC which serves everyone, is the most popular funding system among the public and is agreed as the method of funding the BBC for another eight years.\u201d The policy was not mentioned in the Conservative party manifesto, but Nicky Morgan, the outgoing culture secretary, hinted last month that the days of the licence fee could be numbered. Morgan, who is standing down as an MP, had said she was \u201copen-minded\u201d about scrapping the licence fee and replacing it with a Netflix-style subscription service, although sources in her department later downplayed the significance of her comments. The BBC is already dealing with the aftermath of the decision to start charging most over-75s for the fee, which will come into effect this summer. The corporation was forced to make the cuts after former chancellor George Osborne pushed the BBC to take responsibility for the benefit, which was previously paid by the government. David Henderson, a mechanic at Fergusons Transport who asked about the licence fee, said he was happy with the answer and planned to vote Tory for the first time.

      "body": "<p>Gary Neville was right. It might have struck a jarring note in the post-match Sky Sports studio, sandwiched between the unsmiling platitudes of Roy Keane and an ad-break sting. But Neville was right to state that for the last few years British politicians have deliberately, or at best carelessly [narrator: it was deliberate], <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/08/gary-neville-criticises-pm-after-fan-accused-of-racism-at-manchester-derby\">leveraged racial tensions for political gain</a>.</p> <p>Don\u2019t just take Gary\u2019s word for it. Ask the UN, who have in the last year criticised British politics for exactly this, with specific reference to the \u201chostile environment\u201d shambles on immigration policy and the insidious rhetoric around Brexit. These things don\u2019t happen in a vacuum. There is a price to be paid.</p> <p>On Monday it emerged Tottenham Hotspur had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/09/burnley-supporter-13-alleged-racist-gesture-spurs\">expelled a child</a> from their stadium for allegedly racially abusing Son Heung-min during the game against Burnley. Elsewhere two Wolves supporters were ejected from the Amex Stadium for homophobic abuse, another form of viciousness on the rise at football, as it is elsewhere.</p> <p>So Neville was right to talk about politics in response to the news a man in the crowd had appeared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/08/alleged-racist-abuse-manchester-united-city-fred-derby\">to racially abuse Manchester United players</a> at the Etihad on Saturday. Firstly because if not now, then when?

      "bodyText": "Gary Neville was right. It might have struck a jarring note in the post-match Sky Sports studio, sandwiched between the unsmiling platitudes of Roy Keane and an ad-break sting. But Neville was right to state that for the last few years British politicians have deliberately, or at best carelessly [narrator: it was deliberate], leveraged racial tensions for political gain. Don\u2019t just take Gary\u2019s word for it. Ask the UN, who have in the last year criticised British politics for exactly this, with specific reference to the \u201chostile environment\u201d shambles on immigration policy and the insidious rhetoric around Brexit. These things don\u2019t happen in a vacuum. There is a price to be paid. On Monday it emerged Tottenham Hotspur had expelled a child from their stadium for allegedly racially abusing Son Heung-min during the game against Burnley. Elsewhere two Wolves supporters were ejected from the Amex Stadium for homophobic abuse, another form of viciousness on the rise at football, as it is elsewhere. So Neville was right to talk about politics in response to the news a man in the crowd had appeared to racially abuse Manchester United players at the Etihad on Saturday. Firstly because if not now, then when? And secondly because politics is talking to sport all the time, informing its tone, its voice, its discourse. Neville was right also to refer specifically to Boris Johnson, who has ridden these tides more successfully than anyone else. When Johnson pronounces on immigration or presents himself as the hammer of the shadowy ruling elites, it is still hard to feel he really believes what he\u2019s saying himself, hard to conclude he isn\u2019t simply doing this to score points, or simply because he knows it works. This is where we\u2019re at now: a prime minister so inauthentic you start to suspect he isn\u2019t even a real racist. Credit where it\u2019s due, though. In his tribalism and his command of division Johnson appears to have a perfect understanding of the way crowds work. And beyond that, of the way the shouty polarities of public life have begun to follow a familiar football-crowd pattern: to be so easily led, and so easily led the wrong way. With this in mind it was heartening to hear that Pep Guardiola had comforted Fred in the tunnel after the Manchester derby, although Fred says he wasn\u2019t aware of the abuse until he returned to the dressing room and saw the TV footage (for the record, the man in question insists he is innocent and was simply putting his hands down his pants). It was also encouraging to hear Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r try to separate the two elements \u2013 racist abuse, club identity \u2013 in his post-match press conference. It was entirely right, too, that City have promised to take immediate and decisive action. This is not a problem the club has historically carried. City are from Moss Side originally, a racially mixed part of Manchester. Black supporters and players have long been a part of the club, from locals such as Alex Williams to the more recent roster of stars. This is the good side of Saturday afternoon. As for the bad side, well, that starts pretty much everywhere else and goes on from there. East Manchester was a poisonous place generally, not helped by the witless decision to kick off at 5.30pm. The vibe at the Etihad was fractious, pent-up and \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 jaw-grindingly intoxicated in parts. Zoom out a little wider and from the moment pictures of the alleged abuse first appeared on the internet the digital periphery was jammed with the usual tide of blame, finger-jabbing and that particularly modern strain of gloating that seems to have little to do with rectifying the ills of prejudice and division. It is by now a familiar cycle, what we might call the Evra Dialectic. A racist incident happens. Outrage follows, much of it oddly gleeful, characterised by name-calling and demonising of other fans of the \u201cguilty\u201d club. A vocal subsection will then reply by \u201cbacking their man\u201d: dissembling, denying, blaming \u201cthe media\u201d, listing the other club\u2019s own assorted wrongs. And so we enter the dead zone of insults and counter-claim, deluded badge-loyalties and a refusal to accept the evidence of our own eyes. It is a trap football falls into so easily and at every level. Perhaps it is time to talk again about Guardiola, who a year ago blamed the media, with some justification, for publishing racist stereotypes that contributed to the abuse of Raheem Sterling at Chelsea. Fast-forward to Bernardo Silva, Twitter and the publication of a more guileless form of cartoon stereotype on the internet, for which Silva received a one-match ban from the FA.

      "body": "<p>Labour has accused Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign of \u201clying and cheating\u201d to try to distract attention from the prime minister\u2019s insensitive reaction to a sick four-year-old boy forced to sleep on a hospital floor.</p> <p>With just days to go until polling day, the Tories suffered one of their worst days of the campaign as Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/refuses-to-look-at-picture-of-boy-forced-to-sleep-on-hospital-floor\">refused on camera</a> to look at a picture of the poorly child and pocketed the phone of the reporter who tried to show it to him.</p> <p>The incident escalated when Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was dispatched to Leeds General Infirmary in an effort to show that the party was taking the case seriously. But Johnson\u2019s team ended up trying to deflect the story on to Labour by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/matt-hancock-aide-altercation-hospital-campaign-visit\">wrongly briefing that a Tory aide was \u201cpunched\u201d</a> outside the hospital by a leftwing activist.</p> <p>The claims quickly turned out to be untrue when video footage showed that the adviser was accidentally brushed in the face.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tories are so desperate to distract from a four-year-old boy sleeping on a hospital floor because of their cuts to the NHS that, once again, they have resorted to barefaced lying,\u201d a Labour spokesperson said. \u201cThis is a new low and the Conservative party has serious questions to answer.\u201d</p> <p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, tweeted: \u201cJohnson and the Tories lie and they cheat to manipulate the media. A sick child treated on the floor of a hospital and they try divert attention with a dead-cat lie story. Never has our politics sunk so low in our country.\u201d</p> <p>The Tories struggled to get to grips with the story of the sick child after the Daily Mirror printed the picture of him on their front page. In an ITV interview during a campaign visit, the prime minister was challenged about the image of Jack Williment-Barr <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/little-boy-pneumonia-forced-sleep-21053225\">sleeping under coats</a> on a hospital floor in Leeds as he waited for a bed, despite having suspected pneumonia.</p> <p>Asked if he had seen the photographs, Johnson said he had not. The ITV reporter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joepike/status/1204018593656180736\">Joe Pike</a>, then showed the prime minister the photograph on his phone, describing what it portrayed.</p> <p>Johnson declined to look, saying: \u201cI understand. And obviously, we have every possible sympathy for everybody who has a bad experience in the NHS.\u201d He went on to discuss investment in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> and Brexit.</p> <p>Pike pressed the point: \u201cI\u2019m talking about this boy, prime minister. How do you feel, looking at that photo?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cOf course. And let me tell you \u2026 I haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it.\u201d Pike asked: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at it now, prime minister?\u201d Johnson, still not looking at the photo, replied: \u201cI\u2019ll study it later.\u201d</p> <p>Pressed again, he said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll give you an interview now. What we are doing is we are taking this country forward, and we are investing in the NHS.\u201d Johnson then appeared, out of camera shot, to take the phone out of Pike\u2019s hand and put it in his coat pocket.</p> <p>The reporter challenged him: \u201cYou\u2019ve refused to look at the photo, you\u2019ve taken my phone and put it in your pocket, prime minister. His mother says the NHS is in crisis. What\u2019s your response to that?\u201d</p> <p>At this point, Johnson removed the phone and looked at the picture for the first time: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologise, obviously, to the family and all of those who have terrible experiences in the NHS. But what we are doing is supporting the NHS and, on the whole, I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson ended by handing back the phone: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have taken your phone. There you go.\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn responded by tweeting a video of the exchange <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1204026303508307968\">with the message</a>: \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour leader later added: \u201cHe took the phone off Joe. Strange behaviour. I don\u2019t think anyone should behave like that. Whilst sometimes lots of questions from journalists do irritate politicians, that\u2019s the way it is, it\u2019s part of the democratic process. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the kind of behaviour we should be doing \u2013 I would never do that.\u201d</p> <p>At a subsequent media Q&amp;A at the warehouse, Johnson was twice asked about his reaction in the interview, but declined to address the questions, instead talking about investment in the NHS.</p> <p>Asked later by the Guardian why he had not acknowledged the photo, he said: \u201cI did. I did. I did. Next question.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson has previously been accused of showing a lack of empathy, for example during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/criticism-grows-boris-johnson-use-police-officers-political-speech\">speech at a police training college</a> in September, when he pressed on with a speech even after a cadet directly behind him half-collapsed.</p> <p>The incident was compounded by the Tories\u2019 apparent attempt to distract from Johnson\u2019s behaviour by wrongly accusing a Labour activist of violence. The party was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown after aides initially briefed that an adviser to Hancock been hit by one of a group of Labour protesters in an incident that it later emerged had been innocuous.</p> <p>Having later been shown footage of the alleged incident, aides were forced to acknowledge that it looked as if the adviser was hit in the face accidentally, but still tried to turn the story against Labour by claiming that the activists\u2019 behaviour and language had been unacceptable.</p> <p>West Yorkshire police later said they were \u201cunaware of any reports\u201d of an incident involving election campaigners at the hospital. Hancock and his aide were both heckled, with people shouting, \u201cShame on you\u201d, \u201cWe do not want you in this country\u201d and \u201cYou are not welcome in this hospital\u201d as they both walked to a waiting car, but a source present at the scene said they had seen no sign of the incident described by Tory aides.</p> <p>The aide to the health secretary has not responded to a request for comment.</p> <p>The chaotic day for the Tory campaign came after Johnson criss-crossed target seats in north-east and south-west England by chartered plane. The prime minister acknowledged criticism over the environmental cost of taking a short 25 minute flight between Doncaster and Teesside, but insisted the carbon emissions had been \u201coffset\u201d. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Johnson is due in Staffordshire, where he will rail against the threat of tactical voting to his chances of getting a majority.</p> <p>The pressure remained on the Tories on Monday evening as further reports emerged of long wait-times in NHS facilities. Birmingham Children\u2019s hospital confirmed one young patient had been left for 17 hours in A&amp;E on Saturday, saying it had been \u201cexceptionally busy over the last two weeks\u201d. Giving context, a spokesman said the average waiting time that day was about four and a half hours.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s Daily Mirror ran another story about a sick child the paper said had been made to wait for hours before being seen. The Mirror reported that nine-month-old Lily Webb had spent six hours on a chair in A&amp;E with just her mother\u2019s cardigan as a blanket. The front page story bore the headline: \u201cHere\u2019s another picture you won\u2019t want to look at, Mr Johnson.\u201d</p> <p>The Independent said it had seen a leaked NHS email that said a 12-year-old with learning disabilities and mental health issues had spent 57 hours in an Essex hospital\u2019s A&amp;E department waiting for a specialist bed to become available. The trust declined to comment on Monday evening.</p> <p>Speaking on the campaign trail earlier on Monday, Corbyn said the Tories\u2019 response to the case of the sick child had been unacceptable. He said: \u201cThey\u2019ve had nine years in office, and whilst they now claim they are funding the NHS, they are not; they\u2019re not even beginning to make up the shortfall it\u2019s had over the past nine years.</p> <p>\u201cWe are determined that we\u2019ll put \u00a326bn in, which will over time amount to \u00a340bn into the NHS, to ensure it\u2019s properly funded \u2013 but also social care and mental health services.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour has accused Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign of \u201clying and cheating\u201d to try to distract attention from the prime minister\u2019s insensitive reaction to a sick four-year-old boy forced to sleep on a hospital floor. With just days to go until polling day, the Tories suffered one of their worst days of the campaign as Johnson refused on camera to look at a picture of the poorly child and pocketed the phone of the reporter who tried to show it to him. The incident escalated when Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was dispatched to Leeds General Infirmary in an effort to show that the party was taking the case seriously. But Johnson\u2019s team ended up trying to deflect the story on to Labour by wrongly briefing that a Tory aide was \u201cpunched\u201d outside the hospital by a leftwing activist. The claims quickly turned out to be untrue when video footage showed that the adviser was accidentally brushed in the face. \u201cThe Tories are so desperate to distract from a four-year-old boy sleeping on a hospital floor because of their cuts to the NHS that, once again, they have resorted to barefaced lying,\u201d a Labour spokesperson said. \u201cThis is a new low and the Conservative party has serious questions to answer.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, tweeted: \u201cJohnson and the Tories lie and they cheat to manipulate the media. A sick child treated on the floor of a hospital and they try divert attention with a dead-cat lie story. Never has our politics sunk so low in our country.\u201d The Tories struggled to get to grips with the story of the sick child after the Daily Mirror printed the picture of him on their front page. In an ITV interview during a campaign visit, the prime minister was challenged about the image of Jack Williment-Barr sleeping under coats on a hospital floor in Leeds as he waited for a bed, despite having suspected pneumonia. Asked if he had seen the photographs, Johnson said he had not. The ITV reporter, Joe Pike, then showed the prime minister the photograph on his phone, describing what it portrayed. Johnson declined to look, saying: \u201cI understand. And obviously, we have every possible sympathy for everybody who has a bad experience in the NHS.\u201d He went on to discuss investment in the NHS and Brexit. Pike pressed the point: \u201cI\u2019m talking about this boy, prime minister. How do you feel, looking at that photo?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cOf course. And let me tell you \u2026 I haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it.\u201d Pike asked: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at it now, prime minister?\u201d Johnson, still not looking at the photo, replied: \u201cI\u2019ll study it later.\u201d Pressed again, he said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll give you an interview now. What we are doing is we are taking this country forward, and we are investing in the NHS.\u201d Johnson then appeared, out of camera shot, to take the phone out of Pike\u2019s hand and put it in his coat pocket. The reporter challenged him: \u201cYou\u2019ve refused to look at the photo, you\u2019ve taken my phone and put it in your pocket, prime minister. His mother says the NHS is in crisis. What\u2019s your response to that?\u201d At this point, Johnson removed the phone and looked at the picture for the first time: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologise, obviously, to the family and all of those who have terrible experiences in the NHS. But what we are doing is supporting the NHS and, on the whole, I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had.\u201d Johnson ended by handing back the phone: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have taken your phone. There you go.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn responded by tweeting a video of the exchange with the message: \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d The Labour leader later added: \u201cHe took the phone off Joe. Strange behaviour. I don\u2019t think anyone should behave like that. Whilst sometimes lots of questions from journalists do irritate politicians, that\u2019s the way it is, it\u2019s part of the democratic process. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the kind of behaviour we should be doing \u2013 I would never do that.\u201d At a subsequent media Q&amp;A at the warehouse, Johnson was twice asked about his reaction in the interview, but declined to address the questions, instead talking about investment in the NHS. Asked later by the Guardian why he had not acknowledged the photo, he said: \u201cI did. I did. I did. Next question.\u201d Johnson has previously been accused of showing a lack of empathy, for example during a speech at a police training college in September, when he pressed on with a speech even after a cadet directly behind him half-collapsed. The incident was compounded by the Tories\u2019 apparent attempt to distract from Johnson\u2019s behaviour by wrongly accusing a Labour activist of violence. The party was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown after aides initially briefed that an adviser to Hancock been hit by one of a group of Labour protesters in an incident that it later emerged had been innocuous. Having later been shown footage of the alleged incident, aides were forced to acknowledge that it looked as if the adviser was hit in the face accidentally, but still tried to turn the story against Labour by claiming that the activists\u2019 behaviour and language had been unacceptable. West Yorkshire police later said they were \u201cunaware of any reports\u201d of an incident involving election campaigners at the hospital. Hancock and his aide were both heckled, with people shouting, \u201cShame on you\u201d, \u201cWe do not want you in this country\u201d and \u201cYou are not welcome in this hospital\u201d as they both walked to a waiting car, but a source present at the scene said they had seen no sign of the incident described by Tory aides. The aide to the health secretary has not responded to a request for comment. The chaotic day for the Tory campaign came after Johnson criss-crossed target seats in north-east and south-west England by chartered plane. The prime minister acknowledged criticism over the environmental cost of taking a short 25 minute flight between Doncaster and Teesside, but insisted the carbon emissions had been \u201coffset\u201d. On Tuesday, Johnson is due in Staffordshire, where he will rail against the threat of tactical voting to his chances of getting a majority. The pressure remained on the Tories on Monday evening as further reports emerged of long wait-times in NHS facilities. Birmingham Children\u2019s hospital confirmed one young patient had been left for 17 hours in A&amp;E on Saturday, saying it had been \u201cexceptionally busy over the last two weeks\u201d. Giving context, a spokesman said the average waiting time that day was about four and a half hours. Tuesday\u2019s Daily Mirror ran another story about a sick child the paper said had been made to wait for hours before being seen. The Mirror reported that nine-month-old Lily Webb had spent six hours on a chair in A&amp;E with just her mother\u2019s cardigan as a blanket. The front page story bore the headline: \u201cHere\u2019s another picture you won\u2019t want to look at, Mr Johnson.\u201d The Independent said it had seen a leaked NHS email that said a 12-year-old with learning disabilities and mental health issues had spent 57 hours in an Essex hospital\u2019s A&amp;E department waiting for a specialist bed to become available. The trust declined to comment on Monday evening. Speaking on the campaign trail earlier on Monday, Corbyn said the Tories\u2019 response to the case of the sick child had been unacceptable. He said: \u201cThey\u2019ve had nine years in office, and whilst they now claim they are funding the NHS, they are not; they\u2019re not even beginning to make up the shortfall it\u2019s had over the past nine years. \u201cWe are determined that we\u2019ll put \u00a326bn in, which will over time amount to \u00a340bn into the NHS, to ensure it\u2019s properly funded \u2013 but also social care and mental health services.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Austrian media who were expecting a bit of light-hearted banter with J\u00fcrgen Klopp at the Red Bull Arena were to be disappointed. It was not the time or place. There was confusion over where to sit alongside Jordan Henderson at the pre-match press conference, a TV light on full beam was shone directly into the face of the Liverpool manager, who then had to correct the interpreter over a mistranslation of his captain\u2019s words. \u201cAs you can see,\u201d said Klopp by way of apology, \u201cI am in competitive mood already.\u201d Salzburg should know to expect nothing less. Liverpool find themselves on familiar ground in the final game of their Champions League group: needing a result to qualify and to keep alive hopes of reaching the final of every European competition they have played under Klopp. Two years ago they needed to avoid defeat against Spartak Moscow and won 7-0. Last season they had to beat Napoli, one of the teams who could prompt the holders\u2019 elimination on Tuesday, and won 1-0. RB Salzburg have \u201cnothing to lose\u201d according to their prolific 19-year-old striker Erling Braut Haaland, who has predicted a 3-1 win for the Austrian champions and a hat-trick for himself in \u201cthe biggest game of my career so far\u201d. Liverpool know what it takes to win. \u201cI am not nervous but I am tense,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cIt is a special kind of tense. If something is important to you, you want to reach it. That is why you have the situation of stress but, over the years, you learn how to deal with it and learn that you won\u2019t die because of these situations. I have won and lost many important games but in the last few years it has gone well. Salzburg are going in the right direction. \u201cI have a big interest in this club [Salzburg]. They create opportunities for young players and people in football and in other sports too. That is important. They fought for years to get into the Champions League and now they have the chance to go to the knockout stages. This situation has caused a lot of fear and whoever can overcome this fear best will make it into the next stages.\u201d Jesse Marsch, Salzburg\u2019s American coach, was filmed at half-time at Anfield in October berating his team for showing Liverpool too much respect as they fell 3-0 behind and rallied to level at 3-3 before Mohamed Salah sealed victory for the hosts. \u201cShow them we are fucking here to compete,\u201d raged Marsch, who also urged his forwards to be more ruthless against Virgil van Dijk. That is easier said than done. The Salzburg coach was more relaxed on Monday but not lacking in confidence. \u201cTo play aggressively, defend well and work well,\u201d he listed of his aims for Tuesday. \u201cLiverpool are very talented and quick and dangerous in their transitions, so we always have to be alert to what happens on the pitch.

      "bodyText": "An FBI investigation into the Donald Trump election campaign\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia was justified and not motivated by political bias against him, a government watchdog has concluded. A report by the justice department\u2019s inspector general demolished three years of claims by the president that he was the victim of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy and that the investigation was based on a dossier compiled by an ex-British intelligence operative, Christopher Steele. \u201cThe report issued today by the inspector general debunks the conspiracy theories about the Mueller report and the Russia investigation that President Trump and Republicans in Congress have pushed for years,\u201d Jerrold Nadler, the chair of the House judiciary committee, and Carolyn Maloney, the chair of the House oversight committee, said in a joint statement. \u201cThose discredited conspiracy theories were attempts to deflect from the president\u2019s serious and ongoing misconduct, first urging Russia and now extorting Ukraine into interfering with our elections to benefit himself personally and politically.\u201d But the report by the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, did pinpoint \u201cserious performance failures\u201d in the monitoring of a Trump aide, which the president\u2019s allies seized on in an attempt to claim vindication. Horowitz identified 17 \u201csignificant inaccuracies or omissions\u201d in applications for a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance or Fisa court to monitor the communications of the former Trump adviser Carter Page and subsequent warrant renewals. The errors resulted in \u201capplications that made it appear that the information supporting probable cause was stronger than was actually the case\u201d, the report said, although the FBI had a legal \u201cauthorized purpose\u201d to ask for court approval. The attorney general, William Barr, rejected Horowitz\u2019s conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to open the investigation. \u201cThe inspector general\u2019s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a US presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,\u201d Barr said. However, the inspector general concluded there was no evidence to support the claim by Trump and his supporters that he would uncover bias in the top ranks of the FBI. The president has repeatedly suggested the Russia investigation was driven by Barack Obama\u2019s justice department because it wanted Hillary Clinton to win the White House. Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, has been demonised by Trump. McCabe\u2019s counsel, Michael Bromwich, said \u201cthe review found an ample factual basis for the launching of the Russia investigation. It also found unanimity \u2013 among FBI and DoJ personnel at every level \u2013 that the investigation needed to be opened, and that not doing so would have been a dereliction of duty by the FBI.\u201d The investigation, ultimately taken over by the special counsel Robert Mueller, started in July 2016 after the FBI learned that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump aide, had been saying before it was publicly known that Russia possessed dirt on Clinton in the form of hacked emails. It was this, not the so-called \u201cSteele dossier\u201d, that was the trigger. Horowitz found that the FBI had overstated the significance of Steele\u2019s past work as an informant and left out information about one of Steele\u2019s sources whom Steele called a \u201cboaster\u201d who \u201cmay engage in some embellishment\u201d. The report also says law enforcement officials failed to offer \u201cgreater clarity on the political origins and connections\u201d of Steele\u2019s reporting, including the fact that the political research firm that selected him had been hired by Democrats.

I don\u2019t want to hear about how much they support law enforcement, how much they care about lives and the sanctity of lives.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd yet we all know in law enforcement that this is one of the biggest reasons that the Senate and Mitch McConnell, and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and others are not getting into a room and having a conference committee with the House, and getting the Violence Against Women Act, is because the NRA doesn\u2019t like the fact that we want to take firearms out of the hands of boyfriends that abuse their girlfriends.\u201d</p> \n<p>The NRA <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/us/politics/nra-domestic-violence-congress.html\">says the act\u2019s definition of domestic abuse is too broad</a>. Experts disagree.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd who killed our sergeant?\u201d Acevedo asked. \u201cA boyfriend abusing his girlfriend. So you\u2019re either here for women and children and our daughters and our sisters and our aunts, or you\u2019re here for the NRA.\u201d</p> \n<p>Growing more emotional, he continued: \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to see their little smug faces about how much they care about law enforcement when I\u2019m burying a sergeant because they don\u2019t want to piss off the NRA.</p> \n<p>\u201cMake up your minds. Whose side are you on? Gun manufacturers? The gun lobby? Or the children who are getting gunned down in this country every single day? In our schools, in our theatres, in our colleges, on our streets, in our homes, in our businesses. Who are you coming to work for?\u201d</p> \n<p>The Violence Against Women Act, passed in 1994, lapsed during last year\u2019s government shutdown. The Democratic-controlled House reauthorised it in April, adding protections for transgender victims and banning those convicted of domestic abuse from buying guns.</p> \n<p>Responding to Acevedo\u2019s comments last week, Cornyn referred to Donald Trump\u2019s current predicament when he <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/HPD-chief-Acevedo-and-Sen-John-Cornyn-joust-over-14885330.php\">said</a>: \u201cUnfortunately, legislation like this has fallen casualty to impeachment mania.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Senate has not yet had to act on impeachment, as House committees continue to stage hearings before staging a formal vote.</p> \n<p>On Monday Acevedo rejected Cornyn\u2019s argument. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me, senator, with all due respect, it\u2019s about the impeachment. Because you brag every day, you and Mitch McConnell, <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/unsuitable-before-the-election-trump-gets-obamas-judges-on-the-bench\">about getting judges confirmed</a>. You brag about every piece of legislation you care about.</p> \n<p>\u201cStart caring about cops, children and women and everyday gun violence. And that will be the last thing I say this week, because the rest of this week is going to be about Christopher Brewster and his sacrifice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cornyn did not immediately comment. Nor did the NRA.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou are an American, and American blood is being shed every day in this community throughout this nation,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cDo something about it or retire.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two days after a Houston police sergeant was shot dead responding to a domestic violence call, the city police chief, Art Acevedo, has lacerated the majority leader Mitch McConnell and Texas\u2019s two Republican US senators, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz for stalling the Violence Against Women Act. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see their little smug faces about how much they care about law enforcement when I\u2019m burying a sergeant because they don\u2019t want to piss off the NRA,\u201d Acevedo told reporters on Monday. Sgt Christopher Brewster was killed in Houston on Saturday. At a briefing the same day, Acevedo paid tribute to Brewster, 32, who was shot repeatedly after responding to a call from a female victim who reported her boyfriend was assaulting her and was armed with two guns. A suspect, captured at a nearby school, was charged with capital murder. Acevedo clashed last week with Cornyn over why the Violence Against Women Act was stalled in the Senate, which Republicans control. He returned to the subject on Monday, speaking to reporters before police provided an escort for Brewster\u2019s body. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the Violence Against Women Act acted upon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get in a room. I don\u2019t want to hear about how much they support law enforcement, how much they care about lives and the sanctity of lives. \u201cAnd yet we all know in law enforcement that this is one of the biggest reasons that the Senate and Mitch McConnell, and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and others are not getting into a room and having a conference committee with the House, and getting the Violence Against Women Act, is because the NRA doesn\u2019t like the fact that we want to take firearms out of the hands of boyfriends that abuse their girlfriends.\u201d The NRA says the act\u2019s definition of domestic abuse is too broad. Experts disagree. \u201cAnd who killed our sergeant?\u201d Acevedo asked. \u201cA boyfriend abusing his girlfriend. So you\u2019re either here for women and children and our daughters and our sisters and our aunts, or you\u2019re here for the NRA.\u201d Growing more emotional, he continued: \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to see their little smug faces about how much they care about law enforcement when I\u2019m burying a sergeant because they don\u2019t want to piss off the NRA. \u201cMake up your minds. Whose side are you on? Gun manufacturers? The gun lobby? Or the children who are getting gunned down in this country every single day? In our schools, in our theatres, in our colleges, on our streets, in our homes, in our businesses. Who are you coming to work for?\u201d The Violence Against Women Act, passed in 1994, lapsed during last year\u2019s government shutdown. The Democratic-controlled House reauthorised it in April, adding protections for transgender victims and banning those convicted of domestic abuse from buying guns. Responding to Acevedo\u2019s comments last week, Cornyn referred to Donald Trump\u2019s current predicament when he said: \u201cUnfortunately, legislation like this has fallen casualty to impeachment mania.\u201d The Senate has not yet had to act on impeachment, as House committees continue to stage hearings before staging a formal vote. On Monday Acevedo rejected Cornyn\u2019s argument. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me, senator, with all due respect, it\u2019s about the impeachment. Because you brag every day, you and Mitch McConnell, about getting judges confirmed. You brag about every piece of legislation you care about. \u201cStart caring about cops, children and women and everyday gun violence. And that will be the last thing I say this week, because the rest of this week is going to be about Christopher Brewster and his sacrifice.\u201d Cornyn did not immediately comment. Nor did the NRA. \u201cYou are an American, and American blood is being shed every day in this community throughout this nation,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cDo something about it or retire.\u201d",

Pretty much everyone now accepts the country was engaged in extraordinary levels of deception and manipulation when it comes to doping \u2013 except, of course, the Russians themselves.</p> <p>It started in 2011 and led to hundreds of Russian athletes being given a cocktail of banned substances including methenolone, trenbolone and oxandrolone \u2013 which were mixed with alcohol (Chivas whisky for male athletes and Martini vermouth for women) to improve the absorption of the steroids and shorten the detection window, and then spat out. Grigor Rodchenkov, the former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory who later turned whistleblower, even had a name for his concoction: \u201cThe Duchess\u201d, after the popular Russian cocktail.</p> <p>It was Rodchenkov who also revealed how Russia corrupted the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi \u2013 after the FSB, its security service, developed a method to open anti-doping bottles surreptitiously. After each day\u2019s competition tainted samples from Russian athletes were passed through a mouse hole into an adjacent room where they were opened and switched for clean urine in the dead of night.</p> <p>It allowed the Russians to continue to use steroids during the Games, handing them an even bigger advantage. And they would have got away with it, too, but for Rodchenkov, who fled the country in 2015 with hard drives containing thousands of pieces of evidence.</p> <p>The latest twist in this sprawling drama came in January when Wada\u2019s executive committee was finally able to extract a database from the Moscow anti-doping laboratory to help it prosecute individual Russian athletes. But that database was recently found to have been manipulated to conceal failed drug tests \u2013 leading to the four-year ban.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly Rodchenkov, who is now in a witness protection programme in the United States, feels vindicated. But he also wants Wada to go further.</p> <p>\u201cAs usual Russia has disregarded all of its promises and obligations to clean sport,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cThe Moscow database from my laboratory was manipulated. Tons of files and results were deleted. After all of this, who can say whether there are any clean athletes in Russia if the crucial data is lost? The results of the London and Sochi Olympics should be reanalysed and reconsidered with the new knowledge available today. We need to take the strongest action to bring justice back to sport.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the US Anti-Doping Agency and a vocal critic of Russia, agrees, saying Wada had not gone nearly far enough.</p> <p>\u201cTo allow Russia to escape a complete ban is yet another devastating blow,\u201d he warned. \u201cThere is no disputing that Russia has committed the most intentional, deep and broad level of corruption on the entire sports world that has put money over morals, abuse over health and corruption over the Olympic values and all athlete\u2019s dreams.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the approach of the International Olympic Committee and Wada is to try to punish Russia the country, while preserving natural justice for athletes who have not failed any test or been implicated in any wrongdoing. As one influential onlooker put it: \u201cThere is quite rightly a big desire to see punishment. But it seems that it is not so easy to punish the guilty.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, of the few Russian athletes to speak out against doping the world high jump champion, Mariya Lasitskene, recently lamented the situation in her country, saying: \u201cClean athletes are still defenceless and not sure they\u2019ll be able to compete tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>And despite the apparently emphatic nature of Monday\u2019s verdict, the fate of Russia \u2013 and by extension Lasitskene and the country\u2019s other athletes \u2013 remains in an uneasy limbo.</p>",

Before the 2018 Winter Games it overturned the lifetime Olympic bans of 28 Russian athletes \u2013 prompting widespread angst and outrage \u2013 with even usually stoic figures in anti-doping worried about the consequences for elite sport. No retreat, no surrender: that has been the Russian way from the start. Pretty much everyone now accepts the country was engaged in extraordinary levels of deception and manipulation when it comes to doping \u2013 except, of course, the Russians themselves. It started in 2011 and led to hundreds of Russian athletes being given a cocktail of banned substances including methenolone, trenbolone and oxandrolone \u2013 which were mixed with alcohol (Chivas whisky for male athletes and Martini vermouth for women) to improve the absorption of the steroids and shorten the detection window, and then spat out. Grigor Rodchenkov, the former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory who later turned whistleblower, even had a name for his concoction: \u201cThe Duchess\u201d, after the popular Russian cocktail. It was Rodchenkov who also revealed how Russia corrupted the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi \u2013 after the FSB, its security service, developed a method to open anti-doping bottles surreptitiously. After each day\u2019s competition tainted samples from Russian athletes were passed through a mouse hole into an adjacent room where they were opened and switched for clean urine in the dead of night. It allowed the Russians to continue to use steroids during the Games, handing them an even bigger advantage. And they would have got away with it, too, but for Rodchenkov, who fled the country in 2015 with hard drives containing thousands of pieces of evidence. The latest twist in this sprawling drama came in January when Wada\u2019s executive committee was finally able to extract a database from the Moscow anti-doping laboratory to help it prosecute individual Russian athletes. But that database was recently found to have been manipulated to conceal failed drug tests \u2013 leading to the four-year ban. Unsurprisingly Rodchenkov, who is now in a witness protection programme in the United States, feels vindicated. But he also wants Wada to go further. \u201cAs usual Russia has disregarded all of its promises and obligations to clean sport,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cThe Moscow database from my laboratory was manipulated. Tons of files and results were deleted. After all of this, who can say whether there are any clean athletes in Russia if the crucial data is lost? The results of the London and Sochi Olympics should be reanalysed and reconsidered with the new knowledge available today. We need to take the strongest action to bring justice back to sport.\u201d Unsurprisingly Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the US Anti-Doping Agency and a vocal critic of Russia, agrees, saying Wada had not gone nearly far enough. \u201cTo allow Russia to escape a complete ban is yet another devastating blow,\u201d he warned. \u201cThere is no disputing that Russia has committed the most intentional, deep and broad level of corruption on the entire sports world that has put money over morals, abuse over health and corruption over the Olympic values and all athlete\u2019s dreams.\u201d Yet the approach of the International Olympic Committee and Wada is to try to punish Russia the country, while preserving natural justice for athletes who have not failed any test or been implicated in any wrongdoing. As one influential onlooker put it: \u201cThere is quite rightly a big desire to see punishment. But it seems that it is not so easy to punish the guilty.\u201d Meanwhile, of the few Russian athletes to speak out against doping the world high jump champion, Mariya Lasitskene, recently lamented the situation in her country, saying: \u201cClean athletes are still defenceless and not sure they\u2019ll be able to compete tomorrow.\u201d And despite the apparently emphatic nature of Monday\u2019s verdict, the fate of Russia \u2013 and by extension Lasitskene and the country\u2019s other athletes \u2013 remains in an uneasy limbo.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 10 December. Top stories Five people have died, eight are missing and 31 remain in hospital after a volcanic eruption on White Island in New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern has said. The volcano erupted on Monday with a towering blast of ash and scalding steam. Police said the site was still too dangerous hours later for rescuers to search for the missing but that aircraft had seen no signs of life. The disaster immediately raised questions of why tourists were allowed to visit the island 50km off the mainland after scientists had noted an uptick in volcanic activity. White Island is the tip of an undersea volcano. US lies and deception have been spelled out in shocking detail in the Afghanistan papers, published by the Washington Post after a three-year court battle. The papers portray a trajectory of deliberate misinformation, wishful thinking, massaging of figures and cruel waste of lives \u2013 civilian and military \u2013 and $1tn spent in pursuit of an unwinnable war. Hundreds of interviews \u2013 given by key players to a US federal agency without the expectation their words would see the light of day \u2013 detail how politicians, commanders and diplomats lied to themselves as they lied to voters. Scott Morrison ends an election-winning year with a strong thumbs up from Coalition voters. But voter disapproval of the PM has also crept up in the second half of 2019, from 34% in July to 43% in December, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Of voters asked to rate Morrison\u2019s performance as prime minister compared with their expectations, 11% said he had exceeded them, 41% said he had met them and 47% said he had fallen short. Meanwhile, on Q&amp;A, Malcolm Turnbull called on Scott Morrison to step up his response to the catastrophic bushfires, declaring that emergency management in Australia needed to be restructured because the threat was now a \u201cnational security issue\u201d. Australia Labor is doubling down on its efforts to woo back the communities it lost at the last election, with Anthony Albanese aiming to visit a coalmine as part of his first official tour of Queensland since becoming leader. The ACT will continue to push for pill-testing nationally after an independent review confirmed a trial in Canberra encouraged buyers of a synthetic ecstasy substitute to ditch unsafe drugs. NSW is facing a potentially \u201clethal\u201d cocktail of bushfire conditions, with smoke pollution set to smother Sydney and temperatures to soar past 40C. The world Boris Johnson has repeatedly refused during a TV interview to look at a photo of a boy forced to sleep on the floor at an overcrowded ER unit, before pocketing the reporter\u2019s phone on which he was being shown the picture. Marina Hyde writes that the awkward confrontation prompted Johnson to add larceny to mendacity. A quarter of the world\u2019s population are at risk of water supply problems as mountain glaciers, snow-packs and alpine lakes are run down by global heating and rising demand, according to an international study. Children and young people must be at the heart of dealing with the climate crisis, the UN and campaigners have said as climate talks in Madrid enter their second week with little concrete progress. The US supreme court on Monday left in place a Kentucky law requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds and show foetal images to patients before abortions. The justices did not comment in refusing to review an appeals court ruling that upheld the law. China has said Uighurs and other minorities believed to be detained in Xinjiang have been freed, repeating claims made previously but offering no evidence. Recommended reads How tourists became first aiders on seas off the White Island volcano. Eleanor Ainge Roy writes: \u201cJust off the volcanic White Island, or Whakaari, a boatload of tourists who had been standing at the crater about 20 minutes earlier watched in surprise, and then horror. \u2018It was hard to tell at first, because we\u2019d seen the smoke before, but this was a huge cloud of it,\u2019 said Michael Schade, who was visiting the island with his parents. \u2018We were taking photos and videos and then it dawned on us what had happened.\u2019\u201d The Coalition isn\u2019t being honest about the climate crisis, writes Greg Jericho. But neither is Labor. \u201cOf course we do need to think about those who will be affected by mine closures, but cripes, there is no pressure, no impetus and no real commitment from the ALP right now on an issue that is causing children and elderly to have to stay inside because of worries about air quality. What are they waiting for? I suspect they are waiting for the fires to end and the smoke to blow away so that people stop worrying about the issue, because too many in the ALP have taken the position that climate change is a vote loser. Instead it should be a rallying call.\u201d Watch Marriage Story and The Irishman are set to do battle at next year\u2019s Golden Globe awards. Only one will prove victorious but the distributor of both \u2013 Netflix \u2013 has already emerged triumphant. This year\u2019s nominations are an extraordinary validation of the streaming-service-turned-studio. That said, Peter Bradshaw writes, \u201cMarriage Story and The Irishman deserve awards love, but no Greta Gerwig is heart-sinking.\u201d Cate Blanchett, Toni Collette, Russell Crowe, Nicole Kidman, and Margot Robbie have all been nominated. See the full list here. Cook A Christmas lunch with all the trimmings is never a budget-friendly proposition, and this year between drought, African swine fever and rising grocery store prices, costs may be particularly high. Making a few strategic switches will help in creating a feast that is just as impressive. Sport The World Anti-Doping Agency has voted unanimously to ban Russia from international sport for four years for doping offences. Russia now has 21 days to appeal against the sentence, which would see the country banned from taking part at next summer\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo and the Qatar 2022 World Cup. W-League crowd figures have never been lower. But why? Is the league lacking role models, marketing, community connection or relevance? It might be all of the above. Media roundup New responsible lending guidelines say banks should be asking customers \u201cprove they can save money and afford loans by sending their children to public schools or canceling their Netflix subscriptions\u201d, the Australian Financial Review reports. The chairman of the NSW Waratahs has called for an overhaul of Australian Super Rugby as \u201ca matter of the utmost urgency\u201d, the Sydney Morning Herald reveals. In today\u2019s Australian, David Littleproud has \u201cnamed and shamed\u201d Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia as the states doing the least to support drought relief. Coming up NSW\u2019s drought-stricken New England region will welcome a delivery of 2m litres of water thanks to the #FinishWaterWaste initiative. Malcolm Turnbull and the billionaire entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes will be the keynote speakers at Australia\u2019s biggest renewable energy summit.

      "body": "<p>The former MI6 officer Christopher Steele had a \u201cpersonal\u201d relationship with Ivanka Trump and gifted her a \u201cfamily tartan from Scotland\u201d as a present, the long-awaited report by US Department of Justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, revealed on Monday.</p> <p>Horowitz\u2019s review of the FBI\u2019s 2016 investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign and its links with Russia includes fresh details of Steele\u2019s interactions with the FBI, and startling claims about his relationship with the Trumps dating back to the period before he wrote a controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/14/fusion-gps-founders-book-trump-russia-ties-steele-dossier\">dossier</a> on Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/dec/09/trump-news-today-live-impeachment-inquiry-doj-trump-russia-investigation-report-latest-updates\">DoJ internal watchdog report clears FBI of illegal surveillance of Trump adviser \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report did not mention Ivanka Trump by name but her identity <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dossier-author-chris-steele-met-ivanka-trump-years/story?id=67597270\">was revealed</a> by ABC News.</p> <p>The report said that contrary to what Donald Trump has claimed on Twitter Steele was actually \u201cfavorably disposed\u201d to the Trump family. It was \u201cridiculous\u201d to suggest he was biased against the then Republican candidate or that his memos on collusion, written at the behest of the Washington-based research firm Fusion GPS, were in any way biased, Steele told federal investigators.</p> <p>Steele said he had visited Ivanka Trump at Trump Tower and had been \u201cfriendly\u201d with her for \u201csome years\u201d. He described their relationship as \u201cpersonal\u201d. The former British government spy had even given her a \u201cfamily tartan from Scotland\u201d as a present, the report quoted him as saying.</p> <p>ABC also <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dossier-author-chris-steele-met-ivanka-trump-years/story?id=67597270\">reported</a> that Ivanka Trump even discussed work that Steele\u2019s firm \u2013 Orbis Business Intelligence \u2013 might do for the Trump family business.</p> <p>Earlier this year Steele met with members of the inspector general\u2019s team in London and spoke to investigators via Skype. He handed over memos setting out his two meetings in 2016 with the FBI, in which he passed on his dossier which said that the Russians had been seeking to cultivate Trump for some years, and had secretly compromised him in a Moscow hotel room.</p> <p>Horowitz\u2019s conclusions were sent to Orbis ahead of the report\u2019s publication on Monday. This prompted Steele to issue an unusual statement via his lawyers pushing back against some of the inspector general\u2019s key claims.</p> <p>The report concludes the FBI placed too much emphasis on Steele\u2019s work. It said Steele\u2019s reporting was not done \u201cin bad faith\u201d but sometimes showed a \u201clack of judgement\u201d and could involve pursuing people with \u201cpolitical risk but no intelligence value\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday Steele\u2019s Washington-based law firm, Bredhoff &amp; Kaiser, issued a lengthy rebuttal of Horowitz\u2019s findings and defended Steele\u2019s professional work.</p> <p>It said that the Trump-Russia memos written by Steele in 2016 were derived from \u201ccredible and reliable\u201d human sources. Subsequently his reporting was \u201cextensively corroborated\u201d, the lawyers said.</p> <p>Some of this confirmation came from testimony given by Carter Page, Trump\u2019s former foreign policy aide.</p> <p>Page is at the centre of the Horowitz review.

      "bodyText": "The former MI6 officer Christopher Steele had a \u201cpersonal\u201d relationship with Ivanka Trump and gifted her a \u201cfamily tartan from Scotland\u201d as a present, the long-awaited report by US Department of Justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, revealed on Monday. Horowitz\u2019s review of the FBI\u2019s 2016 investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign and its links with Russia includes fresh details of Steele\u2019s interactions with the FBI, and startling claims about his relationship with the Trumps dating back to the period before he wrote a controversial dossier on Trump. The report did not mention Ivanka Trump by name but her identity was revealed by ABC News. The report said that contrary to what Donald Trump has claimed on Twitter Steele was actually \u201cfavorably disposed\u201d to the Trump family. It was \u201cridiculous\u201d to suggest he was biased against the then Republican candidate or that his memos on collusion, written at the behest of the Washington-based research firm Fusion GPS, were in any way biased, Steele told federal investigators. Steele said he had visited Ivanka Trump at Trump Tower and had been \u201cfriendly\u201d with her for \u201csome years\u201d. He described their relationship as \u201cpersonal\u201d. The former British government spy had even given her a \u201cfamily tartan from Scotland\u201d as a present, the report quoted him as saying. ABC also reported that Ivanka Trump even discussed work that Steele\u2019s firm \u2013 Orbis Business Intelligence \u2013 might do for the Trump family business. Earlier this year Steele met with members of the inspector general\u2019s team in London and spoke to investigators via Skype. He handed over memos setting out his two meetings in 2016 with the FBI, in which he passed on his dossier which said that the Russians had been seeking to cultivate Trump for some years, and had secretly compromised him in a Moscow hotel room. Horowitz\u2019s conclusions were sent to Orbis ahead of the report\u2019s publication on Monday. This prompted Steele to issue an unusual statement via his lawyers pushing back against some of the inspector general\u2019s key claims. The report concludes the FBI placed too much emphasis on Steele\u2019s work. It said Steele\u2019s reporting was not done \u201cin bad faith\u201d but sometimes showed a \u201clack of judgement\u201d and could involve pursuing people with \u201cpolitical risk but no intelligence value\u201d. On Monday Steele\u2019s Washington-based law firm, Bredhoff &amp; Kaiser, issued a lengthy rebuttal of Horowitz\u2019s findings and defended Steele\u2019s professional work. It said that the Trump-Russia memos written by Steele in 2016 were derived from \u201ccredible and reliable\u201d human sources. Subsequently his reporting was \u201cextensively corroborated\u201d, the lawyers said. Some of this confirmation came from testimony given by Carter Page, Trump\u2019s former foreign policy aide. Page is at the centre of the Horowitz review. The president appointed Horowitz after Republicans claimed Page was the victim of \u201cillegal\u201d FBI spying in 2016, with a surveillance warrant issued by a federal court in part because of the dossier. The report finds that the FBI made multiple mistakes and errors in its handling of the Page case. Page admitted that in 2016 he met with senior officials from the Kremlin and the oil firm Rosneft in Moscow. This was what the dossier reported, Steele\u2019s lawyers pointed out. They added that Steele\u2019s memos \u2013 published by BuzzFeed \u2013 were never \u201cmeant to be made public\u201d. The report further quotes Steele as saying his field work was meant to be \u201cbriefed off of orally\u201d rather than consumed as a \u201cwritten product\u201d. Donald Trump has repeatedly blasted Steele on Twitter, describing him as a \u201cfailed spy\u201d and his dossier as \u201cphoney\u201d. The dossier says Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, launched a multi-faceted campaign to boost Trump ahead of the 2016 election. Robert Mueller confirmed \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d Russian interference but did not establish that Trump had engaged in a criminal-level conspiracy.",

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull has called on Scott Morrison to step up his response to catastrophic bushfires fuelled by climate change, declaring that emergency management in Australia needs to be restructured because the threat is now a \u201cnational security issue\u201d. Before a speech to an energy conference on Tuesday where he is expected to lament that climate change has become \u201ca political battlefield\u201d, Turnbull told the ABC on Monday night the Morrison government had to provide hands-on leadership and coordinate a national response to a bushfire emergency, which has claimed six lives and destroyed more than 680 homes, and is expected to intensify in coming days as summer temperatures breach 40C. \u201cWhen Australians\u2019 lives are at risk, when they are being threatened, when their families and their homes and their crops and properties and everything they hold dear is being put at threat \u2013 that\u2019s a national security issue,\u201d Turnbull said on Monday night. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t a national security issue, what is? The national government has to provide leadership. Obviously the federal government can\u2019t do everything but the federal government\u2019s job is to lead and this is an issue that needs leadership.\u201d The former prime minister said the management of bushfires in Australia was traditionally a matter for state and local governments, with the fire events managed by a largely volunteer workforce. While paying tribute to the fire brigades working around the clock to manage the emergency, Turnbull said the current structure was no longer fit for purpose in an environment where global warming fundamentally changed the risk assessments; where the fires would get worse. \u201cWe can\u2019t kid ourselves that we\u2019re not going to face more and hotter fires. That\u2019s the consequence of global warming. \u201cThat is what you get if you have a hotter and drier climate, more fires and hotter fires. So we have to review the measures we\u2019ve got to defend ourselves against fires and upgrade and improve them, because the challenge has changed. You can\u2019t keep on responding in the same way you have in the past.\u201d Turnbull said Australians needed to understand the seriousness of the fires and the consequences of the changed environment. \u201cThese fires can be 1,000C. They will melt everything except steel.\u201d He recounted his experiences visiting the scene of the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria a decade ago. \u201cWe saw cars which had been caught up in the fire which people had been in, and there was nothing left except the steel,\u201d he said. \u201cThe glass had melted and flowed down over the car, over what was left of the dashboard and the floor. \u201cThe aluminium and the wheels had melted and it was left run out on the ground. That is what our firefighters and our communities in rural areas and areas around our cities are facing.\u201d Turnbull said when he was prime minister, and there were truck attacks launched in Europe by terrorists, he had thought it prudent to bring together state leaders, state police, local government and the private sector to develop a crowded places counterterrorism strategy to try to prevent copycat events in this country. He said a similar adaptation was required for disaster management. \u201cWe can\u2019t kid ourselves that we\u2019re not going to face more and hotter fires. That\u2019s the consequence of global warming.\u201d Turnbull continued to argue on Monday night, as he did in a broad-ranging interview with Guardian Australia late last month, that the Coalition struggled with the reality of climate change. He said the government roiled \u201cbecause there is a group within the Liberal party and the National party who deny the reality of climate change\u201d. Asked if Morrison and other ministers had declined until recently to meet with a vocal group of retired fire chiefs because they styled themselves Emergency Leaders for Climate Action, Turnbull said he wasn\u2019t there to \u201crun the ruler over Scott Morrison\u2019s appointments diary\u201d. He said: \u201cWhether you have the meeting or not, the bottom line is you\u2019ve got to address the issue. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all the tools. What the problem is that people are treating, on the right, they are treating what should be a question of physics and science and economics and engineering as though it were an issue of religion and belief. And it\u2019s nuts.\u201d The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, appearing on the same program, echoed Turnbull\u2019s critique. Albanese said he had written to Morrison three weeks ago calling for a national response. \u201cHe wrote back to me saying it wasn\u2019t required, and that everything was in hand, and quite clearly it\u2019s not.\u201d Albanese said greater coordination was needed because wildfires like the ones Australia is now experiencing did not recognise state boundaries. \u201cAt the moment, there is a single fire that is burning from the Hawkesbury right up to Singleton, a single fire. \u201cThis is connected with climate change.

It\u2019s affecting our security.\u201d Labor has called for an urgent Council of Australian Governments meeting to ensure Australia has the water-bombing aircraft, volunteer incentives and other measures necessary for the future but, speaking to the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday, the government\u2019s leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, said the government was already responding as needed. \u201cIf and when additional support is required, then, of course, we would consider that, but right now as we speak, you know, we obviously planned for this bushfire season and we have put significant measures in place and we have put significant measures in place for the future too, to better address, you know, these sort of emergencies into the future,\u201d Cormann said. Turnbull on Tuesday will address an energy conference in Sydney, and is expected to argue that southern Australia will face more heatwaves, fires, floods and droughts in the coming decades, with \u201ca huge impact on our water and food security, ecosystems, transport, health and tourism\u201d. \u201cWe in Australia, more than many if not most countries, are facing the actual lived experience of climate change, and yet the debate, particularly in Australia, is stuck \u2013 with many, particularly on the right of politics and the rightwing political media, refusing to acknowledge the science, instead stubbornly \u2013 and blindly \u2013 holding to their political positions.\u201d",

Subsequent video footage shows that the aide, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, was accidentally hit by an outstreched arm. \u2026 and Mail blamed over false Labour tax claim The Mail on Sunday falsely claimed that Labour was planning to scrap a tax exemption on homeowners, in a prominent story that has since been used by the Conservatives as part of their election campaign. The press regulator Ipso ruled that the newspaper\u2019s reporting was inaccurate and \u201ccould cause significant concern to readers that, under a Labour government, they could be liable to pay a tax they are exempt from under current legislation\u201d. \u2018Dead cat\u2019 flung at BBC Boris Johnson has threatened to take the BBC\u2019s licence fee away. He made the surprise revelation that this policy was under consideration at a Q&amp;A where he was facing hostile questions about his botched TV interview on the Leeds general hospital incident. His comments had all the hallmarks of a famous \u201cdead cat\u201d \u2013 a term Johnson himself first put into the public domain, when he was revealing how the Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby (whose prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Isaac Levido is running the Conservative campaign) uses big media stories to distract attention from events that are getting negative coverage. Meanwhile Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has accused Boris Johnson of breaking his word over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has revealed some of the contents of the first budget that he says Labour will hold on Wednesday 5 February if it wins the election. A Conservative general election candidate shared messages on social media claiming Muslims play the \u201crace card\u201d and have a \u201cnasty culture\u201d, in the latest escalation of concern over Islamophobia in the party.

An imposing figure at 2 metres (6ft 7in), Volcker, who had been suffering from prostate cancer, was notoriously independent both in the way he conducted himself \u2013 smoking cheap cigars and wearing crumpled suits \u2013 and in his views, which often clashed with the short-term considerations of legislators on Capitol Hill.

But the cameraman filmed what he was doing, and Pike revealed it to viewers, and so <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joepike/status/1204018593656180736\">the clip</a> when viewed in its entirety is much more damaging to Johnson than the usual \u201cpolitician dodges tricky question\u201d footage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee50298f0820fa95dad0e6#block-5dee50298f0820fa95dad0e6\">Labour has been saying that it is evidence that Johnson \u201ccould not care less\u201d. </a>Pike\u2019s clip has now attracted 3.7m viewers. One of the features of this election is that it has seen broadcast journalists increasingly using short interviews to record combative clips that go viral on social media. Granada\u2019s <strong>Hannah Miller </strong>achieved <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hannahITV/status/1203336121368928257\">the same thing at the weekend</a>, confronting Johnson with challenging questions about cuts to children\u2019s services. Lord Reith would probably not approve, but given that Johnson is avoiding a lot of long-form media scrutiny during this campaign, like the Andrew Neil interview, it is not surprising that some of the reporters who do get the chance to ask him questions are going for him robustly. Viewers probably want to see politicians quizzed like this. This definitely counts as a bad day for Johnson, but in trying to assess how much difference it might make, it is important to keep things as perspective. It is not as bad as when Gordon Brown called a woman a bigot in the 2010 campaign for raising concerns about immigration, and post-election analysis subsequently concluded that bigot-gate had no effect on the result at all. Labour even won the constituency where the voter was insulted.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1204100056762265600\">ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has blamed \u201csenior Tories\u201d for telling him and other journalists that a special adviser to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had been assaulted by anti-Tory protesters outside Leeds general hospital.</a> </strong>Subsequently video footage shows that the aide, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee86518f08be0cbf46d26d#block-5dee86518f08be0cbf46d26d\">accidentally hit by an outstreched arm.</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1204100056762265600\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It is completely clear from video footage that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MattHancock</a>'s adviser was not whacked by a protestor, as I was told by senior Tories, but that he inadvertently walked into a protestor's hand.

The subsequent UK-EU trade deal will be another matter entirely, and the only template for that is <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/revised_political_declaration.pdf\">the 27-page political declaration (pdf).</a> But increasingly Tories have been arguing that this deal is close to conclusion too (even though it is not) and Johnson was giving the same impression at the Q&amp;A. In response to questions about whether manufacturing companies in the north-east would be safe after Brexit, Johnson said:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The great thing about the deal that we have ready to go is that it protects businesses, it protects supply chains, it means we leave the EU with our relationships absolutely intact, so that we have a zero-tariff, zero-quota relationship with the EU as we come out. We protect our supply chains ....</p> \n   <p>The thing about the deal we\u2019ve got ... it makes sure we have complete equivalence when it comes to our standards, our industrial requirements and the rest of it. So, as we come out, it\u2019s all protected from the point of view of big, motor manufacturing investors in our country ...</p> \n   <p>We have a decent deal ... What it also does is it keeps us in a state of grace, a state of equivalence with our European Union friends and partners.

This may be what Johnson was referring to when he spoke about the UK staying in a \u201cstate of equivalence\u201d. But Johnson also seemed to be implying that this would be a long-term goal. As explained earlier (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee29888f08e7796de8f511#block-5dee29888f08e7796de8f511\">11.10am)</a>, an eventual trade deal that fully protects supply chains might be possible \u2013 but only if Johnson were to abandon what he has said in the past about wanting a Brexit that would allow the UK to diverge from EU regulation.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson refused to give details of the pledge that all Tory candidates have given him saying they will support his Brexit deal.</strong> Asked for how long they would be bound by this pledge, he just said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They have pledged to me personally to support the deal we have done.

Joseph, 65, terminal cancer patient, Northern Ireland</em></p> \n  <p>Given the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution, this is partly down to convention. However, as the existing prime minister, Boris Johnson would have the first go at forming a government. If he could not command a majority, according to the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/60641/cabinet-manual.pdf\">cabinet manual</a>, the Whitehall bible for government operations, the Queen would then call the leader \u201cwho appears most likely to be able to command the confidence of the house\u201d.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: If there is the possibility of a hung parliament with Labour, which party would they most likely go into a coalition with and why? Angel, digital marketing apprentice, Milton Keynes</em></p> \n  <p>While the polls suggest a Conservative majority, it remains possible that the Tories would fail to achieve this, which could bring a minority Labour government, backed by other parties. Rather than a formal coalition, some sort of confidence-and-supply or even case-by-case arrangement seems more likely. Parties are understandably wary of speculating before an election about how this would work, and it would need complex negotiations. As to who: Labour could potentially expect support from the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens. But there are many complications, for example the SNP\u2019s demand for a new independence referendum, and Jo Swinson\u2019s insistence that the Lib Dems could not help put Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. In short: a lot would remain to be seen.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: The PM keeps saying that we have a great economy, but do we? No one is pulling him up on it. Bill Muskett, 66, retired, Cheshire</em></p> \n  <p>You can argue all day about the strength or otherwise of the economy, depending on whether you cite, say, employment figures or data on in-work poverty. But you\u2019re right on one key point: Boris Johnson has managed to get through almost all the election with remarkably little scrutiny of nearly 10 years of Tory rule, in part due to his fairly ludicrous claim to be \u201ca new administration\u201d. It\u2019s partly a media failure, partly a factor of the endless focus on Brexit.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:45:31.010Z\">at 1.45pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee496d8f0820fa95dad092\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterwalker\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:26:52.963Z\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Just under five minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the general election.

Do you have any hope for the future? If so, what is it? Rob Perry, Norwich</em></p> \n  <p>It has, in truth, been a pretty depressing election so far. If I am to look at the positives for the future, politics is extremely changeable at the moment, and party fortunes could rise and fall very quickly. One factor could be pushes for electoral reform \u2013 the more the first-past-the-post system creates anomalies (such as Ukip winning nearly 13% of the vote in 2015 and getting precisely one seat), the more pressure there will be for a proportional system. If that happened, people could forget tactical voting and just pick the party whose politics they like the most. This could arguably create a more consensual type of politics.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will a Labour defeat end Corbyn\u2019s career? Peter, retired, North Yorkshire</em></p> \n  <p>As someone who got (mildly) booed by a Labour crowd the other week for asking Corbyn if he would retire if he lost another election, it\u2019s fair to say some activists would like him to stay on. But it does seem likely he would step down as leader (if not as an MP). The struggle in Labour is already half-ongoing for who could succeed him, and whether it would be a keeper of the Corbyn flame, such as Rebecca Long-Bailey, or someone from a different section of Labour.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: In the event of a Labour win and a second referendum, which way would Boris Johnson vote? Chris, 47, author and business owner, Warrington</em></p> \n  <p>That answer, officially, would be between him and the ballot box. But as someone who has, after some wavering, tied his political colours so tightly to the mast of Brexit, he would presumably be expected to argue very strongly for leave \u2013 unless he really disliked Labour\u2019s Brexit plan and, for example, called for a boycott of the referendum.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:31:18.828Z\">at 1.31pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee492e8f0820fa95dad08e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rowena-mason\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:22:12.535Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson </strong>chartered a plane this morning for part of his campaign dash across the UK - from Doncaster to Teesside (even though it would only be a few hours by road).</p> \n  <p>The plane had an unmistakeable odour after the prime minister, his aides and the travelling press pack had spent time in a fish market in Grimsby this morning.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was not commenting in the morning <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5be23ba-19d0-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4\">on the leaked paper casting doubt on the viability of his Brexit plan</a>.

You can share your questions with us via our form <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/ask_us_a_question_general_election\">here</a>.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What is your view from the inside of how the areas of the media that have been attempting balance during this campaign have handled it? Is the scrutiny being felt within the media, and what effect is it having? Josh Rodell, 27, engineer, London</em></p> \n  <p>The social media world is not necessarily more fractious than past eras, but it does make it easier for people to express their annoyance. As such, more or less everywhere you turn there have been criticisms of the media \u2013 notably the BBC \u2013 for supposed bias. My own, completely personal, view is that (within the basic paradigm of a fundamentally small-c conservative viewpoint) the BBC tries extremely hard to be balanced and generally does a decent job, despite occasional cock-ups. What is mentioned less is the naked partisanship of many newspapers, a tone which is ramped up all the more at elections.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Why is Jeremy Corbyn so unpopular with non-Labour voters? Is it more his personality or specific policies? George G, 62, fascinated with UK politics, Virginia, US</em></p> \n  <p>You could come up with all sorts of answers to this. Focus groups identify both, and it does seem that hostile voters can identify Corbyn in a somewhat contradictory way as being both too radical and too indecisive. It is, however, worth always seeing these opinions in the context of the treatment of Corbyn by the majority of the print media, which is consistently hostile to him. Yes, many people get their news elsewhere, but the repeatedly negative front-page headlines about Corbyn arguably set a wider tone. This is not to say that there are not valid criticisms of the Labour leader, but the context is important, too.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Why is it not illegal to openly lie and mislead the electorate? Dave, West Midlands</em></p> \n  <p>I suppose the short answer is that a law on this would be hugely difficult to enforce, not least to prove lying involves showing intent as well as inaccuracy, and it would be a very subjective and controversial process. But would I like more public condemnation and shame for politicians who openly say things that they, and we, know are not true? Yes, I would.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:34:54.427Z\">at 1.34pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee3a4b8f0820fa95dacf90\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:14:34.578Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">John McDonnell's speech and Q&amp;A - Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the main points from <strong>John McDonnell</strong>\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A.

To establish free personal social care and childcare, to bring forward urgent homeless support, and inject much needed resources into our council services, with a full comprehensive spending review to follow later in 2020 to allocate resources for the full five years.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he would set up its new Treasury national transformation unit before Christmas if Labour won. </strong>(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee2d238f08e7796de8f542#block-5dee2d238f08e7796de8f542\">11.19am.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Labour would use people\u2019s assemblies to give people a say in how nationalised utilities were run.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee2dd38f08eef228680117#block-5dee2dd38f08eef228680117\">11.21am.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Labour\u2019s enemies were \u201cpeople who hate the people of this country\u201d.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee2ec98f08eef22868011d#block-5dee2ec98f08eef22868011d\">11.28am.)</a> He referred to \u201cthose at the top\u201d, but he did not make it clear whether he was talking about Conservative politicians, or the financial elite, or the media - or all three - although he did implicate Boris Johnson, referring to contemptuous comments by the PM about the working class in some of his old newspaper articles.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He denied being worried about the pound crashing in the event of a Labour victory, and instead said he thought it could go up in value.</strong> When it put to him that in the past he said a Labour victory could lead to a run on the pound, he claimed he had said the opposite. Labour had been advised that there would not be a run on the pound, he said. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My fear is the pound will start going up because of our investment plans.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He did not rule out trying to break up the giant tech companies.</strong> Asked if he was attracted by the idea, which is also favoured by Elizabeth Warren, one of the frontrunners to be the Democratic presidential candidate in the US in 2020, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s about breaking them up or whether it\u2019s about proper regulation. That will be the debate and the discussion that we will be having. But there are clearly issues of accountability and there are clearly issues about the fair treatment of them as a sector, as against other sectors.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Given that the major tech giants are all American, a British government would probably have very little say over this anyway.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to rule out <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/08/jeremy-corbyn-poised-hand-john-mcdonnell-loses-election-11410779/\">a Sunday Times report </a>saying he might take over as interim Labour leader in the event of the party losing the election. </strong>Asked about the story, he just insisted it was not a valid question because Labour would win.

I think that\u2019s happening in a number of countries.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed that pundits would be surprised by the election result. </strong>People wanted real change, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think what you\u2019ll see is, despite what\u2019s happening in the opinion polls, although the opinion polls have consistently being trending towards us, I think you\u2019ll see, as some of you were shocked in the 2017 general election, I think you\u2019ll be even more shocked this time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77cfd83bdffd11f9b19c109413ad82b64ca0cdf9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77cfd83bdffd11f9b19c109413ad82b64ca0cdf9/0_70_4248_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee41668f08951c7479d10b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterwalker\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T12:52:18.494Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: A good friend says she won\u2019t vote because, although she is anti-Conservative, she would feel a hypocrite for voting Green, and Labour are too leftwing for her and she doesn\u2019t believe they can afford their manifesto pledges. How can I persuade her? Vicki, Cumbria</em></p> \n  <p>You could make the argument \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/02/hugh-grant-i-want-to-do-my-bit-to-prevent-a-national-catastrophe\">has Hugh Grant</a>, among many others \u2013 that your friend could vote tactically in whatever constituency she lives in so as to have the most chance of preventing a Conservative MP and thus limiting or stopping Boris Johnson\u2019s majority. The Lib Dems would probably argue that if she doesn\u2019t like the Tories, and the Greens and Labour are too leftwing, she could give them a try.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: How can we trust any of the promises made by the leaders of the main parties? There is Johnson and Corbyn promising everything, but the kitchen. Kim, 55, Manchester</em></p> \n  <p>This is an interesting area. Politicians promising the moon on a stick in elections is hardly a new phenomenon, but this campaign has seen an arguable increase in voter scepticism about many of these pledges. Sometimes the reason for the scepticism is obvious. For example, Boris Johnson has pledged to \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, when the UK is merely part-way through a long and tricky departure process. Similarly, Jo Swinson\u2019s initial claim that she could become PM wasn\u2019t especially convincing. I suppose the best answer would be the slightly boring one: read parties\u2019 manifestos and see what seems feasible/appealing to you.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee3ec78f08be0cbf46cf03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterwalker\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T12:42:42.244Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some of your questions so far have been about what happens if a leader of a winning party loses their seat, and about checks for goods crossing the Irish Sea:</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What happens if the leader of the winning party loses their seat as an MP? Marina Nea, housewife, Essex</em></p> \n  <p>If they lose their seat there is no law prevening them from being prime minister \u2013 Alec Douglas-Home was briefly in No 10 before becoming MP. But it would be very hard to do. If Boris Johnson won the election and lost his seat he would either need to be made a peer (you can be PM from the Lords, but in this Commons-centric era it would be pretty tough) or a loyal MP with a safe seat could resign, triggering a byelection. The latter would seem by far the most likely outcome.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Can we please have a definitive answer on whether or not there will be checks and paperwork needed for goods crossing the Irish Sea, over and above current ones, before the election please. John Davidson, 77, retired, Liverpool</em></p> \n  <p>The definitive answer seems to be: yes to \u201cchecks\u201d of some sort, though what these will be is up for debate and depends on the future Brexit deal.

Is there any special site focusing on the close seats interesting in the case of tactical voting?

This is a debate about people and their lives. This is a debate about people who are facing extreme prejudice and discrimination. It takes us back to a very similar situation to where we were on gay rights decades ago, when people were being told that they were somehow as a person wrong for being who they were. And the vitriol that was heaped on them by society drove people to huge mental crises, in many cases to misery and sometimes to suicide. We see that amongst non-binary and trans people today and I think we should be making sure that every individual is protected.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On the issue of women-only spaces, Swinson said the priority was to keep people safe. But she said processes were already in place to address this. She went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I do think it is important that people are protected. And I don\u2019t think there should be some kind of hierarchy of equality, because trans women are some of the most vulnerable women in our society facing huge discrimination. And all women who have been on the receiving end of violence deserve to have safe spaces, whether they are gay, straight, bi, whether they are trans, whether they are cis, whatever their race is, whatever their background they come from. And they need to be protected on that individual basis.</p> \n   <p>And I have to say, we are talking about a very small part of the population. And implicit in this is an assumption that trans women are in some way more likely to be violent. And it is just not borne out.

But all of the goods would have to be checked, and that would be the default position.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said Johnson\u2019s plan would contravene the Act of Union. </strong>She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That, of course, is very concerning for us, because it goes very much to the heart of the Act of Union.

And if we are to have what has been proposed, then it wouldn\u2019t be free-flowing trade. And that of course causes us great concern. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said Johnson\u2019s plan could lead to shoppers in Northern Ireland not being able to buy goods on sale in Britain, or having to pay a higher price for them.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Most of our goods, particularly in the retail sector, come from Great Britain, and therefore any checks on those goods would lead to higher costs, perhaps even less choice, for people here in Northern Ireland, and that is completely unacceptable. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1125b5aececeb3d382761f728870848e37af6aef\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1125b5aececeb3d382761f728870848e37af6aef/0_106_5448_3268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arlene Foster, the DUP leader.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arlene Foster, the DUP leader.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T10:33:54.321Z\">at 10.33am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee06dc8f08e7796de8f3f1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T08:34:42.546Z\">8.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: The Guardian says voters are confused by your plans for an Australian-style points system.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson made one of his worst campaign trail errors today when he repeatedly tried to avoid having to confront emotive evidence of a young boy not getting proper treatment at an NHS hospital. He was giving a stand-up interview to ITV\u2019s Joe Pike, and Pike tried to get him to comment on a picture of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr having to sleep on the floor in Leeds general hospital, where he was being treated for suspected pneumonia, because there were no beds available. The picture makes today\u2019s Daily Mirror splash. Johnson repeatedly refused to comment on the picture, which Pike had on his phone, and kept making general points about the NHS. It is not unusual for politicians to avoid difficult topics in interviews, but as he was speaking Johnson took Pike\u2019s camera, and placed it in his pocket (apparently to stop Pike asking further questions about it), thinking that his ploy would be out of shot. But the cameraman filmed what he was doing, and Pike revealed it to viewers, and so the clip when viewed in its entirety is much more damaging to Johnson than the usual \u201cpolitician dodges tricky question\u201d footage. Labour has been saying that it is evidence that Johnson \u201ccould not care less\u201d. Pike\u2019s clip has now attracted 3.7m viewers. One of the features of this election is that it has seen broadcast journalists increasingly using short interviews to record combative clips that go viral on social media. Granada\u2019s Hannah Miller achieved the same thing at the weekend, confronting Johnson with challenging questions about cuts to children\u2019s services. Lord Reith would probably not approve, but given that Johnson is avoiding a lot of long-form media scrutiny during this campaign, like the Andrew Neil interview, it is not surprising that some of the reporters who do get the chance to ask him questions are going for him robustly. Viewers probably want to see politicians quizzed like this. This definitely counts as a bad day for Johnson, but in trying to assess how much difference it might make, it is important to keep things as perspective. It is not as bad as when Gordon Brown called a woman a bigot in the 2010 campaign for raising concerns about immigration, and post-election analysis subsequently concluded that bigot-gate had no effect on the result at all. Labour even won the constituency where the voter was insulted. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has blamed \u201csenior Tories\u201d for telling him and other journalists that a special adviser to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had been assaulted by anti-Tory protesters outside Leeds general hospital. Subsequently video footage shows that the aide, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, was accidentally hit by an outstreched arm. Boris Johnson has threatened to take the BBC\u2019s licence fee away as a source of funding. He made the surprise revelation that this policy was under consideration at a Q&amp;A where he was facing hostile questions about his botched TV interview about the Leeds general hospital incident. His comments had all the hallmarks of a famous \u201cdead cat\u201d \u2013 a term that Johnson himself first put into the public domain, when he was revealing how the Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby (whose prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Isaac Levido is running the Conservative campaign) uses big media stories to distract attention from events that are getting negative coverage. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has accused Boris Johnson of breaking his word over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has revealed some of the contents of the first budget that he says Labour will hold on Wednesday 5 February if it wins the election. A Conservative general election candidate shared messages on social media claiming Muslims play the \u201crace card\u201d and have a \u201cnasty culture\u201d, in the latest escalation of concern over Islamophobia in the party. The Mail on Sunday falsely claimed that Labour was planning to scrap a tax exemption on homeowners, in a prominent story that has since been used by the Conservatives as part of their election campaign. As my colleague Jim Waterson reports, the press regulator Ipso ruled that the newspaper\u2019s reporting was inaccurate and \u201ccould cause significant concern to readers that, under a Labour government, they could be liable to pay a tax they are exempt from under current legislation.\u201d That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has posted this video clip of an incident involving Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, a special adviser to Matt Hancock, outside Leeds general hospital. If this is the only incident of physical contact, it does not really amount to him being hit, which is the allegation that was being made earlier and given to journalists. To say that he was hit would normally imply some intent. This video shows him being hit by accident. The Conservatives are on course to make significant gains in Wales, according to a YouGov poll. Labour is on 40%, only just ahead of the Tories (37%) and Plaid Cymru is in third place on 10%. Roger Awan-Scully, head of politics at Cardiff University, projected that if the figures are accurate this could leave Labour with 20 seats in Wales (down from 28 in 2017). The Conservatives could win 16 (10 more than in 2017) Awan-Scully said this would be the lowest Labour seat number in Wales since 1983 (when there were 38 rather than 40). Forty per cent of people said they believed Boris Johnson would be a good prime minister, while 33% said Jeremy Corbyn would do a good job in No 10. The poll was carried out for ITV Wales and Cardiff University. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been visiting Leeds General Infirmary, in an attempt to defuse the row generated by four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr having to sleep on the floor there when being treated, and Boris Johnson\u2019s reaction to it. He told BBC News that he was \u201chorrified\u201d by what happened. As a parent of young children who has had to visit A&amp;E with them, he said he could understand how the parents felt. Asked what he would say to them, he replied: It\u2019s not good enough, and I\u2019ve apologised. But Hancock said Jack\u2019s parents were not blaming the staff. And he said the hospital accepted it had a problem, and that it was taking steps to deal with it. He also said the government was putting in investment to address exactly this sort of problem. Asked why he had come in person, he said he wanted to get reassurance that the trust was doing everything it could. He said he had been impressed by their response, and by the work of the staff. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s Q&amp;A earlier. Boris Johnson said the Conservatives were considering abolishing the TV licence. Here is ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on the consequences of this. It is also worth pointing out that Johnson seemed keen to set this running as a story because he was also facing strong criticism over another story with the potential to hog the headlines ... Johnson sidestepped questions about whether his attempt to avoid having to look at a picture of a boy being forced to sleep on a hospital floor in a TV interview showed that he did not care about problems facing NHS patients. (See 3.19pm.) He claimed that manufacturing firms reliant on EU supply chains would not lose out under his plan for Brexit. Throughout the whole campaign he has been arguing that he has a Brexit deal ready to go, referring to the withdrawal agreement. The subsequent UK-EU trade deal will be another matter entirely, and the only template for that is the 27-page political declaration (pdf). But increasingly Tories have been arguing that this deal is close to conclusion too (even though it is not) and Johnson was giving the same impression at the Q&amp;A. In response to questions about whether manufacturing companies in the north-east would be safe after Brexit, Johnson said: The great thing about the deal that we have ready to go is that it protects businesses, it protects supply chains, it means we leave the EU with our relationships absolutely intact, so that we have a zero-tariff, zero-quota relationship with the EU as we come out. We protect our supply chains .... The thing about the deal we\u2019ve got ... it makes sure we have complete equivalence when it comes to our standards, our industrial requirements and the rest of it. So, as we come out, it\u2019s all protected from the point of view of big, motor manufacturing investors in our country ... We have a decent deal ... What it also does is it keeps us in a state of grace, a state of equivalence with our European Union friends and partners. So the zero-tariff, zero-quota arrangements that we have, the just-in-time supply chains, they remain absolutely there, perfect and intact. Under Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement, Britain would be in a transition period until the end of 2020, during which current trade arrangements would continue to apply. This may be what Johnson was referring to when he spoke about the UK staying in a \u201cstate of equivalence\u201d. But Johnson also seemed to be implying that this would be a long-term goal. As explained earlier (see 11.10am), an eventual trade deal that fully protects supply chains might be possible \u2013 but only if Johnson were to abandon what he has said in the past about wanting a Brexit that would allow the UK to diverge from EU regulation. Johnson refused to give details of the pledge that all Tory candidates have given him saying they will support his Brexit deal. Asked for how long they would be bound by this pledge, he just said: They have pledged to me personally to support the deal we have done. I cannot envisage any circumstances in which they fail to do that. We haven\u2019t lobotomised them, they\u2019ve done it of their own free will, they believe in this deal, they see it\u2019s the best way forward for our country and I think they will be crazy if they didn\u2019t see it was the best way forward. He claimed not to know why the Conservative party had paid Google to ensure that, when people searched for Labour\u2019s manifesto, a Tory website criticising it appeared ahead of it in search results. According to BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham, the Tory proposal to abolish the licence fee isn\u2019t just something dreamed up this afternoon to distract attention from the row about Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the story about a boy having to sleep on a hospital floor. Wickham says No 10 aides have been looking at this for weeks. That doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that Johnson\u2019s decision to talk about it today wasn\u2019t a distraction exercise (or a \u201cdead cat\u201d, to use Lynton Croby\u2019s terminology). It certainly looked as if Johnson was talking this up (ignoring his own advice not to announce policy \u201con the hoof\u201d) to get reporters off the hospital story. And this is what Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary and outgoing Labour deputy leader, said about Boris Johnson\u2019s comment about considering abolishing the licence fee (See 2.37pm.). Watson said: This is a pathetic attempt by Boris Johnson to distract from his refusal to even look at the picture of a four-year-old boy forced to sleep on a hospital floor. We already know that Boris Johnson is a danger to our NHS. His comments today reveal that he will threaten the very existence of another of Britain\u2019s great institutions, the BBC, by scrapping its funding mechanism. This is on top of the cruel decision to strip over-75s of their free TV licences. And here is Jeremy Corbyn commenting on the photograph that Boris Johnson did not want to talk about. Jeremy Corbyn has refused to say whether he would resign as Labour leader if Boris Johnson won the election. When he was asked this, he replied: We put forward a positive manifesto with a fully costed programme and I am taking that message out all over the country. That message is getting home to people. They realise this Thursday is a straight choice: do you want to carry on with austerity and underfunding of public services or do you want a Labour government that will tax fairly to fund properly. ICM has a new poll out. It suggests the Conservatives have a lead of just six points, which would put the UK in hung parliament territory, although, of course, it is not in line with most other polling, which points to Boris Johnson having a much bigger lead. In his Q&amp;A in Sunderland Boris Johnson was twice asked about his attempt to avoid having to look at a picture of a boy being forced to sleep on a hospital floor in a TV interview. The first question came from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, who asked if that incident said something about whether the Tories understood the real concerns of people living in the north of England. Johnson gave a general answer, without saying anything specific about his earlier interview with ITV\u2019s Joe Pike. (See 1.36pm.) Johnson said: I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019re doing to rebuild Leeds general infirmary and it\u2019s one of the hospitals we will rebuild from the beginning, it\u2019ll be a fantastic project. Then ITV\u2019s Paul Brand tried again. He said: One of your biggest challenges in this election is to persuade people that you really do care, that you really are trustworthy. And yet today when you\u2019re shown that picture of the four-year-old boy on the floor of an A&amp;E department you take the phone away and put it in your pocket, what does that say about how much you really care? Johnson said he had already addressed this. He went on: We are not only investing in children\u2019s services in Leeds but we\u2019re also rebuilding the whole Leeds infirmary from top to bottom. And we can do that because we\u2019re now putting the biggest ever investment into the NHS. What I don\u2019t want to see is a fantastic programme that is going to unite and level up our country being blocked again. In the original interview, when Pike did eventually get Johnson to look at the picture of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr sleeping on a hospital floor, Johnson said: It\u2019s a terrible, terrible photo. And I apologise obviously to the families and all those who have terrible experiences in the NHS. But what we are doing is supporting the NHS, and on the whole I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making huge investments into the NHS, and we can only do it if we get parliament going, if we unblock the current deadlock, and we move forward. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking at a rally in Bristol. He is holding up the Daily Mirror splash, which features the story about four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr having to sleep on a hospital floor. He says the Tories have had nine years to invest properly in the NHS. [Boris Johnson has] had nine years to properly fund the NHS. A child being treated on the floor is a disgrace to our society. It\u2019s a child with pneumonia on the floor of a hospital in modern Britain. This is a disgrace. They need to invest in our public services. He also says Labour would not allow the NHS to be sold off to the Americans. He says the US wants to enter the British healthcare market. But healthcare stopped being a market when the NHS was set up by Labour in the 1940s, he says. This is what Boris Johnson said about considering scrapping the TV licence. He was responding to a question about what he would not abolish all TV licences. At this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV licences, though I am certainly looking at it. What I will say is that \u2013 I\u2019m under pressure not to extemporise policy on the hoof. But you have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a media organisation still make sense in the long term, given the way other organisations manage to fund themselves. That\u2019s all I will say. I think the system of funding out of what is effectively a general tax \u2013 everybody has a TV \u2013 bears reflection, let me put it that way. How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels? That is the question. Abolishing the TV licence would have huge implications for the BBC, which relies on the TV licence for its funding. Johnson said that he did not want to make up policy on the hoof, but it did sound as if he was deliberating floating this as an idea \u2013 knowing that it would get picked up enthusiastically by the media (journalists are particularly interested in stories about how media organisations get their money \u2013 because he is also facing a lot of negative coverage over his attempt to avoid having to confront a picture of a boy being forced to sleep on a hospital floor in a TV interview. (See 1.36pm.) He did get tough questions about this at the Q&amp;A too. I will post a full summary soon. Boris Johnson said he is \u2018looking at\u2019 scrapping the BBC licence fee. Responding to a question about why he would not abolish all TV licences, Boris Johnson said: \u2018At this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV licences, though I am certainly looking at it. \u2018I think the system of funding out of what is effectively a general tax \u2013 everybody has a TV \u2013 bears reflection, let me put it that way. How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels? That is the question.\u2019 Q: Have you done enough to persuade people who voted Labour in the past to trust you? Johnson says: \u201cHow am I supposed to know? I\u2019m doing my best.\u201d He says Labour would be disastrous for the UK. Q: You are trying to show people you care. But when a reporter shows you a distressing image, you put the phone in your pocket. What does that say about about whether you care? Johnson says he has addressed this already. He wants more investment in the NHS. Q: What will people think of the fact that you could not even look at a picture of a four-year-old boy having to sleep on a hospital floor? Johnson says his government is putting more money into the NHS, and recruiting more nurses. He says you can only do that with a strong economy, and if you get Brexit done. That is why he hopes people will vote for a one nation Conservative government. Q: Services in Sunderland have been slashed. How can anyone trust your party on public services? Johnson says \u201cthis new, one nation government\u201d is determined to put more money into public services. He says he wants to lift national insurance, that would give everyone a \u00a3500 tax cut. (That would only happen if the national insurance threshold were raised to \u00a312,500 - which is only a long-term aspiration, and not something the Tories are committed to doing in the next parliament. The actual value of the national insurance cut proposed by the Tories is about \u00a385.) Q: Nissan has said it will leave if you do not get a decent Brexit deal. Johnson says he has a decent deal. The UK will be able to leave on 31 January. But it keeps the UK in a state of grace, a state of equivalence, with the EU. Q: It took five years to get a Canada deal. Johnson says the UK will leave in a state of equivalence. Johnson is now taking questions from journalists. Q: Why have you chosen Conservative candidates in Sunderland who are not from the area? Johnson says he thinks his candidates will do a fantastic job. Tony Blair did not have deep roots in Sedgefield, he said. Q: Why don\u2019t you abolish TV licences for everyone? Johnson says he won\u2019t make an unfunded promise at this stage of the campaign. But he thinks the BBC should cough up and pay for TV licences for all over-75s. He says you have to ask whether that system of funding still makes sense in the modern era. This is something he will look at, he says He says he won\u2019t go further than that now. Johnson questions long-term viability of the TV licence as a means of funding the BBC. Q: Would you fund the air ambulance? Johnson says this is an incredible organisation. He is surprised how little the government contributes to it. It can save lives. Johnson says the deal he has \u201cready to go\u201d will protect supply chains. It will involve complete equivalence, protecting supply chains. Johnson is now taking questions from employees. Q: Will it profit us, leaving the EU? Yes, says Johnson. He says he thinks there is investment worth $150bn dollars ready to come into the UK when Brexit happens. And he says the UK will be able to protect its supply chains because of the Brexit he will negotiate. Boris Johnson is doing a Q&amp;A at a factory in Sunderland. He is starting his with standard stump speech. Yesterday, in an interview with Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Boris Johnson complained about EU migrants being able to treat the UK as if it were \u201cpart of their own country\u201d. He said: I\u2019ve said that what we want to do is bear down on migration, particularly of unskilled workers who have no job to come to and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happened over the last couple of decades or more. You\u2019ve seen quite a large number of people coming in from the whole of the EU \u2013 580m population \u2013 able to treat the UK as though it\u2019s basically part of their own country and the problem with that is there has been no control at all and I don\u2019t think that is democratically accountable. This morning Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, described his attitude as \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cdog-whistle politics\u201d. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, claims that Boris Johnson\u2019s behaviour in his interview with ITV\u2019s Joe Pike (see 1.36pm) claims he \u201ccould not care less\u201d about how the boy was being treated in hospital. Ashworth said: Refusing to even look at an image of a child suffering because of Conservative cuts to the NHS is a new low for Boris Johnson. It\u2019s clear he could not care less. Don\u2019t give this disgrace of a man five more years of driving our NHS into the ground. Sick toddlers like Jack deserve so much better. Here is ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston on Boris Johnson trying to avoid having to look at a picture of a boy having to sleep on the floor in a hospital. (See 1.36pm.) Thanks for all your questions Our political team will answer more of your questions about the election on Wednesday at 12.30pm. You can ask your question via our form here. This is from ITV\u2019s Joe Pike, who tried to get Boris Johnson to look at the photograph of a four-year-old boy with suspected pneumonia having to sleep on the floor in a hospital because of a shortage of beds. Johnson at first refused to look at the photograph on Pike\u2019s phone until Pike effectively shamed him into doing so by revealing to viewers that Johnson had put the phone in his pocket. At that point Johnson said it was a \u201cterrible, terrible photo\u201d, and repeated the apology he had made earlier. (See 8.28am.) Q: In the event of no party having an overall majority on Friday, does the Queen decide who she will invite to form a coalition government or is it always the last PM given first stab at it? Joseph, 65, terminal cancer patient, Northern Ireland Given the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution, this is partly down to convention. However, as the existing prime minister, Boris Johnson would have the first go at forming a government. If he could not command a majority, according to the cabinet manual, the Whitehall bible for government operations, the Queen would then call the leader \u201cwho appears most likely to be able to command the confidence of the house\u201d. Q: If there is the possibility of a hung parliament with Labour, which party would they most likely go into a coalition with and why? Angel, digital marketing apprentice, Milton Keynes While the polls suggest a Conservative majority, it remains possible that the Tories would fail to achieve this, which could bring a minority Labour government, backed by other parties. Rather than a formal coalition, some sort of confidence-and-supply or even case-by-case arrangement seems more likely. Parties are understandably wary of speculating before an election about how this would work, and it would need complex negotiations. As to who: Labour could potentially expect support from the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens. But there are many complications, for example the SNP\u2019s demand for a new independence referendum, and Jo Swinson\u2019s insistence that the Lib Dems could not help put Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. In short: a lot would remain to be seen. Q: The PM keeps saying that we have a great economy, but do we? No one is pulling him up on it. Bill Muskett, 66, retired, Cheshire You can argue all day about the strength or otherwise of the economy, depending on whether you cite, say, employment figures or data on in-work poverty. But you\u2019re right on one key point: Boris Johnson has managed to get through almost all the election with remarkably little scrutiny of nearly 10 years of Tory rule, in part due to his fairly ludicrous claim to be \u201ca new administration\u201d. It\u2019s partly a media failure, partly a factor of the endless focus on Brexit. Just under five minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the general election. Send them in to us here. Q: I\u2019ve never been more depressed about the state of the political system. Do you have any hope for the future? If so, what is it? Rob Perry, Norwich It has, in truth, been a pretty depressing election so far. If I am to look at the positives for the future, politics is extremely changeable at the moment, and party fortunes could rise and fall very quickly. One factor could be pushes for electoral reform \u2013 the more the first-past-the-post system creates anomalies (such as Ukip winning nearly 13% of the vote in 2015 and getting precisely one seat), the more pressure there will be for a proportional system. If that happened, people could forget tactical voting and just pick the party whose politics they like the most. This could arguably create a more consensual type of politics. Q: Will a Labour defeat end Corbyn\u2019s career? Peter, retired, North Yorkshire As someone who got (mildly) booed by a Labour crowd the other week for asking Corbyn if he would retire if he lost another election, it\u2019s fair to say some activists would like him to stay on. But it does seem likely he would step down as leader (if not as an MP). The struggle in Labour is already half-ongoing for who could succeed him, and whether it would be a keeper of the Corbyn flame, such as Rebecca Long-Bailey, or someone from a different section of Labour. Q: In the event of a Labour win and a second referendum, which way would Boris Johnson vote? Chris, 47, author and business owner, Warrington That answer, officially, would be between him and the ballot box. But as someone who has, after some wavering, tied his political colours so tightly to the mast of Brexit, he would presumably be expected to argue very strongly for leave \u2013 unless he really disliked Labour\u2019s Brexit plan and, for example, called for a boycott of the referendum. Boris Johnson chartered a plane this morning for part of his campaign dash across the UK - from Doncaster to Teesside (even though it would only be a few hours by road). The plane had an unmistakeable odour after the prime minister, his aides and the travelling press pack had spent time in a fish market in Grimsby this morning. Johnson was not commenting in the morning on the leaked paper casting doubt on the viability of his Brexit plan. His aides have been briefing against it though, with a Conservative spokesman saying: Our new deal with the EU takes the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, out of the EU. A Conservative majority government will implement this deal and agree a trade agreement next year. In doing so we will strengthen our union, and we will not extend the implementation period beyond December 2020. You have been sending in your questions about the general election which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: What is your view from the inside of how the areas of the media that have been attempting balance during this campaign have handled it? Is the scrutiny being felt within the media, and what effect is it having? Josh Rodell, 27, engineer, London The social media world is not necessarily more fractious than past eras, but it does make it easier for people to express their annoyance. As such, more or less everywhere you turn there have been criticisms of the media \u2013 notably the BBC \u2013 for supposed bias. My own, completely personal, view is that (within the basic paradigm of a fundamentally small-c conservative viewpoint) the BBC tries extremely hard to be balanced and generally does a decent job, despite occasional cock-ups. What is mentioned less is the naked partisanship of many newspapers, a tone which is ramped up all the more at elections. Q: Why is Jeremy Corbyn so unpopular with non-Labour voters? Is it more his personality or specific policies? George G, 62, fascinated with UK politics, Virginia, US You could come up with all sorts of answers to this. Focus groups identify both, and it does seem that hostile voters can identify Corbyn in a somewhat contradictory way as being both too radical and too indecisive. It is, however, worth always seeing these opinions in the context of the treatment of Corbyn by the majority of the print media, which is consistently hostile to him. Yes, many people get their news elsewhere, but the repeatedly negative front-page headlines about Corbyn arguably set a wider tone. This is not to say that there are not valid criticisms of the Labour leader, but the context is important, too. Q: Why is it not illegal to openly lie and mislead the electorate? Dave, West Midlands I suppose the short answer is that a law on this would be hugely difficult to enforce, not least to prove lying involves showing intent as well as inaccuracy, and it would be a very subjective and controversial process. But would I like more public condemnation and shame for politicians who openly say things that they, and we, know are not true? Yes, I would. Here are the main points from John McDonnell\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A. The full text of his speech is here. McDonnell said that Boris Johnson was \u201cprobably the least trusted politician that people have ever experienced\u201d and that people would agree with Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, who said this morning he could not be trusted. (See 12.09pm.) McDonnell said Labour would hold its first budget on Wednesday 5 February if it won the election. Explaining what would be in the budget, he said in his speech: This is the budget that will save the NHS, that starts to rebuild the public services the Tories have brought to their knees. A budget that will put money in people\u2019s pockets, a real living wage of \u00a310 an hour. Money to fix the worst aspects of universal credit, while we design its replacement, a 5% pay rise for public sector workers after years of pay freezes. The Waspi compensation scheme will be established and legislation brought forward to scrap tuition fees Urgent funding will be brought forward rapidly to tackle the funding crisis in our NHS, our schools and education service. To establish free personal social care and childcare, to bring forward urgent homeless support, and inject much needed resources into our council services, with a full comprehensive spending review to follow later in 2020 to allocate resources for the full five years. He said he would set up its new Treasury national transformation unit before Christmas if Labour won. (See 11.19am.) He said Labour would use people\u2019s assemblies to give people a say in how nationalised utilities were run. (See 11.21am.) He said Labour\u2019s enemies were \u201cpeople who hate the people of this country\u201d. (See 11.28am.) He referred to \u201cthose at the top\u201d, but he did not make it clear whether he was talking about Conservative politicians, or the financial elite, or the media - or all three - although he did implicate Boris Johnson, referring to contemptuous comments by the PM about the working class in some of his old newspaper articles. He denied being worried about the pound crashing in the event of a Labour victory, and instead said he thought it could go up in value. When it put to him that in the past he said a Labour victory could lead to a run on the pound, he claimed he had said the opposite. Labour had been advised that there would not be a run on the pound, he said. He went on: My fear is the pound will start going up because of our investment plans. He did not rule out trying to break up the giant tech companies. Asked if he was attracted by the idea, which is also favoured by Elizabeth Warren, one of the frontrunners to be the Democratic presidential candidate in the US in 2020, he replied: I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s about breaking them up or whether it\u2019s about proper regulation. That will be the debate and the discussion that we will be having. But there are clearly issues of accountability and there are clearly issues about the fair treatment of them as a sector, as against other sectors. Given that the major tech giants are all American, a British government would probably have very little say over this anyway. He refused to rule out a Sunday Times report saying he might take over as interim Labour leader in the event of the party losing the election. Asked about the story, he just insisted it was not a valid question because Labour would win. (See 11.39am.) He claimed Labour had inspired other progressive parties around the world to be more radical, including the Democrats in America. He said: I think we\u2019ve helped inspire the debate within the US, where the debate around radical policies has caught the wind, and all the Democratic candidates now are aspiring policies that maybe five or 10 years ago that they wouldn\u2019t have even considered. I think that\u2019s happening in a number of countries. He claimed that pundits would be surprised by the election result. People wanted real change, he said: I think what you\u2019ll see is, despite what\u2019s happening in the opinion polls, although the opinion polls have consistently being trending towards us, I think you\u2019ll see, as some of you were shocked in the 2017 general election, I think you\u2019ll be even more shocked this time. Q: A good friend says she won\u2019t vote because, although she is anti-Conservative, she would feel a hypocrite for voting Green, and Labour are too leftwing for her and she doesn\u2019t believe they can afford their manifesto pledges. How can I persuade her? Vicki, Cumbria You could make the argument \u2013 as has Hugh Grant, among many others \u2013 that your friend could vote tactically in whatever constituency she lives in so as to have the most chance of preventing a Conservative MP and thus limiting or stopping Boris Johnson\u2019s majority. The Lib Dems would probably argue that if she doesn\u2019t like the Tories, and the Greens and Labour are too leftwing, she could give them a try. Q: How can we trust any of the promises made by the leaders of the main parties? There is Johnson and Corbyn promising everything, but the kitchen. Kim, 55, Manchester This is an interesting area. Politicians promising the moon on a stick in elections is hardly a new phenomenon, but this campaign has seen an arguable increase in voter scepticism about many of these pledges. Sometimes the reason for the scepticism is obvious. For example, Boris Johnson has pledged to \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, when the UK is merely part-way through a long and tricky departure process. Similarly, Jo Swinson\u2019s initial claim that she could become PM wasn\u2019t especially convincing. I suppose the best answer would be the slightly boring one: read parties\u2019 manifestos and see what seems feasible/appealing to you. Some of your questions so far have been about what happens if a leader of a winning party loses their seat, and about checks for goods crossing the Irish Sea: Q: What happens if the leader of the winning party loses their seat as an MP? Marina Nea, housewife, Essex If they lose their seat there is no law prevening them from being prime minister \u2013 Alec Douglas-Home was briefly in No 10 before becoming MP. But it would be very hard to do. If Boris Johnson won the election and lost his seat he would either need to be made a peer (you can be PM from the Lords, but in this Commons-centric era it would be pretty tough) or a loyal MP with a safe seat could resign, triggering a byelection. The latter would seem by far the most likely outcome. Q: Can we please have a definitive answer on whether or not there will be checks and paperwork needed for goods crossing the Irish Sea, over and above current ones, before the election please. John Davidson, 77, retired, Liverpool The definitive answer seems to be: yes to \u201cchecks\u201d of some sort, though what these will be is up for debate and depends on the future Brexit deal. My colleague, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, wrote a good mini-Twitter thread on this yesterday. Q: Where can I follow the best prognoses after the voting closes? Is there any special site focusing on the close seats interesting in the case of tactical voting? Frank, IT service consultant, Germany The gold standard for instant results is the post-election exit poll, a vast effort which involves asking people how they actually did vote, and is usually released just after the polls close at 10pm. For a rolling update of specific seats, a good one-stop bet is the fantastic Britain Elects Twitter feed. Rebecca Long-Bailey has refused to deny that she would seek to become Labour leader if Jeremy Corbyn were to step down following defeat on Thursday. Speaking after addressing business leaders at a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d talk in Manchester\u2019s financial centre, Spinningfields, the shadow business secretary said: \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever thought about before if I\u2019m honest.\u201d Long-Bailey, who is widely seen as John McDonnell\u2019s preferred candidate for the next Labour leader, also would not confirm whether Corbyn would go if Labour lost, saying only that: \u201cYou\u2019d have to have a crystal ball to find out.\u201d When asked why Corbyn has such a dismal personality rating among voters, Long-Bailey said leaders were always \u201cmarmite\u201d. In 2015 that was the mantra that we were hearing, \u2018no one likes Ed Miliband\u2019, and then in the last general election it was like, \u2018oh, no one likes Jeremy Corbyn\u2019. Unfortunately we\u2019ve moved to a system now where people view politicians in the same way as the American-style system, where it\u2019s all about one person and their personality rather than their policies. While an Opinium poll from the weekend showed the Conservatives held a 15-point lead over Labour, just days ahead of the election, Long-Bailey said feedback on doorsteps during the campaigning had been \u201cvery different\u201d to the picture being portrayed by surveys. Normally in an election you get a don\u2019t know on the doorstep because they\u2019re too polite to tell you they\u2019re not going to vote for you. But these are genuine don\u2019t knows in most cases because they\u2019re engaging and they\u2019re asking questions because they\u2019re not sure where to go. I think a lot of those don\u2019t knows are going to be the deciding factor on Thursday. A lot of people haven\u2019t made their mind up and I think it\u2019s going to be a very interesting general election. I\u2019m Peter Walker, a political correspondent for the Guardian, and I will be answering any questions you have on the general election today. I have been covering politics since just after the Brexit referendum, and previously wrote about national and international news. Before joining the Guardian I worked for various other organisations, including Agence France-Presse, where I was based in Beijing, Hong Kong and Paris. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. In the Q&amp;A earlier McDonnell was also asked if he had been too ambitious, because some voters did not believe all Labour\u2019s spending promises. McDonnell said his plans were ambitious. He said the combination of Tories lies, and hostile media reporting, had had some effect. But Labour had 500,000 members who had been explaining these plans, he said. He also said he and his team had spent two years touring the country explaining what they wanted to do. This is what John McDonnell said about Boris Johnson in the Q&amp;A. Isn\u2019t it interesting that as the prime minister tours around different constituencies, he finds it incredibly difficult even to mix with people ... What we\u2019re getting back on the doorstep is he\u2019s probably the least trusted politician that people have ever experienced. Arlene Foster, I think, has come to a judgment this morning which is echoed right the way across the country; this is a man whose word you cannot trust. Ask our experts a question As part of a new series, you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Today, Peter Walker, a political correspondent for the Guardian, will answer any questions you have on the general election. You can ask your question via our form here. Q: If you win on Friday, what will be the first thing you do in No 11? And if you don\u2019t win, will you resign immediately or stay in office for a bit? On the second question, McDonnell says Labour is going to win. He says, if Labour wins, he will want to have meetings with the permanent secretary at the Treasury within minutes. He will want to send a letter to the Office for Budget Responsibility, in preparation for a budget eight weeks from Wednesday ie, Wednesday 5 February. That\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary shortly. Q: Could you work with the Democratic Unionist party? You have mentioned Arlene Foster warmly twice this morning? McDonnell says if Labour has to govern as a minority government, he will. He has worked with DUP MPs on issues in the past, he says. He says he cannot imagine the DUP voting against a real living wage, or more investment. Q: What would your policies mean for tech giants? And would you want to break them up, as Elizabeth Warren is proposing in the US? McDonnell says he has a group working on this. He has called for a taxation regime \u2013 \u201cunitary taxation\u201d \u2013 that would lead to them paying more. He says he is not sure whether they need to be broken up, or whether proper regulation would address the problems. But they do need to be more tightly regulated, he says. He says there are questions about their role in society - not just the amount of tax they pay. He says this is a global debate. He is glad it has started. McDonnell does not rule out calling for tech giants to be broken up. Q: [From an Australian journalist] The Australian Labor party was defeated earlier this year on a moderate platform. Would you encourage other leftwing parties to be more ambitious? McDonnell says he thinks Labour has inspired other parties. In the US, Democratic candidates are proposing policies they would not have chosen a decade ago, he says. He says he has an agenda whose time has come. Q: Yesterday the Sunday Times said there is a plan for you to take over as interim Labour leader if the party loses. Can you rule that out? McDonnell says he can rule that out because there is going to be a majority Labour government. McDonnell brushes aside claim he might replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader if Labour loses on Friday. McDonnell says he thinks the pound will go up in value if Labour win. He says people should look at what has happened to the value of the pound under the Tories. Q: Do you think the election will be decided in Labour heartlands? And why do you think there are people willing to vote Tory who have never done so for decades? McDonnell says the election will be decided everywhere. He says, although Boris Johnson is touring marginals, it is striking that he is not mixing with ordinary people. He says Johnson is \u201cprobably the least trusted politician that people have ever experienced\u201d. He says a lot of people will agree with what Arlene Foster said this morning. He also says he thinks people will be surprised by the election result. Q: Is there a price you are not willing to pay for privatised companies? McDonnell says he is not writing a blank cheque. Parliament will decide the price, he says. He says there is strong public support for bringing these firms back into public control. They are natural monopolies, he says. And people are fed up of being \u201cripped off\u201d. John McDonnell is now taking questions. Q: Are you saying there are four days to save the planet? McDonnell says the country is facing twin emergencies; the climate crisis, and a social emergency. He refers to the boy forced to sleep on the floor of a hospital. That is why this election is about saving the NHS, he says. And he says our grandchildren will not forgive us if we do not address the climate crisis. Q: Would you definitely vote remain in a future referendum? McDonnell says he cannot see a better deal than remain, but when Labour does bring its new Brexit deal back, he will make his assessment of it then. McDonnell says Labour\u2019s opponents hate the people of this country. There will always be those at the top who will do anything to stop us \u2013 we\u2019ve seen character assassinations, lies and smears taken to a new level \u2026 When they attack me, or Jeremy, we know it\u2019s not really about us. It\u2019s about you; they hate the people of this country. They think \u2013 and I quote the prime minister \u2013 that you\u2019re drunk and criminal, they hate the idea you might dream of a better life. They hate the idea you might want real change in how things have been done for so long, and a say in how things are done in future. And here is his peroration. When they come to write the history books, and write about when it all began to turn around. When your children or grandchildren ask you: What did you do to end that world of rough sleeping and food banks? What did you do to save the NHS and stop the Tories selling it off? What did you do to bring back pride to our town? And to finally wrestle back control from those who had kept it to themselves for so long? You can tell them: It all began when we voted Labour, when together we laid the foundations of that new society, foundations so deeply rooted that no Tory could ever tear them up. You can tell them: It was when we proved, once and for all, that the doubters were wrong. That the doubters are always wrong: another world really is possible. McDonnell says it is now clear that Boris Johnson would not be able to get Brexit done quickly. Despite all his promises it is clear to all that far from getting Brexit done, under Johnson Brexit won\u2019t be done for years or we risk a catastrophic no deal. He says he agrees with what Arlene Foster said this morning (see 9.23am); you cannot trust Johnson, he says. McDonnell says Labour will make the nationalised companies publicly accountable. In our first 100 days we will start the process of bringing water and energy into public ownership. We\u2019ll set up boards to run these utilities made up of you, the customer, and you, the worker, as well as representatives from local councils, metro mayors and others. We\u2019ll make sure decisions are taken locally by those who understand the services \u2013 those who use them and deliver them. Meetings will be public and streamed online, with new transparency regulations set higher than ever before, so you can see if your road is being dug up, why, and for how long. And we\u2019ll create new people\u2019s assemblies to give everyone the option of participating in how their utilities are run. McDonnell says Labour will set up its national transformation unit before Christmas. The first priority of a Labour government will be getting investment going to make this happen. We\u2019ll set up our national transformation unit immediately \u2013 before Christmas \u2013 so it can start work in the Treasury, before being moved out to its new office in the north of England early next year. It will provide the initial finance for our new national investment bank, regional development banks and Post Bank, using the power of the Treasury to get affordable finance on to every high street in Britain. He says people have lost faith in how much change is possible. We\u2019ve already started our meetings with the Treasury, they are working up plans and getting ready to implement all this. So don\u2019t be fooled by the doubters who say our plans are unachievable. A decade of austerity, and 40 years of believing the market knows best, have dulled people\u2019s sense of what\u2019s possible, just as they were intended to do. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is giving a speech now on the first 100 days of a Labour government. He says Labour has won the argument about austerity. He says Boris Johnson himself now admits austerity was wrong, although, McDonnell says, under Tory manifesto plans, austerity would continue for another five years. He says he has been having detailed meetings with colleagues about what Labour will do when it gets into government. Good jobs and whole industries that were once the pride of our country have been lost and replaced with dreary, exploitative, insecure and low-paid jobs, or in some cases no jobs at all. No wonder people feel disillusioned in politicians. As our manifesto makes clear, turning these two things around will be our number one priority in government. Our green industrial revolution will deliver the changes we need to avert climate catastrophe. And it will put British industry back on the map, bringing prosperity to every part of our country. It will give every community something to be proud of. On the Today programme this monring Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, repeated the usual Conservative claim that Boris Johnson would be able to agree a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year. (See 8.17am.) Anyone who has followed this issue even just half-closely will know that there are good grounds for thinking that the Tories are not being realistic, and the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has a good Twitter thread this morning explaining why. It starts here. And here is one of her key points. This chart from the academic and Brexit specialist Simon Usherwood also sums up the problems to be addressed in the next phase of the Brexit negotiation. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, did a phone-in on Radio 5 Live this morning. The Liberal Democrats are committed to reforming the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for trans people to change their gender, and this has led to concern that it would put women at risk in women-only space from people who are anatomically male. In the phone-in, Swinson was clearly on the defensive on this issue, and did not seem to get very far in terms of persuading the sceptical caller who raised the issue. But Swinson was much better on the Today programme this morning when Justin Webb raised the same issue. Asked if she thought biological sex existed, she replied: Not on a binary ... from what I\u2019ve read, I\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019m an expert on the subject, but I don\u2019t think things are as binary as is often presented. Swinson also insisted that this was a rights issue. This is not a scientific debate. This is a debate about people and their lives. This is a debate about people who are facing extreme prejudice and discrimination. It takes us back to a very similar situation to where we were on gay rights decades ago, when people were being told that they were somehow as a person wrong for being who they were. And the vitriol that was heaped on them by society drove people to huge mental crises, in many cases to misery and sometimes to suicide. We see that amongst non-binary and trans people today and I think we should be making sure that every individual is protected. On the issue of women-only spaces, Swinson said the priority was to keep people safe. But she said processes were already in place to address this. She went on: I do think it is important that people are protected. And I don\u2019t think there should be some kind of hierarchy of equality, because trans women are some of the most vulnerable women in our society facing huge discrimination. And all women who have been on the receiving end of violence deserve to have safe spaces, whether they are gay, straight, bi, whether they are trans, whether they are cis, whatever their race is, whatever their background they come from. And they need to be protected on that individual basis. And I have to say, we are talking about a very small part of the population. And implicit in this is an assumption that trans women are in some way more likely to be violent. And it is just not borne out. And I think there is a demonisation of a community going on here, and I often find the media is complicit in it. These are from the politics professor Tim Bale. He is flagging up research from two other academics, Cristian Vaccari and David Smith, in this article for the Conversation. Nicola Sturgeon has suggested that a referendum on Brexit would be held before a second vote on Scottish independence. As PA Media reports, the Scottish first minister told BBC\u2019s Good Morning Scotland that Labour wanted to hold an EU poll within six months of being elected and that she would want another Scottish independence referendum towards the end of 2020. She said: It looks as if the EU [referendum] would come first and then an independence referendum towards the end of next year. That\u2019s the sequencing. In terms of the priority, in order of importance if you like, I want the whole UK to get the opportunity to escape Brexit, but of course an EU referendum doesn\u2019t guarantee that Scotland escapes Brexit, we could have the same result we had in 2016. And whether it\u2019s Brexit or stopping any other Westminster policy being imposed on Scotland, the way to do that is to become independent and that\u2019s why that choice over the future of our country is so important. Here are some of the main items on the agenda for today. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech on what Labour would do in its first 100 days. 2pm: Jeremy Corbyn addresses a rally in Bristol. Later he is doing campaign stops in Stroud, Worcester and Wolverhampton. Boris Johnson is also due to deliver a speech during his various campaign visits today, but the timing has not been confirmed. On the subject of whether or not there will be checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland under Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan (see 9.23am), it is worth pointing out that the briefing issued by the Conservative party press office on Friday, in response to the document leaked by Labour on this subject, specifically said there would be checks. It said (bold type inserted by me): The deal ensures that there will not be any tariffs in either direction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and allows for \u2018unfettered access\u2019 between Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Article 6, link). We will ensure no change to trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. There will be checks as goods head into Northern Ireland, but the only goods that will pay tariffs will be goods that are destined for the Republic. Boris Johnson has also managed to ensure that, if the UK Government believes that someone has paid a customs fee who shouldn\u2019t have, we have the unilateral power to reimburse or waive any tariff. This means that, if we have a majority Conservative government, we can ensure that goods headed to Northern Ireland never pay tariffs. When Boris Johnson was running for the Conservative party leadership, he had the enthusiastic backing of Democratic Unionist party MPs. That changed abruptly when Johnson unveiled his plan for a new withdrawal agreement that involved a de facto customs border down the Irish Sea - something he insisted \u201cno British Conservative government\u201d would accept when he gave a speech to the DUP annual conference in November 2018. Despite effectively being betrayed, the DUP does not want Jeremy Corbyn to win the election, and during the campaign it has been relatively reluctant to criticise Johnson in personal terms. But this morning Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, did let slip her true feeling about his reliability in an interview on the Today programme. Here are the main points. Foster said Johnson could not be trusted to keep his word. Asked about the extent to which Johnson was seen as someone who could not be trusted by unionists in the light of his U-turn over a customs border down the Irish Sea, she replied: I think it is right for the leadership of unionism in Northern Ireland to try to work with the prime minister of the day to get the best deal for Northern Ireland. We will always do that. We will continue to do that. I think it says more about the person who broke their word than me and the leadership of the \u2026 Democratic Unionist party. When asked if that meant she would not take him at his word in future, she said: Well, I think once bitten, twice shy. We will certainly be looking for the detail of what this is going to look like. She said that HM Revenue and Customs officials had told the DUP that Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan would involve goods coming to Northern Ireland from Britain having to be checked. Johnson has at at times flatly denied this, as he did when he visited Northern Ireland last month, although in an interview yesterday he did say there would be checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland if they were destined for the Republic of Ireland, having initially said: \u201cThere\u2019s no question of there being checks on goods going [between] NI/GB and GB/NI.\u201d Nick Robinson, the presenter, asked Foster a question the Financial Times\u2019 political editor asked of Johnson directly: Was he lying, or did he not understand the policy? Foster refused to answer this directly, and she did not directly accuse Johnson of lying or of not understanding his policy. But she said the DUP had been told by HM Revenue and Customs that there would be checks. She said: Before Boris Johnson announced his deal, we spoke to \u2013 myself and Nigel Dodds \u2013 HMRC officials and we asked them a number of questions about goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, and they were very clear with us that it would mean that all of those goods would have to be checked. Obviously, only those goods that were going to the Republic of Ireland would have tariffs imposed on them. But all of the goods would have to be checked, and that would be the default position. She said Johnson\u2019s plan would contravene the Act of Union. She said: That, of course, is very concerning for us, because it goes very much to the heart of the Act of Union. That Act of Union not just talks of political and constitutional union, it also talks about trade, and it says there has to be a free flow of trade between the different parts of the United Kingdom. And if we are to have what has been proposed, then it wouldn\u2019t be free-flowing trade. And that of course causes us great concern. She said Johnson\u2019s plan could lead to shoppers in Northern Ireland not being able to buy goods on sale in Britain, or having to pay a higher price for them. She said: Most of our goods, particularly in the retail sector, come from Great Britain, and therefore any checks on those goods would lead to higher costs, perhaps even less choice, for people here in Northern Ireland, and that is completely unacceptable. Q: The Guardian says voters are confused by your plans for an Australian-style points system. What are you trying to achieve? Johnson says he wants to put immigration under democratic control. He says unskilled people would not be able to come to the UK without a job. Q: To what level? Johnson says he does not know. And that\u2019s it. The interview is over. Q: Do you support HS2? Johnson says he is reviewing this. It is sensible to do this, and decide if this is a good use of money. Q: You just said HS2 will cost more than \u00a3100bn. But the budget is \u00a388bn. So you are saying it could cost another \u00a310bn plus? Johnson says he does think the total cost will be \u201cnorth of \u00a3100bn\u201d. That is an awful lot of money. Johnson says he thinks total cost of HS2 would be more than \u00a3100bn - well above the current estimate. Q: Today Priti Patel, the home secretary, is claiming there would be 52 more murders a year under Labour. Where has she got those figures? Johnson says he does not know. Q: It\u2019s an article she wrote in the Daily Telegraph. She is making it up, isn\u2019t she? Johnson says Patel is making a point about the need for robust policing. Johnson says that if you increase police numbers you will get crime down. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Seth Jacobson. Boris Johnson is being interviewed by Nick Ferrari on LBC now. Ferrari starts by saying Johnson is trying to break the \u201cred wall\u201d of Labour-held seats. Johnson claims not to recognise the phrase. He says he is trying to win seats. Q: You are near Leeds, where a boy spent the night on a hospital floor because of a lack of beds. Johnson does not comment on that specific story, but says the government is putting a record amount into the NHS. Q: What would you say to the boy\u2019s family? Johnson says he apologises to everyone who has had a bad NHS experience. But most people are treated well by the NHS, he says. It needs proper funding. Of course I sympathise very much and I apologise to everybody who has a bad experience. By and large I think the NHS do an amazing job and I think that they deserve all praise for the service they provide \u2013 but they do need investment and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it now. But they need investment from a one nation government that really cares and understands \u2013 that\u2019s us that cares and understands \u2013 and you need long-term funding. Johnson apologises to family of boy forced to sleep on hospital floor. He says Labour would be \u201cdeeply destructive\u201d to the economy, meaning there would be no money for the NHS. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, has just been on the Today programme, where he was pressed about a story in today\u2019s Financial Times that reports that civil servants in the Department for Exiting the EU had cast doubt on the prospect of leaving the EU by December 2020. A document seen by the paper said \u201cdelivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge\u201d. Asked whether such a deal was capable with the EU, Sunak, a rising star in the Conservative party, said: Having sat on a committee chaired by Michael Gove to plan for our departure fro the EU, I\u2019ve actually been incredibly impressed by all the preparations that have gone on which mean we\u2019re in very good shape not just to deal with new trading relationships but all the other things. He also said that a \u201cnew immigration system\u201d was something that the government had been planning for, \u201cmaking sure the systems were in place and the resources were there so we can have control over our immigration policy\u201d. He went on: It\u2019s exactly the type of thing we\u2019ve been planning for and we can do after we leave but then again it can only happen after we actually deliver the election result and leave the EU. When pressed on whether no-deal planning would resume next week if the Tories were returned to office, he replied: We won\u2019t need to plan for no deal because we will have a deal to leave with. There is going to be a trade deal. The framework is already there in the political declaration. Our deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, is with Boris Johnson at Grimsby fish market this morning as he embarks on a three-day blitz of Labour seats across the party\u2019s traditional heartlands in Wales, the Midlands and Yorkshire. Boris Johnson started the day just after 6am at a fish market in Grimsby, a Tory target seat held by Labour\u2019s Melanie Onn with a majority of 2,565. He toured the market and watched a live auction before holding up a cod for the cameras and dragging a crate of fish across the warehouse. The PM got a mixed welcome with a number of fish wholesalers saying they were planning to vote for him but one started booing loudly. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has been on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme as the final few days of campaigning get under way. She has admitted it \u201cdoesn\u2019t look likely\u201d her party will win a majority as she insisted the Lib Dems have led the campaign for a second EU referendum. Asked about her party\u2019s manifesto pledge to revoke article 50, Swinson said: It\u2019s only in the circumstances of a Liberal Democrat majority government which of course in itself would be democratic. But where we are right now that obviously doesn\u2019t look likely. The most likely way we can stop Brexit is through a people\u2019s vote and the Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people\u2019s vote for three-and-a-half years. Conservatives, Greens, Labour, Lib Dems and SNP have answered questions about the climate crisis, including: Does your party support the students striking from school and/or the Extinction Rebellion protests demanding urgent action on the climate crisis? Conservatives: We don\u2019t support students losing out on their education, though we recognise and respect the passion that young people feel. We do not support illegal action that disrupts the lives of ordinary, hardworking people. Greens: We have supported the school strikers from day one. Young people will be most affected by the effects of climate chaos but don\u2019t have a political voice or vote. Labour: Absolutely. This year saw the blossoming of a global movement calling on politicians to wake up. We have turned its demands into detailed, credible plans for real change. Lib Dems: Of course we support this action. It is deeply worrying that children are feeling the need to strike because they\u2019re worried about their future. We are supportive of the aims of Extinction Rebellion and support their right to protest. But some of their actions have been counter-productive. SNP: We applaud the actions by school students in drawing attention to the need for greater urgency in tackling climate change. Read Kate Proctor\u2019s devastating account of the Brexit party\u2019s run over the last few weeks, which she descibes as a \u201ccampaign on life support\u201d. At Hull Ionians RUFC on a soaking wet Thursday morning last month, chairs were swiftly removed from the back few rows of a Brexit party event. It did the trick. The curtained event space, usually reserved for weddings, suddenly went from looking half empty to almost full. After the highs of the EU election campaign, when Nigel Farage\u2019s party drew thousands to glitzy rallies, a swathe of empty chairs beneath a glitter ball might not be how he imagined his eighth general election campaign would pan out. Still, the show goes on. Farage waited in the wings expressionless before exploding into life, striding down the gangway to his soundtrack of the party\u2019s 2019 campaign, Power by Kanye West. He vigorously shook the hands of those followers who had paid \u00a32.50 to attend. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be on stage in leave country,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m in the heart of a part of England that feels very, very let down by parliament, [the] political class. It\u2019s three-and-a-half years on and we\u2019ve still not got Brexit.\u201d Except he is in Haltemprice and Howden, the seat of the arch-Eurosceptic David Davis, a former Brexit secretary. Worse, it is not a seat the party is contesting. Running events a few miles into the wrong constituency is one of many hallmarks of a campaign that is now on life support. The day ahead Boris Johnson will make campaign visits to the east of England, the north-east and south-west. John McDonnell will give a speech on Labour\u2019s plans for its first 100 days in government this morning in London, while the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will be campaigning in the south-west. The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Ed Davey, will be canvassing for votes in Guildford. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, will take part in a photocall in Coatbridge, then join her party\u2019s candidate for Lanark and Hamilton East, on a visit to the Wallace tea rooms where they will help bake a cake. Good morning. We\u2019re here, in the final stretch of the campaign. The country will go to the polls on Thursday, but before that happens, the parties are giving their pitches one final push. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will outline the party\u2019s plan for the first 100 days of a Labour government, while the party focuses on the benefit of its policies to the bank balances of voters, promising the public that a Labour government would put \u201cmoney in your pocket\u201d. Amid concerns that Labour has overpromised with a blizzard of announcements during the six-week campaign, Corbyn will focus on the NHS and voters\u2019 finances in the final crucial days of campaigning. Meanwhile, the Tories have been much quieter than the opposition ahead of the vote \u2013 as John Harris points out, they have been throughout the campaign \u2013 though Boris Johnson did do an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News yesterday, which John Crace described as a \u201c20-minute audio-visual barrage of near constant mansplaining and manspreading\u201d. The Tories have been much less forthcoming about their plansand those they have promised are problematic. Johnson\u2019s proposal of 40 new hospitals has not been costed (although some say it could be as much as \u00a324bn), his promise to introduce an \u201cAustralian-style\u201d immigration system has been criticised. At the odder end of the spectrum is Johnson\u2019s claim that getting Brexit done will lead to a baby boom such as the one that he wrongly alleges occurred after the London Olympics. But, their message that the Conservatives will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d seems to have cut through, and despite stagnating in the polls they still look strongly placed to win the election. Thanks for reading along, I\u2019ll have the blog for the early hours before handing over to my colleagues. Let\u2019s get cracking.",

It reinforces the idea that bi women are there for men\u2019s titillation.\u201d</p> <p>It also implies that bi women are inherently sexual, engaging in a greater variety of sexual acts, which, she explains, \u201ccan sometimes be true \u2026 but isn\u2019t an inherent part of any sexual orientation.\u201d Plus the line about changing lanes makes bisexual people seem indecisive.</p> <p>Murphy explains that Payne\u2019s lyrics are harmful because they can encourage male listeners to expect bi women to perform for them. We saw the real-life consequences of how attitudes such as this can play out earlier this year, when two women, Chris (who is bisexual) and Melania (a lesbian), were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/14/homophobic-attack-bus-outrage-media-white\" title=\"\">attacked on a London bus</a> after refusing when a group of men demanded they kiss for their entertainment. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/bisexual-lgbt-pride-sexual-assault-violence-invisible-minority-survivors-a8435226.html\" title=\"\">government research</a> has found that in the UK, bisexual women are more likely to experience sexual violence than straight or gay women.</p> <p>\u201cI think most representations of bisexuality until recently have been through the lens of straight men, or in porn, so we are viewed as overly sexualised,\u201d says Simone, 35, who is bisexual, and from Dubai. But there are other misconceptions too, she says: \u201cWhen you\u2019re bisexual, people always seem to tie your sexuality into who you\u2019re having sex with at the time \u2026 I\u2019ve been in a relationship with a man for 12 years, but that doesn\u2019t erase my bisexuality.\u201d</p> <p>Payne\u2019s song isn\u2019t the first time pop stars have failed us when it comes to bi representation. Last year, Rita Ora made an apology after Kehlani, Hayley Kiyoko and Shura were among those who criticised her song Girls for exploiting her own bisexuality.</p> <p>So how should pop get it right? Well, to start with, Payne should apologise, says Murphy. \u201cFor someone with his privilege and following he should be aware of his impact \u2013 and he should apologise so that young, bi fans don\u2019t have to feel that their identity is inherently sexualised.\u201d</p> <p>We also need to see more bisexual representation in videos, Murphy says. Isn\u2019t that difficult, though? If we see a woman kissing a woman, we assume she is gay, if we see her kissing a man, that she is straight. But that\u2019s just the point, says Murphy: \u201cIt\u2019s related to a wider societal problem around how we view bisexuality \u2013 and how we shouldn\u2019t be making assumptions about people\u2019s sexual identities.\u201d</p>",

Two years ago, there had been a sense of hope. A feeling that change was possible. Now there was just weariness, a weight of resignation.

She said: \u201cWe need to keep giving the decisionmakers the power to make the changes we need to see. People have a right to knowledge, and an obligation to get knowledge. Some say we have to wait for people to get ready for change. But we need to make people ready. These are some of the things the youth movement is trying to do, and have to do to ensure progress at COP25.\u201d</p> \n<p>She spoke as governments including the intended conference host Chile, the co-hosts Costa Rica and Spain, and several other countries signed up to an international declaration that the climate emergency was a crisis for the rights of children.

      "bodyText": "Children and young people must be at the heart of dealing with the climate crisis, the UN and campaigners have said as climate talks in Madrid enter their second week with little concrete progress. Young people, including Greta Thunberg, played a leading role in protests at COP25 over the weekend, and on Monday appeared at the conference to put pressure on negotiators to come up with a plan for reducing greenhouse gases and tackling the impacts of climate breakdown. Penelope Lea, a 15-year old from Norway, was the first climate activist chosen to be a Unicef ambassador. She said: \u201cWe need to keep giving the decisionmakers the power to make the changes we need to see. People have a right to knowledge, and an obligation to get knowledge. Some say we have to wait for people to get ready for change. But we need to make people ready. These are some of the things the youth movement is trying to do, and have to do to ensure progress at COP25.\u201d She spoke as governments including the intended conference host Chile, the co-hosts Costa Rica and Spain, and several other countries signed up to an international declaration that the climate emergency was a crisis for the rights of children. The organisers, including Unicef, hope this will encourage countries to include special consideration for children in their climate action plans. Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, applauded the young activists. \u201cI understand the despair and rage that so many young people and older ones too are feeling. All of us know the facts and so far there has been far too little real action. Children and young people have a right to participate. We need to implement the principle of intergenerational equity that the Paris agreement sets out.\u201d Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland, said: \u201cThe children have called out the adult world, called us out very effectively, as this is a grave injustice. When I was growing up I did not have that shadow [of climate breakdown]. It\u2019s not fair that we have made children have that fear.\u201d Unicef warned that climate breakdown would reverse the gains made in recent years in protecting children and enshrining their rights in law. More than 500 million children live in areas judged to be at extremely high risk of floods, due to cyclones, hurricanes, storms and rising sea levels. In the Caribbean alone, the number of children displaced by extreme weather events has risen sixfold in five years, with more than 760,000 children displaced between 2014 and 2018.

Most of the failures have been caused by a surge in compensation claims by customers who say they were mis-sold loans they could not afford. The FCA imposed affordability checks and capped payday loan charges in 2014 to stop lenders charging more in fees and interest than the amount borrowed. The changes, designed to protect vulnerable consumers, reduced the lenders\u2019 income and triggered a flurry of customer complaints. Peter Tutton, the head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, said there had been a drop in the number of people struggling with payday loans debt after the spate of administrations. \u201cWhile this reduction in harm is welcome, lower income households will still need access to safe, suitable and affordable credit from time to time. \u201cWhoever forms the next government needs a comprehensive strategy that provides greater access to affordable credit safety nets for the most financially vulnerable, including the full introduction of a no interest loan scheme.\u201d Jason Wassell, the chief executive of the payday loans industry body the Consumer Finance Association, also called on the next government to consider access to credit. He said vulnerable customers could turn to less credible sources of credit, particularly over the holidays. \u201cWe are not necessarily suggesting this will lead to a rise in loan sharks, but we do suspect we will see an increase in unregulated borrowing, possibly from hard-pressed family members, and on occasion, it will be from individuals with links to criminality.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A troubling statistic before Chelsea attempt to secure their place in the last 16 of the Champions League by beating Lille on Tuesday evening: aside from the Carabao Cup victory over League Two\u2019s Grimsby Town in September, Frank Lampard\u2019s young side have not held a half-time lead at Stamford Bridge since the 2-2 draw with Sheffield United on 31 August. It has been a common sight this season, Chelsea getting bogged down at home after failing to build on fast starts, and Lampard needs his players to discover the clinical edge they have shown on the road when they host Lille. \u201cWe wanted more in our home games and quite a lot of it has been chance conversion,\u201d said the Chelsea manager. \u201cAway from home we\u2019ve gone and racked up some goals and some really good performances, and scored early in the game. But when you play well at home but don\u2019t score for 45 minutes you kind of add the pressure on yourselves. We need to take our chances, especially ones that come early in a game. If you\u2019ve got pressure, you need to convert it.\u201d Yet while it could be another tense occasion in front of their supporters, Chelsea would have taken this situation after opening their European campaign with a home defeat by Valencia. Lille are out after picking up one point from five games in Group H and a Chelsea win will leave Ajax and Valencia fighting over the other qualification spot in Amsterdam. A draw would leave them relying on the Dutch side beating their Spanish counterparts. Not that Lampard will take anything for granted after the 4-4 draw with nine-man Ajax last month and the wild 2-2 with Valencia a fortnight ago. Chelsea, who have not won at home in the Champions League since September 2017, have lost three of their last four games in the Premier League and have to react after Saturday\u2019s 3-1 defeat by Everton. It is an occasion that calls for composure and Lampard, who is likely to stiffen his back four by starting Antonio R\u00fcdiger for the first time since 14 September, will find out if his players are capable of expressing themselves when the stakes are this high. \u201cI think you can be defined as an individual and as a group by success and what success looks like,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this means going into the next stage of the Champions League.

      "body": "<p>Public funding for environment bodies in Scotland has plummeted by 40% in a decade, placing already declining wildlife at risk, according to analysis of government budgets.</p> <p>Scottish Environment Link, a coalition of more than 35 wildlife, environment and countryside charities, including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, WWF and the Scottish Wildlife Trust, estimates almost \u00a3100m has been <a href=\"https://www.scotlink.org/funding-the-nature-and-climate-emergency-reversing-a-decade-of-austerity-for-the-environment/\">slashed from the budgets of public agencies in Scotland</a> between 2010-11 and 2019-20.</p> <p>The group described the cuts as \u201cstaggering\u201d, given the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis. The agencies affected are Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) and several research institutes, including the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh and Scotland\u2019s Rural College.</p> <p>The Scottish government said the analysis gave a \u201cmisleading picture\u201d and did not take into account EU and other sources of funding. Budgets had been constrained by UK-wide cuts, it said.</p> <p>Deborah Long, Scottish Environment Link\u2019s chief officer, said: \u201cObviously there\u2019s a lack of resources across the board: in the NHS, in policing. But what we\u2019re seeing is that cuts to environment have been ongoing and we\u2019re at a stage where if we want to tackle the biodiversity and climate crisis, that needs to be reflected in budgets.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are going to tackle the biodiversity and climate crisis you can\u2019t do that with no money and no staffing.\u201d</p> <p>Citing Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/28/nicola-sturgeon-world-facing-climate-emergency-snp\">who announced a climate emergency</a> and the need for \u201ctransformative change\u201d seven months ago, Long said there was a significant mismatch between words and action.</p> <p>Long said the <a href=\"https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/publications/state-of-nature-2019-report-scotland.pdf\">State of Nature Scotland</a> report, which showed 49% of species had decreased in abundance in Scotland and one in nine were facing extinction, had clarified the cause of biodiversity loss in Scotland and the UK. The budget cuts had put the agencies under strain, she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can definitely see it reflected in the stresses in what the agencies are trying to do,\u201d Long said. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for action on the ground and for monitoring, Both of these are under severe stress. It is easy not to act until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p> <p>Taking account of inflation, the analysis showed funding has dropped overall from \u00a3246m in 2010-11 to \u00a3147.5m in 2019-20. It looked at Sepa, Scotland\u2019s environment regulator, SNH and the research bodies covered by the Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services (Resas), and used draft budget equivalent figures, measured in 2019 prices.</p> <p>\u201cCompared to nine years ago, the annual aggregate SNH, Resas and Sepa budgets have been cut by almost \u00a3100m, measured in 2019 prices, a staggering 40% reduction in real terms,\u201d the Link reports. It called for funding for environmental agencies and research to be substantially increased.</p> <p>The report says UK government austerity measures are partly to blame.</p> <p>Ruchir Shah, the director of external affairs for the Scottish Wildlife Trust, described the analysis as \u201cstark\u201d. \u201cIt is counterproductive to shift resources away from nature as it has been shown how important it is to health and welfare,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Aed\u00e1n Smith, the head of policy at the RSPB in Scotland, said: \u201cThis definitely illustrates not only have we been underfunding nature and the environment but actually reducing funding.

      "bodyText": "Public funding for environment bodies in Scotland has plummeted by 40% in a decade, placing already declining wildlife at risk, according to analysis of government budgets. Scottish Environment Link, a coalition of more than 35 wildlife, environment and countryside charities, including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, WWF and the Scottish Wildlife Trust, estimates almost \u00a3100m has been slashed from the budgets of public agencies in Scotland between 2010-11 and 2019-20. The group described the cuts as \u201cstaggering\u201d, given the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis. The agencies affected are Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) and several research institutes, including the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh and Scotland\u2019s Rural College. The Scottish government said the analysis gave a \u201cmisleading picture\u201d and did not take into account EU and other sources of funding. Budgets had been constrained by UK-wide cuts, it said. Deborah Long, Scottish Environment Link\u2019s chief officer, said: \u201cObviously there\u2019s a lack of resources across the board: in the NHS, in policing. But what we\u2019re seeing is that cuts to environment have been ongoing and we\u2019re at a stage where if we want to tackle the biodiversity and climate crisis, that needs to be reflected in budgets. \u201cIf we are going to tackle the biodiversity and climate crisis you can\u2019t do that with no money and no staffing.\u201d Citing Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, who announced a climate emergency and the need for \u201ctransformative change\u201d seven months ago, Long said there was a significant mismatch between words and action. Long said the State of Nature Scotland report, which showed 49% of species had decreased in abundance in Scotland and one in nine were facing extinction, had clarified the cause of biodiversity loss in Scotland and the UK. The budget cuts had put the agencies under strain, she said. \u201cWe can definitely see it reflected in the stresses in what the agencies are trying to do,\u201d Long said. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for action on the ground and for monitoring, Both of these are under severe stress. It is easy not to act until it\u2019s too late.\u201d Taking account of inflation, the analysis showed funding has dropped overall from \u00a3246m in 2010-11 to \u00a3147.5m in 2019-20. It looked at Sepa, Scotland\u2019s environment regulator, SNH and the research bodies covered by the Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services (Resas), and used draft budget equivalent figures, measured in 2019 prices. \u201cCompared to nine years ago, the annual aggregate SNH, Resas and Sepa budgets have been cut by almost \u00a3100m, measured in 2019 prices, a staggering 40% reduction in real terms,\u201d the Link reports. It called for funding for environmental agencies and research to be substantially increased. The report says UK government austerity measures are partly to blame. Ruchir Shah, the director of external affairs for the Scottish Wildlife Trust, described the analysis as \u201cstark\u201d. \u201cIt is counterproductive to shift resources away from nature as it has been shown how important it is to health and welfare,\u201d he said. Aed\u00e1n Smith, the head of policy at the RSPB in Scotland, said: \u201cThis definitely illustrates not only have we been underfunding nature and the environment but actually reducing funding. A transformative change is required. We need to be embedding tackling climate change and reversing the decline in nature.\u201d A Scottish government spokesperson said the Link figures were inaccurate. \u201cThis analysis provides an incomplete and misleading picture of government spending on environment activity and relevant agencies,\u201d they said. \u201cIt does not include other sources of funding nor recognise how the shift from one EU CAP programme to another might have affected the availability of funding for internal government research. It also does not include the full picture on other sources of funding such as European funds or in-year budget adjustments. \u201cWhile budgets have been constrained over the past decade due to UK budget cuts, we have worked hard to provide our environment agencies with the necessary resources to fulfil their statutory functions and enabled them to increase revenue through environmental charges making polluters pay towards protecting our natural resources.\u201d It had also expanded the range and number of agencies working in this area, it said. The SNH said that because of additional funding for peatland restoration from the Scottish government, its budget since 2017-18 had increased. It pointed out its European funding had also increased and \u201cthis year the Scottish government announced a \u00a32m increase to the Biodiversity Challenge Fund\u201d. A Sepa spokesperson said its staffing levels had remained consistent through the decade. Sepa said its baseline budget grant from the Scottish government was \u00a334.2m in 2008-09, compared with \u00a331.7m in 2019-20. Link\u2019s figures were \u00a345m in 2010-11, down to \u00a334.4m in 2019-20.",

Under Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, about two football pitches of Brazil\u2019s Amazon rainforest are being lost every minute, the highest level of deforestation in a decade, pushing the country off track from its climate targets. Speaking before the launch of the EU\u2019s \u201cgreen deal\u201d plan this Wednesday, Canfin said Europe\u2019s trade deals could not contradict the bloc\u2019s goals on climate action. \u201cThe EU is the first trade power in the world, so we have to use these trade deals in order to contribute to our vision of what is the right globalisation.

The EU-Mercosur trade pact was agreed in June after two decades of stop-start negotiations, but in September as fires raged in the Amazon as a result of land clearance by farmers and developers, Emmanuel Macron threatened to block the deal. Although the pact includes a chapter intended to protect social and environmental standards, Canfin said it was not enough and the protections should be enforceable and legally binding.

The house used to belong to their grandfather, who, says their teacher (played by Paul Rudd \u2013 who may be 200 or 20 years old, no one can tell anymore), was a Ghostbuster. Cue revving up the old Ecto-1 as the kids chase ghosts and whizz round their new town, which looks, confusingly, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/25/back-to-the-future-michael-j-fox-christopher-lloyd-how-we-made\">Hill Valley circa 1955</a>. That\u2019s a reference only us grandparents will understand.</p> <p>But what we learn from the trailer is that the new Ghostbuster is not really Ghostbusters: it\u2019s Stranger Things, the movie version. Like Stranger Things, it\u2019s about kids in a small town, and it\u2019s rooted in an homage to an 80s movie. In fact, from what I\u2019ve seen of the trailer, I\u2019m not actually sure why the film exists, given that Stranger Things was surely going to get on to Ghostbusters at some point, having already riffed on Stand By Me, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, and so on.</p> <p>This brings me to my biggest quibble with the new movie. The main reason why Feig\u2019s version didn\u2019t work was that it lacked Ghostbusters\u2019 secret special ingredients. No, not special effects and comedy but friendship and specificity. The original Ghostbusters is still so adored because viewers can sense the very real bond between the three leads as they ad-lib and riff off one another. They are grownups but fun, which means kids and grownups alike can enjoy them. And then there\u2019s the specificity. Although people think the stars of the first Ghostbusters were Bill Murray, Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, the real star was New York City. It was, above all, a movie about the city, filmed right out there on the streets. Even the slightly absurd (but still underrated) sequel was very much about Manhattan. Feig\u2019s movie, by contrast, was clearly filmed on a studio lot and felt poorer as a result \u2013 synthetic where it should have been grubby, anodyne where it should have been real.</p> <p>This latest one is filmed, as far as I can tell, in Anywheresville, USA. And it\u2019s a shame. I get that it\u2019s not easy to film in cities: Ivan Reitman had to shut down almost half of Manhattan to film the last scene of the first movie. Also, studios think specificity limits appeal whereas generic makes a movie more relatable. But they\u2019re wrong. Specificity and in-the-know references make a movie seem real and give it texture. It\u2019s the difference between a real New York chili dog and bland porridge. And while I may be a lifelong vegetarian (imagine how much Venkman would disapprove), even I know a chili dog beats porridge. I hope Reitman the Younger proves me wrong. Lord knows he got the genes to do so. But for now, I\u2019m keeping faith with the originals.</p>",

Although people think the stars of the first Ghostbusters were Bill Murray, Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, the real star was New York City. It was, above all, a movie about the city, filmed right out there on the streets. Even the slightly absurd (but still underrated) sequel was very much about Manhattan. Feig\u2019s movie, by contrast, was clearly filmed on a studio lot and felt poorer as a result \u2013 synthetic where it should have been grubby, anodyne where it should have been real. This latest one is filmed, as far as I can tell, in Anywheresville, USA. And it\u2019s a shame. I get that it\u2019s not easy to film in cities: Ivan Reitman had to shut down almost half of Manhattan to film the last scene of the first movie. Also, studios think specificity limits appeal whereas generic makes a movie more relatable. But they\u2019re wrong. Specificity and in-the-know references make a movie seem real and give it texture. It\u2019s the difference between a real New York chili dog and bland porridge. And while I may be a lifelong vegetarian (imagine how much Venkman would disapprove), even I know a chili dog beats porridge. I hope Reitman the Younger proves me wrong. Lord knows he got the genes to do so. But for now, I\u2019m keeping faith with the originals.",

Guest vocals by the late great Kirsty MacColl.</p> \n<p>Yet even by his own standards of thermonuclear disingenuity, Johnson\u2019s turn on ITV news on Monday morning reached new depths. In a fish market in Grimsby, ITV News reporter Joe Pike asked Johnson about newspaper reports featuring Jack Williment-Barr, a four-year-old boy with suspected pneumonia, who was pictured being forced to sleep on a concrete floor in an overcrowded NHS hospital this weekend. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to look at the photo,\u201d Johnson said.

At which point Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/refuses-to-look-at-picture-of-boy-forced-to-sleep-on-hospital-floor\">simply took the reporter\u2019s phone</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/refuses-to-look-at-picture-of-boy-forced-to-sleep-on-hospital-floor\"> and stuffed it in his pocket</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e20491e1-ec20-481a-af08-65d98f8a8d21\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/diX8IyrGQJY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>What has happened to reality? What can you say? Other than: may all would-be statesmen disport themselves with the casual larceny of a guy who knows if you don\u2019t let the legal papers physically touch you, then they haven\u2019t been served on you. For my money, the inclusion of the auto-satirical words \u201cprime minister\u201d at the end of Pike\u2019s next sentence mark it out as a contender for quote of the campaign. Let\u2019s see them in action: \u201cYou refuse to look at the photo, you\u2019ve taken my phone, and put it in your pocket, prime minister.\u201d YOU\u2019VE ROBBED HIS PHONE LIVE ON AIR. Sorry \u2013 you\u2019ve robbed his phone live on air, <em>prime minister</em>.</p> \n<p>A pause. \u201cSorry,\u201d said the prime minister of the United Kingdom, eventually, fumbling around in his pocket for another man\u2019s phone and some more lies. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have taken your phone, but there you go,\u201d blustered Johnson. \u201cI was just \u2026\u201d But he couldn\u2019t finish the sentence. How on earth could he have finished the sentence? He simply tailed off. Later, at a Q&amp;A in a Sunderland factory, Johnson appeared to float <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/boris-johnson-looking-at-abolishing-tv-licence-fee-for-bbc\">scrapping the BBC licence fee</a> simply to distract from this story \u2013 a move that vaguely reminded me of Bill Clinton bombing the Sudanese aspirin factory to distract from his blowjob hearings. As Johnson put it: \u201cI\u2019m under pressure not to extemporise policy on the hoof.\u201d Incorrect. You\u2019re under pressure because you nicked a phone live on telly.</p> \n<p>When she was through the looking glass, the White Queen famously told Alice that \u201csometimes I\u2019ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast\u201d. No offence to Her Majesty, but this is an incredibly low score if you\u2019ve been listening to Boris Johnson\u2019s early morning media round.</p> \n<p>That said, the PM\u2019s breakfast interview with Nick Ferrari on LBC on Monday gave us a little insight into his process \u2013 kind of like an episode of Inside the Liar\u2019s Studio. The prime minister allowed lucky listeners a real-time chance to see how he turns in some of his more memorable mendacious performances. Take the other sort of lying \u2013 lying on the floor in front of bulldozers, which he\u2019d once promised to do if Heathrow went ahead with a third runway, but which now appears in direct opposition to government policy.</p> \n<p>Is he going to do it? wondered Ferrari, rhetorically. \u201cI would \u2026 have to find some way of honouring that promise,\u201d mused Johnson, like one of those pundits who promise to eat their shoe live on air if something doesn\u2019t happen, then are proved wrong, but eat a shoe made out of cake and imagine they\u2019re quits. Like this, but with his entire climate morality. \u201cIt might be technically difficult to achieve,\u201d Johnson continued, ostensibly talking about the bulldozers, but subconsciously surely weighing up the technical challenges of the lie. This would be a 4 \u00bd reverse ferret, in the pike position, with 2 \u00bd twists. Technically difficult to achieve \u2013 near-impossible to guarantee a perfect 10 from the Russian judge \u2013 yet somehow entirely doable for this most tireless of all competitors.</p> \n<p>Even when not actively advancing one of his own lies, Johnson has developed a new tic of lying that he doesn\u2019t understand his interviewer\u2019s questions. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by breaking a red wall,\u201d he lied to Ferrari about a term that has been bandied about by his Tory strategists the entire campaign. It was the same last week when people were asking him questions about the film of him taking the piss out of Donald Trump with some other Nato leaders. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what is being referred to,\u201d he lied then. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come from.\u201d The prime minister remains a man whose deep personal philosophy can be summed up by the video for Shaggy\u2019s It Wasn\u2019t Me.</p> \n<p>His other stylistic trait has been linking two things that have precisely no bearing on the other. Asked by Ferrari about Jack Williment-Barr, Johnson appeared to suggest that the real illness is Britain\u2019s political constipation. Not having Brexit is \u201cblocking things\u201d, he explained. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve got things motoring,\u201d he suggested, situations like a small child being treated on a floor would no longer occur, \u201cbut that can only happen when we\u2019ve got Brexit done.\u201d Hang on, what? Why? What in the name of logic, never mind empathy, are you talking about? We expect sociopathy, but at least lace it with basic coherence.</p> \n<p>Then again, we have reached the stage of the campaign where Johnson\u2019s words feel terminally unmoored from reality. Take his Grimsby visit, where he offered fishermen \u201cthe chance to recapture some of that spectacular marine wealth\u201d \u2013 a way of putting it that makes one of the country\u2019s most hardscrabble industries sound easily as rewarding as running a hedge fund. Follow Johnson, even if it goes against your instincts, and he will make you fishers of men. Which is to say that you\u2019ll be retraining as cold callers if you currently fish sustainably, then he ends up going for no-deal and you lose paper-free access to the single market. And that\u2019s if he hasn\u2019t had your phone off you, preventing you from even making the calls.</p>",

Look at it now, said Pike, who had it up on his phone. At which point Johnson simply took the reporter\u2019s phone and stuffed it in his pocket. What has happened to reality? What can you say? Other than: may all would-be statesmen disport themselves with the casual larceny of a guy who knows if you don\u2019t let the legal papers physically touch you, then they haven\u2019t been served on you. For my money, the inclusion of the auto-satirical words \u201cprime minister\u201d at the end of Pike\u2019s next sentence mark it out as a contender for quote of the campaign. Let\u2019s see them in action: \u201cYou refuse to look at the photo, you\u2019ve taken my phone, and put it in your pocket, prime minister.\u201d YOU\u2019VE ROBBED HIS PHONE LIVE ON AIR. Sorry \u2013 you\u2019ve robbed his phone live on air, prime minister. A pause. \u201cSorry,\u201d said the prime minister of the United Kingdom, eventually, fumbling around in his pocket for another man\u2019s phone and some more lies. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have taken your phone, but there you go,\u201d blustered Johnson. \u201cI was just \u2026\u201d But he couldn\u2019t finish the sentence. How on earth could he have finished the sentence? He simply tailed off. Later, at a Q&amp;A in a Sunderland factory, Johnson appeared to float scrapping the BBC licence fee simply to distract from this story \u2013 a move that vaguely reminded me of Bill Clinton bombing the Sudanese aspirin factory to distract from his blowjob hearings. As Johnson put it: \u201cI\u2019m under pressure not to extemporise policy on the hoof.\u201d Incorrect. You\u2019re under pressure because you nicked a phone live on telly. When she was through the looking glass, the White Queen famously told Alice that \u201csometimes I\u2019ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast\u201d. No offence to Her Majesty, but this is an incredibly low score if you\u2019ve been listening to Boris Johnson\u2019s early morning media round. That said, the PM\u2019s breakfast interview with Nick Ferrari on LBC on Monday gave us a little insight into his process \u2013 kind of like an episode of Inside the Liar\u2019s Studio. The prime minister allowed lucky listeners a real-time chance to see how he turns in some of his more memorable mendacious performances. Take the other sort of lying \u2013 lying on the floor in front of bulldozers, which he\u2019d once promised to do if Heathrow went ahead with a third runway, but which now appears in direct opposition to government policy. Is he going to do it? wondered Ferrari, rhetorically. \u201cI would \u2026 have to find some way of honouring that promise,\u201d mused Johnson, like one of those pundits who promise to eat their shoe live on air if something doesn\u2019t happen, then are proved wrong, but eat a shoe made out of cake and imagine they\u2019re quits. Like this, but with his entire climate morality. \u201cIt might be technically difficult to achieve,\u201d Johnson continued, ostensibly talking about the bulldozers, but subconsciously surely weighing up the technical challenges of the lie. This would be a 4 \u00bd reverse ferret, in the pike position, with 2 \u00bd twists. Technically difficult to achieve \u2013 near-impossible to guarantee a perfect 10 from the Russian judge \u2013 yet somehow entirely doable for this most tireless of all competitors. Even when not actively advancing one of his own lies, Johnson has developed a new tic of lying that he doesn\u2019t understand his interviewer\u2019s questions. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by breaking a red wall,\u201d he lied to Ferrari about a term that has been bandied about by his Tory strategists the entire campaign. It was the same last week when people were asking him questions about the film of him taking the piss out of Donald Trump with some other Nato leaders. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what is being referred to,\u201d he lied then. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come from.\u201d The prime minister remains a man whose deep personal philosophy can be summed up by the video for Shaggy\u2019s It Wasn\u2019t Me. His other stylistic trait has been linking two things that have precisely no bearing on the other. Asked by Ferrari about Jack Williment-Barr, Johnson appeared to suggest that the real illness is Britain\u2019s political constipation. Not having Brexit is \u201cblocking things\u201d, he explained. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve got things motoring,\u201d he suggested, situations like a small child being treated on a floor would no longer occur, \u201cbut that can only happen when we\u2019ve got Brexit done.\u201d Hang on, what? Why? What in the name of logic, never mind empathy, are you talking about? We expect sociopathy, but at least lace it with basic coherence. Then again, we have reached the stage of the campaign where Johnson\u2019s words feel terminally unmoored from reality. Take his Grimsby visit, where he offered fishermen \u201cthe chance to recapture some of that spectacular marine wealth\u201d \u2013 a way of putting it that makes one of the country\u2019s most hardscrabble industries sound easily as rewarding as running a hedge fund. Follow Johnson, even if it goes against your instincts, and he will make you fishers of men. Which is to say that you\u2019ll be retraining as cold callers if you currently fish sustainably, then he ends up going for no-deal and you lose paper-free access to the single market. And that\u2019s if he hasn\u2019t had your phone off you, preventing you from even making the calls.",

It contains the line \u201cspecial night, beard that\u2019s white\u201d. Guaranteed to entertain a section of Guardian readers of a certain age, and also has an excellent video to accompany it.

      "bodyText": "A teenager\u2019s claim that another gang member stole his clothes and wore them during the murder of 14-year-old Jaden Moodie is \u201cpreposterous\u201d, a court has been told. Ayoub Majdouline, 19, is accused of being part of a drug gang who rammed Jaden to the ground with a car before stabbing him with three knives and leaving him to bleed to death in the street in Leyton, east London. One of the five people involved in the attack was wearing Majdouline\u2019s jeans, black jacket and yellow rubber gloves. The defendant\u2019s DNA was found on the discarded jeans and gloves \u2013 which also had Jaden\u2019s DNA on them \u2013 as well as the handle of a knife, which had traces of Jaden\u2019s blood on the blade. The prosecutor, Oliver Glasgow QC, said the attacker identified as \u201csuspect two\u201d, who was captured on CCTV, wore the same grey hoodie and black trainers as Majdouline \u2013 although the defendant denies these were his \u2013 and was the same size and had the same skin colour as him. Majdouline has claimed the clothes were stolen after he left them in a JD Sports bag in a drugs safe house and were then worn during the killing of Jaden. However, in his closing submissions at the Old Bailey on Monday, Glasgow said: \u201cThe idea that he simply left his bag of clothes behind is preposterous.\u201d He said Majdouline, despite admitting being associated with the Mali boys gang, was contending he was the victim of an \u201cunfortunate mistake\u201d. Jaden suffered catastrophic injuries from nine stab wounds inflicted in seven seconds as he lay in the road on 8 January. The prosecution case is that Majdouline and four accomplices killed Jaden in \u201cthe most shocking and brutal fashion\u201d because he was dealing drugs for a rival east London gang, the Beaumont Crew, or Let\u2019s Get Rich gang. Glasgow said: \u201cThe murder of Jaden Moodie was clearly a gang attack. It was a ride out, committed by those who had planned the violence.\u201d He said the killers were fuelled by an attitude that \u201cwe can do what we want, when we want, to who we want and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it\u201d. The court has previously heard that after a referral in 2017 Majdouline had last year been deemed by the National Crime Agency to be a victim of modern slavery. Majdouline, whose father died in 2015, had left his mother\u2019s home after being abused by his stepfather and was seen in Hampshire, an area with which he had no connection, in the company of a known drug dealer. Addressing the defendant\u2019s background, Glasgow said: \u201cHe chose to get involved in drug dealing. Ultimately, he chose to go out ready and willing to kill anyone from the opposition \u2026 He chose to do what he did because being a Mali boy means more than the lives of their rivals \u2026 There\u2019s no doubt he was taken advantage of, that\u2019s what the drug business is all about \u2026 but no one made him do this.\u201d At times, the defendant shook his head as he listened to the prosecutor, while at other times bowing his head. Beginning his summing up, the defence counsel, James Scobie QC, described his client as \u201cisolated\u201d and \u201ctroubled\u201d and suggested Majdouline had been mocked by the prosecution during cross-examination. Although his client admitted carrying a knife in the past, Scobie said there was no evidence of him ever using it or having been involved in gang violence in the past. He also questioned why Majdouline\u2019s DNA had not been found in the Mercedes car used during the attack on Jaden. Majdouline denies murder and an additional charge of carrying a knife.

      "body": "<p>On Saturday, the Sun published an exclusive story by its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, which announced that a group of former British intelligence officers had uncovered a \u201chard-left extremist network\u201d at the heart of the Labour party. \u201c<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20191207145207/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10501848/jeremy-corbyn-extremist-network/\" title=\"\">HIJACKED LABOUR</a>\u201d declared the piece, which went on to claim that Jeremy Corbyn sits at the centre of a \u201cspider\u2019s web of extensive contacts\u201d that stretch \u201cfrom Marxist intellectuals to militant groups and illegal terror organisations\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A global online ecosystem has grown up that bridges the gap between the far right and the mainstream</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The piece directed readers towards a <a href=\"https://hijackedlabour.com/\" title=\"\">website featuring a network map</a> that it said had been compiled by ex-military veterans \u201cin their spare time\u201d to reveal \u201cwhat they insist is now a party firmly in the grip of a hardline cabal\u201d. Each of the 490 organisations or individuals listed was presented as a node on a network, with an attached fact file and further reading links.</p> <p>But when readers began to inspect the map more closely, we found that several entries on the chart included extreme rightwing material among their sources. One fact file recommended a \u201ccritique\u201d of anti-fascism posted on the antisemitic conspiracy website the Millennium Report \u2013 which also features articles on such topics as \u201cthe Jewish hand in the world wars\u201d and \u201cexposing Jewish Zionism\u201d. Another fact file pointed readers towards the website Aryan Unity \u2013 once the mouthpiece of the British People\u2019s party, a defunct neo-Nazi group. These were presented without caveats, as apparently trustworthy sources.</p> <p>Before the end of the day, the story had been removed from the paper\u2019s website \u2013 without acknowledgement or explanation from Newton Dunn or his bosses. (The Sun declined to comment, and Newton Dunn has not responded to my questions.)</p> <p>This was more than a case of sloppy sourcing: the map itself is drenched in conspiratorial thinking. It describes obvious political connections \u2013 for instance, that Corbyn and other senior Labour MPs are linked to trade union officials \u2013 in a way that implies these are part of a wider shadowy network. This network apparently includes the IRA, Hamas and the Colombian guerilla group Farc; \u201cradical\u201d members of the British Medical Association; and various anti-war, anti-racist and anarchist groups, many of whom don\u2019t even get on with each other. The chart also links Corbyn\u2019s Labour party to a range of living and deceased philosophers, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/22/stanley-fish-donald-trump-winning-arguments-2016-election\" title=\"\">Stanley Fish</a>, \u201cJacques Derrida RIP\u201d and \u201cRichard Rorty RIP\u201d.</p> <p>The argument here is that this \u201chard-left extremist network\u201d shares an insidious and unpatriotic ideology: \u201cpostmodern neo-Marxism\u201d. As one of the researchers told the Sun, this is \u201can ideology which specifically encourages its supporters to tell lies, because it denies the existence of any absolute truth\u201d. Various independent media outlets were featured on the map, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/01/lib-dems-suspend-campaigner-over-apparent-email-forgery\" title=\"\">openDemocracy</a> \u2013 George Soros was listed among its funders \u2013 as well as a number of high-profile journalists, including Guardian contributors.</p> <p>So how did the Sun, one of the UK\u2019s most widely read newspapers, come to publish it? The answer reveals how easily far-right conspiracy theories now circulate between fringe outlets and the mainstream media. The map linked to by the Sun closely resembles an earlier graphic that first appeared online in August, under the name the Traitor\u2019s Chart.

The website\u2019s only other significant intervention to date has been a pro-Brexit polemic that <a href=\"https://www.irishpost.com/news/brexit-article-branding-ireland-land-puppy-farms-drug-mule-celebs-sparks-anger-131620\" title=\"\">described Ireland as</a> a \u201cland of puppy farms, rain-soaked holidays, dingy bars, drugs mule celebs, verbal diarrhoea and squeaky fiddles\u201d, also now deleted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55b360c7f72d01bb58024059343903c8d093f752\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55b360c7f72d01bb58024059343903c8d093f752/0_0_600_567/500.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Trilling tweet\" width=\"500\" height=\"473\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Traitors\u2019 Chart, which was larger than its successor and included the names of even more high-profile journalists, was then picked up by the international far-right media network, Breitbart, whose UK editor, James Delingpole, <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/08/27/british-culture-thrall-radical-left-boris-over-to-you/\" title=\"\">wrote about it</a> on 27 August.

(Since the Sun took down its story, the map has been revised once more, removing the links to neo-Nazi and antisemitic websites.)</p> <p>Conspiracy theories offer a simple way to explain complex power relationships and patterns of cause and effect. Individuals are more likely to turn to them when they feel powerless or when they lack the tools to analyse the world in other ways. They can flourish within any political tradition \u2013 look, for instance, at the \u201cCorbyn did Brexit\u201d rhetoric among some liberal remainers, who believe he sabotaged the referendum.

In the UK, there has been a concerted effort from mainstream conservatives to depict Corbyn, and by extension the whole Labour party, as a deadly threat to the nation.

Burnley said in a statement that the alleged abuse by the supporter, who was accompanied by a guardian at Saturday\u2019s game, is being investigated by the Metropolitan police, assisted by Lancashire police and the two clubs. Burnley added that it will be contacting the teenager and his family with a view to an \u201cenforced educational programme\u201d, run in conjunction with football\u2019s anti-discrimination campaign Kick It Out and Burnley\u2019s community programme. Kick It Out has been running programmes for some years aiming to help educate people who have committed acts of discrimination.

      "body": "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that any of us can ever accept the inevitability of our own death. Life is too bloody wonderful.\u201d So wrote Kate Figes, who has died of cancer aged 62, in <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-7685757/How-carry-diagnosis-incurable-cancer-Kate-Figes-writes.html\" title=\"\">her final piece of journalism</a>, published only a fortnight ago. After listing some of the medical crises that had made her life rather less than wonderful over the last few months, she concluded that even this terrible year had its \u201csurprising silver lining\u201d, in that \u201cby coming that much closer to dying I have learned a little more about how to live well.\u201d Living well, for Figes, meant continuing to look beyond her own determined struggle to beat the odds.</p> <p>Born in London into a family of writers, she found her own writing niche as a smart and accessible synthesiser of complex information, an indefatigable interviewer and an astute observer of people. It was not until her early 30s that she plucked up the courage to write full-time, because \u201cit\u2019s not easy to believe you can when your own mother is one too\u201d.</p> <p>In 1994, she published the first of seven non-fiction books, Because of Her Sex: The Myth of Equality for Women in Britain. A part-time job as fiction editor for Cosmopolitan led to commissions to write for newspapers, and in 1996 she became books editor for the Mail on Sunday\u2019s You magazine, a position she held until her death.</p> <p>In her early 30s, too, she married Christoph Wyld, a BBC foreign news editor she had met years earlier as a student on language placement in Russia, and gave birth to their two daughters, Eleanor and Grace. \u201cIn retrospect, motherhood is the best thing that ever happened to me,\u201d she wrote, in a second book that made no bones about the conflicting emotions of its early stages.</p> <p>Maternal ambivalence was such a taboo at the time that she received hate mail when Life After Birth was published in 1998; on its reissue 10 years later, she reflected that, while early motherhood was now widely discussed, the conditions facing women in terms of support both during and after birth had barely changed.</p> <p>Her two forays into fiction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/14/booksonhealth.lifeandhealth\" title=\"\">What About Me?</a> (2004) and What About Me, Too? (2006), were light relief from the heavy lifting of her non-fiction \u2013 mouthy comic novels, written in emails, which reprised her recurring preoccupation with mother-daughter relationships.</p> <p>Her difficult relationship with her own mother came up again in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jan/26/gender.society\" title=\"\">The Big Fat Bitch Book for Girls</a> (2007), the first of a series of books for the imprint Virago. It combined sensible, research-based advice with painful personal reminiscences and mischievous recommendations for \u201ctop bitch viewing\u201d (Mae West on Jayne Mansfield: \u201cI heard she never turns anything down except the bedcovers.\u201d)</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/16/relationships-couples-kate-figes\" title=\"\">Couples</a> (2010) she brought the same formula to long-term relationships, and three years later she moved on to infidelity, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/16/our-cheating-hearts-figes-review\" title=\"\">Our Cheating Hearts \u2013 Love and Loyalty, Lust and Lies</a>. Her great gift, according to her publisher Lennie Goodings, was her ability to move from the personal to the general, from the specific to the more universal in a way that illuminates and really helps us to understand life.</p> <p>Typically, a recent outing to the opera produced the observation that the queues for the men\u2019s loos were longer than those for the women\u2019s because of the prevalence of prostate problems in its elderly clientele. Behind such witty apercus lay the \u201cenormous, boisterous laugh\u201d that her friends recall as one of Figes\u2019s defining characteristics, along with her loyalty and her fierce zest for life.</p> <p>Yet her final book \u2013 a memoir, On Smaller Dogs and Larger Life Questions, published last year \u2013 painted her as a sad and needy child. The elder of two children of the feminist author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/07/eva-figes\" title=\"\">Eva Figes</a> (nee Unger) and her husband, John Figes, a personnel consultant, Kate was five years old when her parents split up, leaving her feeling abandoned and unable to confide in anyone about being badly bullied at her north London primary school.</p> <p>In her memoir, she wrote that \u201cthe isolation and loneliness of that small girl who wandered between a home riven with the acrimony of divorce and terrible exclusion at school still haunts me sometimes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee6f8dfd0d013a7d99bfd60b6af538911648a1f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee6f8dfd0d013a7d99bfd60b6af538911648a1f2/0_75_2059_1236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Figes in the 1990s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Figes in the 1990s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kenneth Saunders/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a household dominated by the working routine of a single mother who was also a driven writer, she formed a close bond with her younger brother, Orlando. She went to Camden school for girls, in north London. In a book about teenagers, The Terrible Teens, published in 2002 as her own daughters were hitting adolescence, she recalled smoking too much dope, failing her French A-level \u201cnot once but twice\u201d and leaving home at 17 after a row with her mother.</p> <p>She held it together well enough to win a place to study Arabic and Russian at the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster). Her first job in the world of books was as a sales rep for the feminist publisher Pandora, for whom she went on to become a publicist and an editor. She carried its values energetically into her writing life.</p> <p>Asked in an interview later in life how she relaxed, she listed tennis, walking, cooking, eating, listening to music and going to the theatre and staring out to sea from a beach hut on the south coast that she shared with a friend. On tennis, for which she conceived a mid-life passion, she was particularly eloquent, revealing a side of herself that wasn\u2019t about diligently listening and honourably reporting.</p> <p>\u201cI know that a \u2018good\u2019 girl is supposed to be kind, enabling of others, nice \u2013 not expressing all those natural human emotions of anger and selfishness,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cBut in tennis there is a freedom to be me - sweaty and sunburnt, competitive and crafty, exuberantly lost in all the joy of play.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, eight months after learning that she had an aggressive form of breast cancer, she and Orlando went to the German embassy to reclaim the German nationality their mother had lost when her Jewish family fled Berlin in 1939. Recalling the day in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/my-family-after-the-holocaust-reclaim-german-nationality-kate-figes\" title=\"\">an article for the Guardian</a>, she wrote, \u201cI wore a cashmere jumper [in memory of her smartly dressed grandmother] and placed my mother\u2019s 1960s necklace on top, so I could take Eva with us, too.\u201d</p> <p>She is survived by Christoph, Eleanor and Grace, and Orlando.</p> <p>\u2022 Kate Figes, writer, born 6 November 1957; died 7 December 2019<em> </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 December 2019.

Born in London into a family of writers, she found her own writing niche as a smart and accessible synthesiser of complex information, an indefatigable interviewer and an astute observer of people. It was not until her early 30s that she plucked up the courage to write full-time, because \u201cit\u2019s not easy to believe you can when your own mother is one too\u201d. In 1994, she published the first of seven non-fiction books, Because of Her Sex: The Myth of Equality for Women in Britain. A part-time job as fiction editor for Cosmopolitan led to commissions to write for newspapers, and in 1996 she became books editor for the Mail on Sunday\u2019s You magazine, a position she held until her death. In her early 30s, too, she married Christoph Wyld, a BBC foreign news editor she had met years earlier as a student on language placement in Russia, and gave birth to their two daughters, Eleanor and Grace. \u201cIn retrospect, motherhood is the best thing that ever happened to me,\u201d she wrote, in a second book that made no bones about the conflicting emotions of its early stages. Maternal ambivalence was such a taboo at the time that she received hate mail when Life After Birth was published in 1998; on its reissue 10 years later, she reflected that, while early motherhood was now widely discussed, the conditions facing women in terms of support both during and after birth had barely changed. Her two forays into fiction, What About Me? (2004) and What About Me, Too? (2006), were light relief from the heavy lifting of her non-fiction \u2013 mouthy comic novels, written in emails, which reprised her recurring preoccupation with mother-daughter relationships. Her difficult relationship with her own mother came up again in The Big Fat Bitch Book for Girls (2007), the first of a series of books for the imprint Virago. It combined sensible, research-based advice with painful personal reminiscences and mischievous recommendations for \u201ctop bitch viewing\u201d (Mae West on Jayne Mansfield: \u201cI heard she never turns anything down except the bedcovers.\u201d) In Couples (2010) she brought the same formula to long-term relationships, and three years later she moved on to infidelity, with Our Cheating Hearts \u2013 Love and Loyalty, Lust and Lies. Her great gift, according to her publisher Lennie Goodings, was her ability to move from the personal to the general, from the specific to the more universal in a way that illuminates and really helps us to understand life. Typically, a recent outing to the opera produced the observation that the queues for the men\u2019s loos were longer than those for the women\u2019s because of the prevalence of prostate problems in its elderly clientele. Behind such witty apercus lay the \u201cenormous, boisterous laugh\u201d that her friends recall as one of Figes\u2019s defining characteristics, along with her loyalty and her fierce zest for life. Yet her final book \u2013 a memoir, On Smaller Dogs and Larger Life Questions, published last year \u2013 painted her as a sad and needy child. The elder of two children of the feminist author Eva Figes (nee Unger) and her husband, John Figes, a personnel consultant, Kate was five years old when her parents split up, leaving her feeling abandoned and unable to confide in anyone about being badly bullied at her north London primary school. In her memoir, she wrote that \u201cthe isolation and loneliness of that small girl who wandered between a home riven with the acrimony of divorce and terrible exclusion at school still haunts me sometimes\u201d. In a household dominated by the working routine of a single mother who was also a driven writer, she formed a close bond with her younger brother, Orlando. She went to Camden school for girls, in north London. In a book about teenagers, The Terrible Teens, published in 2002 as her own daughters were hitting adolescence, she recalled smoking too much dope, failing her French A-level \u201cnot once but twice\u201d and leaving home at 17 after a row with her mother. She held it together well enough to win a place to study Arabic and Russian at the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster). Her first job in the world of books was as a sales rep for the feminist publisher Pandora, for whom she went on to become a publicist and an editor. She carried its values energetically into her writing life. Asked in an interview later in life how she relaxed, she listed tennis, walking, cooking, eating, listening to music and going to the theatre and staring out to sea from a beach hut on the south coast that she shared with a friend. On tennis, for which she conceived a mid-life passion, she was particularly eloquent, revealing a side of herself that wasn\u2019t about diligently listening and honourably reporting. \u201cI know that a \u2018good\u2019 girl is supposed to be kind, enabling of others, nice \u2013 not expressing all those natural human emotions of anger and selfishness,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cBut in tennis there is a freedom to be me - sweaty and sunburnt, competitive and crafty, exuberantly lost in all the joy of play.\u201d In 2017, eight months after learning that she had an aggressive form of breast cancer, she and Orlando went to the German embassy to reclaim the German nationality their mother had lost when her Jewish family fled Berlin in 1939. Recalling the day in an article for the Guardian, she wrote, \u201cI wore a cashmere jumper [in memory of her smartly dressed grandmother] and placed my mother\u2019s 1960s necklace on top, so I could take Eva with us, too.\u201d She is survived by Christoph, Eleanor and Grace, and Orlando. \u2022 Kate Figes, writer, born 6 November 1957; died 7 December 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 10 December 2019. Eva Figes\u2019 family fled Berlin in 1939 rather than 1937.",

Before the attack she had been optimistic, felt safe in the world and had spoken about starting a family with her partner but now feels her life aspirations have been \u201cviolently taken away\u201d and spends her time avoiding things that could remind her of her trauma, such as her old neighbourhood and intimacy with her partner. \u201cI have been met with the utmost care, empathy and respect by nurses, doctors, advisers and police officers, to whom I owe more thanks than it is possible to express,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, the evident scarcity, underresourcing and overstretching of specialist services for survivors has intensified my sense of isolation and abandonment by a society in which I used to feel safe. It feels like what has happened to me is not a social priority unless it\u2019s being sensationalised in the news.\u201d Her statement was read out at the Old Bailey at her request after she had spent the previous months looking for reassurance that she was not alone in the stories of other victims and survivors. Immediately after the attack, she was scared to go home, did not return for weeks and eventually had to move as the property and neighbourhood were full of reminders that triggered flashbacks and made her feel constantly unsafe. \u201cIt took me weeks to be able to walk a few doors down the road to a local shop on my own, with my thumb hovering over the button on the panic phone in my pocket.\u201d The woman concluded by saying that, while she was glad that justice was being sought, the trial was also an intensely traumatic event. Speaking of \u201cthe misplaced guilt which often plagues victims of rape and sexual assault\u201d, she added that the questions asked of her in court were the same that kept her up at night, namely: \u201cCould I, should I have acted differently, got away sooner? \u201cThe defence\u2019s questions echoed, and threatened to confirm, these intrusive and distressing thoughts. \u201cThe fact that I am here to write this statement is testament to the answer: no. I had one chance. I did what I could in a situation that thankfully most people have no experience or understanding of \u2013 a situation for which nothing in my life had prepared me \u2013 and I survived.\u201d The British Medical Association said it knew waiting times for mental health treatment were unacceptably long, but that examples such as that of the McCann victim were \u201cstark illustrations of the tragic human impact behind the statistics\u201d. Dr Andrew Molodynksi, a BMA mental health spokesman, added: \u201cPeople need help when they are at their most vulnerable, and no one should be forced to pay for treatment that should be available on the NHS. Indeed, for many this is simply not an option.\u201d",

Upon returning to Canberra, I discovered a wind change had meant the nation\u2019s capital was now enveloped in a haze of smoke \u2013 and expected to be so for the rest of the week. This, I need not tell you, is not normal. Because of climate change, areas of south-eastern Australia are going to be drier and hotter, the times for doing preventative hazard reduction burning will shrink, and as a result our fire seasons will become longer, and the fires will become more intense. This is due to one thing \u2013 climate change. The only way to prevent this is to reduce our emissions and to pressure the rest of the world to reduce emissions as well. We are not doing either of those things. Last week the latest emissions projection figures came out.

Little wonder that the rest of the world are currently trying to prevent Australia from using \u201ccarryover credits\u201d from our Kyoto commitment to count towards our Paris target. This matters because the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has argued that to ensure temperatures don\u2019t rise by 1.5C we need to cut emissions by 45% by 2030. That is real emissions, not fake emissions using dodgy land use accounting and carryover credits. We are not even close to achieving that. It is a failure that should shame the LNP, and yet ... Here\u2019s a dirty secret \u2013 there are two reasons the LNP has a joke of a climate change policy: they are full of climate change deniers, and secondly there is zero pressure from the ALP for them to develop one. The ALP remains far more worried about looking like it is attacking people who work in coalmines than getting on the front foot on climate change. It is 2019 and the leader of the ALP is now repeating lines about our exports of coals that Tony Abbott used. It is 2019 and the ALP acts as if putting a price on carbon is the most radical and politically horrific idea ever conceived (and never shows any pride that the carbon price introduced under Gillard was one the biggest economic reforms of the past 40 years). Ask yourself who in the ALP \u2013 even some young backbencher or senator \u2013 is pushing so hard on climate change policy that the leaders are wishing he or she might tone it down a little?

      "bodyText": "The Australian Capital Territory will continue to push for pill-testing nationally after an independent review confirmed a trial in Canberra encouraged buyers of a synthetic ecstasy substitute to ditch unsafe drugs. The Australian National University evaluation of pill-testing at Groovin the Moo in April, released on Tuesday, declared the trial of 234 patrons a success because \u201call those who had a very dangerous substance detected disposed of that drug in the amnesty bin\u201d. The study found all seven festival patrons whose pills were found to contain the highly toxic chemical N-Ethylpentylone, a drug sold as MDMA and associated with deaths in the US and New Zealand, disposed of their drugs. It found that more than 40% of patrons who used the service said they intended to reduce the quantity of drugs they would use (28%), not use them at all, or have only alcohol (13%). The ACT health and youth minister, Rachel Stephen-Smith, said she would bring the results to the next health ministers\u2019 meeting in 2020 because governments have a responsibility \u201cto not only try and prevent drug use but also to support initiatives that reduce the harms associated with drug use\u201d. \u201cI hope all states and territories consider these findings seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cAcross the country we have seen too many avoidable deaths at music festivals. It is obvious current processes and policies are not working and more needs to be done.\u201d In neighbouring New South Wales, a coronial inquest into drug-related festival deaths has called for pill-testing to be introduced permanently, but the call was rebuffed by the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, who claims it gives potential drug users a \u201ca false sense of security\u201d. Victoria has also rejected calls for a trial. The ANU study found most patrons who presented a sample believed they had MDMA (89.5%), and 91% of them were correct. \u201cWhen a patron was told that their drug was not what they expected it to be, they were less likely to take that drug,\u201d it said. \u201cWhen a patron was told that their drug was what they expected it to be, they were more likely to take that drug.\u201d Despite the fact more than 40% planned to reduce or not use drugs, 19% reported that they planned to use the same amount and 8% said they would use more of the drug than originally planned. One quarter (26%) were not sure how the test results would influence their intentions. The lead researcher, Anna Olsen, said the fact the service led to harm reduction behaviours among patrons was a key marker of success, including disposing of highly dangerous drugs when they were identified. \u201cAnd for people who go on to take the drug they had tested, we found evidence for risk-reducing behaviours such as taking less of the drug, spacing out their drug consumption and taking other safety precautions like drinking lots of water,\u201d she said. \u201cOur evaluation team applauds the ACT government for showing such leadership on this issue and the open-mindedness and willingness to work with the relevant experts and services to trial this service, building the evidence base for policymaking in this space.\u201d The study found the trial produced \u201cvaluable information about illicit drug availability\u201d, including identification of N-Ethylpentylone, a substance \u201cpreviously unidentified in the ACT\u201d, and confirmation of increased prevalence and purity of MDMA in Canberra. The first trial of pill-testing in April 2018 had similarly positive results, with 30% of respondents suggesting they would not take drugs or take fewer as a result.",

      "body": "<p>A Christmas lunch with all the trimmings is never a budget-friendly proposition, but this year between drought, African swine fever and rising grocery store prices, costs may be particularly high.</p> <p>But making a few strategic switches will help with creating a feast that is just as impressive.</p> <p>Jackie Middleton, the director and head food nerd at EARL Canteen has created a Christmas main and dessert that take into account rising prices, and still look (and taste) like Christmas. She also shares her tips for keeping Christmas costs down.</p> <h2>To save on seafood: buy ahead of time</h2> <p>\u201cThe quality of seafood available is terrible at Christmas time,\u201d says Middleton. \u201cBecause there\u2019s so much demand and so little availability.\u201d</p> <p>Her solution is to get your seafood shopping done as soon as possible. \u201cGreen [raw] prawns are highly perishable,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Australia, pretty much every prawn that we eat has been frozen before it even gets to us. If they\u2019re wild-caught they\u2019re usually frozen on the boat, or if they\u2019re farmed they pretty much process, freeze them, then distribute and defrost them in supermarkets and seafood shops.\u201d</p> <p>Buying frozen prawns now and keeping them in your freezer at home will help you avoid Christmas price hikes \u2013 without compromising on quality. You will need to buy in larger quantities \u2013 usually 1kg minimum \u2013 but \u201cIQF [individually quick frozen] is an ideal option for whole or cutlet [peeled apart from the small tail] prawn tails. Just defrost as many as you need at a time.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cSome retailers at markets will cook prawns onsite so they are freshly cooked, but usually they are buying them frozen and defrosting, as customers are used to buying \u2018fresh\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Middleton also suggests slices of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/jan/07/how-to-make-perfect-gravadlax-cured-salmon-recipe\">home-cured salmon </a>because \u201cit\u2019s only a small portion but you get a beautiful dramatic effect, and you\u2019ve put some love into it yourself.\u201d Cured salmon can also be prepared up to five days in advance.</p> <h2>To save on sides: shop seasonally</h2> <p>Middleton suggests abandoning notions of \u201ctraditional\u201d Christmas sides in favour of what is local and abundant. \u201cCrisp green beans \u2026 can get expensive in the summer. They can be up to $15 a kilo, which is ridiculous. Whereas broccoli is $5 or $6 a kilo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you eat within the season, prices usually aren\u2019t too bad. Things like stone fruit go really well with Christmas flavours. I do an asparagus, peach and walnut salad \u2013 it feels festive.\u201d</p> <h2>For the main: pick chicken</h2> <p>\u201cThe pork price has increased by at least 50% since June,\u201d says Middleton. \u201cEARL buys about one and a half tonnes of pork every week, so I\u2019m really across the prices. It\u2019s going through the roof.\u201d</p> <p>This price rise is largely due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/18/china-auction-pork-reserves\">African swine fever</a>. While the illness hasn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/african-swine-fever-the-deadly-virus-at-australias-doorstep\">reached Australian shores yet</a>, increased international demand for pork is driving local prices up. The price of other classic Christmas meats, like lamb, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/nov/07/the-price-of-lamb-has-soared-200-since-the-90s-now-the-drought-is-sending-it-even-higher\">has also been increasing</a> year-on-year.</p> <p>For a cheaper Christmas protein, Middleton suggests \u201ctricked-up chicken\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re still getting those flavours of Christmas, which many people think of as pork or ham, but into a cheaper option.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/08/5-foolproof-recipes-christmas-curry-black-forest-ossobuco\">Five foolproof recipes to get you through Christmas</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Prosciutto-wrapped chicken with sage and currant stuffing-inspired bread salad</strong></h2> <p>Taking cues from traditional Christmas sage and onion stuffing, and the classic Zuni roast chicken, this crusty bread salad soaks up the pan juices and melds the components together to create festive flavours that feel modern.

      "bodyText": "A Christmas lunch with all the trimmings is never a budget-friendly proposition, but this year between drought, African swine fever and rising grocery store prices, costs may be particularly high. But making a few strategic switches will help with creating a feast that is just as impressive. Jackie Middleton, the director and head food nerd at EARL Canteen has created a Christmas main and dessert that take into account rising prices, and still look (and taste) like Christmas. She also shares her tips for keeping Christmas costs down. To save on seafood: buy ahead of time \u201cThe quality of seafood available is terrible at Christmas time,\u201d says Middleton. \u201cBecause there\u2019s so much demand and so little availability.\u201d Her solution is to get your seafood shopping done as soon as possible. \u201cGreen [raw] prawns are highly perishable,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Australia, pretty much every prawn that we eat has been frozen before it even gets to us. If they\u2019re wild-caught they\u2019re usually frozen on the boat, or if they\u2019re farmed they pretty much process, freeze them, then distribute and defrost them in supermarkets and seafood shops.\u201d Buying frozen prawns now and keeping them in your freezer at home will help you avoid Christmas price hikes \u2013 without compromising on quality. You will need to buy in larger quantities \u2013 usually 1kg minimum \u2013 but \u201cIQF [individually quick frozen] is an ideal option for whole or cutlet [peeled apart from the small tail] prawn tails. Just defrost as many as you need at a time.\u201d She adds: \u201cSome retailers at markets will cook prawns onsite so they are freshly cooked, but usually they are buying them frozen and defrosting, as customers are used to buying \u2018fresh\u2019.\u201d Middleton also suggests slices of home-cured salmon because \u201cit\u2019s only a small portion but you get a beautiful dramatic effect, and you\u2019ve put some love into it yourself.\u201d Cured salmon can also be prepared up to five days in advance. To save on sides: shop seasonally Middleton suggests abandoning notions of \u201ctraditional\u201d Christmas sides in favour of what is local and abundant. \u201cCrisp green beans \u2026 can get expensive in the summer. They can be up to $15 a kilo, which is ridiculous. Whereas broccoli is $5 or $6 a kilo.\u201d \u201cIf you eat within the season, prices usually aren\u2019t too bad. Things like stone fruit go really well with Christmas flavours. I do an asparagus, peach and walnut salad \u2013 it feels festive.\u201d For the main: pick chicken \u201cThe pork price has increased by at least 50% since June,\u201d says Middleton. \u201cEARL buys about one and a half tonnes of pork every week, so I\u2019m really across the prices. It\u2019s going through the roof.\u201d This price rise is largely due to African swine fever. While the illness hasn\u2019t reached Australian shores yet, increased international demand for pork is driving local prices up. The price of other classic Christmas meats, like lamb, has also been increasing year-on-year. For a cheaper Christmas protein, Middleton suggests \u201ctricked-up chicken\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re still getting those flavours of Christmas, which many people think of as pork or ham, but into a cheaper option.\u201d Prosciutto-wrapped chicken with sage and currant stuffing-inspired bread salad Taking cues from traditional Christmas sage and onion stuffing, and the classic Zuni roast chicken, this crusty bread salad soaks up the pan juices and melds the components together to create festive flavours that feel modern. It also stretches the portions out when there\u2019s a crowd to feed. \u201cKiev-cut\u201d is the chicken breast fillet with the small wing bone still attached. It takes the presentation of this dish to the next level and creates a nifty handle for Boxing Day leftover snacks. Ask your butcher to cut these for you or just use skin-on breast fillets without the bone. Serves 6, with intentional left overs 6 Kiev-cut free-range chicken breasts, skin-on, about 300-350g each, cut from size 18 birds 200g prosciutto, sliced thin For the sauce 70g currants 30g balsamic vinegar Sea salt 100ml extra virgin olive oil For the bread salad 400g sourdough, thick cut Sea salt Olive oil to drizzle \u00bd red onion, sliced thinly 2 large handfuls of rocket, approximately 100g 1 small radicchio, approximately 100g, torn to bite size pieces Prepare the chicken breasts (up to two days prior) Cut or gently pull off the tenderloins from the breast fillets if they are still attached. Stash in the freezer for another day. Lay out a square of baking paper. Each breast fillet will need four slices of prosciutto arranged, half-overlapping, creating a squarish sheet of prosciutto of about 15cm. Lay out the four slices of prosciutto onto the baking paper, then use the paper to wrap the square of prosciutto neatly around each breast with the chicken skin side up and the prosciutto ends hidden underneath. Repeat until all six breasts are wrapped. Store on a baking paper-lined tray, cling-wrapped. To make the currant sauce (up to three days prior) Simmer the currants, balsamic, a pinch of salt and 100ml water in a small pot for 5 minutes to soften the currants. Allow to rest until the currants swell and soak up most of the liquid. Add the olive oil and store refrigerated until needed. Crispy sage leaves (day prior) Heat 80ml olive oil in a small pot, enough to just cover the base. Just before the oil smokes, add the sage leaves and fry for 20 seconds to brighten the colour, crisp them and release the aromatics. Remove from the oil before they brown onto a paper towel, store in an airtight container in the cupboard. Reuse the oil in the remaining recipe. Make the bread salad (day of) Drizzle the sourdough slices with olive oil, or the oil leftover from frying the sage leaves and season with a generous pinch of salt. Grill the bread until lightly brown, then tear into rough chunks. Toss the partially toasted bread pieces with the sliced red onion, rocket and radicchio. Arrange on the serving platter, ready for the cooked chicken. Cook the chicken breasts (to serve) Heat the oven to 180C fan. Drizzle a roasting pan with a little olive oil, then add the wrapped chicken breasts, skin side up, and give another drizzle on top. Cook for 10 minutes. Open the oven and add a splash of water, about 100ml, to the roasting pan to stop the prosciutto from browning too much and help retain moisture in the chicken. Roast for another 10-15 minutes until the chicken is cooked. If you have a digital probe, it should reach 75C. Alternatively, see if the juices run clear when a skewer is inserted into the centre of each breast. The roasting pan should have a small amount of liquid left and the prosciutto should be nicely browned. Remove the cooked chicken breasts and allow them to rest for 10 minutes arranged, ready to serve on top of the bread salad. Add the prepared currant sauce to the hot roasting pan and mix around to meld the flavours together. Pour the warm currant sauce over the resting chicken breasts and garnish with the crispy sage leaves. Serve to the table, carving off breast slices, and serve with spoonfuls of the bread salad that has soaked in the roasting juices and sage currant sauce. For dessert: bombe Alaska Christmas wreath This dessert can be made up to a week ahead. Ensure you have plenty of freezer storage for the plate and finished pudding before you start.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison ends an election-winning year with a strong thumbs up from Coalition voters. But voter disapproval of the prime minister has also crept up in the second half of 2019, from 34% in July to 43% in December, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. With parliament rising for 2019 and Australians preparing for their summer break, voters were asked in the final poll of the year to rate Morrison\u2019s performance as prime minister compared to their expectations, with 11% of the sample saying he had exceeded expectations, 41% saying he had met expectations, and 47% saying he had fallen short. While Morrison ends the year beloved of the Liberal and National party base, with 82% of Coalition voters reporting he has either met or exceeded expectations, Coalition voters are more likely than other voting cohorts to express that positive view. Anthony Albanese ends 2019 with approval ratings lower than Morrison\u2019s (39% to 45%) but voter approval of the Labor leader has crept up over the past six months (he\u2019s gone from 35% in June to 39% in December). Albanese\u2019s disapproval has also gone from 25% in June to 28% in December. Albanese\u2019s main problem in the middle of this year was 39% of the sample didn\u2019t know if they approved of his performance or not \u2013 reflecting his fledgling leadership of the Labor party. Albanese replaced Bill Shorten after the May election loss. While voters are still on the fence about the Labor leader, the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d cohort in Guardian Essential is trending down to 33% in the final poll of the year. Albanese\u2019s voter sentiment compared to expectations yields similar results to the prime minister, with 8% of the sample of 1,035 respondents saying the Labor leader has exceeded their expectations, 48% saying he has met their expectations, and 44% saying he has fallen short. While 82% of Coalition rusted-ons are pleased with Morrison, Albanese enjoys a smaller premium among the Labor faithful, with 66% saying he\u2019s either met or exceeded their expectations. As well as reflecting on the performance of the leaders, voters were also asked to reflect their broad thinking over the past 12 months, with a series of questions about the winners and losers of 2019. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Voters in the sample thought the year had been good for them and their families, and for large corporations. But people thought 2019 had been a very bad year for the planet (a 10-point drop from the reading captured at the end of 2018) \u2013 reflecting increasing community anxiety about the impact of climate change exacerbated by a catastrophic early bushfire season and prolonged drought. The responses also suggest Australians are worried about the economy. The latest official figures show the economy grew by just 0.4% in the September quarter, with annual growth at 1.7%. There was a large negative swing in Guardian Essential from 2018, with the economy dropping from +6 in 2018 to -13 in 2019. Voters in the sample remain not particularly enamoured by Australian politics in general, or the government, but the readings for both are more positive then they were 12 months ago in a survey taken shortly after the Liberal party had blasted Malcolm Turnbull out of the prime ministership. Trade unions are also seen as having a bad year, falling from -2 in 2018 to -11 in 2019. Voter sentiment is also negative about unions in other respects. Almost half the sample (49%) agree with the observation \u201coverall unions have too much power today\u201d, while 68% agree that union officials should be disqualified for breaching administrative laws such as failing to file annual financial reports \u2013 which is part of the Morrison government\u2019s union bill, which failed to clear the Senate in the penultimate sitting week when Pauline Hanson refused to support the package. Just over half the sample, 51%, also agree that union officials should be disqualified for taking unprotected industrial action such as snap strikes. City dwellers are more likely than voters in the regions to think unions have too much power, and Coalition voters and people aged over 55 are more likely to be negative about unions that other groups. But the news is not all good for the government, which will renew efforts to get the legislation passed once parliament resumes in February. More than half the sample, 62%, supports the statement the \u201cgovernment seems to be more concerned about the actions of union officials than the CEOs of banks and other corporations\u201d. With the Angus Taylor controversy dominating the final two sitting weeks of parliament, voters were also asked to express their perspective on the sequence of events that has led to a police investigation into the use of a dodgy document to attack the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore. Voters were split over whether Morrison should have sidelined the minister for the duration of the police investigation (35%), or stood by him (17%), but mostly they were tuned out, with 48% of the cohort saying they weren\u2019t following the story. Voters strongly support setting up an independent federal corruption body to monitor the behaviour of politicians and public servants (75% support compared with 82% just over a year ago). There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling, as none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory on 18 May. The polls instead projected Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is now not publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and a range of policy issues. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3%.",

Let\u2019s start with events at the Scottish Tin Pot final, where Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers thrashed the Queen\u2019s Celtic by nil goals to one. Poor $tevie Mbe, standing there in the pouring rain, soaked to the bone, cursing Steve McClaren, unable to shelter under a brolly lest the tabloid press brands him a dry ponce. What must have been going through the poor man\u2019s dripping noggin, history repeating itself as a furious South American striker ran around kicking people for no good reason while his team\u2019s hopes of a title went up in smoke. At least he didn\u2019t slip over in a puddle, eh ladies and gentlemen, am I right, etc.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/aston-villa-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Jamie Vardy strikes twice as Leicester beat Aston Villa to keep up title chase</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anyway, that\u2019s all terrible news for folk on Merseyside eagerly tracking $tevie\u2019s fledgling managerial career, hoping to see evidence of tangible success and/or vague signs of basic competence, either of which would come in useful when he inevitably succeeds J\u00fcrgen Klopp in 18 months\u2019 time. But it was more encouraging for those at Anfield who would argue for a less emotional appointment, based on Shearermetric data gathered by the Ljungberg Institute on their patented Olegunnarometer. (Admittedly this isn\u2019t the best day to be referencing Solskj\u00e6r in such an offhand manner, given Manchester United are now officially back, baby, on account of scoring two goals and missing a hatful of chances against a circus troupe purporting to be Manchester City. But it\u2019s a low bar at Old Trafford these days and you get the general point.)</p> <p>The Manchester derby was another double-edged sword for Liverpool. Sure, they\u2019re now 14 points clear of City, and no team in top-flight history has ever overcome such a gap to win the league. Problem is, that\u2019s really going to crank up the pressure on Klopp\u2019s side \u2013 just wait for the coverage next time they draw, never mind lose a game \u2013 and in any case City are currently third in a two-horse race. Leicester are now Liverpool\u2019s main rivals, a mere eight points back, scoring for fun, unencumbered by 30 years of expectation, and with Brendan Rodgers in charge ... well, it doesn\u2019t bear thinking about, does it, Liverpool fans?</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t bear thinking about because there\u2019s no need, it writes itself. Best to cross your fingers and hope the Foxes are 2020\u2019s version of Graham Taylor\u2019s Aston Villa, a surprise package from the Midlands that falls away quietly in March. That would complete a three-decade cycle of narrative purity.

      "bodyText": "LOST WEEKEND Depending on which way you look at things, it was either a good or bad weekend for Liverpool. Let\u2019s start with events at the Scottish Tin Pot final, where Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers thrashed the Queen\u2019s Celtic by nil goals to one. Poor $tevie Mbe, standing there in the pouring rain, soaked to the bone, cursing Steve McClaren, unable to shelter under a brolly lest the tabloid press brands him a dry ponce. What must have been going through the poor man\u2019s dripping noggin, history repeating itself as a furious South American striker ran around kicking people for no good reason while his team\u2019s hopes of a title went up in smoke. At least he didn\u2019t slip over in a puddle, eh ladies and gentlemen, am I right, etc. Anyway, that\u2019s all terrible news for folk on Merseyside eagerly tracking $tevie\u2019s fledgling managerial career, hoping to see evidence of tangible success and/or vague signs of basic competence, either of which would come in useful when he inevitably succeeds J\u00fcrgen Klopp in 18 months\u2019 time. But it was more encouraging for those at Anfield who would argue for a less emotional appointment, based on Shearermetric data gathered by the Ljungberg Institute on their patented Olegunnarometer. (Admittedly this isn\u2019t the best day to be referencing Solskj\u00e6r in such an offhand manner, given Manchester United are now officially back, baby, on account of scoring two goals and missing a hatful of chances against a circus troupe purporting to be Manchester City. But it\u2019s a low bar at Old Trafford these days and you get the general point.) The Manchester derby was another double-edged sword for Liverpool. Sure, they\u2019re now 14 points clear of City, and no team in top-flight history has ever overcome such a gap to win the league. Problem is, that\u2019s really going to crank up the pressure on Klopp\u2019s side \u2013 just wait for the coverage next time they draw, never mind lose a game \u2013 and in any case City are currently third in a two-horse race. Leicester are now Liverpool\u2019s main rivals, a mere eight points back, scoring for fun, unencumbered by 30 years of expectation, and with Brendan Rodgers in charge ... well, it doesn\u2019t bear thinking about, does it, Liverpool fans? It doesn\u2019t bear thinking about because there\u2019s no need, it writes itself. Best to cross your fingers and hope the Foxes are 2020\u2019s version of Graham Taylor\u2019s Aston Villa, a surprise package from the Midlands that falls away quietly in March. That would complete a three-decade cycle of narrative purity. Yes, cross your fingers and keep telling yourselves that. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Scott Murray at 8pm GMT for red-hot MBM coverage of West Ham 2-2 Arsenal. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe club will continue to vigorously defend its rights against all parties involved in tampering of staff so the club recovers all damages incurred. All recovered damages will be reinvested in our squad\u201d \u2013 Barnsley claim new Hearts boss Daniel Stendel was hoofed through the door marked Do One because he was in discussions about a managerial post at a rival Championship club. Perhaps Tykes fans who bought him a tequila at his impromptu leaving do can make a claim too. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Get your ears around the the latest edition of Football Weekly here. FIVER LETTERS \u201cEvery so often you amaze and delight with your literary acumen. No, really. Your description of Woodgate\u2019s Boro with \u2018... we could only imagine a team under his tutelage playing as though Hunter S Thompson was managing them\u2019 could well have been penned by Joyce or Bellow. The vivid imagery explodes in the mind. It may not attain the renown of \u2018Total Football\u2019, but \u2018Gonzo Football\u2019 would at least be more readily copied by modern managers\u201d \u2013 Mike Fichtner (and no others). \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m just one of 1,057 readers who\u2019s pleased to see the return to the Premier League of a man capable of providing ostrich-based entertainment not seen since the days of Bernie Clifton\u201d \u2013 James Taylor. \u201cAfter Friday\u2019s revelation about the David Beckham sleep video (Friday\u2019s Quote of the Day), I wondered if there was a screen large enough to show the weekly recording of the whole of the Arsenal defence getting 40 Harrys\u201d \u2013 Craig Derry. \u201cRichard Morris (Friday\u2019s Fiver letters) on patron saints had me thinking wich patron saint The Fiver might be named after.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS The World Anti-Doping Agency has voted unanimously to ban Russia from international sport for four years for doping offences, meaning the national team cannot compete at the Ethics World Cup or Tokyo\u2019s Big Sports Day. Two away fans were arrested on suspicion of homophobic abuse during Wolves\u2019 2-2 draw at Brighton, while Everton are investigating reports of homophobic chants during Saturday\u2019s game with Chelsea. The 36 players on trial in Spain\u2019s most high-profile match-fixing case have been cleared of wrongdoing. The accused players could have faced a six-year ban but were all found not guilty by a Spanish judge. The charges related to a 2011 La Liga game between Levante and Zaragoza. England will face Italy at Wembley in the first of four pre-Euro 2020 friendlies. The game on 27 March will be known as \u2018the Heads Up international\u2019 as part of a partnership with the Heads Together mental health initiative. Gareth Southgate\u2019s boys will also face Denmark, Austria and Romania. Wales will also host Austria at home on 27 March, with Ryan Giggs keen to tackle alpine opponents after landing in Group A with Italy and Switzerland. It\u2019s a watershed day for AFC Wimbledon, with the club set to decide whether to end their supporter-owned structure in order to secure investment for their cash-knacked stadium. Cruzeiro fans clashed with Brazilian fuzz and ripped out seats after their 2-0 home defeat to Palmeiras confirmed their first ever relegation. The match was abandoned shortly after the visitors\u2019 second goal, as home fans started scuffling among themselves. And Manchester City could plug the chasm in the middle of their defence with Samuel Umtiti, according to reports in France. STILL WANT MORE?

      "body": "<p>They were all there except him, everyone waiting for the old man again. It was six minutes to two, time to go, and in the tunnel at the Benito Villamar\u00edn 21 players lined up ready to go out alongside the referee, Valent\u00edn Pizarro G\u00f3mez, and one of his assistants. Just up the stairs, the other linesman stood by the dressing-room door, flag in one hand, getting a little impatient. \u201cWe\u2019re only missing Joaqu\u00edn,\u201d he called down, \u201c\u2026 yeah I know.\u201d Alongside him the Betis manager, Joan Francesc Ferrer \u2018Rubi\u2019, wore a look that said <em>what do you want me to do</em>? so the linesman took a step inside. \u201cCome on Joaqu\u00edn!\u201d he shouted. \u201cLet\u2019s go mate. We\u2019re waiting for you here.\u201d Rubi looked at his watch, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vamos/status/1203810737530949632?s=20\">then stuck his head round the door, nervous now</a>.</p> \n<p>The next time he looked it said one minute past two, 01.28 on the screens around the stadium, and the place was going wild. Joaqu\u00edn had finally left the dressing room, high-fived his manager and, with linesman in tow shouting \u201ccome on let\u2019s go\u201d, led them into the sunshine. He had shaken hands with all of Athletic\u2019s players, Betis\u2019s anthem booming round as he went along the line, and posed for a team picture with dozens of kids, many in wheelchairs. He had chosen ends, I\u00f1aki Williams calling wrong, stood head bowed in silence in honour of former player Francisco Aparicio, <em>and</em> belted the ball into the net. He had been out only seven minutes, touched the ball only twice, and hadn\u2019t even been playing 90 seconds, but he had already scored.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/la-liga-real-madrid-espanyol-barcelona-mallorca\">La Liga roundup: Messi masterclass puts Barcelona back on top after Madrid win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nine minutes and three seconds later, he had scored again. And nine minutes and 19 seconds after that, he had scored another.</p> \n<p>It had taken 19 minutes. Nineteen minutes and 19 years, which made it all the more special.</p> \n<p>Five times Joaqu\u00edn had touched the ball, three times he had guided it into the net, all of them perfect finishes. He had thumped at his chest when he got the first, hand pounding at the badge of the club where he began his career, owns 2% of the shares, and wants to be the president one day; now he thumped it harder, heart racing, standing before the crowd, arms wide. \u201cThe euphoria,\u201d he said later, \u201cI didn\u2019t even believe it.\u201d Nor did anyone else. Athletic had the league\u2019s best defence, conceding just nine times; now, in less than 20 minutes they had let in a third again, the scoreboard showing 19.50 and 3-0.</p> \n<p>And that was just the start, each stat sillier than the last, leaving you to choose which you liked best. \u201cMy daughters didn\u2019t stop crying: they\u2019re not used to seeing their dad score goals. They said: \u2018Hey Dad, how cool that you scored three goals; I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever do that,\u2019\u201d Joaqu\u00edn admitted later. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Nor did I.\u2019\u201d He arrived on 100 goals, averaging just over one every eight games across his career and he had never scored a hat-trick, not even at youth level. The Benito Villamar\u00edn had not seen any of their players score a hat-trick since Finidi George, 22 years earlier. And only six players had scored a hat-trick inside 20 minutes for anyone, anywhere. But now he\u2019d gone and blown away all those records in the blink of an eye.</p> \n<p>Yet if it was fast, it was also slow: it had taken Joaqu\u00edn until he was 38 years and 140 days old to get a hat-trick, long after most have retired. On Sunday he was the oldest man on the pitch \u2013 and that includes the referee \u2013 and became the oldest player to score three in a La Liga match, overtaking Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano at 37 years 255 days in 1964. This is his 20th senior season; he has scored in all of them.</p> \n<p>The day Joaqu\u00edn made his first-team debut, at the start of 2000-01, the Betis captain Juan Merino hid his boots. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll have to clean them,\u201d Joaqu\u00edn told him. Today, Merino would have to join a queue. Joaqu\u00edn won the Copa del Rey, one of only three trophies in the club\u2019s history, posing with the trophy wearing nothing at all and then <a href=\"https://as.com/futbol/2005/07/09/mas_futbol/1120890441_850215\">placing it at the altar</a> when he got married a few days later. Back then, most expected him to be a superstar somewhere. When it was suggested that his dad was off negotiating a move away Joaqu\u00edn replied: \u201cNah, he\u2019s on the sofa at home with his arse hanging out the back of his trousers as usual.\u201d Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea came. And he was the gal\u00e1ctico that never was, Florentino P\u00e9rez making a show of publicly courting him. But in the end he joined Valencia after six seasons at home \u2013 not least because Betis needed him to.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"524477b7-ba94-4902-bdea-762db0febca8\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The 36 players on trial in Spain's most high-profile match-fixing case were cleared of wrongdoing on Monday. A Spanish judge issued the not guilty verdict, saying there was not enough evidence to convict the players and others on trial.</p>\n    <p>More than 40 people were accused of match-fixing involving the La Liga game between Levante and Zaragoza at the end of the 2010-11 season. Two former Zaragoza officials convicted of fraud: the former president Agapito Iglesias and club director Javier Porquera. Both men were given one-year, three-month prison sentences that are likely to be suspended.</p>\n    <p>The accused players were facing two years in prison and a six-year soccer ban, but will now not face any further action. The charges related to a \u20ac965,000 (\u00a3812,000) payment to Zaragoza's squad before their 2-1 win over Levante, which secured survival and relegated Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a.<br></p>\n    <p>Prosecutors claimed there was evidence that the money had been transferred to Levante players, but the judge ruled there was no evidence this had occurred. Former Zaragoza officials said the money was paid to motivate the club's players, not to fix the result.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He went to M\u00e1laga and Fiorentina, then he came back again. He was 34; he\u2019d be lucky to have a season ahead of him, most thought. That was four and a half years ago now, and there will be more. Betis are expected to announce a new contract soon, taking him beyond his 40th birthday, Joaqu\u00edn joking on Sunday night that he could turn the screw a little bit now. Not that it is just the hat-trick; it is the three games in a row he has scored, the role played both on and off the pitch in pulling Betis away from the relegation zone and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/31/nabil-fekir-rubi-and-a-picture-that-sums-up-sport-real-betis-celta-vigo-la-liga-sid-lowe\">their manager away from the sack</a>, the way he is playing. It is 12 years since Joaqu\u00edn was in the Spain squad \u2013 the country\u2019s best player at the 2002 World Cup, the kid who least deserved to miss in that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/25/worldcupfootball2002.sport1\">shootout against South Korea</a> \u2013 but it might not be so daft to suggest he would fit in again now. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/16/fun-finta-and-why-it-is-impossible-not-to-love-joaquin-at-real-betis\">In the past couple of years</a>, he has actually got <em>better</em>.</p> \n<p>When Lionel Messi said the words that couldn\u2019t be unsaid last week, depressing everyone when he admitted, at 32, that <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/story/4007115/barcelona-have-to-prepare-for-life-after-messi-fati-just-might-be-the-answer\">retirement is close</a>, Joaqu\u00edn noted: \u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t got my physique, has he?\u201d He was joking but there was something in it, something that expressed hope for everyone, maybe even Messi. His dad reckons he is so strong because he was breast fed until he was seven. And yet it\u2019s psychological too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/08/real-betis-crowned-kings-of-seville-again-after-winning-the-wildest-of-all-derbies\">enthusiasm renewed over the past couple of years</a>.

      "bodyText": "They were all there except him, everyone waiting for the old man again. It was six minutes to two, time to go, and in the tunnel at the Benito Villamar\u00edn 21 players lined up ready to go out alongside the referee, Valent\u00edn Pizarro G\u00f3mez, and one of his assistants. Just up the stairs, the other linesman stood by the dressing-room door, flag in one hand, getting a little impatient. \u201cWe\u2019re only missing Joaqu\u00edn,\u201d he called down, \u201c\u2026 yeah I know.\u201d Alongside him the Betis manager, Joan Francesc Ferrer \u2018Rubi\u2019, wore a look that said what do you want me to do? so the linesman took a step inside. \u201cCome on Joaqu\u00edn!\u201d he shouted. \u201cLet\u2019s go mate. We\u2019re waiting for you here.\u201d Rubi looked at his watch, then stuck his head round the door, nervous now. The next time he looked it said one minute past two, 01.28 on the screens around the stadium, and the place was going wild. Joaqu\u00edn had finally left the dressing room, high-fived his manager and, with linesman in tow shouting \u201ccome on let\u2019s go\u201d, led them into the sunshine. He had shaken hands with all of Athletic\u2019s players, Betis\u2019s anthem booming round as he went along the line, and posed for a team picture with dozens of kids, many in wheelchairs. He had chosen ends, I\u00f1aki Williams calling wrong, stood head bowed in silence in honour of former player Francisco Aparicio, and belted the ball into the net. He had been out only seven minutes, touched the ball only twice, and hadn\u2019t even been playing 90 seconds, but he had already scored. Nine minutes and three seconds later, he had scored again. And nine minutes and 19 seconds after that, he had scored another. It had taken 19 minutes. Nineteen minutes and 19 years, which made it all the more special. Five times Joaqu\u00edn had touched the ball, three times he had guided it into the net, all of them perfect finishes. He had thumped at his chest when he got the first, hand pounding at the badge of the club where he began his career, owns 2% of the shares, and wants to be the president one day; now he thumped it harder, heart racing, standing before the crowd, arms wide. \u201cThe euphoria,\u201d he said later, \u201cI didn\u2019t even believe it.\u201d Nor did anyone else. Athletic had the league\u2019s best defence, conceding just nine times; now, in less than 20 minutes they had let in a third again, the scoreboard showing 19.50 and 3-0. And that was just the start, each stat sillier than the last, leaving you to choose which you liked best. \u201cMy daughters didn\u2019t stop crying: they\u2019re not used to seeing their dad score goals. They said: \u2018Hey Dad, how cool that you scored three goals; I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever do that,\u2019\u201d Joaqu\u00edn admitted later. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Nor did I.\u2019\u201d He arrived on 100 goals, averaging just over one every eight games across his career and he had never scored a hat-trick, not even at youth level. The Benito Villamar\u00edn had not seen any of their players score a hat-trick since Finidi George, 22 years earlier. And only six players had scored a hat-trick inside 20 minutes for anyone, anywhere. But now he\u2019d gone and blown away all those records in the blink of an eye. Yet if it was fast, it was also slow: it had taken Joaqu\u00edn until he was 38 years and 140 days old to get a hat-trick, long after most have retired. On Sunday he was the oldest man on the pitch \u2013 and that includes the referee \u2013 and became the oldest player to score three in a La Liga match, overtaking Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano at 37 years 255 days in 1964. This is his 20th senior season; he has scored in all of them. The day Joaqu\u00edn made his first-team debut, at the start of 2000-01, the Betis captain Juan Merino hid his boots. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll have to clean them,\u201d Joaqu\u00edn told him. Today, Merino would have to join a queue. Joaqu\u00edn won the Copa del Rey, one of only three trophies in the club\u2019s history, posing with the trophy wearing nothing at all and then placing it at the altar when he got married a few days later. Back then, most expected him to be a superstar somewhere. When it was suggested that his dad was off negotiating a move away Joaqu\u00edn replied: \u201cNah, he\u2019s on the sofa at home with his arse hanging out the back of his trousers as usual.\u201d Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea came. And he was the gal\u00e1ctico that never was, Florentino P\u00e9rez making a show of publicly courting him. But in the end he joined Valencia after six seasons at home \u2013 not least because Betis needed him to. He went to M\u00e1laga and Fiorentina, then he came back again. He was 34; he\u2019d be lucky to have a season ahead of him, most thought. That was four and a half years ago now, and there will be more. Betis are expected to announce a new contract soon, taking him beyond his 40th birthday, Joaqu\u00edn joking on Sunday night that he could turn the screw a little bit now. Not that it is just the hat-trick; it is the three games in a row he has scored, the role played both on and off the pitch in pulling Betis away from the relegation zone and their manager away from the sack, the way he is playing. It is 12 years since Joaqu\u00edn was in the Spain squad \u2013 the country\u2019s best player at the 2002 World Cup, the kid who least deserved to miss in that shootout against South Korea \u2013 but it might not be so daft to suggest he would fit in again now. In the past couple of years, he has actually got better. When Lionel Messi said the words that couldn\u2019t be unsaid last week, depressing everyone when he admitted, at 32, that retirement is close, Joaqu\u00edn noted: \u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t got my physique, has he?\u201d He was joking but there was something in it, something that expressed hope for everyone, maybe even Messi. His dad reckons he is so strong because he was breast fed until he was seven. And yet it\u2019s psychological too, enthusiasm renewed over the past couple of years. Derby wins followed with Setien, a new style that suited him: after one, in which he scored the winner, he said could leave football \u201ca happy man\u201d, but staying made him even happier man, and that\u2019s the key. The day after Messi scored his 35th league hat-trick \u2013 more than anyone else ever \u2013 Joaquin scored his first \u2013 later than anyone else ever. This was something to celebrate, for all of us. Joaqu\u00edn put out a video saying he was exhausted and staying at home, only to crack up and giggle: \u201cNo one believes that for a minute,\u201d announcing: \u201cI\u2019m off out for a wee drink.\u201d Meanwhile, his feat was splashed across every front page. \u201cSuperhero\u201d, \u201cJoaqu\u00edn performs magic\u201d, \u201cMonumental\u201d, ran the three headlines in Diario de Sevilla alone. What he had done was a reminder of the power of enjoyment, further evidence that a grin isn\u2019t a handicap and a joke isn\u2019t a crime, still unprofessionalism; that scowling seriousness is not the only route to success, and happiness helps. Everyone\u2019s favourite cheeky scamp, more famous for his gags than his goals, Joaqu\u00edn isn\u2019t just a comedian, he is also a competitor; he\u2019s not still playing because he\u2019s funny, but he may well still be playing because it\u2019s fun, another way of clinging to your childhood. \u201cI have kids of 19 and one of 38 in my team,\u201d Rubi said. Emerson, who provided the assist for the first, was one the day Joaqu\u00edn made his first-team debut. Diego La\u00ednez, playing alongside him, was two months old. Loren Moron made the third. His dad played against Joaqu\u00edn, now he plays with him, just like Sergio Canales. \u201cGranddad,\u201d Canales wrote on the ball, \u201cit\u2019s an honour to play with you.\u201d \u201cThe dickhead,\u201d Joaqu\u00edn laughed as he read it out on the radio. \u201cIf I had known how much hassle there would be, I wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d Joaqu\u00edn joked on Sunday night. He might even have scored more, the clock showing 90.57 when he raced into the area and drew a sharp save from Unai Sim\u00f3n. \u201cI was as stiff as dried cod: if I\u2019d stopped to control it, I\u2019d have fallen over,\u201d he said. Besides, three was just enough.

But in fact Mueller\u2019s report presents evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump for activity including the firing of FBI director James Comey; ordering the White House counsel to fire Mueller; trying to have the attorney general take over the special counsel investigation; and ordering the White House counsel to deny the earlier order that he fire Mueller. In both prior impeachment proceedings against a US president in the modern era, obstruction of justice was among the articles of impeachment. The White House signaled on Friday that it would not send lawyers to the hearing on Monday or seek to call witnesses in Trump\u2019s defense, continuing its unprecedented policy of total non-participation with the inquiry. \u201cPresident Trump chose not to show,\u201d said Nadler. \u201cHe may not have much to say in his own defense, but he cannot claim that he did not have the opportunity to be heard.\u201d",

Against the US dollar, it struck $1.318 - its highest level in seven months.</p> <p>But the rally has now faded, as investors wonder whether recent opinion polling can be trusted. While Survation gave Boris Johnson a 14-point lead overnight, ICM\u2019s latest poll have trimmed the PM\u2019s advantage to just 7 points.</p> <p>If ICM are right, Britain could find itself in hung parliament territory again on Friday morning. But if Survation, and YouGov, are on the money then Boris Johnson could sweep back to Downing Street.</p> <p>Investors believe that a chunky Conservative majority would allow Britain to leave the EU in an orderly fashion by 31 January, removing the immediate risk of a cliff-edge exit. But it would also create a fresh deadline at the end of December 2020 for a new trade deal to be signed.</p> <p><strong>Connor Campbell</strong> of <strong>SpreadEx</strong> says </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling now just wants Brexit done, a telling about-face considering the plunge it suffered following 2016\u2019s referendum result, which means the Tories are its favoured party.</p> <p>Its current levels \u2013 7- and 31-month highs against the dollar and euro respectively \u2013 suggest it is confident of a blue majority come Friday morning.

He was 92.</p> <p>The death was confirmed by Janice Zima, his daughter. </p> <p>Mr. Volcker, a towering, taciturn and somewhat rumpled figure, arrived in Washington as America\u2019s postwar economic hegemony was beginning to crumble. He would devote his professional life to wrestling with the consequences.</p> <p>As a Treasury Department official under Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M.

A big majority would free Johnson from having to placate the hard-line Brexiteers on the back benches (and now in his cabinet too). </p> <p><strong>Rahman </strong>says there\u2019s little clarity about which way Johnson will pivot (if he remains as PM):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cabinet ministers admit privately they have barely discussed the future relationship question that would loom large once the UK had left the EU on 31 January. \u201cAll the focus has been on the election,\u201d one minister said. \u201cBoris is vague about the EU trade deal.\u201d</p> <p>Whitehall officials believe Johnson would soon have to confront the dilemma May faced: to secure close to frictionless trade needed to protect UK business, he would have to accept more EU regulation than he has been prepared to admit.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s position is deliberately opaque. He is still in the \u201chave cake and eat it\u201d mode he outlined when May was PM. In effect, he has asked voters to take him on trust, and allow him to sort out the detail after \u201cgetting Brexit done.\u201d He wants a \u201cno tariffs, no quotas\u201d deal with the EU but has not addressed the quid pro quo of regulatory alignment. He has avoided speaking about possible trade-offs in politically sensitive areas such as fishing rights, an inevitable EU demand. He has raised the prospect of a \u201cbuy British\u201d policy and state aid for struggling UK companies, and largely avoided the EU\u2019s demand for a level playing field. If he wins, he will have some very big decisions to make.</p> <p>Time would be very short. Johnson has argued that after securing a withdrawal agreement in three months, he can be confident of landing an EU trade deal by December 2020. An extension of up to two years, set out in the withdrawal agreement, would have to be approved by EU leaders at their summit next June. Brussels officials say December is an \u201cextremely challenging\u201d deadline and predict a trade agreement would take at least three years. Some UK ministers privately predict (and hope for) a fudge: a bare bones deal in some areas\u2014with the details filled in later. There would be a mechanism to allow the UK to diverge, with consequences for its EU market access.</p> <p>Another scenario\u2014more likely if Johnson has a small majority\u2014would be that the bare bones deal is as good as it got.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dee06de8f08bacaf000cabb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T08:34:44.865Z\">8.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our morning briefing explains what the parties will be up to today:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/monday-briefing-parties-deliver-final-pitches-in-last-stretch-of-campaign\">Monday briefing: parties deliver final pitches in last stretch of campaign</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dee007c8f08e7796de8f3db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T08:16:25.567Z\">8.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jim Reid </strong>of <strong>Deutsche Bank has</strong> warned clients that the Conservative lead has been slightly whittled away in recent days:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The weekend polls showed a wide spread of Tory leads from 6pts to 15pts but with the average edging back above 10pts after recently dipping below.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap Sterling has hit fresh highs as the UK\u2019s general election campaign enters its final stretch. The pound broke over \u20ac1.19 against the euro today, for the first time since May 2017. Against the US dollar, it struck $1.318 - its highest level in seven months. But the rally has now faded, as investors wonder whether recent opinion polling can be trusted. While Survation gave Boris Johnson a 14-point lead overnight, ICM\u2019s latest poll have trimmed the PM\u2019s advantage to just 7 points. If ICM are right, Britain could find itself in hung parliament territory again on Friday morning. But if Survation, and YouGov, are on the money then Boris Johnson could sweep back to Downing Street. Investors believe that a chunky Conservative majority would allow Britain to leave the EU in an orderly fashion by 31 January, removing the immediate risk of a cliff-edge exit. But it would also create a fresh deadline at the end of December 2020 for a new trade deal to be signed. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says Sterling now just wants Brexit done, a telling about-face considering the plunge it suffered following 2016\u2019s referendum result, which means the Tories are its favoured party. Its current levels \u2013 7- and 31-month highs against the dollar and euro respectively \u2013 suggest it is confident of a blue majority come Friday morning. It also leaves the currency with plenty of room to fall if Britain produces the latest in a string of electoral upsets. The shadow chancellor has tried to calm worries about a sterling crisis if Labour won a surprise victory. John McDonnell claimed there was more danger of the pound going up.... In other news: Paul Volcker, one of the giants of central banking, has died aged 92. He\u2019s been widely praised for his work tackling America\u2019s inflation problems in the 1970s and 80s Economic confidence across the eurozone has risen this month, to its highest level since the spring. Shares in Africa-focused oil company Tullow have slumped by almost 70%, after it slashed production targets and shed two top executives Over in New York, trading is subdued as investors brace for the next deadline in the US-China trade talks. Washington is due to hike tariffs on $155bn of Chinese goods, including technology products, on 15 December unless a Phase One trade deal is agreed. Many analysts expect a delay, but the uncertainty is worrying Wall Street. So, the Dow is down 31 points or 0.1% in morning trading at 27,984. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s take: Wall Street is particularly focused on developments in the trade war ahead of a new round of tariffs on $160 billion of Chinese imports due to take effect on Sunday. That would raise prices on key products, including cell phones and laptops, and threaten to affect consumers. A Chinese official said Monday that the nation wants a prompt settlement, but gave no details on progress toward a potential deal. China made a conciliatory gesture last week when it said it would waive tariffs on American soybeans and pork. Gains from communications companies were offset by losses from energy and health care stocks. Charter Communications rose 1% and Marathon Petroleum fell 2.5%. Trade war jitters seem to be weighing on European stock markets today. The main indices are mostly in the red as that 15th December deadline looms. Data showing that Chinese exports fell again in November has disappointed some investors, as it implies the trade dispute with America is causing more damage. Duncan Weldon of The Economist points out that Paul Volcker\u2019s long, varied career went beyond simply running the Federal Reserve: Whoever wins Thursday\u2019s election faces many challenges, including how to fight the climate emergency while still raising living standards. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz reckons this conundrum can be solved, if policymakers focus on the \u2018quality\u2019 of growth in the economy: Back in the UK, another opinion poll has shown that the Conservative\u2019s lead over Labour has narrowed. It shows that Boris Johnson\u2019s lead over Jeremy Corbyn has dipped to 6 percentage points, from 7. That\u2019s a tighter race than other polls in recent days, such as YouGov (a ten-point lead) and Survation (14 points). And it\u2019s weighing on the pound a little - much of this morning\u2019s rally has now fizzled out. Reuters points out that Paul Volcker was no fan of the rise of the super-rich: In 2018 he published a memoir, \u201cKeeping at It: The Quest for Sound Money and Good Government,\u201d and expressed concern about the direction of the federal government and the loss of respect for it. \u201cThe central issue is we\u2019re developing into a plutocracy,\u201d he told the New York Times in October 2018. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they\u2019re rich because they\u2019re smart and constructive. And they don\u2019t like government and they don\u2019t like to pay taxes.\u201d They also talk about the \u2018mystique\u2019 that underpinned his work at the Fed, as he hiked interest rates painfully high: Volcker stood 6-foot-8 (2.03 meters), smoked cheap cigars, wore old suits and spoke with a rumbling baritone, creating a mystique that intimidated congressmen and even presidents. Part of his aura of power was due to the Fed\u2019s unusual nature - the central bank\u2019s governors, although appointed by the president and overseen by Congress, are effectively answerable to no one. In 2018 when President Donald Trump regularly attacked the Fed as \u201ccrazy\u201d for raising interest rates, Volcker advised Chairman Jerome Powell to simply ignore the criticism. Volcker, who slammed the economy\u2019s brakes like no other Fed chair, also absorbed his share of barbs from lawmakers in the 1980s. But he faced down both that criticism and, ultimately, inflation that had spiked higher than any point since the 1940s. Economists, investors and journalists are offering their appreciations for Paul Volcker\u2019s work: He wasn\u2019t infallible, though.... Newsflash: Paul Volcker, who ran America\u2019s Federal Reserve through much of the 1980s battle against inflation, has died at the age of 92, according to the New York Times. Volcker was one of the most important central bankers to have steered monetary policy in recent decades. He ran the Fed from 1979 to 1987, first under Jimmy Carter and then Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency - a time of surging inflation. Volcker responded with sharply higher interest rates, to drive inflationary pressures down. The NYT says: Paul A. Volcker, who helped shape American economic policy for more than six decades, most notably by leading the Federal Reserve\u2019s brute-force campaign to subdue inflation in the late 1970s and early \u201980s, died on Sunday in New York. He was 92. The death was confirmed by Janice Zima, his daughter. Mr. Volcker, a towering, taciturn and somewhat rumpled figure, arrived in Washington as America\u2019s postwar economic hegemony was beginning to crumble. He would devote his professional life to wrestling with the consequences. As a Treasury Department official under Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, Mr. Volcker waged a long, losing struggle to preserve the postwar international monetary system established by the Bretton Woods agreement. The recent rally in the pound is a blow to any hedge funds who have bet against the currency. Speculators have reduced their net short positions on the pound vs the US dollar to $2.44bn in the last week, Reuters is reporting. That\u2019s down from a peak of $7.81bn earlier this year. Jordan Rochester, Nomura\u2019s currency strategist, has predicted that a Tory triumph could push the pound to $1.35 - not seen since May 2018. Rochester says: \u201cSterling can get to $1.34/$1.35 if there is a Conservative victory, then its appreciation will be capped by what the Conservatives have pledged in terms of the spending offered and renewed Breixt uncertainty. The FT has spotted that the cost of insuring against a tumble in the value of the pound has risen. That suggests some investors are nervous about the result of this week\u2019s election, as a hung parliament would probably knock sterling lower. Rupert Thompson, Head of Research at Kingswood, says smaller UK companies could see their shares rally after a Tory win -- which looks probable, but not certain. A Conservative victory is still not a done deal given the scope for significant tactical voting and the poor performance of the polls in recent elections. Indeed, UK equities overall have struggled to build on their burst of outperformance in October as the risk of a No-Deal Brexit faded. Within the UK market, by contrast, the prospect of a Conservative victory and an orderly Brexit departure are being embraced rather more enthusiastically. Mid and small cap stocks have outperformed their large cap counterparts by around 10% and 5% respectively since mid-October, benefiting from their greater exposure to the domestic UK economy. If the Conservatives do end up with a majority, we would see scope for the pound recovering somewhat further to maybe $1.35 and some renewed outperformance by UK equities. Small cap stocks should also outperform further, as valuations continue to look cheap relative to large caps. In other news, the battle for takeaway company Just Eat rumbles on. Amsterdam-listed Prosus has hiked its offer for the FTSE 100 firm, to over \u00a35bn, which rival bidder Takeaway.com has dismissed as \u2018derisory\u2019. Here\u2019s the latest: Gambling site Betfair reports that the odds of a Conservative win have narrowed again today, to its lowest levels since 2017. As chart shows, it\u2019s now a 79% chance (based on wagers) while a hung parliament is roughly 19%. Betfair spokesperson, Katie Baylis explains: When the Election was called in October, no overall majority was odds-on and the Tories had a battle on their hands according to punters, but once Nigel Farage announced his Brexit Party candidates would not oppose in Tory seats, Boris Johnson and his party have seen their odds continue to shorten to the point that today they look almost unbeatable. \u201cBut if there\u2019s one thing that the last few years in British politics have taught us, is that nothing is ever certain and we will be watching those exit polls and first seats very closely when they come in on Thursday night.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has denied that the pound would plunge if his party forms the next government. Presenting his fiscal plans in London, McDonnell is asked what his plan is for a sterling crisis (something he said Labour was planning for back in 2017). McDonnell insists that there won\u2019t be a run on the pound, claiming: My fear is that the pound will start to go up because of our investment plans. McDonnell adds that the markets realised that Boris Johnson\u2019s promises are neither \u201ctruth nor implementable\u201d. They are worried about instability, and very fearful about dropping off the edge within a year with a cliff-edge Brexit, he adds. McDonnell also invites us to \u201cexplore the recent history of the pound under the Conservative government\u201d [reminder: it is still around 10% lower than before the EU referendum]. Back to the pound.... and Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada points out that sterling has already largely priced in a Tory victory. That means there might not be much of a rally if Johnson wins a majority....and quite a tumble if he doesn\u2019t. Cole writes: If the UK bookies\u2019 prices are a reasonable guide to market expectations for Thursday\u2019s election, it is hard to see much more upside for GBP on the outcome. Betfair\u2019s prices now imply almost an 80% probability of a Conservative majority government and that rises to 85% including a Conservative minority. At 15%, the probability of a Labour-led government is its lowest since the campaign began Taken together, the weekend\u2019s polls suggest voting intentions have stabilised, with the Conservatives 10% points ahead on the raw data. As the second chart shows, the steady rise in Labour\u2019s share appears to have stalled and their performance is now lagging, relative to the run up to the 2017 election. There is no \u201cblackout\u201d period in the UK, aside from polling day itself, and polls will continue to be published up to Wednesday night. YouGov will update their MRP model at 10:00 GMT tomorrow. Despite the confidence with which markets predict a Conservative victory, there are still several major uncertainties \u2013 turnout (particularly amongst younger voters), potential tactical voting and the large proportion of undecided voters that the polls still show. In another fillip for the eurozone economy, Germany has managed to grow its exports. German exports rose by 1.2% in October, beating gloomy forecasts of a 0.7% decline. Sales to non-EU countries jumped by 4.5%, suggesting a pick-up in the global economy may be helping the euro area. Economists are encouraged by the pick-up in eurozone confidence this month: Just in: Eurozone economic confidence has jumped unexpectedly, in an encouraging signal for the European economy. The monthly gauge of investor morale, from the Sentix research group, rallied to +0.7 from -4.5% last month. That shows that fears of a euro-recession are easing; investors\u2019 expectations have hit their highest level since March 2018. The receding danger of a disorderly hard Brexit may be cheering Europe, along with hopes of a breakthrough in the US-China trade wars. Some stocks could rally if the Conservatives win Thursday\u2019s election, given Labour\u2019s commitment to nationalise parts of the utilities sector. But Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says Brexit uncertainty could still hold the market back: The pound nudged ahead to $1.3162 as the latest polls showed the Conservative Party extending its lead ahead of the General Election later this week. \u201cThe key question for investors is by how much UK shares could bounce on a Tory majority win. This scenario would remove various negative factors which have been weighing on markets such as Labour renationalising transport companies. Yet there is still Brexit to tackle which sustains some level of uncertainty among investors.\u201d Elsewhere in the City, shares in oil producer Tullow are in freefall after announcing its CEO and exploration director had both resigned. The firm also suspended its dividend, and admitted that oil production from two fields in Ghana will be rather lower than expected. Shares have slumped 60% this morning, a quite staggering slump, to 57p - their lowest since 2001. Back in 2012 they were worth \u00a313, when the firm was reporting solid activity in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya. Shares in UK focused companies are strengthening this morning too. Retailers Marks &amp; Spencer (+3%), Next (1%) and Kingfisher (+1.1%) are all among the risers, along with banks such as Lloyds (+0.8%) and RBS (+0.7%). Supermarket chain Tesco is the top riser, up 5%, after announcing it could sell its Thai and Malaysian stores. But the pound\u2019s strength is pulling down some big overseas earners, including drinks firm Diageo (-1%). This means the FTSE 100 has dipped by 10 points in early trading, to 7228. For all the talk of \u2018getting Brexit done\u2019, it\u2019s inevitable that the issue would dominate UK politics in 2020 and beyond. If the UK does leave the EU by the end of January, a new battle to define the future trading relationship between the two sides will break out. Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at Eurasia Group, says Johnson will have some \u201cvery big decisions to make\u201d, about how close to stick to European rules and regulations in return for less friction at the border. The size of any Conservative win would be a crucial factor here. A big majority would free Johnson from having to placate the hard-line Brexiteers on the back benches (and now in his cabinet too). Rahman says there\u2019s little clarity about which way Johnson will pivot (if he remains as PM): Cabinet ministers admit privately they have barely discussed the future relationship question that would loom large once the UK had left the EU on 31 January. \u201cAll the focus has been on the election,\u201d one minister said. \u201cBoris is vague about the EU trade deal.\u201d Whitehall officials believe Johnson would soon have to confront the dilemma May faced: to secure close to frictionless trade needed to protect UK business, he would have to accept more EU regulation than he has been prepared to admit. Johnson\u2019s position is deliberately opaque. He is still in the \u201chave cake and eat it\u201d mode he outlined when May was PM. In effect, he has asked voters to take him on trust, and allow him to sort out the detail after \u201cgetting Brexit done.\u201d He wants a \u201cno tariffs, no quotas\u201d deal with the EU but has not addressed the quid pro quo of regulatory alignment. He has avoided speaking about possible trade-offs in politically sensitive areas such as fishing rights, an inevitable EU demand. He has raised the prospect of a \u201cbuy British\u201d policy and state aid for struggling UK companies, and largely avoided the EU\u2019s demand for a level playing field. If he wins, he will have some very big decisions to make. Time would be very short. Johnson has argued that after securing a withdrawal agreement in three months, he can be confident of landing an EU trade deal by December 2020. An extension of up to two years, set out in the withdrawal agreement, would have to be approved by EU leaders at their summit next June. Brussels officials say December is an \u201cextremely challenging\u201d deadline and predict a trade agreement would take at least three years. Some UK ministers privately predict (and hope for) a fudge: a bare bones deal in some areas\u2014with the details filled in later. There would be a mechanism to allow the UK to diverge, with consequences for its EU market access. Another scenario\u2014more likely if Johnson has a small majority\u2014would be that the bare bones deal is as good as it got. Our morning briefing explains what the parties will be up to today: Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank has warned clients that the Conservative lead has been slightly whittled away in recent days: The weekend polls showed a wide spread of Tory leads from 6pts to 15pts but with the average edging back above 10pts after recently dipping below. A reminder that anything below a 6-7 point lead is around hung parliament territory. The closely-watched MRP opinion poll, released on Sunday, also gives the Conservatives a solid lead of Labour -- with a majority of 38. But... it comes with a warning that many voters are undecided, so that majority could yet evaporate. This chart shows how the pound has rallied against the euro in recent weeks, to this morning\u2019s 31-month high. However, it\u2019s still around 8% weaker than before the EU referendum in 2016. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With three days until polling day, the City is growing increasingly confident that Boris Johnson is heading back to Downing Street with a healthy working majority. Fears of a hung parliament are receding, as the Conservative Party extends its sizeable lead in the opinion polls. This has lifted the pound to a new 31-month high against the euro this morning, touching \u20ac1.19 for the first time since May 2017 (just before the Tory\u2019s lost their majority in a snap election). Sterling is also rallying against the US dollar too, up 0.25% to $1.318 - a seven-month high. The rally comes as pollsters Survation give the Conservatives a 14-point lead over Labour, at 45% of the vote vs 31%. That would surely be enough to guarantee a Conservative majority, who could drive Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill through the Commons by January 31st. But elections are unpredictable beasts -- so traders could yet get a nasty shock after the polls close on Thursday night. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada points out that undecided voters could still swing plenty of seats: There are two main possible outcomes for this week\u2019s election which will shape the UK for possibly decades to come: (1) A Conservative majority government (exit from the EU at end-Jan on terms of Withdrawal Agreement and then still TBD, the free trade agreement that has to be negotiated by the end of the transition period); (2) A hung Parliament that would see a further delay to the UK\u2019s EU exit and potentially a second referendum. Bookies odds show a Tory majority as a near certainty, in line with the steady gap in most (but not all) opinion polls. But there is a historically high number of undecided voters which could affect as many as 80 marginal seats. We will be neutral GBP going into Thursday and look to trade the outcome. The election campaign will continue today across the country, with Labour outlining its plans if it defies the polls and forms the next government.... Also coming up today Asian stock markets have rallied overnight, after last Friday\u2019s US jobs report came in much stronger than expected. Europe is likely to be subdued, though, having ended last week strongly. On the data front, research group Sentix publishes its latest survey of eurozone investor morale. The agenda 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence survey; expected to fall to -5.3 from -4.5",

      "bodyText": "It must be a tough call for any actor, when the breakout star of your film is hailed as a ... jumper. But that\u2019s what has just happened with Chris Evans, whose muesli coloured Aran knit in the murder mystery Knives Out has a) utterly broken the internet b) made people rethink their life choices, based on a desire to get intimate with a piece of clothing. Or, as writer Ira Madison III put it: \u201cI just ordered Chris Evans\u2019 sweater from Knives Out and I can\u2019t wait to **** it.\u201d Quite. Even the film\u2019s official marketing has nodded to the fact: in an official video statement, \u201cthe film everyone\u2019s talking about\u201d has been amended to \u201cthe sweater everyone\u2019s talking about\u201d. (Evans, himself, touchingly admitted he nicked the, what I\u2019m now referring to as the Charlie Bit My Finger of Wool Garments, off the film set to presumably set fire to it, in case it elbowed him out of the way and got cast in a new Captain America franchise). The Knives Out jumper is part of a new trend for the The Statement Utility Jumper. Recently, we\u2019ve also seen the ribbed, tight-fitting jumper in the No Time to Die poster, where James Bond looks as if he is both #humblebragging about his pecs but also semaphoring an edgy, ready-for-the-apocalypse vibe (all in all, very War Core). And Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe in The Lighthouse, going quietly off-kilter in ribbed, wide-necked jumpers. These jumpers feel imbued with a pre-worn history and a heavy attitude. As Knives Out costume designer Jenny Eagan said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the sweater or who\u2019s wearing the sweater.\u201d The Statement Utility Jumper is all very \u201cBig Knit Energy\u201d (Hi, Sarah Lund) and exactly the opposite of The Christmas Jumper that, in contrast, has all the dark energy and presence of Crazy Frog\u2019s cover of Last Christmas. In interesting timing, the Christmas jumper was officially cancelled last week when charity Hubbub said they were bad for the environment. An early Christmas present for anyone who felt the juddering, in-coming horror at the thought of wearing their Hotline Bling jumper to the Christmas party next week.",

We met eight-year-old Courtney and watched her counting down till her family\u2019s next universal credit payment while worrying about whether her mum would get a present from Santa.

We met eight-year-old Courtney and watched her counting down till her family\u2019s next universal credit payment while worrying about whether her mum would get a present from Santa. Courtney\u2019s family have been sleeping in coats and visiting food banks because of problems with their benefits. We met Danielle, a 15-year-old from Sudbury who lives with her mum and sister in a cramped bedsit flat, still trying to study for her GCSEs though she\u2019s struggling with self-harming issues and suicidal thoughts.

But enough of the caveats. Many pundits have said that this is an uninspiring election, that voters are underwhelmed by the choices. But the rise in youth engagement suggests otherwise: that among the young there is palpable excitement about the potential for imaginative, radical change. If this registration surge is reflected in turnout, who knows what may happen? In the recent galvanising spirit of optimism that I found in the Labour manifesto, I see no shame in saying: there is hope. \u2022 Micha Frazer-Carroll is opinions editor at gal-dem",

      "bodyText": "Alfie Meadows spoke of the \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d he felt after being hit with a police baton during a student protest in 2010 that resulted in a brain injury requiring emergency surgery, a hearing has been told. Meadows, then a 20-year-old philosophy student at Middlesex University, was among more than 10,000 people demonstrating against the rise in student fees in London on 9 December 2010. Det Con Mark Alston is accused of using unreasonable force against Meadows, who needed more than 100 staples in his head and was left with a large scar. Alston is facing a misconduct hearing in central London accused of using unreasonable force. Video footage shown at the hearing appeared to capture the moment Alston and another unknown officer raised their baton and bringing it down. During his testimony, Meadows said a police officer was \u201cthrashing his baton around\u201d before striking him. \u201cThe baton swung from high to low. It was coming straight towards my head. I instinctively span around because I thought I was about to be hit by the baton and as soon as I span around I was struck by the baton,\u201d he told the hearing. \u201cI was struck on the top right of my head and it was incredibly hard and painful.

I was very concerned for my health and I wanted to get away from the police as quickly as possible.\u201d Alston, then of PC rank, was deployed to police the protest, which turned violent in and around Parliament Square. After the protest, Meadows was charged with causing violent disorder and taken to court, where he was cleared by a jury in 2013. An investigation by the police watchdog, now called the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), found Alston had a case to answer for gross misconduct but City of London police rejected the recommendation. The force failed in a court bid to challenge the IOPC\u2019s direction that he should face a full hearing and Alston appeared in front of a disciplinary panel on Wednesday. A response to the allegations submitted on Alston\u2019s behalf said: \u201cThe officer accepts he wielded his baton, but denies that it was in a violent, uncontrolled and dangerous manner or was in any way disproportionate in light of the circumstances in which he was operating. The officer denies hitting Mr Meadows, or anyone, on the head with it.\u201d Meadows told the hearing that after he was struck, he pushed people out of the way and it took him a while to get through the crowd. \u201cI took my mask off and touched my head and felt blood to my head.

      "body": "<p>Has the British musical lost its mojo? Jake Gyllenhaal, who will be in London next year to co-star in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Sunday in the Park With George, thinks that it has. He\u2019s been telling a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jake-gyllenhaal-calls-on-britain-to-get-its-musical-mojo-back-wnlbd5ptv\">reporter for the Times</a> that, since the heyday of the 1980s and 90s, British musicals are no longer bombarding Broadway, which, he argues, is now setting the pace. Mr Gyllenhaal is a damn fine actor but I\u2019m not sure he can be relied on as a cultural commentator.</p> <p>For a start his remarks comes at a time when the British musical is enjoying something of a resurgence. Forget, for a moment, Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/05/i-was-welling-up-teachers-report-on-their-school-of-rock-students\">School of Rock</a>, which has been filling the New London Theatre for the past two years or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/07/musicals-we-love-matilda\">Matilda</a>, admittedly by Tim Minchin who is part-Australian, which has been at the Cambridge theatre even longer. Has Mr Gyllenhaal heard of a hit called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/22/six-musical-henry-wives-fringe-to-broadway-lucy-moss-toby-marlow\">Six</a>, by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, which is a tune-and-toe show about Tudor queens? He also ignores <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/14/everybodys-talking-about-jamie-review-crucible-sheffield-the-feeling\">Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie</a>, composed by Dan Gillespie Sells with lyrics by Tom MacRae, which has had a long life since its Sheffield opening. News has presumably not yet reached Mr Gyllenhaal about the RSC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/28/the-boy-in-the-dress-review\">The Boy in the Dress</a>, with music and lyrics by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers, which strikes a blow for individual self-expression and pupil power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d03ba5ee51331066d137f55a515e1d6fcd74dea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d03ba5ee51331066d137f55a515e1d6fcd74dea/136_2_3813_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Long life \u2026 Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Muir</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not only is the British musical enjoying a mini-boom, what strikes me is that, when it comes to directors, choreographers and performers, we no longer need to bow the knee to Broadway. I\u2019d remind Mr Gyllenhaal that it was a British director, Marianne Elliott, who had the wit to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/17/company-review-sex-switch-sondheim-gielgud-theatre-london\">re-gender Sondheim\u2019s Company</a> by making the protagonist a woman, thereby giving the story an extra emotional depth. Stephen Mear, whose triumphs include Gypsy, Kiss Me Kate and who co-choreographed Mary Poppins with Matthew Bourne, seems to me a match for anyone on Broadway. If Mr Gyllenhaal has time, I\u2019d also suggest he drops in on the Menier Chocolate Factory revival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/04/the-boy-friend-review-menier-chocolate-factory-london\">The Boy Friend</a> where Bill Deamer has choreographed the best Charleston you\u2019ll ever see, as well as exhilarating tangos and two-steps.</p> <p>We\u2019re also not lacking for musical performers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/16/gypsy-review-imelda-staunton-momma-rose-stephen-sondheim-jonathan-kent-peter-davison\">Imelda Staunton\u2019s performance as Mama Rose in Gypsy</a> was a revelation in reminding us that the character was both a manipulative mum and a gutsy, wannabe star. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/13/mary-poppins-review-prince-edward-theatre-richard-eyre\">Mary Poppins, Zizi Strallen</a> invests the flying nanny with a balletic grace and a strange, unearthly quality.

      "bodyText": "Has the British musical lost its mojo? Jake Gyllenhaal, who will be in London next year to co-star in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Sunday in the Park With George, thinks that it has. He\u2019s been telling a reporter for the Times that, since the heyday of the 1980s and 90s, British musicals are no longer bombarding Broadway, which, he argues, is now setting the pace. Mr Gyllenhaal is a damn fine actor but I\u2019m not sure he can be relied on as a cultural commentator. For a start his remarks comes at a time when the British musical is enjoying something of a resurgence. Forget, for a moment, Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s School of Rock, which has been filling the New London Theatre for the past two years or Matilda, admittedly by Tim Minchin who is part-Australian, which has been at the Cambridge theatre even longer. Has Mr Gyllenhaal heard of a hit called Six, by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, which is a tune-and-toe show about Tudor queens? He also ignores Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie, composed by Dan Gillespie Sells with lyrics by Tom MacRae, which has had a long life since its Sheffield opening. News has presumably not yet reached Mr Gyllenhaal about the RSC\u2019s The Boy in the Dress, with music and lyrics by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers, which strikes a blow for individual self-expression and pupil power. Not only is the British musical enjoying a mini-boom, what strikes me is that, when it comes to directors, choreographers and performers, we no longer need to bow the knee to Broadway. I\u2019d remind Mr Gyllenhaal that it was a British director, Marianne Elliott, who had the wit to re-gender Sondheim\u2019s Company by making the protagonist a woman, thereby giving the story an extra emotional depth. Stephen Mear, whose triumphs include Gypsy, Kiss Me Kate and who co-choreographed Mary Poppins with Matthew Bourne, seems to me a match for anyone on Broadway. If Mr Gyllenhaal has time, I\u2019d also suggest he drops in on the Menier Chocolate Factory revival of The Boy Friend where Bill Deamer has choreographed the best Charleston you\u2019ll ever see, as well as exhilarating tangos and two-steps. We\u2019re also not lacking for musical performers. Imelda Staunton\u2019s performance as Mama Rose in Gypsy was a revelation in reminding us that the character was both a manipulative mum and a gutsy, wannabe star. As Mary Poppins, Zizi Strallen invests the flying nanny with a balletic grace and a strange, unearthly quality. And this year, two young performers, only just out of drama school, have taken the town by storm. One was Jac Yarrow in the title role of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, who made the London Palladium stage look like his natural habitat. The other is Sam Tutty, who plays the shy, socially awkward hero in Dear Evan Hansen with astonishing technical assurance. But behind Mr Gyllenhaal\u2019s remarks lie a bigger issue. The British musical is in a much healthier state than he assumes. But I don\u2019t see it as the prime function of the British theatre to supply Broadway with a chain of gold-plated, ready-made hits. I welcome the fact that the National Theatre, under Rufus Norris, is focusing on plays that reflect the state of the nation rather than seeking to explore the American musical back catalogue or search for potential commercial transfers.

Greenhouse gas emissions rose by 0.6% last year \u2013 less than in recent years, but not enough to turn the corner.

Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to \u201cavoid dangerous climate change\u201d, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way.

In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time&nbsp;to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.</p>\n    <p>The negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.<br></p>\n    <p>Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China.

It\u2019s only my second Muriel Spark novel (no prizes for guessing the other) but it certainly won\u2019t be the last.</p> </blockquote> <p>Constellations by Sinead Gleeson has given <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3165651\">captainlego </a></strong>plenty to think about:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is part memoir, part essay collection with the unifying theme of the body, and what it is like, or what it means to live our lives through our bodies (if that makes sense). Gleeson has/had a history of quite serious illness, so the book is a reflection of her experiences in dealing with her own illnesses and at the hands of various surgeons, nurses, midwives and the Irish medical profession in general. It\u2019s a thoughtful and reflective read; at times funny, poetic and heartbreaking, but shot through with great humanity and good humour.</p> </blockquote> <p>Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s <strong>Flights</strong> (translated by Jennifer Croft) has also had <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/748720\">JayZed </a></strong>looking at constellations:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Flights is a fragmentary, essayistic meditation on travel, connectedness and human anatomy with no clear narrative structure. It comprises over 100 sections ranging from a couple of sentences to 30+ pages: while some of the longer sections can be read as short stories, many of the shorter sections are simply brief meditations on an aspect of travel psychology or anatomy.</p> <p>Tokarczuk has described this structure as a \u201cconstellation novel\u201d in which the author throws her stories into orbit, allowing the reader to form meaningful shapes from them. It makes for a challenging read, and I have to confess to finishing the novel (if indeed it is a novel) feeling that I\u2019d encountered some interesting themes and ideas among the fragments, but I hadn\u2019t quite figured out what the point was.</p> <p>Despite that, there was a lot to like about this. The writing is consistently good, and the book included some compelling stories (the Dutch anatomist who dissected his own amputated leg; a Polish man whose family inexplicably goes missing on a Croatian island; a retired sailor who takes a ferry out into the open seas) and explored many interesting ideas. I felt that I learned a lot from the journey, even if the destination wasn\u2019t clear to me. Maybe that was the point.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elizabeth Strout\u2019s Olive Kitteridge has enchanted <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16791163\">allworthy</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How could I have not read it before? Strout\u2019s an alchemist. How does she do it? You think you know someone and then you\u2019re shown again. So deft with just a few brush strokes and Olive herself. How brilliant is it to have a no frills, no nonsense, complex heroine who is flawed and yet we care for her. It is pure magic.</p> </blockquote> <p>Julia Boyd\u2019s Travellers in the Third Reich has fascinated <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16488741\">Alexia_R</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think I may have first heard about this book here. If so, thank you to those of you who recommended it. I thought it was a fantastic piece of research. Utterly fascinating. She draws on material from all sorts of People travelling in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, naturally many of them are well-off but by no means all. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in Germany and also just in the rise of extremism and how people actually living through it see it without the benefit of hindsight.</p> </blockquote> <p>Purity is <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15798790\">Veufveuve</a>\u2019s first time with a Jonathan Franzen novel:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I thought it was just terrific storytelling. He controls the multiple strands superbly as they weave across time and space, bringing it together beautifully at the end. (The nod to Dickens via Pip is cheeky but not entirely unearned.) My wife says I\u2019m the only person she can admit to having enjoyed this to. There\u2019s little doubt its written with a powerful male gaze but I also think the only two truly sympathetic characters are both women: Pip and Leila.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12546532\">NicolaVintageReads </a>has been re-reading Persuasion and \u2013 oh my goodness:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My edition has the cancelled chapter where Captain Wentworth proposes to Anne at the lodgings of Admiral Croft. Would be wonderful to know why Austen changed her mind about this chapter and decided on Captain Wentworth declaring his feelings in a letter written while Anne was in the room. The more I re-read Persuasion the more I like the cancelled chapter!</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s right.

Let\u2019s start with a success story. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished Memento Mori by Muriel Spark,\u201d says ignicapilla, \u201cyet another recommendation from this forum and another that I\u2019ve enjoyed enormously\u201d: The thing that struck me most about the book was that the average age of the main characters is around 80 and I can\u2019t remember reading anything else that gives more than scant attention to a single character from that age group.

She draws on material from all sorts of People travelling in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, naturally many of them are well-off but by no means all. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in Germany and also just in the rise of extremism and how people actually living through it see it without the benefit of hindsight. Purity is Veufveuve\u2019s first time with a Jonathan Franzen novel: I thought it was just terrific storytelling. He controls the multiple strands superbly as they weave across time and space, bringing it together beautifully at the end. (The nod to Dickens via Pip is cheeky but not entirely unearned.) My wife says I\u2019m the only person she can admit to having enjoyed this to. There\u2019s little doubt its written with a powerful male gaze but I also think the only two truly sympathetic characters are both women: Pip and Leila. Finally, NicolaVintageReads has been re-reading Persuasion and \u2013 oh my goodness: My edition has the cancelled chapter where Captain Wentworth proposes to Anne at the lodgings of Admiral Croft. Would be wonderful to know why Austen changed her mind about this chapter and decided on Captain Wentworth declaring his feelings in a letter written while Anne was in the room. The more I re-read Persuasion the more I like the cancelled chapter! That\u2019s right. There\u2019s an alternate (almost) ending. Wow. Interesting links about books and reading John F Callahan looks at decades of Ralph Ellison correspondence. The secret feminist history of Shakespeare and Company. Critics from the New York Times discuss their favourite books of the year. Bharat Tandon tries to make Henry James\u2019s Bostonians sound interesting. \u201cPrinters ink is the greater explosive,\u201d reads a sign watching over the Poetry Room at City Lights Bookstore. An encomium to a special place. He needs a bigger boat: Connor Harrison wants to get his books to Canada.

Cattelan\u2019s Comedian is a banana taped to a wall. Descriptions tend to carefully specify that it is fixed there with grey duct tape. Everyone stresses this somewhat bare technical fact, as if to find physical evidence that it really is, after all, art. At the weekend, after Comedian had already sold for $120,000, an artist named David Datuna joined the queue of fair-goers eager to take selfies with Comedian, but instead peeled back the grey duct tape<em>, </em>removed the banana from the wall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/08/banana-artwork-that-fetched-120000-is-eaten-by-hungry-artist\">and ate it</a>.

America, as Cattelan called his loo, reduced gold from the precious to the base as it invited users to pee and poo on this most coveted of metals. A banana is another way of making the point: that we\u2019re all organisms that eat, excrete and die. (After eating an overripe banana, Datuna may well have needed the loo.) Cattelan\u2019s toilet mocked the money-obsessed art world by being potentially more valuable for its raw material than its concept \u2013 reflecting a market that can turn shit to gold.

      "bodyText": "In his final pre-election speech, John McDonnell has repeatedly attacked Boris Johnson for being untrustworthy and making promises he did not intend to keep. The shadow chancellor said the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, was correct when she questioned the prime minister\u2019s word as he outlined plans for Labour\u2019s first 100 days in government. His comments came at a launch of Labour\u2019s priorities in its first 100 days in office, including a promise to end austerity on 5 February with a first budget if elected to government on Thursday. Labour is expected to intensify criticisms of Johnson\u2019s reliability in the final three days of the campaign as it seeks to close down a 14-point deficit behind the Conservatives in the polls. McDonnell said he agreed with Foster, who on Monday morning indicated that she could not trust the prime minister after he broke his word over the Brexit deal in Northern Ireland. \u201cIsn\u2019t it interesting that as the prime minister tours around different constituencies, he finds it incredibly difficult even to mix with people \u2026 What we\u2019re getting back on the doorstep is he\u2019s probably the least trusted politician that people have ever experienced. \u201cArlene Foster, I think, has come to a judgment this morning which is echoed right the way across the country; this is a man whose word you cannot trust. \u201cI agree with Arlene Foster \u2013 you won\u2019t hear those words very often \u2013 you can\u2019t trust him,\u201d he said. At his final major speech of the campaign, held in Waterloo, central London, McDonnell said: \u201cMy first act as chancellor will be to write to the Office for Budget Responsibility, asking them to begin their preparations for my first budget, which will be given on 5 February \u2013 the date when almost 10 years of cuts will come to an end.\u201d He said the three priorities for the Treasury of the next Labour government would be to end austerity in social security and public services, invest in communities as part of Labour\u2019s green industrial revolution, and bring key utilities into public ownership under democratic management. The planned measures include putting more money into an emergency package of reforms to universal credit while Labour designs a replacement social security system, introducing a real living wage of \u00a310 an hour for workers over 16, providing funding for a 5% pay rise for all public sector workers and enacting the department spending plans promised in Labour\u2019s \u201cgrey book\u201d, Funding Real Change, putting billions more into schools, hospitals and social care. McDonnell said Labour must confront the two problems of a climate crisis and the devastation wrought by 10 years of austerity. \u201cThere is a twin emergency in this country. These next few days are going to be key in addressing them,\u201d he said. \u201cOur green industrial revolution will deliver the changes we need to avert climate catastrophe. And it will put British industry back on the map, bringing prosperity to every part of our country. It will give every community something to be proud of.\u201d McDonnell also used his speech on Monday to set out fresh details of Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans, including creating people\u2019s assemblies as part of the oversight for the renationalised utilities. McDonnell has said he \u201cwould expect\u201d the DUP to support a Labour government\u2019s programme but ruled out any attempt at a pact if the party failed to win a outright majority. \u201cIf we were in a minority position, there\u2019d be no deals, no pacts, no coalitions or anything like that. \u201cIt will be up to other parties to actually take their decision on what aspects of that programme they\u2019ll support and those that they don\u2019t. \u201cOver the years I have worked with individual DUP politicians. I can\u2019t see them voting against the real living wage, I can\u2019t see them voting against the levels of investment that we want to put in right the way across the country, including Northern Ireland.\u201d Asked to comment on a report in the Sunday Times which claimed that McDonnell could take over as an interim leader if Labour lose and Corbyn resigns, he said that it was not a valid question because Labour would win.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been accused of not caring after he repeatedly refused during a TV interview to look at a photo of a four-year-old boy forced to sleep on the floor at an overcrowded A&amp;E unit, before pocketing the reporter\u2019s phone on which he was being shown the picture. In an ITV interview during a campaign visit to a factory in Sunderland, the prime minister was challenged about the plight of Jack Williment-Barr, who was pictured sleeping under coats on a hospital floor in Leeds as he waited for a bed, despite having suspected pneumonia. Johnson refused to look at the photo and, out of camera shot, eventually took the phone from the reporter and put it in his own pocket. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, responded by tweeting a video of the exchange with the message: \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d First asked if he had seen the photographs, Johnson said he had not. The ITV reporter, Joe Pike, then showed the prime minister the photograph on his phone, describing what it portrayed. Johnson declined to look at the picture, saying: \u201cI understand. And obviously, we have every possible sympathy for everybody who has a bad experience in the NHS.\u201d He went on to discuss investment in the NHS and Brexit. Pike pressed the prime minister: \u201cI\u2019m talking about this boy, prime minister. How do you feel, looking at that photo?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cOf course. And let me tell you \u2026 I haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it.\u201d Pike asked: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at it now, prime minister?\u201d Johnson, still not looking at the photo, replied: \u201cI\u2019ll study it later.\u201d Pressed again, he said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll give you an interview now. What we are doing is we are taking this country forward, and we are investing in the NHS.\u201d Johnson then appeared, out of camera shot, to take the phone out of Pike\u2019s hand and put it into his coat pocket. The reporter challenged him on this: \u201cYou\u2019ve refused to look at the photo, you\u2019ve taken my phone and put it in your pocket, prime minister. His mother says the NHS is in crisis. What\u2019s your response to that?\u201d At this point, Johnson removed the phone and looked at the picture for the first time: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologise, obviously, to the family and all of those who have terrible experiences in the NHS. But what we are doing is supporting the NHS and on the whole, I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had.\u201d Johnson ended by handing back the phone: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have taken your phone.

      "body": "<p>Listening doesn\u2019t seem to be in fashion these days. Shouting? Yes. But really listening to a different point of view? Not so much. Craig Taylor\u2019s series of sketches, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/series/one-million-tiny-plays-about-britain\">originally appeared in the Guardian</a>, feel like a welcome antidote to all the noise and fury. Some scenes are just a few seconds long but they are insightful, funny and encompass a huge range of characters across the country. It is a pleasure to sit with them for a while.</p> <p>The show originally appeared <a href=\"https://www.watermill.org.uk/one_million_tiny_plays_about_britain_2016\">at the Watermill theatre in 2016</a> and, for this latest stage outing, <a href=\"https://www.cecicalf.com/\">Ceci Calf</a>\u2019s set has gone all Christmassy. There are tinsel stars, a tinsel tree and tinsel trimmings; the full festive works. There\u2019s also a big bingo board on the back wall, which frames the show both visually and structurally. As the numbers are called, a voiceover artist sets the scene \u2013 with a few jokes thrown in for good measure. Admittedly, the shtick begins to wear a little thin, but it\u2019s a tidy way to pull the show together.</p> <p>Actors Emma Barclay and Alec Nicholls make things light, focused and occasionally surprisingly moving. They wear all their costumes in one go and then, with each new sketch, strip off their layers to reveal other characters hidden inside. There\u2019s a gentle mayhem to Laura Keefe\u2019s production, which has been tightly choreographed yet still feels loose and relaxed.

      "bodyText": "Listening doesn\u2019t seem to be in fashion these days. Shouting? Yes. But really listening to a different point of view? Not so much. Craig Taylor\u2019s series of sketches, which originally appeared in the Guardian, feel like a welcome antidote to all the noise and fury. Some scenes are just a few seconds long but they are insightful, funny and encompass a huge range of characters across the country. It is a pleasure to sit with them for a while. The show originally appeared at the Watermill theatre in 2016 and, for this latest stage outing, Ceci Calf\u2019s set has gone all Christmassy. There are tinsel stars, a tinsel tree and tinsel trimmings; the full festive works. There\u2019s also a big bingo board on the back wall, which frames the show both visually and structurally. As the numbers are called, a voiceover artist sets the scene \u2013 with a few jokes thrown in for good measure. Admittedly, the shtick begins to wear a little thin, but it\u2019s a tidy way to pull the show together. Actors Emma Barclay and Alec Nicholls make things light, focused and occasionally surprisingly moving. They wear all their costumes in one go and then, with each new sketch, strip off their layers to reveal other characters hidden inside. There\u2019s a gentle mayhem to Laura Keefe\u2019s production, which has been tightly choreographed yet still feels loose and relaxed. As the actors cobble together yet another scene, grabbing at seemingly random props, they laugh with the audience, always careful to let us in on the joke. The very best skits look indirectly but with real pertinence at some of the country\u2019s most pressing issues, including the strained NHS, the housing crisis and loneliness among an ageing population. In one very clever and very funny scene, a kid freaks out about the CCTV cameras watching her from every angle (\u201cBut who are they protecting us from?\u201d).

No other party comes close.</p> <p>Money matters in politics, particularly during general elections. Running a campaign is a costly business. When it comes to political funding, Britain sits somewhere between the United States and Europe. Unlike in many European states, parties, and even individual politicians, largely finance themselves through private donations. Unlike in the US, the amount of money in British politics is pretty meagre. The 2018 US midterm elections were estimated to have <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/07/politics/midterm-election-costs-topped-5-7-billion/index.html\">cost almost $6b</a><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/07/politics/midterm-election-costs-topped-5-7-billion/index.html\">n</a>.

The Tories are increasingly reliant on a small group of very wealthy, overwhelmingly pro-Brexit donors, mostly involved in the City of London. Last week, a billionaire businessman, <a href=\"https://politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/news/108397/tories-rake-seven-times-more-donations-labour-thanks-billionaire\">Peter Hargreaves, gave the Conservatives \u00a31m</a>.

The Conservatives have said the same, but a look at the party\u2019s most recent accounts suggests that\u2019s unlikely.

      "body": "<p>The loathsome Roger Ailes, notorious as a former Nixon apparatchik and veteran CEO of the stridently mediocre Fox News channel, became even less fragrant in 2016 when the open secret of his sexual harassment became an open non-secret. The channel\u2019s former anchor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/06/fox-news-gretchen-carlson-settlement-roger-ailes\">Gretchen Carlson successfully filed a lawsuit</a> against him, revealing that he made sexual advances to her and other women at Fox; their careers would be advanced (or cancelled) at his seedy whim. Carlson\u2019s courageous lawsuit was supported by six other women and the 76-year-old Ailes\u2019s own boss, Rupert Murdoch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">fired his </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">underling</a>, who died a year later.</p> <p>This gruesome soap opera of misogyny and reactionary politics has already been turned into a Showtime TV drama, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/05/the-loudest-voice-review-portrait-of-a-monster-that-misses-the-bigger-story\">The Loudest Voice</a>, with Naomi Watts as Carlson and Russell Crowe as Ailes \u2013 and now it is a movie directed by Jay Roach and written by Charles Randolph, with Nicole Kidman as Carlson and John Lithgow horribly plausible and latexed up as her bloated old sex-criminal employer. Charlize Theron is Fox News presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/20/megyn-kelly-donald-trump-fox-news-truce\">Megyn Kelly, who infuriated the Fox News fanbase</a> by challenging Trump on his anti-women attitudes before the election, and Margot Robbie plays Katya Pospisil, a fictional composite of all the younger women who were abused. She is the \u201cChristian influencer\u201d on Instagram who figures she can get ahead at Fox, and submits, almost in a dream, to the humiliation required.</p> <p>It is a strange film in some ways, speckled with powerful, insightful moments but also with some strained acting, pulled punches and fudged attitudes, unable to decide if its heroines are compromised through having been loyal Fox staffers. Ailes is the obvious villain but Murdoch (still alive, with lawyers and power in the media world) is almost presented as the good guy, finally intervening to create a happy ending and played in cameo by Malcolm McDowell. Despite the film\u2019s title, the Carlson/Ailes lawsuit was not a bombshell in the way the Harvey Weinstein revelations were a year later.

      "bodyText": "The loathsome Roger Ailes, notorious as a former Nixon apparatchik and veteran CEO of the stridently mediocre Fox News channel, became even less fragrant in 2016 when the open secret of his sexual harassment became an open non-secret. The channel\u2019s former anchor Gretchen Carlson successfully filed a lawsuit against him, revealing that he made sexual advances to her and other women at Fox; their careers would be advanced (or cancelled) at his seedy whim. Carlson\u2019s courageous lawsuit was supported by six other women and the 76-year-old Ailes\u2019s own boss, Rupert Murdoch, fired his underling, who died a year later. This gruesome soap opera of misogyny and reactionary politics has already been turned into a Showtime TV drama, The Loudest Voice, with Naomi Watts as Carlson and Russell Crowe as Ailes \u2013 and now it is a movie directed by Jay Roach and written by Charles Randolph, with Nicole Kidman as Carlson and John Lithgow horribly plausible and latexed up as her bloated old sex-criminal employer. Charlize Theron is Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly, who infuriated the Fox News fanbase by challenging Trump on his anti-women attitudes before the election, and Margot Robbie plays Katya Pospisil, a fictional composite of all the younger women who were abused. She is the \u201cChristian influencer\u201d on Instagram who figures she can get ahead at Fox, and submits, almost in a dream, to the humiliation required. It is a strange film in some ways, speckled with powerful, insightful moments but also with some strained acting, pulled punches and fudged attitudes, unable to decide if its heroines are compromised through having been loyal Fox staffers. Ailes is the obvious villain but Murdoch (still alive, with lawyers and power in the media world) is almost presented as the good guy, finally intervening to create a happy ending and played in cameo by Malcolm McDowell. Despite the film\u2019s title, the Carlson/Ailes lawsuit was not a bombshell in the way the Harvey Weinstein revelations were a year later. This may have been because Ailes\u2019s accuser was no feminist, and was for years fully on board with the aggressively boorish and sexist attitudes of Fox News. As for Kelly, the film uses some narrative sleight of hand to suggest that she joined forces with Carlson, when it fact she appears to have limited her support to reporting her own harassment from Ailes in an internal investigation. Where Bombshell succeeds is in showing how the predatory and sinister abuse plays out in the corporate environment \u2013 in bullying. The film shows that sexual harassment and bullying are not separate issues but part of the continuum of coercion.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of confidential interviews with key figures involved in prosecuting the 18-year US war in Afghanistan have revealed that the US public has been consistently misled about an unwinnable conflict. Transcripts of the interviews, published by the Washington Post after a three-year legal battle, were collected for a Lessons Learned project by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar), a federal agency whose main task is eliminating corruption and inefficiency in the US war effort. The 2,000 pages of documents reveal the bleak and unvarnished views of many insiders in a war that has cost $1tn (\u00a3760bn) and killed more than 2,300 US servicemen and women, with more than 20,000 injured. Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians have died in the conflict. The documents have echoes of the Pentagon Papers \u2013 the US military\u2019s secret history of the Vietnam war that were leaked in 1971 and told a similarly troubling story of the cover-up of military failure. Negotiations are taking place between the Trump administration and the Taliban as the US debates whether to withdraw 13,000 troops who remain in Afghanistan. The interviews were collected, beginning in 2014, in addition to Sigar\u2019s regular audits to identify what could be learned from successive policy failures in Afghanistan. While many of the failures of the war in Afghanistan have been exposed by Sigar\u2019s work, often in highly technical reports, the cache of interviews offers an easily accessible fly-on-the-wall account. In his own damning intervention John Sopko, the head of Sigar, told the paper the assessments contained in the project suggested that \u201cthe American people have constantly been lied to\u201d. Two major claims in the documents are that US officials manipulated statistics to suggest to the American public that the war was being won and that successive administrations turned a blind eye to widespread corruption among Afghan officials, allowing the theft of US aid with impunity. The long-term nature of the manipulation of statistics was detailed in an interview with an individual identified only as a senior \u201cNational Security Council official\u201d. \u201cIt was impossible to create good metrics. We tried using troop numbers trained, violence levels, control of territory and none of it painted an accurate picture,\u201d the official told interviewers in 2016. \u201cThe metrics were always manipulated for the duration of the war.\u201d The papers depict the view of many people of a conflict with vague and unachievable war aims, pursued under three US presidents, George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, whose alleged successes were presented repeatedly in inflated terms.

Cut the lemon into wedges and season the ricotta with a squeeze of juice from one of the wedges, along with some salt and pepper.</p> <p>When you\u2019re ready to eat, heat a large frying pan on a medium-high heat until smoking hot.

Alternatively, if you have children with a sweet tooth, whip half the ricotta with a little sugar instead of salt, and serve with runny honey or maple syrup instead of the salmon.</p> <h2><strong>Fiona Beckett\u2019s drinks match</strong></h2> <p>My first thought was to recommend iced vodka shots, but that\u2019s more New Year\u2019s Eve than Christmas Day.

Pour slowly into the flour, beating it in bit by bit with a wooden spoon. When the batter is smooth, cover and leave in a warm place for 30-60 minutes, to prove (depending on how much time you have). Beat the egg whites to soft peaks in a clean bowl, then fold into the batter with a metal spoon. Leave for another 30-60 minutes to prove again. Meanwhile, add the lemon zest to the ricotta and stir in the oil. Cut the lemon into wedges and season the ricotta with a squeeze of juice from one of the wedges, along with some salt and pepper. When you\u2019re ready to eat, heat a large frying pan on a medium-high heat until smoking hot. Add the butter, then teaspoons of the batter, and cook until bubbles appear. Flip over and cook for another minute or so on the other side, until golden. Cook in batches, keeping the cooked ones warm in a low oven. Serve the pancakes warm with a dollop of ricotta, a few slices of trout or salmon, a sprinkle of chives, a little caviar and lemon wedges. Alternatively, if you have children with a sweet tooth, whip half the ricotta with a little sugar instead of salt, and serve with runny honey or maple syrup instead of the salmon. Fiona Beckett\u2019s drinks match My first thought was to recommend iced vodka shots, but that\u2019s more New Year\u2019s Eve than Christmas Day. Fizz is an option (see here for my festive recommendations), but a good sauvignon blanc would be even better.

      "body": "<p>Much of the debate concerning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/noah-baumbach\">Noah Baumbach</a>\u2019s latest film has not concerned how good it is: this divorce drama has unified critics and audiences like few others this season. Its debut on the small screen has not come with the disappointment, even anger, that accompanied the Netflix drop of Martin Scorsese\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-irishman\">The Irishman</a> \u2013 though that was a film whose length and visuals make it much less suited to the telly.</p> <p>Rather, the debate has largely been tribal: do you side with Nicole or with Charlie? Or do you take a higher moral ground and contend that such reductiveness is antithetical to the spirit of art and demeans all those who indulge in it?</p> <p>Here, we have our wedding cake and eat it.</p> <h2>Why it\u2019s Nicole\u2019s fault</h2> <p>She\u2019s the one who moves to Los Angeles. She doesn\u2019t have to \u2013 they <em>are</em> a New York family, despite her having been raised on the west coast. The pilot looks ropey, and surely there are other work opportunities she could have enjoyed in New York, had she a little more vision (and confidence).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/15/marriage-story-review-noah-baumbach-adam-driver-scarlett-johansson\">Marriage Story review \u2013 everything you always wanted to know about divorce | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Secondly: she hires Nora, and believes she\u2019ll play fair. That\u2019s a major error of judgment. Plus, whether by design or accident, she blocks Charlie using most other affordable lawyers by consulting them first. Apparently, her sister set up the meetings, but, given the number of them, it\u2019s hard to believe that she saw them all accidentally.</p> <p>The incidentals seem mean, too: not offering Charlie a bed for the night on the day he\u2019s served with divorce papers. The last-minute volte face about Halloween. Right from that initial mediator meeting, Nicole is by far the more spiky and volatile \u2013 the person who makes things difficult.</p> <h2>Why it\u2019s Charlie\u2019s fault</h2> <p>He cheated. He was wrapped up in his work to the detriment of both Nicole\u2019s career and her sense of self. He didn\u2019t temporarily move to LA when they were married \u2013 though did agree to a hiatus in Europe.</p> <h2>Nicole\u2019s redeeming features</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d721013fa14f21163b1f8a99227cbcba5da4ee2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d721013fa14f21163b1f8a99227cbcba5da4ee2/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cMarriage Story \u201c (2019)Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver, \u201cMarriage Story \u201c (2019) Credit: Wilson Webb / Netflix / The Hollywood Archive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She\u2019s honest, while Charlie does fib a little. She does more of the childcare. She has to contend with her own family, as well as her ex \u2013 though this is also a luxury that Charlie (who\u2019s estranged from his own parents) can\u2019t enjoy. She\u2019s essentially kind and loving; suckered by Nora when she\u2019s at her most vulnerable and the lawyer is at her most rapacious. Late on, she concedes she did the wrong thing in proceeding with lawyers, though the way that confrontation plays out goes some way to vindicating her decision.</p> <p>Plus, she\u2019s the victim of something bigger than just this story. The first scene earning rounds of applause in the cinema is Nicole\u2019s blindside against the injustice of the pressures put on mothers but not on fathers. It\u2019s calculated, articulate, cathartic \u2013 and valid.</p> <h2>Charlie\u2019s redeeming features</h2> <p>How long have you got? He\u2019s a self-made genius. A wonderful boss; if anything too diligent and kind. A fantastic father: creative, loving, devoted. He moves 3,000 miles, away from everything else he loves, to be with his son. He\u2019s an adorable son- and brother-in-law.</p> <p>All his flaws are forgivable and his errors of judgment relatable \u2013 who hasn\u2019t struggled with a rental-car child seat? Sometimes they\u2019re even aspirational: sure, he cheated, but only once. And, as he says, he stayed faithful in his 20s, when he had ample opportunity and appetite to stray.</p> <p>One of the funniest scenes in the film comes when Charlie and Henry spend the evening under the mirthless gaze of Martha Kelly\u2019s mediator \u2013 and he accidentally slices his arm open. Charlie protests its painlessness through the agony to brilliant comic effect. But have no doubt: this man <em>bleeds</em>.</p> <p>Charlie is the one who says that he hopes every day that his ex is dead, that she gets ill and then hit by a car and then dies. He\u2019s also the one who is embraced and comforted the very next second. Because, even if he does mean it, he\u2019s been hurt.</p> <h2>Why it\u2019s your fault for caring</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/14/alan-alda-its-amazing-that-most-of-us-live-as-if-were-not-gonna-die\">Alan Alda: 'It's amazing that most of us live as if we're not gonna die'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Few break-ups are without blame on both sides, and no films are interesting that exist in such polarities. The trend for gunning for one of the couple is a nasty, social-media-fuelled impulse that lowers the audience and insults the art.</p> <p>Plus, the split is a red herring \u2013 right? Baumbach himself has protested that it\u2019s not really about divorce at all. But does that ring false? Could it be a way of deflecting attention from the immensely personal private inspiration for the film?</p> <h2>The lawyers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"54dee1c7203072a9980e55cf0e1e6ada33991508\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54dee1c7203072a9980e55cf0e1e6ada33991508/0_87_3432_2060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MArriage Story\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/NETFLIX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two major career renaissances (for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/14/alan-alda-its-amazing-that-most-of-us-live-as-if-were-not-gonna-die\">Alan Alda</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ray-liotta\">Ray Liotta</a>) have been de facto launched by Marriage Story, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/laura-dern\">Laura Dern</a>\u2019s bubbling comeback has gone red hot. Dern has won widespread praise and a small coterie of detractors for her rapacious turn as Nora, the cutthroat broker hired by Nicole. It\u2019s a performance of rare charisma and lethal efficiency \u2013 which makes especially compelling contrast with Dern\u2019s role as Marmie in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/little-women-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-emma-watson\">Little Women</a>, directed by Baumbach\u2019s other half, Greta Gerwig.</p> <p>Did her showstopping turn detract from the human drama for you? How about Alda and Liotta: was the first too cuddly and the latter too bombastic? Or were these turns that reminded you just what gems these actors were to start with?</p> <p>Did the film demonise divorce lawyers? Or are they just doing their \u2013 grisly, necessary \u2013 job?</p> <h2>The Sondheim</h2> <p>It\u2019s easy to forget there are two full performances of numbers from Company in the film. Nicole belts out a larky You Could Drive a Person Crazy with her mother and sister at a family do, while Driver\u2019s internet-breaking version of Being Alive is easily the musical moment of the cinematic year so far. (We\u2019ve yet to experience Cats.) Did his performance floor you? Or did you find it too protracted and self-advertising?</p> <h2>First-world problems</h2> <p>The stakes in the film are, in their specificity, extremely high, and taken in relief to most lives, quite low. The main issue is whether Charlie will need to move to Los Angeles to keep up regular contact with his son. When he does so, it\u2019s pretty seamless \u2013 albeit a bit lonely \u2013 and he finds fulfilling work relatively fast. It\u2019s never an option that the pair will reconcile \u2013 Baumbach sets the action almost entirely post-split, and the sadness of the divorce process comes not primarily from the love affair ending but the attendant stresses and strains and the ways in which the process encourages nastiness. Their son seems relatively well adjusted; we know he will be fine. Money isn\u2019t really an issue. Should we still care? And if we do, why?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Much of the debate concerning Noah Baumbach\u2019s latest film has not concerned how good it is: this divorce drama has unified critics and audiences like few others this season. Its debut on the small screen has not come with the disappointment, even anger, that accompanied the Netflix drop of Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman \u2013 though that was a film whose length and visuals make it much less suited to the telly. Rather, the debate has largely been tribal: do you side with Nicole or with Charlie? Or do you take a higher moral ground and contend that such reductiveness is antithetical to the spirit of art and demeans all those who indulge in it? Here, we have our wedding cake and eat it. Why it\u2019s Nicole\u2019s fault She\u2019s the one who moves to Los Angeles. She doesn\u2019t have to \u2013 they are a New York family, despite her having been raised on the west coast. The pilot looks ropey, and surely there are other work opportunities she could have enjoyed in New York, had she a little more vision (and confidence). Secondly: she hires Nora, and believes she\u2019ll play fair. That\u2019s a major error of judgment. Plus, whether by design or accident, she blocks Charlie using most other affordable lawyers by consulting them first. Apparently, her sister set up the meetings, but, given the number of them, it\u2019s hard to believe that she saw them all accidentally. The incidentals seem mean, too: not offering Charlie a bed for the night on the day he\u2019s served with divorce papers. The last-minute volte face about Halloween. Right from that initial mediator meeting, Nicole is by far the more spiky and volatile \u2013 the person who makes things difficult. Why it\u2019s Charlie\u2019s fault He cheated. He was wrapped up in his work to the detriment of both Nicole\u2019s career and her sense of self. He didn\u2019t temporarily move to LA when they were married \u2013 though did agree to a hiatus in Europe. Nicole\u2019s redeeming features She\u2019s honest, while Charlie does fib a little. She does more of the childcare. She has to contend with her own family, as well as her ex \u2013 though this is also a luxury that Charlie (who\u2019s estranged from his own parents) can\u2019t enjoy. She\u2019s essentially kind and loving; suckered by Nora when she\u2019s at her most vulnerable and the lawyer is at her most rapacious. Late on, she concedes she did the wrong thing in proceeding with lawyers, though the way that confrontation plays out goes some way to vindicating her decision. Plus, she\u2019s the victim of something bigger than just this story. The first scene earning rounds of applause in the cinema is Nicole\u2019s blindside against the injustice of the pressures put on mothers but not on fathers. It\u2019s calculated, articulate, cathartic \u2013 and valid. Charlie\u2019s redeeming features How long have you got? He\u2019s a self-made genius. A wonderful boss; if anything too diligent and kind. A fantastic father: creative, loving, devoted. He moves 3,000 miles, away from everything else he loves, to be with his son. He\u2019s an adorable son- and brother-in-law. All his flaws are forgivable and his errors of judgment relatable \u2013 who hasn\u2019t struggled with a rental-car child seat? Sometimes they\u2019re even aspirational: sure, he cheated, but only once. And, as he says, he stayed faithful in his 20s, when he had ample opportunity and appetite to stray. One of the funniest scenes in the film comes when Charlie and Henry spend the evening under the mirthless gaze of Martha Kelly\u2019s mediator \u2013 and he accidentally slices his arm open. Charlie protests its painlessness through the agony to brilliant comic effect. But have no doubt: this man bleeds. Charlie is the one who says that he hopes every day that his ex is dead, that she gets ill and then hit by a car and then dies. He\u2019s also the one who is embraced and comforted the very next second. Because, even if he does mean it, he\u2019s been hurt. Why it\u2019s your fault for caring Few break-ups are without blame on both sides, and no films are interesting that exist in such polarities. The trend for gunning for one of the couple is a nasty, social-media-fuelled impulse that lowers the audience and insults the art. Plus, the split is a red herring \u2013 right? Baumbach himself has protested that it\u2019s not really about divorce at all. But does that ring false? Could it be a way of deflecting attention from the immensely personal private inspiration for the film? The lawyers Two major career renaissances (for Alan Alda and Ray Liotta) have been de facto launched by Marriage Story, while Laura Dern\u2019s bubbling comeback has gone red hot. Dern has won widespread praise and a small coterie of detractors for her rapacious turn as Nora, the cutthroat broker hired by Nicole. It\u2019s a performance of rare charisma and lethal efficiency \u2013 which makes especially compelling contrast with Dern\u2019s role as Marmie in Little Women, directed by Baumbach\u2019s other half, Greta Gerwig. Did her showstopping turn detract from the human drama for you? How about Alda and Liotta: was the first too cuddly and the latter too bombastic? Or were these turns that reminded you just what gems these actors were to start with? Did the film demonise divorce lawyers? Or are they just doing their \u2013 grisly, necessary \u2013 job? The Sondheim It\u2019s easy to forget there are two full performances of numbers from Company in the film. Nicole belts out a larky You Could Drive a Person Crazy with her mother and sister at a family do, while Driver\u2019s internet-breaking version of Being Alive is easily the musical moment of the cinematic year so far. (We\u2019ve yet to experience Cats.) Did his performance floor you? Or did you find it too protracted and self-advertising? First-world problems The stakes in the film are, in their specificity, extremely high, and taken in relief to most lives, quite low. The main issue is whether Charlie will need to move to Los Angeles to keep up regular contact with his son. When he does so, it\u2019s pretty seamless \u2013 albeit a bit lonely \u2013 and he finds fulfilling work relatively fast. It\u2019s never an option that the pair will reconcile \u2013 Baumbach sets the action almost entirely post-split, and the sadness of the divorce process comes not primarily from the love affair ending but the attendant stresses and strains and the ways in which the process encourages nastiness. Their son seems relatively well adjusted; we know he will be fine. Money isn\u2019t really an issue. Should we still care? And if we do, why?",

      "bodyText": "The children\u2019s favourite Sesame Street on Sunday became the first TV programme to receive Kennedy Center Honors \u2013 and its magic conjured some much needed bipartisan accord in Washington. Performers and producers of the series and their puppets wore single yellow feathers in memory of Caroll Spinney, who brought the popular characters Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch to life. Spinney died on Sunday aged 85. That Sesame Street deserved recognition at America\u2019s most prestigious performing arts awards was one thing that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and members of both parties could be seen applauding. \u201cI love Sesame Street,\u201d Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, told the Guardian. \u201cI was a bit too old for it when it started but my children have spent many hours watching it.\u201d Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, described it as \u201ca wonderful concept\u201d. Singer Linda Ronstadt, actor Sally Field, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and music group Earth, Wind &amp; Fire were this year\u2019s other honorees. There were tributes from stars including John Legend, Steven Spielberg and Cynthia Erivo. Breaking from past presidents, Trump did not attend for the third consecutive year. But the red carpet spotlight was grabbed by Sesame Street\u2019s Big Bird, Bert and Ernie and Abby and Cookie Monster, accompanied by their respective humans. Big Bird later turned up in the stalls and accused actor Tom Hanks of nicking his seat. Sesame Street celebrated its 50th anniversary last month and has chalked up around 4,500 episodes. The idea of honouring it on Sunday night with an accolade no other TV show has achieved originated with Caroline Kennedy, daughter of former president John F Kennedy. Sesame Street\u2019s creators were guided by a mission to give under-served preschoolers an academic equal footing, and the involvement of puppeteer Jim Henson ensured it would be an instant hit. The Kennedy Center audience was told: \u201cFuelled by an unlikely marriage of academic research and creative genius, it seemed as if they alone were teaching kindness, inclusion and how to face the things that hurt.\u201d Along with teaching letters and numbers, the series has dealt with subjects including autism, death and divorce. In 2002 the character Elmo became the first non-human to testify before Congress, appearing before an education appropriations subcommittee to defend funding of music programmes in public schools. Peter Linz, 52, who plays Ernie and Herry Monster and has been on the show for 28 years, told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. It\u2019s a tremendous honour. Ever since I was a small child I wanted to work on Sesame Street and it\u2019s kind of mind blowing to be here now. This is the only thing I\u2019m qualified to do and I\u2019m very, very fortunate that I get to do this.\u201d Eric Jacobson, 48, plays Bert and Grover and took on the role of Oscar the Grouch after Spinney retired last year. Clearly emotional, Jacobson said: \u201cHe loved to tell stories. I could just listen to him for hours and I wound up doing that many times.\u201d During the ceremony, actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave Cookie Monster his favourite food and told how his childhood love of Sesame Street is shared by his own kids. \u201cHealthy habits, social emotional skills that foster mutual respect and kindness and acceptance of others \u2013 something we could all probably use a little more of, especially these days.\u201d It was one of several comments during the evening that subtly touched on Washington\u2019s political rancour, though Trump was never mentioned by name. When David Rubenstein, chairman of the Kennedy Center, recognised the presence of cabinet members Chao, DeVos, Alex Azar, Steven Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross, there was polite applause. When he then named Pelosi, currently masterminding an impeachment inquiry against Trump, there was a roar of enthusiasm and a prolonged standing ovation, during which Pompeo remained riveted to his seat. John Roberts, the chief justice, leaned over and said something to the secretary of state, who wore a fixed smile. Pompeo may also have been smarting from a ceremony at the state department the previous night when he reportedly invoked one of Ronstadt\u2019s songs, quipping, \u201cAs I travel the world, I wonder when will I be loved,\u201d only for the singer to respond, \u201cIt\u2019s when he stops enabling Donald Trump\u201d. This was the 42nd annual Kennedy Center Honors \u2013 there have been 222 honorees \u2013 and only three times prior to Trump has the president been absent from Washington\u2019s big night out. Rita Wilson, an actor and singer/ songwriter married to Hanks, told red carpet reporters: \u201cI think they\u2019d have to be prepared for people saying things that they may not want to hear. I mean, artists tell the truth. So if you\u2019ve got a differing opinion, you might say something that may not be the most flattering thing.\u201d Hanks, attending to honour Field, his co-star in Forrest Gump, added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been here under Republican presidents and Democratic presidents and\u2026 there was no issue. We were celebrating literally the arts in America. I think it\u2019s unfortunate that the circumstances are that somehow people don\u2019t want to do that on a night like this in our nation\u2019s capital.\u201d Deborah Rutter, the president of the Kennedy Center, said: \u201cOf course it\u2019s important for us to have that kind of recognition and I\u2019m very proud that the Kennedy Centre has a really good relationship with the White House.

Wang\u2019s The Farewell, meanwhile, will compete against frontrunner Parasite for the best foreign language film prize, while Awkwafina battles some unexpected foes \u2013 Late Night\u2019s Emma Thompson, Knives Out\u2019s Ana De Armas, Booksmart\u2019s Beanie Feldstein and Cate Blanchett for Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette \u2013 for best actress in a comedy or musical. A number of films not yet released feature on the list, including Sam Mendes\u2019s first world war drama 1917, which has three nominations; sexual assault drama Bombshell, which has best actress in a drama and best supporting actress nods for Charlize Theron and Margot Robbie respectively; and Cats, for the new song Beautiful Ghosts \u2013 a collaboration between Taylor Swift and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Cats has not yet been screened for critics; its lack of inclusion other than for best original song does not bode well for reviews. Bombshell co-star Nicole Kidman did not pick up a nomination for her portrayal of Gretchen Carlson \u2013 although her work on Big Little Lies means she will compete with Colman, Comer and The Morning Show\u2019s Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon for best actress in a TV drama. The nominations for the 77th awards were announced in Los Angeles by Dakota Fanning, Susan Kelechi Watson and Tim Allen alongside this year\u2019s Golden Globe ambassadors Dylan and Paris Brosnan (children of Pierce). Unlike the Oscars or Baftas, the Golden Globes are voted for by a small \u2013 and fairly secretive \u2013 group of international journalists working in the entertainment sphere and living in Los Angeles. The identities of the 90-strong group are not widely known, although one former president, Aida Takla O\u2019Reilly, shot to fame following the publication in Egypt Air\u2019s inflight magazine of a bizarre interview with Drew Barrymore. The interview, which was written by O\u2019Reilly, included unfortunate phrasings and quotes that the actor was swift to dismiss as inaccurate. This year\u2019s ceremony will be held on 5 January 2020, with Ricky Gervais returning as host for a record fifth time. The comedian, who hosted the show between 2010 and 2012 and again in 2016, has again protested this will be his final stand at the podium. Announcing his change of heart last month, Gervais said that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association had \u201cmade me an offer I can\u2019t refuse. But this is the very last time I\u2019m doing this, which could make for a fun evening\u201d. The Academy Awards, which are given out a month later, are expected to proceed without a host, following a warm reception for the ceremony in February, when a succession of guest presenters led proceedings. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 December 2019. An earlier version incorrectly described the Irish actor Andrew Scott as British.",

      "body": "<p>Sergej Milinkovic-Savic needed only one glance to know it was time to start running. Few of the 60,000 fans in attendance at the Stadio Olimpico could have guessed what was about to happen as the Serbian, moving without the ball in the middle of the Juventus half, began to accelerate towards the left touchline. Seconds later, he was beside the penalty spot, scoring to give Lazio a 2-1 lead.</p> \n<p>It was a strike that highlighted the breadth of Milinkovic-Savic\u2019s talent. He had judged his movement perfectly, pulling away from Alex Sandro and bending a run into the blind spot behind Matthijs de Ligt at centre-back. Strength and finesse were required to hold off the Dutchman while taming a cross on one boot and burying it with the other.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/european-football-roundup-gladbach-bayern-leipzig-atalanta-verona\">European roundup: Juventus beaten for first time; Gladbach defeat Bayern</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What on earth had inspired him to make such a run? The ball was at midfield when Milinkovic-Savic launched his assault on the penalty box. There were nine Juventus players between it and the goal. None of which seemed as relevant, to his mind, as the fact that it was at Luis Alberto\u2019s feet.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs soon as I see he has the ball, I start making movements to get myself through on goal\u201a\u201d Milinkovic-Savic later explained. \u201cHis passes are always perfect.\u201d</p> \n<p>The numbers support that assertion. This was already Luis Alberto\u2019s 11th assist of the Serie A season \u2013 the most of any player across Europe\u2019s top five leagues \u2013 as well as his second of the game. After Lazio fell behind to a Cristiano Ronaldo strike, the Spaniard helped them to get back level with a precise cross for Luiz Felipe to head home on the cusp of half-time.</p> \n<p>It was a turning point in the game, Lazio finding the confidence that had deserted them during a torrid opening half-hour. Might it also be a turning point in this Serie A season? Lazio went on to win 3-1, ending Juventus\u2019s unbeaten start as well their own run of 16 years without a home league victory against the Bianconeri.</p> \n<p>\u201cI remember that game,\u201d Lazio\u2019s manager, Simone Inzaghi, said afterward, recalling his time at the club as a player. \u201dI was on the bench back then, too!\u201d</p> \n<p>Circumstances favoured his team on Saturday. Rodrigo Bentancur, Juventus\u2019s most impressive midfielder, was forced off with a knee injury after 41 minutes. The match then seemed to be drifting towards a stalemate in the second half before Juan Cuadrado was sent off for clattering into Manuel Lazzari. The Colombian was initially shown a yellow card but the referee, Michael Fabbri, swapped it for a red following a pitchside VAR review.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d27d04dc69900b6fb999011103cf1b418b650bc4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d27d04dc69900b6fb999011103cf1b418b650bc4/158_74_2533_1520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simone Inzaghi issues instructions to his Lazio team during their win against Juventus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simone Inzaghi issues instructions to his Lazio team during their win against Juventus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ettore Ferrari/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Juventus have won plenty of games with 10 men on their way to eight consecutive Serie A titles. Lazio showed courage in going for the jugular. Milinkovic-Savic\u2019s goal gave them a 74th-minute lead but, even then, Inzaghi\u2019s team refused to sit back. They earned a penalty moments later, when another lightning counter ended with Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny tripping Joaqu\u00edn Correa.</p> \n<p>The goalkeeper could count himself fortunate not to follow Cuadrado into the tunnel. Instead, he wound up saving Ciro Immobile\u2019s penalty and follow-up attempt. He did his best to thwart Lazio again in the 94th minute, parrying away Lazzari\u2019s shot at the end of a three-on-two counter, only for Felipe Caicedo to force home the rebound.</p> \n<p>Defeat cost Juventus a chance to return to the top of the table, after Internazionale drew 0-0 with Roma on Friday night. But might it also have allowed a third horse to enter Serie A\u2019s title race? Lazio now sit just five points off first place, and only three behind the reigning champions.</p> \n<p>Milinkovic-Savic had sought to dampen any such talk before kick-off, insisting that his team were only chasing a spot in the top four. Maurizio Sarri disagrees. \u201cLazio are strong, more technical that physical,\u201d the Juventus manager said. \u201cThey will fight us and Inter for the Scudetto.\u201d</p> \n<p>To do so, they will require more days such as this one from Luis Alberto. Three further assists would match the personal record he set with Lazio in 2017-18. Back then much credit was given to his mental coach, Juan Carlos Campillo, who was said to have helped with techniques to keep his focus sharp for 90 minutes even on those occasions when the ball refused to come his way.</p> \n<p>The player\u2019s form dipped again last season, however. Asked in October, during an interview with the Spanish newspaper Marca, about Campillo\u2019s role Luis Alberto suggested that his latest revival might have more to do with the physical side of the game. He added more muscle to his frame in the summer and \u201clearned that you have to take better care of yourself\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/09/gladbach-dare-to-believe-after-stirring-win-over-bayern-in-the-real-klassiker\">Gladbach dare to believe after stirring win over Bayern in the 'real Klassiker'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Then again, perhaps this latest uptick has more to do with the team around him. Luis Alberto was not the only Lazio player to disappoint last season, Immobile dropping from 29 league goals to 15 and Milinkovic-Savic struggling so badly during the first half of the campaign that claims from the owner, Claudio Lotito, of having turned down a \u20ac100m bid started to sound like the boasts of a man who set fire to a winning lottery ticket.</p> \n<p>As they struggled, Inzaghi was obliged to get more from other members of his squad \u2013 Correa and Caicedo in particular. This season, with established players returning to form, and the signing of Lazzari filling a creative gap on the right of the formation, the team suddenly have a wealth of attacking riches to call on.</p> \n<p>They still look best, though, when Luis Alberto is pulling the strings. Milinkovic-Savic made it all sound so simple when he explained his decision to make the run as soon as he saw the Spaniard on the ball, yet even he could not hide his glee at the fact that the move paid off. \u201cI might have to go back and watch that goal again,\u201d he said. \u201cJust two or three times.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cd94973a-14ec-4a95-84cf-b151ba0acf2b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Internationale 0 Roma 0</p>\n    <p>Lazio 3 Juventus 1</p>\n    <p>Udinese 1 Napoli 1</p>\n    <p>Atalanta 3 Verona 2</p>\n    <p>Bologna 2 Milan 3</p>\n    <p>Sampdoria 0 Parma 1</p>\n    <p>SPAL 0 Brescia 1</p>\n    <p>Sassuolo 2 Cagliari 2</p>\n    <p>Torino 2 Fiorentina 1</p>\n    <p>Lecce 2 Genoa 2</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking point</h2> \n<p>\u2022 The biggest of the weekend was, regrettably, Corriere dello Sport\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/05/corriere-dello-sport-condemned-for-black-friday-front-page-with-lukaku-and-smalling\">horrifically ill-judged front page on Thursday</a>. It drew rebukes from both players featured on it \u2013 Romelu Lukaku and Chris Smalling \u2013 and prompted Roma and Milan to ban the newspaper from their training facilities until the end of 2019, yet the paper responded by doubling down with editorials on Friday and Saturday that attacked its critics and painted them as poisonous people wilfully warping the discourse.</p> \n<p>The sad part is that the headline almost certainly wasn\u2019t intended to offend, and the attached article highlighted, as a positive, how the two players had faced down racism. But in his rush to launch a counter-offensive, Corriere\u2019s editor, Ivan Zazzaroni, never stopped to try to listen to why many people \u2013 including, critically, the players themselves \u2013 found the headline problematic.</p> \n<p>There are cultural and generational differences at play here that influence the protagonists\u2019 outlook profoundly. This could have been an opportunity to try to understand one another better, but it\u2019s hard to do that when your only response to being told you might have made a mistake is to point a finger back and shout even louder.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/635\"> \n <table data-embed-type=\"table\"

      "bodyText": "Sergej Milinkovic-Savic needed only one glance to know it was time to start running. Few of the 60,000 fans in attendance at the Stadio Olimpico could have guessed what was about to happen as the Serbian, moving without the ball in the middle of the Juventus half, began to accelerate towards the left touchline. Seconds later, he was beside the penalty spot, scoring to give Lazio a 2-1 lead. It was a strike that highlighted the breadth of Milinkovic-Savic\u2019s talent. He had judged his movement perfectly, pulling away from Alex Sandro and bending a run into the blind spot behind Matthijs de Ligt at centre-back. Strength and finesse were required to hold off the Dutchman while taming a cross on one boot and burying it with the other. What on earth had inspired him to make such a run? The ball was at midfield when Milinkovic-Savic launched his assault on the penalty box. There were nine Juventus players between it and the goal. None of which seemed as relevant, to his mind, as the fact that it was at Luis Alberto\u2019s feet. \u201cAs soon as I see he has the ball, I start making movements to get myself through on goal\u201a\u201d Milinkovic-Savic later explained. \u201cHis passes are always perfect.\u201d The numbers support that assertion. This was already Luis Alberto\u2019s 11th assist of the Serie A season \u2013 the most of any player across Europe\u2019s top five leagues \u2013 as well as his second of the game. After Lazio fell behind to a Cristiano Ronaldo strike, the Spaniard helped them to get back level with a precise cross for Luiz Felipe to head home on the cusp of half-time. It was a turning point in the game, Lazio finding the confidence that had deserted them during a torrid opening half-hour. Might it also be a turning point in this Serie A season? Lazio went on to win 3-1, ending Juventus\u2019s unbeaten start as well their own run of 16 years without a home league victory against the Bianconeri. \u201cI remember that game,\u201d Lazio\u2019s manager, Simone Inzaghi, said afterward, recalling his time at the club as a player. \u201dI was on the bench back then, too!\u201d Circumstances favoured his team on Saturday. Rodrigo Bentancur, Juventus\u2019s most impressive midfielder, was forced off with a knee injury after 41 minutes. The match then seemed to be drifting towards a stalemate in the second half before Juan Cuadrado was sent off for clattering into Manuel Lazzari. The Colombian was initially shown a yellow card but the referee, Michael Fabbri, swapped it for a red following a pitchside VAR review. Juventus have won plenty of games with 10 men on their way to eight consecutive Serie A titles. Lazio showed courage in going for the jugular. Milinkovic-Savic\u2019s goal gave them a 74th-minute lead but, even then, Inzaghi\u2019s team refused to sit back. They earned a penalty moments later, when another lightning counter ended with Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny tripping Joaqu\u00edn Correa. The goalkeeper could count himself fortunate not to follow Cuadrado into the tunnel. Instead, he wound up saving Ciro Immobile\u2019s penalty and follow-up attempt. He did his best to thwart Lazio again in the 94th minute, parrying away Lazzari\u2019s shot at the end of a three-on-two counter, only for Felipe Caicedo to force home the rebound. Defeat cost Juventus a chance to return to the top of the table, after Internazionale drew 0-0 with Roma on Friday night. But might it also have allowed a third horse to enter Serie A\u2019s title race? Lazio now sit just five points off first place, and only three behind the reigning champions. Milinkovic-Savic had sought to dampen any such talk before kick-off, insisting that his team were only chasing a spot in the top four. Maurizio Sarri disagrees. \u201cLazio are strong, more technical that physical,\u201d the Juventus manager said. \u201cThey will fight us and Inter for the Scudetto.\u201d To do so, they will require more days such as this one from Luis Alberto. Three further assists would match the personal record he set with Lazio in 2017-18. Back then much credit was given to his mental coach, Juan Carlos Campillo, who was said to have helped with techniques to keep his focus sharp for 90 minutes even on those occasions when the ball refused to come his way. The player\u2019s form dipped again last season, however. Asked in October, during an interview with the Spanish newspaper Marca, about Campillo\u2019s role Luis Alberto suggested that his latest revival might have more to do with the physical side of the game. He added more muscle to his frame in the summer and \u201clearned that you have to take better care of yourself\u201d. Then again, perhaps this latest uptick has more to do with the team around him. Luis Alberto was not the only Lazio player to disappoint last season, Immobile dropping from 29 league goals to 15 and Milinkovic-Savic struggling so badly during the first half of the campaign that claims from the owner, Claudio Lotito, of having turned down a \u20ac100m bid started to sound like the boasts of a man who set fire to a winning lottery ticket. As they struggled, Inzaghi was obliged to get more from other members of his squad \u2013 Correa and Caicedo in particular. This season, with established players returning to form, and the signing of Lazzari filling a creative gap on the right of the formation, the team suddenly have a wealth of attacking riches to call on. They still look best, though, when Luis Alberto is pulling the strings. Milinkovic-Savic made it all sound so simple when he explained his decision to make the run as soon as he saw the Spaniard on the ball, yet even he could not hide his glee at the fact that the move paid off. \u201cI might have to go back and watch that goal again,\u201d he said. \u201cJust two or three times.\u201d Talking point \u2022 The biggest of the weekend was, regrettably, Corriere dello Sport\u2019s horrifically ill-judged front page on Thursday. It drew rebukes from both players featured on it \u2013 Romelu Lukaku and Chris Smalling \u2013 and prompted Roma and Milan to ban the newspaper from their training facilities until the end of 2019, yet the paper responded by doubling down with editorials on Friday and Saturday that attacked its critics and painted them as poisonous people wilfully warping the discourse. The sad part is that the headline almost certainly wasn\u2019t intended to offend, and the attached article highlighted, as a positive, how the two players had faced down racism. But in his rush to launch a counter-offensive, Corriere\u2019s editor, Ivan Zazzaroni, never stopped to try to listen to why many people \u2013 including, critically, the players themselves \u2013 found the headline problematic. There are cultural and generational differences at play here that influence the protagonists\u2019 outlook profoundly. This could have been an opportunity to try to understand one another better, but it\u2019s hard to do that when your only response to being told you might have made a mistake is to point a finger back and shout even louder.",

It does not have major eruptions, but small blasts of ash, blocks and lava are reasonably common. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause the island is only a couple of kilometres across, however, visitors are close to the vent and under threat even if there is a small explosion. The volcano has been restless for a few weeks, resulting in the raising of the alert level, so that this eruption is not really a surprise.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Dr Jessica Johnson, lecturer in geophysics at the University of East Anglia, said the eruption was \u201cunfortunate but not completely unexpected\u201d, pointing out that \u201clevels of activity ... have been relatively high since September, and even more elevated over the last couple of weeks, with increased numbers of small earthquakes and more volcanic gas detected than usual. As a consequence, the volcanic alert level was raised. Similar eruptions have happened over the last 100 years or so.</p> \n  <p>\u201cEven though the alert level was raised, it is still very difficult to forecast exactly what will happen at volcanoes. White Island/Whakaari is an andesitic stratovolcano, which means that it can have lots of different types of eruptions. It also has a water-filled crater lake. When water reacts with hot rock or magma, it can create explosions, and therefore, can make eruptions even more difficult to forecast.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She said it was difficult to say whether there would be more eruptions.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhite Island/Whakaari is a very beautiful and interesting destination that naturally attracts tourism,\u201d Dr Johnson added. \u201cIt is very difficult to say whether tourism should be allowed there. The volcano has displayed similar unrest in the past with no major eruptions. The most that the scientists can do is continue to monitor the volcano and issue information when it is available.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T12:28:26.200Z\">at 12.28pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee18358f08e7796de8f45c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T09:55:15.704Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is the full statement released by New Zealand police after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/dec/09/new-zealand-volcano-tourists-injured-and-missing-after-eruption-on-white-island-live?page=with:block-5dee01768f08bacaf000caaa#block-5dee01768f08bacaf000caaa\">earlier news briefing</a>.

We know hydrothermal and so-called \u2018phreatic\u2019 eruptions can occur suddenly and with little or no warning because they are driven by the expansion of super-heated water into steam.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe hazards expected from such events are the violent ejection of hot blocks and ash, and formation of \u2018hurricane-like\u2019 currents of wet ash and coarse particles that radiate from the explosion vent. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThese can be deadly in terms of causing impact trauma, burns and respiratory problems.

      "bodyText": "Five people have been confirmed killed, a figure that is expected to rise, after a volcanic eruption on New Zealand\u2019s Whakaari/White Island. Police have said that they believe there are no survivors left on the island after reconnaissance flights showed \u201cno signs of life had been seen at any point\u201d. The military will deploy drones at first light to assess the situation on the ground. As many as 27 people were thought to have been stranded on the island after the eruption. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern arrived in Whakatane, the nearest major town, late on Monday night and met with local council leaders. She is expected to travel to the island on Tuesday. New Zealand police deputy commissioner John Timms told a briefing that police and rescue crews have still not been able to access to the island, after advice from volcano experts. \u201cThe physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island.\u201d. A number of people have been taken to hospital, some with burns as a result of the eruption. Fewer than 50 people were on the island at the time of the eruption, and 23 have been taken off. 30 to 38 of those people were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, as confirmed by the chief executive of the New Zealand Cruise Association. The eruption occurred about 2.11pm local time, 48km off the coast of the Bay of Plenty, in the North Island. Academics have questioned the suitability of White Island, New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano, as a tourist destination, saying it \u201cwas a disaster waiting to happen\u201d. New Zealand Red Cross has activated the Family Links website for those concerned that their loved ones may have been caught up in the incident. We are going to pause our live coverage for now. Thanks for reading. Our latest news wrap is here. Some academics have been questioning the wisdom in allowing White Island to be a tourism destination. Raymond Cas, emeritus professor at Monash University\u2019s school of earth, atmosphere and environment, told the Australian Science Media Centre that he always felt it was too dangerous. \u201cWhite Island has been a disaster waiting to happen for many years. Having visited it twice, I have always felt that it was too dangerous to allow the daily tour groups that visit the uninhabited island volcano by boat and helicopter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a very active geothermal system with many steaming gas vents and varying numbers of hot water filled crater lakes in the floor of an amphitheater-shaped large crater.\u201d Associate professor Derek Wyman, a geoscientist at Sydney University, said he was surprised tourists were allowed so close to the site, given its recent history. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t be recommending tourists be approaching a site that has recently been throwing material up 30 metres into the air,\u201d he told SBS News. The eruption was \u201crelatively minor\u201d, Professor Wyman said. \u201cNew Zealand sees things like this quite frequently. \u201cUsually people don\u2019t die from these kinds of eruptions, but that is likely because they are not usually inappropriately close.\u201d New Zealand police said early on Tuesday morning local time that they did not believe there were any survivors on White Island following Monday\u2019s eruption. Just after midnight, officers said in a statement that after reconnaissance flights over the island, \u201cno signs of life had been seen at any point\u201d. \u201cPolice believe that anyone who could have been taken from the island alive was rescued at the time of the evacuation,\u201d a statement said. \u201cBased on the information we have, we do not believe there are any survivors on the island.\u201d Officers are \u201curgently\u201d working to confirm the exact number of those who have died, in addition to the five already known to be dead. They had earlier said as many as 27 people had been stranded on the island after the eruption. The military will deploy drones at first light to assess the situation. The New Zealand Herald reports that Jacinda Ardern has arrived in Whakat\u0101ne, and that she is currently in a meeting with members of the district council: \u201cThe prime minister is currently in a meeting at the Whakatane District Council. The Crown car is waiting outside with a number of taxis. Waiariki MP Tamati Coffey\u2019s car is also outside, as are police, regional council and St John vehicles.\u201d A post by Twitter user @Maori1 appears to show Ardern arriving there: More information is emerging about the geology that underpins White Island and about the raising of the alert level in recent weeks. Prof Bill McGuire, emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, said it was \u201ca sporadically active volcanic island very similar to Stromboli volcano in the Mediterranean. It does not have major eruptions, but small blasts of ash, blocks and lava are reasonably common. \u201cBecause the island is only a couple of kilometres across, however, visitors are close to the vent and under threat even if there is a small explosion. The volcano has been restless for a few weeks, resulting in the raising of the alert level, so that this eruption is not really a surprise.\u201d Dr Jessica Johnson, lecturer in geophysics at the University of East Anglia, said the eruption was \u201cunfortunate but not completely unexpected\u201d, pointing out that \u201clevels of activity ... have been relatively high since September, and even more elevated over the last couple of weeks, with increased numbers of small earthquakes and more volcanic gas detected than usual. As a consequence, the volcanic alert level was raised. Similar eruptions have happened over the last 100 years or so. \u201cEven though the alert level was raised, it is still very difficult to forecast exactly what will happen at volcanoes. White Island/Whakaari is an andesitic stratovolcano, which means that it can have lots of different types of eruptions. It also has a water-filled crater lake. When water reacts with hot rock or magma, it can create explosions, and therefore, can make eruptions even more difficult to forecast.\u201d She said it was difficult to say whether there would be more eruptions. \u201cWhite Island/Whakaari is a very beautiful and interesting destination that naturally attracts tourism,\u201d Dr Johnson added. \u201cIt is very difficult to say whether tourism should be allowed there. The volcano has displayed similar unrest in the past with no major eruptions. The most that the scientists can do is continue to monitor the volcano and issue information when it is available.\u201d This is the full statement released by New Zealand police after the earlier news briefing. It provides details for the Family Links website which allows family members and friends concerned about loved ones to register an inquiry: Police can confirm five people are now confirmed to have died in the White Island volcanic eruption. Our sincere condolences are with their family and friends. We are continuing to work as quickly as possible, through a number of channels of information, to confirm exact numbers of those involved, including those who remain on the island. A number of people have been injured and taken to Whak\u0101tane hospital and Middlemore hospital [in Auckland]. Both New Zealanders and overseas tourists are believed to be involved. Police are currently taking advice from GeoNet experts, who have advised that due to the current risk environment, emergency services remain unable to access the island. We are reassessing as information and advice is received, however police will not be in a position to access the island tonight. The police 105 number can be used by members of the public to submit information regarding friends or family who might have been visiting White Island during the eruption. People from overseas can call +64 9105 105. People can also use the online form at the police website here. At the request of New Zealand Police, New Zealand Red Cross has activated the Family Links website for people wanting to register themselves as safe or register an inquiry about a loved one. If you are worried about a friend or family member following the White Island eruption, first contact them as you normally would. If you cannot make contact, you can register them through this website. Please note this website does not host an official list of missing persons, and information is submitted by members of the public. A no-fly zone is in place at 5 nautical miles around White Island. Police will continue to provide updates as information becomes available. Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington has written an account of the deadly events on White Island: It was a beautiful, clear day in Whak\u0101tane, a town on the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, the air fresh with the beginning of summer. Suddenly and silently, just after lunch, a massive plume of smoke spewed into the blue sky. Just off the volcanic White Island, or Whakaari, a boatload of tourists who had been standing at the crater just 20 minutes earlier watched in surprise, and then horror. \u201cIt was kind of hard to tell at first, because we\u2019d seen the smoke before, but this was a huge cloud of it,\u201d said Michael Schade, who was visiting the island with his parents. \u201cWe were taking photos and videos and then it dawned on us what had happened.\u201d The full scale of the disaster on New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano is not yet known: five people have been confirmed dead and up to two dozen remain unaccounted for. More deaths are likely, police have said. Passengers on the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship have been told they are not allowed to leave the vessel, and it will remain in dock in Tauranga until further notice. Sylvain Plasse, a Canadian tourist on board, said he had seen the volcano erupt from land and thought he had been lucky to glimpse such a rare sight. But when he returned to the ship and heard that passengers and crew members were missing, \u201cjoy and excitement turned into horror\u201d, he said. \u201cThe mood became sombre on the ship,\u201d said Plasse. \u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to carry on and have a great time but it\u2019s in the back of your mind, it hits your stomach.\u201d Five people have been confirmed killed, a figure that is expected to rise, after a volcanic eruption on New Zealand\u2019s Whakaari/White Island. A double-digit number of people remain on the island, according to deputy commissioner John Timms of New Zealand police, although the exact number remains unknown. Tims told a briefing that police and rescue crews have still not been able to access the island, after advice from volcano experts. \u201cThe physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island.\u201d A number of people have been taken to hospital, some with burns as a result of the eruption. Photographs in the aftermath of the eruption appear to show a wrecked helicopter on the island. Fewer than 50 people were on the island at the time of the eruption, and 23 have been taken off. 30 to 38 of those people were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, as confirmed by the chief executive of the New Zealand Cruise Association. The eruption occurred about 2:11pm local time, 48km off the coast of the Bay of Plenty, in the North Island. Whakaari / White Island is New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano, and is a popular tourist destination and scientific research site. It last experienced a short-lived eruption in 2016. Tims also confirms that \u201ca number\u201d of those on the island were from the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship, but would not confirm their nationalities. Earlier, Guardian Australia confirmed there were 30-38 people from Ovation of the Seas on the island. Guardian Australia also confirmed there were more than 20 Australians. But it is unknown how many were also cruise ship patrons. Now to questions. Deputy commissioner Tims is asked if \u201cat least a double digit number of people remain on the island.\u201d He confirms this but cannot be more specific on numbers. When asked how far police are from the island, Tims says \u201cwe are on the shore\u201d. New Zealand police have just confirmed there are five people who have died. Deputy commissioner John Tims says that police and rescue have still not been able to access to island, after advice from volcano experts. This means police are still unsure how many people remain on the island. \u201cThe physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island,\u201d he says \u201cA number of other people have been taken to hospital. A number of people have burns as a result of the eruption. It is still too early for police to confirm how many people are involved...including how many are still on the island.\u201d There will be another briefing from NZ authorities in 15 minutes. More than 20 Australians were on Whakaari/White Island, as part of a tour group, when it erupted, Guardian Australia can confirm. Their condition is unknown, and it is unclear how many were rescued, and how many remain on the island currently. New Zealand Police said fewer than 50 people, in total, were on the island when it erupted. 23 have since been taken to shore. But it is currently too dangerous for police and rescue to visit the island, and up to 27 people remain. Prime minister Scott Morrison also earlier confirmed that \u201cAustralians have been caught up in this terrible event\u201d. Our updated news story is here: Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has offered emergency support to New Zealand and Jacinda Ardern. He also confirms Australians have been \u201ccaught up in\u201d the eruption. \u201cA terrible tragedy is unfolding in NZ after the volcano eruption on Whakaari/White Island,\u201d he says. \u201cAustralians have been caught up in this terrible event and we are working to determine their wellbeing. \u201cI have been in touch with Jacinda Ardern to offer our full support with whatever they need and our authorities are working closely together. I will be staying in direct contact as events continue to unfold.\u201d The damaged helicopter shown in footage of White Island belongs to Volcanic Air, a tour company based in Rotorua. The pilot and four passengers were unharmed and returned to the mainland via boat on Monday afternoon, a company spokesman said. \u201cVolcanic Air has confirmed it had a helicopter on Whakaari/White Island at the time it erupted this afternoon,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cFive people had flown to the island in the helicopter, but all are accounted for and have arrived back in Whakatane by boat. The company has enacted its emergency response plan and says its priority was looking after the pilot and passengers.\u201d Volcanic Air has been running charter tours to White Island since 1992. Ross Dawson is a director of Adventure Helicopters in Tauranga. One of his pilots flew over the western end of the island with a convoy of media on board soon after the eruption. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t see much from the air apart from a lot of steam and volcanic ash,\u201d Dawson told The Guardian. The pilot\u2019s summary was that it was \u201cnot good.\u201d Aviation authorities have since implemented a 26 nautical mile no fly zone around the island to help rescue crews. White Island is 22 nautical miles offshore. The island last erupted in 2016, according to the New Zealand science agency GeoNet, in a \u201cshort-lived\u201d burst that happened in the evening and did not injure anyone. Explosive eruptions, followed by bursts of ash, happened in 2012 and 2013. In its longest episode, White Island erupted from December 1975 to September 2000. A sulphur mining venture began on the island in 1885, according to GeoNet, but this was stopped abruptly in 1914 when a landslide destroyed the sulphur mine and miners\u2019 village. 12 people died. Now, a visit to the miners\u2019 buildings are part of a daily tour on the island, to the island, which is a popular attraction in a sunny, beachfront region attracts tourists, especially in the summer. 10,000 tourists a year visit the island, which is a popular tourist attraction in a region famed for its beaches and sunlight hours. Professor Richard Arculus, a volcanologist from the Australian National University, says White Island had been \u201cshowing signs of unrest for the past few weeks\u201d. \u201cThe eruption this afternoon was a short-lived explosive event. In addition to gases, fragmented rock particles (ash) rose ~4000m above the vent\u201d. Some more photos from the scene \u2013 showing tour operators rescuing people roughly 15 minutes after the eruption. One person has been killed, and that figure is expected to rise, after a volcanic eruption on New Zealand\u2019s Whakaari / White Island. Up to 27 people are still unaccounted for and the island is too dangerous for police and rescue to access. Police deputy commissioner John Tims said there \u201care likely to be more\u201d casualties. Fewer than 50 people were on the island at the time of the eruption, and 23 have been taken off. 30 to 38 of those people were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, as confirmed by the CEO of the New Zealand Cruise Association. Seven people, of the 23 taken off the island, are critically injured. The eruption occurred about 2:11pm local time, 48km off the coast of the Bay of Plenty, on the north island. Whakaari / White Island is New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano, and is a popular tourist destination and scientific research site. It last experienced a short-lived eruption in 2016. Owner of Ovation of the Seas, Royal Caribbean, has said the ship will stay in port overnight. \u201cWe can confirm that a number of our guests were touring the island today,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe do not have any additional details to share at this time. \u201cOvation of the Seas will remain overnight until we learn more about the situation. We will offer all possible assistance to our guests and local authorities. Please keep all those affected in your prayers.\u201d A still from one of the videos of the island shows a helicopter after the eruption. Former prime minister Helen Clark has shared her condolences. Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs says it is making \u201curgent enquiries\u201d to find out if any Australians were affected by the eruption. However, it does not have any information to share at present. Breaking from Eleanor Ainge Roy: Kevin O\u2019Sullivan, the chief executive officer of the New Zealand Cruise Association confirmed that a tour party of 30 to 38 people from cruise ship Ovation of the Seas were on a tour of White Island today, and had not returned. He said the passengers names and nationalities were now being handed to police, and the Ovation of the Seas would stay docked in Tauranga at least overnight. \u201cI know the cruise ship will be able to compile a list of the tour party and they will be handing that to New Zealand police, and the police will then make a statement on the nationalities,\u201d he said. \u201cOur hope of course is they will be recovered unharmed and returned back to the ship.\u201d Earlier, the operations director for St John Ambulance told Radio NZ that seven people \u2013 out of those taken off the island \u2013 were critically injured. Norma Lane confirmed the figures to the Checkpoint program. In that press conference, deputy commissioner Tims said that some of the tourists on the island were from cruise ship Ovation of the Seas. \u201cFrom my understanding, some of the tourists are from a cruise ship so we should have a list of people that left the cruise ship and potentially are on the island. There are ways for us to have that list confirmed.\u201d He was then asked if all the people on the island were from the cruise ship. He says: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe so\u201d. Last question to Ardern and the police. A reporter asks if \u201c27 people could be dead\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a full clarity at this point,\u201d Ardern says. \u201cYou understand why we are loath to get into speculation\u201d. Dr Ken Gledhill from GNS Science is now speaking about the eruption. \u201cIt was not a particularly big eruption,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was almost like a throat-clearing eruption.\u201d He says it is unlikely, but possible, there could be secondary eruptions. \u201cIt showed increased activity for the lsat few weeks, so we raised the alert level. But it looks like mostly, there will be an eruption like this, then a moment of quiescence. \u201cBut we can\u2019t be certain there wont be another eruption in the next 24 hours.\u201d \u2022 This segment was amended on 11 December 2019 to correct the last name of Ken Gledhill, from Glairdhill as an earlier version misspelled it. Tims says it is still too dangerous for police and rescue services to go onto the island \u2013 so they are still unclear how many people remain on the island. 23 people have been taken from the island. There were fewer than 50 people on the island at the time of the eruption. \u201cSome of these people have been transported to shore, however there is a number still remaining on the island who are currently unaccounted for,\u201d Tims said. \u201cWe are working to confirm the numbers involved. At this stage, it is too dangerous for police and rescue services to go to the island. However, we continue to assess the conditions which would allow us togo onto the island. \u201cThe island is currently covered in ash and volcanic material. We are taking expert advice with regards to the safety of any rescue attempt.\u201d Police Deputy Commissioner John Tims has confirmed that one person has died. \u201cAnd based on information we have, there are likely to be more,\u201d he adds. Sarah Stewart-Black, the director of Civil Defence Emergency Management, is speaking now. \u201cWe do not expect this event you have any significant impact for the people on the north island at this time. If the situation changes we will communicate this. \u201cAshfall appears to be confined to the island and they do not expect more than a minor amount of ash to reach East Cape in the coming hours.\u201d Ardern will travel to the island tonight. \u201cIt continues to be an evolving situation. We know there were a number of tourists on or around the island at the time. \u201cThe Ministry of foreign affairs have also stood up their systems to assist with any response required for those further afield.\u201d Jacinda Ardern is speaking now. Tourist Allessandro Kauffmann, who posted one of the first videos of the eruption, says he saw people with \u201cserious burns\u201d. In a tearful Instagram video, Kauffman said he saw people with \u201cextensive burns on their bodies.\u201d \u201cThere were two tours on the volcano,\u201d he said, as translated from Portuguese by the NZ Herald. \u201cOurs was the first. The other one right after. We left the island and wasn\u2019t even five minutes before it erupted. This other tour that arrived after couldn\u2019t leave in time. \u201cSome people have serious burns. We had to stay to help those people who were on the island. The boat from this other tour was covered in ash from the volcano. Very tense talking about this. We just have to hope that all is as well as can be.\u201d According to Te Ara, the enycyclopedia of New Zealand, Whakaari lies at the northern end of the North Island\u2019s \u2018line of fire\u2019 \u2013 a large volcanic plateau which stretches from the Bay of Plenty on the coast, to Mt Ruapehu inland. The line of fire forms part of the wider \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 around the Pacific ocean. From the Encyclopedia of New Zealand: \u201cUnpredictable and fascinating, the Volcanic Plateau is New Zealand\u2019s main area of volcanic activity. In this zone, the Pacific tectonic plate is sinking beneath the Australian Plate. At a certain depth its rocks heat and produce volcanic activity, which erupts at the surface in minor ways (steam vents, mud pools and hot springs), and major ways (volcanic eruptions, collapsing mountains and lake formation).\u201d TVNZ report that one of the rescue helicopters is now tasked \u201cjust with taking blood from Auckland Hospital to Whak\u0101tane hospital\u201d. There will be a police and emergency press conference in half an hour. Some more footage from a tourist on a boat near White Island today Professor Shane Cronin, a volcanologist at the University of Auckland, says that the kind of eruption we saw today can commonly occur with no warning. \u201cSudden, unheralded eruptions from volcanoes such as White Island can be expected at any time,\u201d he said. \u201cMagma is close to the surface, and the heat and gases from this heat the surface and ground waters to form vigorous hydrothermal systems. We know hydrothermal and so-called \u2018phreatic\u2019 eruptions can occur suddenly and with little or no warning because they are driven by the expansion of super-heated water into steam. \u201cThe hazards expected from such events are the violent ejection of hot blocks and ash, and formation of \u2018hurricane-like\u2019 currents of wet ash and coarse particles that radiate from the explosion vent. \u201cThese can be deadly in terms of causing impact trauma, burns and respiratory problems. The eruptions are short-lived, but once one occurs, there are high chances for further, generally smaller ones as the system re-equilibrates.\u201d Video purporting to be from today\u2019s eruption has been uploaded to Instagram by a tourist on a cruise boat. It was originally posted to Instagram, 50 minutes ago, and has now been shared by a variety of other accounts. The Guardian has not yet independently verified the video. Images from Whakat\u0101ne, where ambulances are taking injured people to hospital. The NZ Department of Conservation has confirmed to the NZ Herald that there were no staff on the island today. New Zealand police have just issued a revised figure for the number of people on or near White Island. That number is now fewer than 50. However, a number of people are still unaccounted for, and of those taken to shore, at least one is \u201ccritically injured\u201d. \u201cWhile it was initially believed there were approximately 100 people on or near the island at the time of the eruption, we now believe there were fewer than 50,\u201d police say. \u201cSome of those people have been transported to shore, however a number believed to be on the island are currently unaccounted for. Of those transported to shore, at least one has been critically injured.\u201d Geonet have provided their latest update. Volcanic activity has calmed down, meaning that only \u201ca minor amount\u201d of ash will reach coastal towns and cities. \u201cOur monitoring data shows that there was a short-lived eruption that generated an ash plume to ~12,000ft above the vent,\u201d the science agency has said. \u201cAsh fall appears to be confined to the island and we do not expect more than a minor amount of ash to reach East Cape in the coming hours. \u201cWe have seen a steady decline in activity since the eruption. There remains significant uncertainty as to future changes but currently, there are no signs of escalation.\u201d Seven helicopters have been dispatched to the island by St John Ambulance. A national warning has been issued for the eruption. New Zealand Police are advising people that volcanic ash could pose a major health hazard. Roads have been closed in the town of Whakat\u0101ne, which is the closest to White Island, and the Whakat\u0101ne hospital has been turned into an emergency operation centre. \u201cEffects of a volcanic eruption can be experienced many kilometres from a volcano,\u201d say NZ Police. \u201cBe aware of the potential for ashfall. Consider staying indoors. Volcanic ash could be a health hazard, especially if you suffer from breathing difficulties. When indoors, close all windows and doors to limit the entry of volcanic ash. \u201cIf caught in volcanic ashfalls: Wear a dust mask or use a cloth handkerchief over your nose and mouth; protect your eyes by wearing goggles. Wear eyeglasses, not contact lenses as fine ash will get under the lens.\u201d Whakaari/White Island is New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano. It is a popular tourist and scientific research site. According to the science agency GeoNet, today\u2019s eruption was a level four, signifying a \u201cmoderate\u201d volcanic eruption. The scale runs from zero to five. Our most recent full story is live here: Prime minister Jacinda Ardern addressed media earlier, and confirmed that there were 100 people near the island. \u201cPolice were alerted at 2.17pm,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cAt this stage, and please do keep in mind this is an evolving situation, we believe around 100 people were on or around the island at the time and some of those are at this stage unaccounted for. \u201cI want to share this is evolving at this stage, at this stage it does appear to be a very significant issue, particularly the scale of those affected.\u201d Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Whakaari/White Island volcano eruption. There are roughly 100 people potentially affected by the eruption, and an emergency rescue operation is under way. St John Ambulance has told Guardian Australia there are up to 20 people injured. There are still other people currently unaccounted for. The eruption occured at 2.10pm local time \u2013 an hour and a half ago The volcano is 48 km off the Bay of Plenty, on the north island\u2019s east coast.",

Frances-White said she could not think of another woman being asked to work on a Bond script.</p> <p>\u201cI think the very first Bond film there was, but not since,\u201d Waller-Bridge said. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t really come into the conversation. That\u2019s only really the press that have made that thing, in terms of me being a woman, you can see it is a button-pressing thing.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality was I got a call from Barbara [Broccoli, the film\u2019s producer] and Daniel saying, \u2018We like your work, can you come in and help us?\u2019. There wasn\u2019t ever really a conversation about can you come in and help us with \u2018the ladies\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThey are proper, amazing producers and writers and actors and suddenly they are reduced to those people?</p> <p> \u201cThey said, \u2018It will be your take, can you come aboard and help us polish the script?\u2019 The characters were there, the story was there, it was just really exciting to be a part of it. There was a bunch of writers, I was a small contribution to this thing.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if audiences would recognise the lines she wrote, she said: \u201cI have no idea. I left long before it had finished filming and they are rewriting all the time, so \u2026 I hope so.\u201d</p> <p>Before Waller-Bridge, the only woman with a Bond writing credit was Johanna Harwood on Dr No (1962) and From Russia With Love (1963).</p> <p>Waller-Bridge was speaking at an event celebrating the publication of Fleabag: The Scriptures, and much of the conversation dug deep into this year\u2019s rapturously received second and final season of the BBC show.</p> <p>It will be remembered by many for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/16/andrew-scott-fleabag-sexy-priest-uncharted-territory\">\u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/16/andrew-scott-fleabag-sexy-priest-uncharted-territory\">hot priest</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/16/andrew-scott-fleabag-sexy-priest-uncharted-territory\">\u201d character played by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/16/andrew-scott-fleabag-sexy-priest-uncharted-territory\">Andrew Scott</a>. Waller-Bridge revealed that she spent a long time talking to a real priest, a monk called Fr William, as she prepared to write the series.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a huge part of the process,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to talk to a priest who would talk to me openly and with candour about celibacy and about what happens when you\u2019re tempted, what goes through your head as well as the choices that you make.</p> <p>\u201cFather William was just an open-hearted, brilliant, brilliant man who had found faith later on in his life, who spoke about it openly and was incredibly inspiring and really gave me a new perspective on why people reach for certain things in their lives. He was just so open. We had long Skype sessions.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her fame as a result of Fleabag, Waller-Bridge could still travel on the tube, she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really care that much. On the tube people don\u2019t really look at other people and even if they do they don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately, Fleabag fans \u201care the most polite fans\u201d. She did not get the \u201cyou\u2019re mine!\u201d experience. Instead \u201cI always have \u2018sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, so sorry, so sorry \u2026 I don\u2019t want anything, I just want to say \u2026 goodbye, thank you.\u201d</p>",

Frances-White said she could not think of another woman being asked to work on a Bond script. \u201cI think the very first Bond film there was, but not since,\u201d Waller-Bridge said. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t really come into the conversation. That\u2019s only really the press that have made that thing, in terms of me being a woman, you can see it is a button-pressing thing. \u201cThe reality was I got a call from Barbara [Broccoli, the film\u2019s producer] and Daniel saying, \u2018We like your work, can you come in and help us?\u2019. There wasn\u2019t ever really a conversation about can you come in and help us with \u2018the ladies\u2019. \u201cThey are proper, amazing producers and writers and actors and suddenly they are reduced to those people? \u201cThey said, \u2018It will be your take, can you come aboard and help us polish the script?\u2019 The characters were there, the story was there, it was just really exciting to be a part of it. There was a bunch of writers, I was a small contribution to this thing.\u201d Asked if audiences would recognise the lines she wrote, she said: \u201cI have no idea. I left long before it had finished filming and they are rewriting all the time, so \u2026 I hope so.\u201d Before Waller-Bridge, the only woman with a Bond writing credit was Johanna Harwood on Dr No (1962) and From Russia With Love (1963). Waller-Bridge was speaking at an event celebrating the publication of Fleabag: The Scriptures, and much of the conversation dug deep into this year\u2019s rapturously received second and final season of the BBC show. It will be remembered by many for the \u201chot priest\u201d character played by Andrew Scott. Waller-Bridge revealed that she spent a long time talking to a real priest, a monk called Fr William, as she prepared to write the series. \u201cHe was a huge part of the process,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to talk to a priest who would talk to me openly and with candour about celibacy and about what happens when you\u2019re tempted, what goes through your head as well as the choices that you make. \u201cFather William was just an open-hearted, brilliant, brilliant man who had found faith later on in his life, who spoke about it openly and was incredibly inspiring and really gave me a new perspective on why people reach for certain things in their lives. He was just so open. We had long Skype sessions.\u201d Despite her fame as a result of Fleabag, Waller-Bridge could still travel on the tube, she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really care that much. On the tube people don\u2019t really look at other people and even if they do they don\u2019t care.\u201d Fortunately, Fleabag fans \u201care the most polite fans\u201d. She did not get the \u201cyou\u2019re mine!\u201d experience. Instead \u201cI always have \u2018sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, so sorry, so sorry \u2026 I don\u2019t want anything, I just want to say \u2026 goodbye, thank you.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There is every chance that a new government will be in place before racing finally draws a line under the chaotic scenes at the end of the Sandown card on Saturday, when seven jockeys were banned for 10 days each for continuing to the finish despite a yellow \u201cstop racing\u201d flag being waved on the approach to the third last. Their route took them past the screens erected around the stricken Houblon Des Obeaux, who had collapsed after suffering a heart attack on the first circuit, prompting the decision to abandon the race.</p> \n<p>The Professional Jockeys\u2019 Association said on Sunday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/08/jockeys-appeal-against-ban-stop-flag-sandown-bha\">all seven jockeys will lodge appeals against their bans</a>, which would rule them out of the busy Christmas season when demand for riders is at its peak. Two \u2013 Harry Skelton and Adam Wedge - are in the top 10 in the title race, while Daryl Jacob and Jamie Moore would also expect to take high-profile rides on the festive programme. With so many cases to organise, though, it seems unlikely that the appeals will be heard this week, which will leave trainers and owners in limbo too as they plan for Boxing day and beyond.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/07/defi-du-seuil-beats-un-de-sceaux-win-tingle-creek\">Defi Du Seuil raises roof before last race fiasco results in multiple bans</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This is unfortunate, to say the least, and comes on top of the 35-minute delay before the race was officially declared void on Saturday, by which time many of the punters who were due a refund on their bets in the London National had set off for home.</p> \n<p>Taken as a whole, the entire episode generated a great deal of comment, from professionals and fans on social media alike. It ends up looking like one big mess, but there are two strands here which need to be treated separately.</p> \n<p>The easy one is the 35-minute delay in letting the punters know the race had been declared void. It was embarrassing and needless, since the decision had been taken while the remaining runners were halfway down the back. The yellow flag was just the signal to tell the jockeys the race was already over, and whether or not they obeyed it was irrelevant. There was no need to wait until after the inevitable inquiry to announce it, and the British Horseracing Authority has already suggested this is likely to change in future.</p> \n<p>When it comes to the seven jockeys who failed to stop, however, the situation is more complicated and the flag-waving approach to stopping a race has already come under scrutiny.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"228b3e21-cc10-4474-9950-b07b3d066ec4\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Fontwell</b> <b>12.30</b> Two Sams <b>1.00</b> Christmas In April <b>1.30</b> Gelboe De Chanay <b>2.00</b> Quarenta (nb) <b>2.30</b> Mystic Dreamer <b>3.00</b> Gold Mountain <b>3.30</b> Lochinver</p>\n    <p><b>Uttoxeter</b> <b>12.40</b> Poucor <b>1.10</b> Vereina <b>1.40</b> Bullionaire <b>2.10</b> With Discretion <b>2.40</b> Passam <b>3.10</b> Freddie Darling</p>\n    <p><b>Wolverhampton</b> <b>3.45</b> Goddess Of Fire <b>4.15</b> Millicent Fawcett <b>4.45</b> Augustus Caesar <b>5.15</b> Diamonique (nap) <b>5.45</b> Disruptor <b>6.15</b> Boy In The Bar <b>6.45</b> Grey Mist <b>7.15</b> Sir Hector</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Dan Skelton, for instance, suggested the existing method is out of date. \u201cIf that is what racing thinks is good enough to stop a race in 2019, then they are wrong,\u201d Skelton said. \u201cThey all know what the yellow flag means. To ignore it is an absolute ban. Why would they ignore it? Those jockeys have said they didn\u2019t see [the flag], it wasn\u2019t clear. It was completely inadequate for the situation to have one flag.\u201d</p> \n<p>Neil Mulholland, whose runner Doing Fine was first past the post, weighed in too. \u201cThe race was not stopped at the right time and it should have been stopped sooner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not good enough in this day and age as this is a multimillion-pound sport. Surely everyone in the sport deserves something more than a man with just a flag standing on an S-shaped bend?\u201d</p> \n<p>These arguments and more will be played out \u2013 as grounds for mitigation, at least \u2013 at the appeal hearing. As the rules stand, however, the basic question which the panel will consider is relatively straightforward: did some or all of the riders fail to see the flag, or did they see it and decide to ignore it?</p> \n<p>What no one should forget is that, chaotic though the scenes at Sandown were, it could potentially have been much worse. Houblon Des Obeaux collapsed in the middle of the racing line. There could easily have been vets or ground staff working to save him who would have been put at risk of serious injury themselves. Anyone who thinks a 35-minute delay in an announcement is a bad look for racing should consider what how one or more people getting flattened by seven galloping steeplechasers while attending to another would come across on the evening news.</p> \n<p>As Mick Fitzgerald reminded ITV viewers before the \u201cwinner\u201d had even returned to be unsaddled, every jockey attends a mandatory safety briefing once a year as a condition of receiving a licence. If it is not item one on the agenda, a reminder that \u201cyellow means stop\u201d must be pretty close to the top.</p> \n<p>Yellow flag, stop racing. It\u2019s that simple. Don\u2019t think about why and don\u2019t talk it over with the jockey next to you. Yellow means the race is already over. There won\u2019t be any \u201cshall we let it stand?\u201d in the steward\u2019s room. See yellow, stop racing \u2013 not least because if a head-down colleague <em>hasn\u2019t</em> seen it, they are then more likely to get the message.</p> \n<p>And it is as clear as day on the ITV footage that at least two of the jockeys on Saturday did see the flag.

      "bodyText": "There is every chance that a new government will be in place before racing finally draws a line under the chaotic scenes at the end of the Sandown card on Saturday, when seven jockeys were banned for 10 days each for continuing to the finish despite a yellow \u201cstop racing\u201d flag being waved on the approach to the third last. Their route took them past the screens erected around the stricken Houblon Des Obeaux, who had collapsed after suffering a heart attack on the first circuit, prompting the decision to abandon the race. The Professional Jockeys\u2019 Association said on Sunday that all seven jockeys will lodge appeals against their bans, which would rule them out of the busy Christmas season when demand for riders is at its peak. Two \u2013 Harry Skelton and Adam Wedge - are in the top 10 in the title race, while Daryl Jacob and Jamie Moore would also expect to take high-profile rides on the festive programme. With so many cases to organise, though, it seems unlikely that the appeals will be heard this week, which will leave trainers and owners in limbo too as they plan for Boxing day and beyond. This is unfortunate, to say the least, and comes on top of the 35-minute delay before the race was officially declared void on Saturday, by which time many of the punters who were due a refund on their bets in the London National had set off for home. Taken as a whole, the entire episode generated a great deal of comment, from professionals and fans on social media alike. It ends up looking like one big mess, but there are two strands here which need to be treated separately. The easy one is the 35-minute delay in letting the punters know the race had been declared void. It was embarrassing and needless, since the decision had been taken while the remaining runners were halfway down the back. The yellow flag was just the signal to tell the jockeys the race was already over, and whether or not they obeyed it was irrelevant. There was no need to wait until after the inevitable inquiry to announce it, and the British Horseracing Authority has already suggested this is likely to change in future. When it comes to the seven jockeys who failed to stop, however, the situation is more complicated and the flag-waving approach to stopping a race has already come under scrutiny. Dan Skelton, for instance, suggested the existing method is out of date. \u201cIf that is what racing thinks is good enough to stop a race in 2019, then they are wrong,\u201d Skelton said. \u201cThey all know what the yellow flag means. To ignore it is an absolute ban. Why would they ignore it? Those jockeys have said they didn\u2019t see [the flag], it wasn\u2019t clear. It was completely inadequate for the situation to have one flag.\u201d Neil Mulholland, whose runner Doing Fine was first past the post, weighed in too. \u201cThe race was not stopped at the right time and it should have been stopped sooner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not good enough in this day and age as this is a multimillion-pound sport. Surely everyone in the sport deserves something more than a man with just a flag standing on an S-shaped bend?\u201d These arguments and more will be played out \u2013 as grounds for mitigation, at least \u2013 at the appeal hearing. As the rules stand, however, the basic question which the panel will consider is relatively straightforward: did some or all of the riders fail to see the flag, or did they see it and decide to ignore it? What no one should forget is that, chaotic though the scenes at Sandown were, it could potentially have been much worse. Houblon Des Obeaux collapsed in the middle of the racing line. There could easily have been vets or ground staff working to save him who would have been put at risk of serious injury themselves. Anyone who thinks a 35-minute delay in an announcement is a bad look for racing should consider what how one or more people getting flattened by seven galloping steeplechasers while attending to another would come across on the evening news. As Mick Fitzgerald reminded ITV viewers before the \u201cwinner\u201d had even returned to be unsaddled, every jockey attends a mandatory safety briefing once a year as a condition of receiving a licence. If it is not item one on the agenda, a reminder that \u201cyellow means stop\u201d must be pretty close to the top. Yellow flag, stop racing. It\u2019s that simple. Don\u2019t think about why and don\u2019t talk it over with the jockey next to you. Yellow means the race is already over. There won\u2019t be any \u201cshall we let it stand?\u201d in the steward\u2019s room. See yellow, stop racing \u2013 not least because if a head-down colleague hasn\u2019t seen it, they are then more likely to get the message. And it is as clear as day on the ITV footage that at least two of the jockeys on Saturday did see the flag. They stared straight at it for at least a second, which should be more than enough. As it turned out, their decision to continue \u2013 which may have carried some of their colleagues along with them \u2013 did not lead to disaster but the rule is there for a reason and so is the penalty for breaching it. A jump jockey\u2019s job is as tough as it comes in sport and Christmas is one of their most lucrative weeks of the year, so it is no surprise to find that the Sandown seven are appealing en masse. The claim that all seven failed to see the flag, however, will be very difficult to make with any credibility. Today\u2019s tips Musselburgh stages the only jumping on today\u2019s card, including a six-runner handicap chase which could prove to be more like a match race between Defi Sacre and Sporting Press (1.45) for which the latter should probably be shorter than 15-8 after an excellent run over course and distance last time. Theclockisticking (2.45) should also go well on the same card. But the best bets of the day look likely to be on the all-weather, including Fizzy Feet (2.00), who came up slightly short over five furlongs last time out while also looking as though a return to today\u2019s six will suit. Wimpole Hall (2.30), who is up just 2lb after winning for today\u2019s jockey Gaia Boni at Chelsmford last time, also looks worth an interest at around 5-1 while Almurr (6.15) is the pick of the prices on the Newcastle card.",

But it would not \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/get-brexit-done-reality-far-more-difficult-tortuous-european-union\" title=\"\">get Brexit done</a>\u201d. Far from it. It would clarify almost nothing. That is the big lie of this election.</p> <p>Everyone knows that Britain simply cannot leave the EU without a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/can-britain-reach-a-trade-deal-with-the-eu-by-the-end-of-2020\" title=\"\">trade deal with the rest of Europe</a>. It is fantasy. An offshore island cannot be without a trade relationship with its adjacent mainland. But what it should be is wholly opaque. The only remotely plausible deal is that reached for Northern Ireland in October, by Johnson himself. It keeps the province within the EU\u2019s customs union and therefore, of necessity, requires a customs border between Ireland and Britain. Yet this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/08/boris-johnson-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-gb-wont-be-checked-brexit\" title=\"\">Johnson denies</a>.</p> <p>Leaks to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/09/northern-irish-customs-arrangements-could-thwart-brexit-plans\" title=\"\">Financial Times from Johnson\u2019s own Brexit department</a> indicate that the protocol for such a border cannot realistically be in place by the formal withdrawal date at the end of next year. Nor will it be \u201cfree of checks\u201d, as Johnson constantly says, in telling traders to tear up any forms and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/09/arlene-foster-accuses-pm-of-breaking-his-word-over-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">\u201cthrow them in the bin</a>\u201d. That would be illegal. He seems unaware that you cannot be inside and outside a customs union at the same time. Northern Ireland cannot enjoy borderless free trade with both Britain and the rest of Ireland. It is a practical impossibility. It is a lie.</p> <p>On this Johnson should have been nailed to the floor in this chaotic election media circus. If Northern Ireland is to remain in the customs union, why not Britain? If Johnson can accept the realpolitik of the first, why not accept the second? Call it something else perhaps, but customs union it must be. The UK must stay within Europe\u2019s economic area on the existing basis. There are no paltry \u201cdeals with the rest of the world\u201d that can remotely compensate for the costs of a fixed border, tariffs and half-baked immigration controls.</p> <p>Every expert in world trade knows this to be true. Every seminar, conference, lecture and Whitehall leak says so. Britain can leave the EU in January. Johnson can have his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_triumph\" title=\"\">Roman triumph.</a> But it makes no sense for him to retreat behind protectionist trade barriers with the rest of Europe.</p> <p>If he only said so, I cannot believe millions of Brexiters would desert him \u2013 he will have \u201cleft Europe\u201d \u2013 and I am sure tens of thousands of exhausted remainers would swing behind him.

      "bodyText": "Vote Tory to \u201cget Brexit done\u2019\u2019 says an increasingly manic Boris Johnson. Yes, a Tory victory at this week\u2019s election would confirm the UK\u2019s departure from the councils of the EU. But it would not \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Far from it. It would clarify almost nothing. That is the big lie of this election. Everyone knows that Britain simply cannot leave the EU without a trade deal with the rest of Europe. It is fantasy. An offshore island cannot be without a trade relationship with its adjacent mainland. But what it should be is wholly opaque. The only remotely plausible deal is that reached for Northern Ireland in October, by Johnson himself. It keeps the province within the EU\u2019s customs union and therefore, of necessity, requires a customs border between Ireland and Britain. Yet this Johnson denies. Leaks to the Financial Times from Johnson\u2019s own Brexit department indicate that the protocol for such a border cannot realistically be in place by the formal withdrawal date at the end of next year. Nor will it be \u201cfree of checks\u201d, as Johnson constantly says, in telling traders to tear up any forms and \u201cthrow them in the bin\u201d. That would be illegal. He seems unaware that you cannot be inside and outside a customs union at the same time. Northern Ireland cannot enjoy borderless free trade with both Britain and the rest of Ireland. It is a practical impossibility. It is a lie. On this Johnson should have been nailed to the floor in this chaotic election media circus. If Northern Ireland is to remain in the customs union, why not Britain? If Johnson can accept the realpolitik of the first, why not accept the second? Call it something else perhaps, but customs union it must be. The UK must stay within Europe\u2019s economic area on the existing basis. There are no paltry \u201cdeals with the rest of the world\u201d that can remotely compensate for the costs of a fixed border, tariffs and half-baked immigration controls. Every expert in world trade knows this to be true. Every seminar, conference, lecture and Whitehall leak says so. Britain can leave the EU in January. Johnson can have his Roman triumph. But it makes no sense for him to retreat behind protectionist trade barriers with the rest of Europe. If he only said so, I cannot believe millions of Brexiters would desert him \u2013 he will have \u201cleft Europe\u201d \u2013 and I am sure tens of thousands of exhausted remainers would swing behind him. As it is, we must hang on and hope, yet again, that Johnson just does not mean the nonsense he says. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<h2>Claim</h2> <p>A Labour government would mean 52 more murders and 146 more sexual assaults or rapes a year, the equivalent of an additional murder every single week.</p> <h2>Background</h2> <p>The Conservative research department, the same body that brought the widely derided claims that a Labour government would oversee a rise in net migration to 840,000 a year and that Labour\u2019s spending plans would cost \u00a31.2tn over five years, has issued findings that it claims show a Labour government would make Britain\u2019s streets less safe.</p> <p>The central claim is that Labour\u2019s supposed opposition to stop-and-search powers for police would see a surge in crime every year, including the specific claim of 52 additional murders.</p> <p>The report also claims there would be 882 more firearms on the streets and 146 sexual assaults or rapes.</p> <p>The \u201cresearch\u201d was cited by the current home secretary, Priti Patel, in an <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/08/tories-will-do-takes-keep-britain-safe/\">article </a>written for the Daily Telegraph.</p> <h2>Reality</h2> <p>On the specific issue of Labour policy on stop and search, the party\u2019s 2019 manifesto says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Proportionate stop and search based on intelligence is a needed tool of effective policing, but the use of expanded powers means black and Asian men are still more likely to be stopped and searched, poisoning relations between the police and the local communities they serve.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is correct that Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott and others have been critical of the use of stop and search. But the manifesto does not advocate scrapping the tactic.</p> <p>There are Conservatives who share a mistrust of stop-and-search powers, among them the former prime minister, Theresa May. When she was home secretary she introduced reforms to the use of the tactic, telling MPs: \u201cNobody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young, black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police.\u201d</p> <p>The spurious calculations made by the Conservative research department have been published in a separate document.</p> <p>The department has used official statistics from the Home Office on how many people have been arrested for possession of an offensive weapon or firearm as a result of the use of a stop-and-search power and then, using separate figures from the Office for National Statistics, extrapolated estimates of crimes that the weapons could have been used for.</p> <p>The report itself reveals it is based on the assumption that anyone arrested for the possession of an offensive weapon or firearm would have gone on to commit a crime at some stage had it not been seized by the police. This is an assumption that can not be proven.</p> <p>The inherent problems of stop and search are laid bare in the document but pass without comment. One of the tables shows the rate for stop and searches resulting in an arrest, which has not been higher than 17% in the last 20 years.</p> <p>The College of Policing, the professional standards body that provides research to inform police tactics and approaches, in 2017 concluded that there was only <a href=\"https://whatworks.college.police.uk/Research/Documents/SS_and_crime_report.pdf\">limited evidence</a> that stop-and-search tactics had a meaningful deterrent effect on crime.</p> <p>Last month, Ministry of Justice figures showed that black and Asian people are being subjected to more stop and searches by police while the tactic is being used less on white people. </p> <p>The proportion of stop and searches carried out on white suspects fell from 75% in 2014/15 to 59% in 2018/19 but rose for \u201call minority ethnic groups\u201d, the MoJ said. The largest increases were from 13% to 22% for black suspects while the number carried out on people from Asian backgrounds rose from 8% to 13%.

      "bodyText": "Claim A Labour government would mean 52 more murders and 146 more sexual assaults or rapes a year, the equivalent of an additional murder every single week. Background The Conservative research department, the same body that brought the widely derided claims that a Labour government would oversee a rise in net migration to 840,000 a year and that Labour\u2019s spending plans would cost \u00a31.2tn over five years, has issued findings that it claims show a Labour government would make Britain\u2019s streets less safe. The central claim is that Labour\u2019s supposed opposition to stop-and-search powers for police would see a surge in crime every year, including the specific claim of 52 additional murders. The report also claims there would be 882 more firearms on the streets and 146 sexual assaults or rapes. The \u201cresearch\u201d was cited by the current home secretary, Priti Patel, in an article written for the Daily Telegraph. Reality On the specific issue of Labour policy on stop and search, the party\u2019s 2019 manifesto says: Proportionate stop and search based on intelligence is a needed tool of effective policing, but the use of expanded powers means black and Asian men are still more likely to be stopped and searched, poisoning relations between the police and the local communities they serve. It is correct that Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott and others have been critical of the use of stop and search. But the manifesto does not advocate scrapping the tactic. There are Conservatives who share a mistrust of stop-and-search powers, among them the former prime minister, Theresa May. When she was home secretary she introduced reforms to the use of the tactic, telling MPs: \u201cNobody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young, black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police.\u201d The spurious calculations made by the Conservative research department have been published in a separate document. The department has used official statistics from the Home Office on how many people have been arrested for possession of an offensive weapon or firearm as a result of the use of a stop-and-search power and then, using separate figures from the Office for National Statistics, extrapolated estimates of crimes that the weapons could have been used for. The report itself reveals it is based on the assumption that anyone arrested for the possession of an offensive weapon or firearm would have gone on to commit a crime at some stage had it not been seized by the police. This is an assumption that can not be proven. The inherent problems of stop and search are laid bare in the document but pass without comment. One of the tables shows the rate for stop and searches resulting in an arrest, which has not been higher than 17% in the last 20 years. The College of Policing, the professional standards body that provides research to inform police tactics and approaches, in 2017 concluded that there was only limited evidence that stop-and-search tactics had a meaningful deterrent effect on crime. Last month, Ministry of Justice figures showed that black and Asian people are being subjected to more stop and searches by police while the tactic is being used less on white people. The proportion of stop and searches carried out on white suspects fell from 75% in 2014/15 to 59% in 2018/19 but rose for \u201call minority ethnic groups\u201d, the MoJ said. The largest increases were from 13% to 22% for black suspects while the number carried out on people from Asian backgrounds rose from 8% to 13%. In the last five years, the proportion of stop and searches involving black suspects in London rose from 30% to 37% and is now equal to the number carried out on white suspects. There are other areas the Conservatives could focus on to reduce violent crime, but they are not. The government\u2019s own serious violent crime strategy states that like other types of crime and antisocial behaviour, violent crime has a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d. Low educational attainment, poor health including mental health, unemployment, socio-economic factors, weak ties to family and exclusion rates all have links to violent crime. A global study on homicide by the UN office on drugs and crime found that inequality and poverty had a bearing on the murder rate of a country. There is little mention in the Conservative manifesto on addressing these links, whereas Labour proposes to build youth services and invest in a youth justice system in which schools, local authorities, health authorities and youth services divert young people away from the pathways towards crime. Furthermore, the number of murders recorded by the police rose from 434 in the year to March 2015 to 592 in the year to March 2019, 158 more murders. Boris Johnson was challenged by LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari on Monday over the claims and was unable to explain where the figures had come from \u2013 even the prime minister does not appear to be willing to stand by them. Verdict To quote Ferrari: \u201cUnless she\u2019s Mystic Priti, this makes no sense at all.\u201d",

It was founded in 1985 in Tullow, near Dublin, by the Irish businessman Aidan Heavey and was promoted to the FTSE 100 in 2007.</p> <p>Its shares reached a peak of \u00a313.70 in 2012 but the oil market collapse led to the debt-laden firm\u2019s ejection from the blue-chip index three years later.

Demand for Jubilee field gas from the Ghana National Gas Company has been much lower than expected and Tullow has run into mechanical problems on two new wells at one of its other fields. It also warned last month that two discoveries off the Guyana coast contained heavy crude oil, which cast doubts on their commercial viability.</p> <p>The latest blow for Tullow shareholders emerged only weeks after its share price crashed to two-year lows after an update on two significant projects in Guyana.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Tullow Oil plunged to a 16-year low after the company surprised investors by slashing its production forecast, scrapping its dividend and announcing that its chief executive and exploration director had left. Tullow said Paul McDade was leaving after almost two decades at the London-listed company. He was appointed chief executive in 2017. Angus McCoss, the head of exploration, was also ousted with immediate effect. The company will be run by the chair, Dorothy Thompson, a former Drax boss, until a new chief executive is found, while Mark MacFarlane, its east Africa chief, becomes chief operating officer. Thompson said: \u201cThe board has been disappointed by the performance of Tullow\u2019s business and now needs time to complete its thorough review of operations.\u201d Tullow was the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 after shares crashed 72% to 70.1p \u2013 its lowest close since December 2003 and wiping more than \u00a31bn off the value of the company. It was founded in 1985 in Tullow, near Dublin, by the Irish businessman Aidan Heavey and was promoted to the FTSE 100 in 2007. Its shares reached a peak of \u00a313.70 in 2012 but the oil market collapse led to the debt-laden firm\u2019s ejection from the blue-chip index three years later. Heavey left last year and recently announced a new oil venture, Boru Energy. Tullow has been plagued by problems in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya. Demand for Jubilee field gas from the Ghana National Gas Company has been much lower than expected and Tullow has run into mechanical problems on two new wells at one of its other fields. It also warned last month that two discoveries off the Guyana coast contained heavy crude oil, which cast doubts on their commercial viability. The latest blow for Tullow shareholders emerged only weeks after its share price crashed to two-year lows after an update on two significant projects in Guyana. The company told investors they contained low quality, \u201cheavy oil\u201d which raised fears that the projects would be more expensive \u2013 and less lucrative \u2013 than investors had hoped. It expects to produce between 70,000 and 80,000 barrels of oil a day next year, down from about 87,000 barrels this year. From 2021-23 it expects production to remain at 70,000 barrels a day. The company has suspended its dividend and said it would be open to offers to acquire it \u201cat the proper value\u201d. Russ Mould, the investment director of stockbroker AJ Bell, described the production downgrade as a \u201creal disaster\u201d. He added: \u201cYou know an update is bad when it is accompanied by the immediate departure of senior management. The news represents a continuation of the problems which have dogged the company ever since its share price peaked more than seven years ago. \u201cThe company\u2019s skillset was in exploration \u2013 it enjoyed notable discoveries in Ghana and Uganda in the mid-noughties \u2013 and it has clearly found the transition to being more of a producer and developer of hydrocarbons more difficult.\u201d Mould noted that Tullow had debts of nearly $3bn (\u00a32.3bn). Nadeem Umar, an analyst at Hargreaves Landsdown, said the debt pile is \u201chigher than we\u2019d like\u201d and the blow to the Guyana fields dashes hopes of a secure source of future income. He warned that Tullow may face further difficult days if oil market prices sink. Tullow has locked-in oil prices of $56 a barrel for its TEN and Jubilee fields in Ghana. If oil market prices are higher than this level the company will rake in higher profits but if the market falls it could tighten the squeeze on its cashflows further. \u201cThat means the onus is on these fields to produce enough profit to shift the substantial debts, fund future projects and hopefully reinstate a dividend,\u201d Umar said. The Ghanaian fields will make up 70% of Tullow\u2019s production next year but are also eyed cautiously by investors. Both have suffered technical difficulties in the past; including technical problems at its Jubilee field and delays at the TEN offshore field.

Timothy Ginter recently sponsored a bill on religion in schools that is almost identical to one promoted by the group. But when first contacted by the Guardian, he said via email that he had \u201cno knowledge of Project Blitz\u201d. Prayer Caucus. The Guardian subsequently learned that, in January 2019, Ginter was listed as the co-chair of the Ohio state chapter of the Congressional Prayer Caucus \u2013 one of the groups behind Project Blitz. He has not responded to repeated requests for further comment. Cheat sheet A top climate scientist has warned that the COP25 UN climate talks under way in Madrid are so busy focusing on \u201cincremental technicalities\u201d that they risk ignoring the most important issue: how fast the world needs to cut its greenhouse gas emissions. The 34-year-old Finnish lawmaker Sanna Marin has been selected as the country\u2019s next \u2013 and youngest ever \u2013 prime minister. Marin will be Finland\u2019s third female government leader and the world\u2019s youngest serving prime minister. Japan\u2019s wartime government was involved in procuring so-called \u201ccomfort women\u201d to work as sex slaves in military brothels in the late 1930s, according to contemporaneous official documents that have now come to light. Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois, the prolific character actor best known for his roles in the TV series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and in the classic 1970 film M*A*S*H*, has died at his home in Los Angeles, aged 79. Must-reads How Juice WRLD helped to define a new sound The young Chicago rapper Juice WRLD was taken ill and died in his home city on Sunday. Despite making his breakthrough just 18 months ago with the single Lucid Dream, writes Al Horner, the 21-year-old had already reached millions with a fresh sound and anthems that focused on depression, addiction and heartbreak. The battle to build four new prisons for New York New York\u2019s mayor has announced an $8.7bn plan to close the notorious Rikers Island jail and build four smaller facilities across the city. While prison reformers are in favour of closing Rikers, they are divided over the plans to replace it, as Daniel A Medina reports. The shocking persistence of virginity tests As a child, Michelle Northcote\u2019s pediatrician regularly checked her hymen, an invasive practice that she didn\u2019t know was unusual until she discussed it with friends in college \u2013 and realised her Catholic mother must have demanded confirmation of her virginity. So-called hymen checks still happen across the US, learns Poppy Noor. The impossible body standards of the modern action hero Last month Henry Cavill, aka Superman, revealed that he had once auditioned for the role of James Bond, only to be told he was too \u201cchubby\u201d to play 007. That\u2019s just one symptom of the near-impossible body standards being set by today\u2019s male action heroes, says Steve Rose. Opinion As a Facebook moderator, Chris Gray regularly witnessed murder, torture and other horrors \u2013 and shielded regular users from seeing the same. Yet Mark Zuckerberg says moderators\u2019 complaints about their working conditions are \u201coverdramatic\u201d. Facebook says it provides \u2018wellness\u2019, which meant invitations to finger painting and yoga, but try taking time off to take care of yourself when you have targets to meet and your boss is agitating because there\u2019s a backlog in the child sexual abuse images queue. Someone has to take care of the innocents, it\u2019s our job, but we can\u2019t face it any more. Sport The world\u2019s top chess player, Magnus Carlsen, is on the verge of another sporting triumph after climbing to third place \u2013 out of more than 7 million players worldwide \u2013 in the Fantasy Premier League. Despite his success in the online soccer game, Carlsen claims he has \u201cjust been lucky\u201d. The 49ers pulled out a thrilling 48-46 victory over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. San Francisco are a revelation this season, writes Melissa Jacobs, so why does the NFL\u2019s ridiculous seeding system still put them below the woeful Cowboys?

      "body": "<p>For a clear picture of how damaged the US postsecondary education system is, one need only look at the money-printing mill that is the for-profit college. I should know: I spent 10 years \u201cteaching\u201d at one of the <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/education/nyc-sues-berkeley-college-over-alleged-deceptive-practices/4517499/\">most notorious cash</a><a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/education/nyc-sues-berkeley-college-over-alleged-deceptive-practices/4517499/\">-grab colleges</a> in the country. There, I saw profoundly underprepared students racking up far more debt than their \u201ctraditional\u201d peers \u2013 debt they would default on at more than <a href=\"https://www.responsiblelending.org/map/pdf/ny.pdf\">twice the rate </a>of those peers, landing the costs of these wayward scholars directly on the shoulders of taxpayers.</p> <p>This week, the US Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/12/04/trump-administration-reveals-that-far-more-corinthian-colleges-students-faced-debt-collection-violation-court-order/\">accidentally showed</a> just how badly the problem of for-profit college debt is intertwined with predatory loan collection: in a court filing, the Department of Education jacked up its estimate of <em>its own</em> illegal debt collection from 16,000 former students at bankrupt Corinthian College to nearly three times that amount. All while the secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, who was held in contempt of court for the department\u2019s actions, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/14/779465130/devos-refuses-to-forgive-student-debt-for-those-defrauded-by-for-profit-colleges\">continued to refuse debt forgiveness</a> for thousands of students ripped off by for-profit colleges.</p> <p>From 1995 to 2015, enrollment at for-profit colleges went <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_303.20.asp\">up more than 460%</a> \u2013 more than 14 times that of traditional institutions. Meanwhile, students at for-profit colleges \u2013 mostly low-income, minority or first-generation college students \u2013 face challenges that severely compromise their ability to stay in school: my students suffered from homelessness, mental illness, abuse and bank accounts so low they couldn\u2019t afford subway passes.</p> <p>Those challenges didn\u2019t matter to recruiters: skipped the SAT or ACT? No problem! As long as you had a pulse and a GED you were in. Once those students got to class we professors \u2013 whose yearly fire-at-will contracts made us particularly vulnerable to any kind of student complaint \u2013 were told to \u201cwork it out\u201d.</p> <p>The students got the message: they considered us waiters, essentially, and complained constantly about our bad service. Their mantra was \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d, and the administration agreed: I got hauled in front of my department chair for such extreme professorial misconduct as pointing out to a student that she was late to class; for asking students to print their syllabi; and for having the gall to assign them actual work.</p> <p>Despite this, professors toiled mightily to educate their students, even if that meant helping them find housing, childcare and jobs. More than once I slipped students extra cash to make sure they could eat. All of this was met with a shrug from the administration, who on one memorable \u201cFaculty Appreciation Day\u201d gifted us a handful of whiteboard markers \u2013 otherwise free in the supply closet \u2013 festooned with ribbons.</p> <p>Considering the challenges they faced, some students worked heroically. One of my students, who had contracted HIV after being forced into prostitution as a young girl, battled manic depression to become a case worker at a men\u2019s shelter. Others sweated through classes grasping their desks for anchor, they were so traumatized with PTSD from their military days.</p> <p>But for most the future seemed grim. They simply could not balance their difficult circumstances and their utter lack of preparation for college-level work. Nearly <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40\">80% of students</a> at for-profit institutions nationwide won\u2019t graduate.</p> <p>Those who do graduate don\u2019t fare much better, as my LinkedIn feed attests: \u201csecurity consultant\u201d (guard), \u201ccustomer interaction manager\u201d (sales clerk) and \u201cAssistant Manager at Old Navy\u201d are OK jobs, but they needn\u2019t have cost these students the more than $48,000 that they did.</p> <p>In 2004, Barack Obama tried to address this with the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/barack-obama-pushes-for-profit-colleges-to-the-brink-119613\">gainful employment rule</a>, forcing for-profits to prove their graduates could find good jobs in order to be eligible for government financial aid. When Trump won in 2016, you could almost hear the champagne corks popping in for-profit college administration offices; Trump appointee DeVos wasted little time in undermining the Obama rule before finally <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/betsy-devos-for-profit-colleges.html\">officially repealing it</a> earlier this year.</p> <p>There are better ways to fix the problem. Increasing investment in public universities and especially in public two-year colleges and technical schools would be a good start. But really we should be investing in the places these students go before college, and that means bridging the <a href=\"https://edbuild.org/content/23-billion\">$23</a><a href=\"https://edbuild.org/content/23-billion\">b</a><a href=\"https://edbuild.org/content/23-billion\">n funding gap</a> between majority-minority schools and their majority-white counterparts, who serve the same number of students. College prep cannot start in college.</p> <p>More to the point, we should be reframing the system entirely: is a bachelor\u2019s degree really necessary for young people to join the fastest-growing US job sectors, those of <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm\">technicians, assistants and aides</a>? And how many students really <em>want</em> that bachelor\u2019s? Every student should be able to get the education they desire, but the bulk of mine had no interest in a classical education: they wanted to get their diploma and get out.</p> <p>Recently, strong job numbers have hurt for-profit enrollment \u2013 fewer out-of-work adults means fewer adult learners returning to school. But there are <a href=\"https://www.responsiblelending.org/map/pdf/crl-state-of-for-profits-methodology-2018.pdf\">over one million students</a> currently enrolled in for-profit colleges. They\u2019ll learn the hard way that, when it comes to a college degree, the adage \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.</p> <ul> <li><p>David Andrew Stoler is a writer whose work has appeared in Politico, the Chronicle of Higher Education, McSweeney\u2019s, Aeon, and many others</p></li> </ul>",

From 1995 to 2015, enrollment at for-profit colleges went up more than 460% \u2013 more than 14 times that of traditional institutions. Meanwhile, students at for-profit colleges \u2013 mostly low-income, minority or first-generation college students \u2013 face challenges that severely compromise their ability to stay in school: my students suffered from homelessness, mental illness, abuse and bank accounts so low they couldn\u2019t afford subway passes. Those challenges didn\u2019t matter to recruiters: skipped the SAT or ACT? No problem! As long as you had a pulse and a GED you were in. Once those students got to class we professors \u2013 whose yearly fire-at-will contracts made us particularly vulnerable to any kind of student complaint \u2013 were told to \u201cwork it out\u201d. The students got the message: they considered us waiters, essentially, and complained constantly about our bad service. Their mantra was \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d, and the administration agreed: I got hauled in front of my department chair for such extreme professorial misconduct as pointing out to a student that she was late to class; for asking students to print their syllabi; and for having the gall to assign them actual work. Despite this, professors toiled mightily to educate their students, even if that meant helping them find housing, childcare and jobs. More than once I slipped students extra cash to make sure they could eat. All of this was met with a shrug from the administration, who on one memorable \u201cFaculty Appreciation Day\u201d gifted us a handful of whiteboard markers \u2013 otherwise free in the supply closet \u2013 festooned with ribbons. Considering the challenges they faced, some students worked heroically. One of my students, who had contracted HIV after being forced into prostitution as a young girl, battled manic depression to become a case worker at a men\u2019s shelter. Others sweated through classes grasping their desks for anchor, they were so traumatized with PTSD from their military days. But for most the future seemed grim. They simply could not balance their difficult circumstances and their utter lack of preparation for college-level work. Nearly 80% of students at for-profit institutions nationwide won\u2019t graduate. Those who do graduate don\u2019t fare much better, as my LinkedIn feed attests: \u201csecurity consultant\u201d (guard), \u201ccustomer interaction manager\u201d (sales clerk) and \u201cAssistant Manager at Old Navy\u201d are OK jobs, but they needn\u2019t have cost these students the more than $48,000 that they did. In 2004, Barack Obama tried to address this with the gainful employment rule, forcing for-profits to prove their graduates could find good jobs in order to be eligible for government financial aid. When Trump won in 2016, you could almost hear the champagne corks popping in for-profit college administration offices; Trump appointee DeVos wasted little time in undermining the Obama rule before finally officially repealing it earlier this year. There are better ways to fix the problem. Increasing investment in public universities and especially in public two-year colleges and technical schools would be a good start. But really we should be investing in the places these students go before college, and that means bridging the $23bn funding gap between majority-minority schools and their majority-white counterparts, who serve the same number of students. College prep cannot start in college. More to the point, we should be reframing the system entirely: is a bachelor\u2019s degree really necessary for young people to join the fastest-growing US job sectors, those of technicians, assistants and aides? And how many students really want that bachelor\u2019s? Every student should be able to get the education they desire, but the bulk of mine had no interest in a classical education: they wanted to get their diploma and get out. Recently, strong job numbers have hurt for-profit enrollment \u2013 fewer out-of-work adults means fewer adult learners returning to school. But there are over one million students currently enrolled in for-profit colleges. They\u2019ll learn the hard way that, when it comes to a college degree, the adage \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.

      "body": "<p>This, the more gnarled of Bundesliga followers would tell you, is the real Klassiker. Years of mere intermittent threats to Bayern Munich\u2019s dominance have made Borussia Dortmund, Germany\u2019s most visible other club and the champions\u2019 most frequent irritants, the default opposition for a showpiece. More than 40 years have passed since Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach were champions for a fifth and as yet final time, an era in which the mantle of top dogs was a real back-and-forth. In the 1970s, Gladbach\u2019s first two titles and last three were split by a Bayern run of three in succession.</p> \n<p>It may be way too early to declare a similar state of suspense but something has changed, and not only because the last time Gladbach were top for this long was that 1976-77 season in which Jupp Heynckes, Rainer Bonhof, Allan Simonsen and company swept Die Fohlen to the Meisterschale. Bayern were here and worse at this time last year, trailing Dortmund by nine points. It does, however, feel \u201cdifferent\u201d this time around, as Joshua Kimmich remarked in the corridors of Borussia-Park as Saturday evening drew in.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/european-football-roundup-gladbach-bayern-leipzig-atalanta-verona\">European roundup: Juventus beaten for first time; Gladbach defeat Bayern</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was hard to think any other way, or even to think at all, after this whirlwind of an occasion. This was the sort of afternoon on which Bayern\u2019s motto of Mia San Mia \u2013 we are who we are \u2013 seems meaningful and not just a marketing buzzphrase. Whatever their issues in terms of leadership, personnel and team identity, they always show up for occasions such as this. Having arrived four points behind Gladbach they spent the first half pinning their hosts back, and it was exactly what we expected. Their dominance over Marco Rose\u2019s team continued after the break, until the twists that turned this from an engrossing contest into something which felt even more significant.</p> \n<p>The sense of throwback lasted into the night as ZDF, whose Sportschau broadcasts free highlights on Saturday evenings, received a raft of complaints after the presenter Matthias Opdenh\u00f6vel accidentally let the result slip before the programme started, not realising his microphone was on. The idea that, in late 2019 and with the ubiquity of social media, viewers can genuinely avoid the result of a Saturday afternoon fixture until the evening is a heartwarming one and fed into the feeling of this being a special day, the suspense of which should be fully embraced.</p> \n<p>Still, it was one of those rare matches that will continue to bear repeated viewing, even if you know what\u2019s coming \u2013 a version of The Usual Suspects among football matches, if you like, offering finer detail and greater nuance on each watch. It was, improbably, Gladbach who ended triumphant after spending most of the match\u2019s first hour hanging on. Their stirring comeback \u201cleft a whole region in jubilation\u201d, as Westdeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Achim M\u00fcller put it, and the celebrations were full of meaning, even if it\u2019s too soon to talk about pivotal events.</p> \n<p>As fans in the Nord Kurve behind the goal celebrated with their delirious players Marcus Thuram, a pest for Bayern all afternoon who had won the late penalty which was the game\u2019s decisive moment, wandered over to the corner flag, put Ramy Bensabaini\u2019s shirt on it and waved it in triumph at the fans.</p> \n<p>The pair were both playing in France last season, Thuram\u2019s efforts failing to keep Guingamp up while Bensabaini played his part in the Coupe de France triumph for Rennes. Here, in entirely another dimension of heat and adrenalin, they played crucial roles. Bensabaini\u2019s towering header on the hour from Jonas Hofmann\u2019s corner equalised Ivan Perisic\u2019s opener and wrested his team back into the game. As stoppage time kicked in Thuram, a revelation in his debut Bundesliga season, improbably found another burst of pace to tear behind Bayern\u2019s back line. Javi Mart\u00ednez stretched and hauled him over, with the referee Marco Fritz pointing to the spot and showing Mart\u00ednez a second yellow card.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b7f97d37af8a61545ce338cfbd7ae238060498b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b7f97d37af8a61545ce338cfbd7ae238060498b/0_126_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s Marcus Thuram was a pest for Bayern all afternoon in their Bundesliga match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s Marcus Thuram was a pest for Bayern all afternoon in their Bundesliga match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixathlon/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As Bayern came to terms with Fritz\u2019s adjudication and struggled to retain their composure, Gladbach had to scrabble to find theirs. It took a reminder from the bench \u2013 and specifically the reserve goalkeeper Tobi Sippel \u2013 that Bensabaini was the nominated penalty taker. After Breel Embolo missed against Freiburg last week the Algerian defender, a regular and confident spot-kicker in training, volunteered to step up for the next one, not for a second thinking that it would end up being a kick of such magnitude. \u201cI honestly forgot [having volunteered] when it was given,\u201d he said with a smile. The surety with which Bensabaini struck it home defied the confusion. Manuel Neuer read it, but still couldn\u2019t stop it. Gladbach had their sixth home win in a row, and Bayern were beaten.</p> \n<p>For Hansi Flick it was \u201cjust like last week against Leverkusen\u201d, he told Sky. His team had played well but failed to take advantage. Both Kimmich and Neuer, meanwhile, talked about Bayern having dropped their intensity after they took the lead. \u201cWe deserved to take the lead,\u201d said Kimmich, \u201cbut then we stopped playing brave football.\u201d Gladbach, on the other hand, rode their luck on occasion but reaped the reward for their show of guts. Rose had thrown on the hero of last week, Embolo, for the midfielder L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e9nes just before Bensabaini\u2019s first, and never looked back. \u201cAfter the equaliser we didn\u2019t try just to manage the game, but to win it,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully, the game has two halves.\u201d</p> \n<p>The question now becomes whether Gladbach \u2013 seven ahead of Bayern but just a single point in front of Leipzig \u2013 can do what Dortmund did not last year and maintain the gap until Christmas. That expectations on them have changed so much is more than just a pinch of nostalgia. It is a huge compliment to Rose and Gladbach, and a shot in the arm for the Bundesliga\u2019s present.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Leipzig had been heading for the top until Bensabaini\u2019s late intervention, courtesy of a 3-1 win against Hoffenheim, which wasn\u2019t quite as easy as it looked but Timo Werner took his personal tally to nine in the past five games. The striker also spoke of his aim to \u201ctake the momentum into the summer\u201d, hoping to have more of an influence on Euro 2020 than he did in the World Cup.</p> \n<p>\u2022 It was a good weekend for Dortmund too, leapfrogging Bayern after sweeping aside a feeble Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf 5-0. Playing in an all-black 110th anniversary kit \u2013 the limited run of 9,009 replicas sold out in three hours \u2013 there were two goals apiece for Marco Reus and Jadon Sancho in a fine tuneup for Tuesday\u2019s Champions League meeting with Slavia Prague, with BVB needing to win and hoping for a favour from Barcelona.</p> \n<p>\u2022 It\u2019s on again at the bottom after Paderborn\u2019s dramatic first away win at Werder Bremen. Sven Michel\u2019s goal was initially ruled out but then verified by VAR to move Steffen Baumgart\u2019s team off the bottom and within four points of the play-off place.</p> \n<figure class=\"element

As fans in the Nord Kurve behind the goal celebrated with their delirious players Marcus Thuram, a pest for Bayern all afternoon who had won the late penalty which was the game\u2019s decisive moment, wandered over to the corner flag, put Ramy Bensabaini\u2019s shirt on it and waved it in triumph at the fans. The pair were both playing in France last season, Thuram\u2019s efforts failing to keep Guingamp up while Bensabaini played his part in the Coupe de France triumph for Rennes. Here, in entirely another dimension of heat and adrenalin, they played crucial roles. Bensabaini\u2019s towering header on the hour from Jonas Hofmann\u2019s corner equalised Ivan Perisic\u2019s opener and wrested his team back into the game. As stoppage time kicked in Thuram, a revelation in his debut Bundesliga season, improbably found another burst of pace to tear behind Bayern\u2019s back line. Javi Mart\u00ednez stretched and hauled him over, with the referee Marco Fritz pointing to the spot and showing Mart\u00ednez a second yellow card. As Bayern came to terms with Fritz\u2019s adjudication and struggled to retain their composure, Gladbach had to scrabble to find theirs. It took a reminder from the bench \u2013 and specifically the reserve goalkeeper Tobi Sippel \u2013 that Bensabaini was the nominated penalty taker. After Breel Embolo missed against Freiburg last week the Algerian defender, a regular and confident spot-kicker in training, volunteered to step up for the next one, not for a second thinking that it would end up being a kick of such magnitude. \u201cI honestly forgot [having volunteered] when it was given,\u201d he said with a smile. The surety with which Bensabaini struck it home defied the confusion. Manuel Neuer read it, but still couldn\u2019t stop it. Gladbach had their sixth home win in a row, and Bayern were beaten. For Hansi Flick it was \u201cjust like last week against Leverkusen\u201d, he told Sky. His team had played well but failed to take advantage. Both Kimmich and Neuer, meanwhile, talked about Bayern having dropped their intensity after they took the lead. \u201cWe deserved to take the lead,\u201d said Kimmich, \u201cbut then we stopped playing brave football.\u201d Gladbach, on the other hand, rode their luck on occasion but reaped the reward for their show of guts. Rose had thrown on the hero of last week, Embolo, for the midfielder L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e9nes just before Bensabaini\u2019s first, and never looked back. \u201cAfter the equaliser we didn\u2019t try just to manage the game, but to win it,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully, the game has two halves.\u201d The question now becomes whether Gladbach \u2013 seven ahead of Bayern but just a single point in front of Leipzig \u2013 can do what Dortmund did not last year and maintain the gap until Christmas. That expectations on them have changed so much is more than just a pinch of nostalgia. It is a huge compliment to Rose and Gladbach, and a shot in the arm for the Bundesliga\u2019s present. Talking points \u2022 Leipzig had been heading for the top until Bensabaini\u2019s late intervention, courtesy of a 3-1 win against Hoffenheim, which wasn\u2019t quite as easy as it looked but Timo Werner took his personal tally to nine in the past five games. The striker also spoke of his aim to \u201ctake the momentum into the summer\u201d, hoping to have more of an influence on Euro 2020 than he did in the World Cup. \u2022 It was a good weekend for Dortmund too, leapfrogging Bayern after sweeping aside a feeble Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf 5-0. Playing in an all-black 110th anniversary kit \u2013 the limited run of 9,009 replicas sold out in three hours \u2013 there were two goals apiece for Marco Reus and Jadon Sancho in a fine tuneup for Tuesday\u2019s Champions League meeting with Slavia Prague, with BVB needing to win and hoping for a favour from Barcelona. \u2022 It\u2019s on again at the bottom after Paderborn\u2019s dramatic first away win at Werder Bremen. Sven Michel\u2019s goal was initially ruled out but then verified by VAR to move Steffen Baumgart\u2019s team off the bottom and within four points of the play-off place.",

Like pop stars holding the mic out to their fans, this gang of actors can count on kids to finish every line. \u201cWhat about sofas?\u201d they ask. \u201cGophers!\u201d bellows six-year-old Hilda into my ear.</p> <p>Hilda loves the Oi series: at bedtime, one book always leads to another, albeit with diminishing returns. There\u2019s barely a plot between the stories, so neither of us can imagine how they\u2019ll inspire an hour-long show. The setting in Emma Earle\u2019s production \u2013 co-written with Zoe Squire, Luke Bateman and Richy Hughes \u2013 is Sittingbottom school for animals, inspired by a blackboard scene in Oi Frog! where cranky Cat teaches rhymes that tell creatures where to sit. Preschoolers and reception pupils will respond to a plot that touches on overcoming nerves, making friends and braving school dinners, before growing increasingly zany.</p> <p>That sourpuss becomes Sittingbottom\u2019s head prefect and Frog is a jumpy new student whose sentimental ballad might be the mushiest amphibian solo since Robin sang <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFR3zz12p0\">Halfway Down the Stairs</a> on The Muppets.

      "bodyText": "Cats sit on mats, mules sit on stools and pumas sit on satsumas. So how about duck-billed platypuses? You\u2019ll know the answer if you\u2019ve raced through the sequels to Kes Gray and Jim Field\u2019s giddy picture book Oi Frog! \u2013 which seems to be just about everyone at the Lyric theatre for this boisterous musical adaptation, where the characters and rhymes from the popular series are shaken up and scattered across an original new tale. Like pop stars holding the mic out to their fans, this gang of actors can count on kids to finish every line. \u201cWhat about sofas?\u201d they ask. \u201cGophers!\u201d bellows six-year-old Hilda into my ear. Hilda loves the Oi series: at bedtime, one book always leads to another, albeit with diminishing returns. There\u2019s barely a plot between the stories, so neither of us can imagine how they\u2019ll inspire an hour-long show. The setting in Emma Earle\u2019s production \u2013 co-written with Zoe Squire, Luke Bateman and Richy Hughes \u2013 is Sittingbottom school for animals, inspired by a blackboard scene in Oi Frog! where cranky Cat teaches rhymes that tell creatures where to sit. Preschoolers and reception pupils will respond to a plot that touches on overcoming nerves, making friends and braving school dinners, before growing increasingly zany. That sourpuss becomes Sittingbottom\u2019s head prefect and Frog is a jumpy new student whose sentimental ballad might be the mushiest amphibian solo since Robin sang Halfway Down the Stairs on The Muppets. However, once he learns that frogs sit on logs \u2013 splinters and all \u2013 our hoppy hero rebels and becomes a demon rhymer, laying down new rules, with cats forced to sit on gnats. The pace mostly matches the delirium of the books: one show-stopping number in the canteen finds Cheetah serving fajitas while dancing to salsa and bouncing giant beach balls at the audience. For Hilda, this is the highlight \u2013 along with a rampaging elephant who brandishes his deadly trunk and sprays us all with water. The accompanying Scarface gag (\u201cSay hello to my little friend\u201d) is one of very few jokes winked at adults. Elsewhere, a \u201ctake back control\u201d line falls flat.

      "body": "<p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2018/may/07/crossword-blog-the-new-yorkers-second-crossword\">we were delighted to see</a> that the New Yorker had begun <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/\">a crossword series</a>, which has since gone twice-weekly. I feigned annoyance that the puzzles weren\u2019t cryptic; they are, in fact a challenging and literate take on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/american-style\">the American puzzle style</a>, which often misleads in a way that\u2019s not a million miles from our own crosswords.</p> <p>The New Yorker did have a cryptic \u2013 in the 1990s. Last month, the magazine created the post of puzzles-and-games editor. Liz Maynes-Aminzade is the inaugural honcho and, she tells me, was persuaded by her colleague Nick Henriquez to try solving some of the cryptics in the archive. \u201cI had to really sweat through the first five or so,\u201d she says, \u201cbut then something clicked. Now, of course, I love them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07ee2a4e0f0f6a7c9d332554688c0dfc062167b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07ee2a4e0f0f6a7c9d332554688c0dfc062167b1/0_0_388_483/388.jpg\" alt=\"A crossword grid from the New Yorker magazine.\" width=\"388\" height=\"483\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A crossword grid from the New Yorker magazine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: The New Yorker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A batch of the old puzzles has reappeared as a kind of Thanksgiving gift, with more to follow weekly. They\u2019re very moreish, partly because they use 10-by-8 grids (in \u201cportrait\u201d orientation); I presumed that this was solely to give newcomers a gentler solving experience, but there\u2019s more to it. Says Maynes-Aminzade:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hendrik Hertzberg, the senior editor who originally launched the cryptic (with the blessing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/18/tina-brown-vanity-fair-new-yorker-interview\">Tina Brown</a>, the British editor of the New Yorker at the time), devised this grid design so the puzzle could fit into a single column of the magazine.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of <em>course</em> the visuals were part of the decision. And in terms of construction, the clues are closer to the Guardian\u2019s quiptic (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/quiptic\">for beginners and those in a hurry</a>\u201d) than, say, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/oct/13/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-enigmatist\">Enigmatist</a> workout. I wondered what would be the American equivalents of all those British abbreviations from cricket and the armed forces that make UK cryptics that little bit tricker for non-native solvers. Letters denoting things from private healthcare, sports leagues and the way they name their radio stations, perhaps?</p> <p>But the hurdle isn\u2019t there. \u201cWhen our puzzles use abbreviations and initialisms,\u201d says Maynes-Aminzade, \u201cthey tend to be common ones: periodic table elements, cardinal directions, etc. In other words, our puzzle is easier than yours!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe the closest analog,\u201d she adds, \u201cwould be names of American actors \u2013 I\u2019ve seen multiple puzzles that play on SLY for Sylvester Stallone, for instance. But I imagine even these references to the Italian Stallion will be legible to British solvers.\u201d</p> <p>They are, and it\u2019s worth noting here that it\u2019s a shame that I come across the fine Irish actor Stephen RAE more often in American puzzles than I do in the film pages of British papers.

      "bodyText": "Last year, we were delighted to see that the New Yorker had begun a crossword series, which has since gone twice-weekly. I feigned annoyance that the puzzles weren\u2019t cryptic; they are, in fact a challenging and literate take on the American puzzle style, which often misleads in a way that\u2019s not a million miles from our own crosswords. The New Yorker did have a cryptic \u2013 in the 1990s. Last month, the magazine created the post of puzzles-and-games editor. Liz Maynes-Aminzade is the inaugural honcho and, she tells me, was persuaded by her colleague Nick Henriquez to try solving some of the cryptics in the archive. \u201cI had to really sweat through the first five or so,\u201d she says, \u201cbut then something clicked. Now, of course, I love them.\u201d A batch of the old puzzles has reappeared as a kind of Thanksgiving gift, with more to follow weekly. They\u2019re very moreish, partly because they use 10-by-8 grids (in \u201cportrait\u201d orientation); I presumed that this was solely to give newcomers a gentler solving experience, but there\u2019s more to it. Says Maynes-Aminzade: Hendrik Hertzberg, the senior editor who originally launched the cryptic (with the blessing of Tina Brown, the British editor of the New Yorker at the time), devised this grid design so the puzzle could fit into a single column of the magazine. Of course the visuals were part of the decision. And in terms of construction, the clues are closer to the Guardian\u2019s quiptic (\u201cfor beginners and those in a hurry\u201d) than, say, an Enigmatist workout. I wondered what would be the American equivalents of all those British abbreviations from cricket and the armed forces that make UK cryptics that little bit tricker for non-native solvers. Letters denoting things from private healthcare, sports leagues and the way they name their radio stations, perhaps? But the hurdle isn\u2019t there. \u201cWhen our puzzles use abbreviations and initialisms,\u201d says Maynes-Aminzade, \u201cthey tend to be common ones: periodic table elements, cardinal directions, etc. In other words, our puzzle is easier than yours!\u201d \u201cMaybe the closest analog,\u201d she adds, \u201cwould be names of American actors \u2013 I\u2019ve seen multiple puzzles that play on SLY for Sylvester Stallone, for instance. But I imagine even these references to the Italian Stallion will be legible to British solvers.\u201d They are, and it\u2019s worth noting here that it\u2019s a shame that I come across the fine Irish actor Stephen RAE more often in American puzzles than I do in the film pages of British papers. And in the New Yorker\u2019s cryptics, there are more British bits and pieces \u2013 ETON collars, say \u2013 than I had expected to find. Does the American cryptic community overlap with the anglophone gang? I only have anecdotal evidence, but I highly suspect it does. The New Yorker once published a cryptic that had ADAM BEDE in the grid \u2013 clued \u2018Plot in a lady\u2019s novel\u2019 \u2013 if that tells you anything.

Some, such as Chinatown\u2019s Ling Sing Association, question the need for new jails at all. <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/10/06/architects-make-case-against-de-blasios-plan-for-city-jails/\">Their plan</a> calls for razing the existing facilities on Rikers and building a new state-of-the-art complex that would include hospital and mental health facilities, gyms and athletic fields, work-training centres and an area for farming.

With 5-inch-wide windows and a small rooftop exercise yard, it shows the grim architectural consequences of stacking prisoners high on a limited plot. Similar MCC towers were built in San Diego and New York around the same time, and they have rarely been copied since. \u201cA high-rise dungeon in Manhattan\u2019s financial district\u201d is how Jeanne Theoharis, professor of political science at Brooklyn College, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/real-scandal-mcc/596257/\">describes the MCC in New York</a>, where many Muslim terrorism suspects have been held in inhumane conditions for years without trial.

The work brought together architects, environmental psychologists, criminal justice experts, former detainees and community members from across the boroughs to help inform what a new generation of \u201cjustice hubs\u201d could be like.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/dec/09/rikers-20-inside-the-battle-to-build-four-new-prisons-in-new-york-city\">Rikers 2.0: inside the battle to build four new prisons in New York City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAccessibility came out top,\u201d says Jessica Lax, a director at the institute. \u201cRikers was totally inaccessible by design, making it very difficult for family members and lawyers to get there. Many former detainees we spoke to found the process of being taken on and off the island so horrific that they didn\u2019t want to go to court.\u201d She says smell and sound were other key factors, with Rikers known for its repulsive cocktail of urine and rotting food, and its echoing cacophony of banging and yelling.<br><br>Their principles for what a decentralised jail network should look like focus on proximity to courthouses, to allow for easier due process and better access to lawyers, and emphasise improved post-release services to help former detainees return to a normal life. Crucially, the facilities can be used by both prisoners and local residents, to increase community connections and reduce the fear and stigma surrounding jails. Their proposals include dedicating multiple floors of the justice hubs to things such as libraries, community gardens, art studios, exercise facilities, medical clinics and social services \u2013 to be used at different times by both inmates and the public.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b846651a21aabd9523c205fc879fde71a6692a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b846651a21aabd9523c205fc879fde71a6692a5/0_0_2673_1899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Justice in Design report by the Van Alen Institute proposes \u2018justice hubs\u2019, which feature proximity to courthouses, emphasise improved post-release services and include community facilities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Justice in Design report by the Van Alen Institute proposes \u2018justice hubs\u2019, which feature proximity to courthouses, emphasise improved post-release services and include community facilities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy: NADAAA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a radical conception that could help reduce stigma and aid rehabilitation.

Elizabeth Glazer, director of the mayor\u2019s office of criminal justice, says the target is eminently achievable. \u201cThis is a decarceration plan,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s been a real change in how we think about the purpose of punishment, how we treat people, how to develop a relationship between officers and incarcerated.\u201d She says that over last six years the city\u2019s jail population has dropped by 40%, while crime rates have also fallen, making New York the safest and least incarcerated big city in the United States. Some, such as Chinatown\u2019s Ling Sing Association, question the need for new jails at all. Their plan calls for razing the existing facilities on Rikers and building a new state-of-the-art complex that would include hospital and mental health facilities, gyms and athletic fields, work-training centres and an area for farming. Abolitionist campaign group No New Jails has proposed closing Rikers without building a replacement at all. Holding large numbers of prisoners in high-density urban sites comes with constraints. Putting a high-rise jail in a built-up location means the windows have to be small, to prevent overlooking, while staircases, elevators and mechanical services have to be beefed up. Outdoor space is inherently limited. At a time when the incarcerated population is rapidly ageing \u2013 with prisons becoming some of the largest providers of elderly care \u2013 the logic of arranging a jail across multiple storeys is questionable. \u201cTwo of the most important things needed by prisoners are privacy and freedom of movement around a site,\u201d says Yvonne Jewkes, professor of criminology at the University of Bath, whose work has focused on the social and psychological effects of prison architecture. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine there\u2019s going to be a huge amount of movement on such a small footprint, while privacy is likely to be an issue in these dense locations.\u201d She cites the example of the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in Chicago, built in 1975 as an icon of brutalist incarceration, which stands as a 28-storey triangular wedge in the middle of the city. With 5-inch-wide windows and a small rooftop exercise yard, it shows the grim architectural consequences of stacking prisoners high on a limited plot. Similar MCC towers were built in San Diego and New York around the same time, and they have rarely been copied since. \u201cA high-rise dungeon in Manhattan\u2019s financial district\u201d is how Jeanne Theoharis, professor of political science at Brooklyn College, describes the MCC in New York, where many Muslim terrorism suspects have been held in inhumane conditions for years without trial. What guarantee is there that the replacement jails won\u2019t just replicate these conditions and multiply the problems of Rikers four times over? Some hope comes in the form of initial research by the Van Alen Institute, a non-profit architecture and urbanism organisation, which was charged with coming up with proposals for healthier and more rehabilitative jail infrastructure as part of the 2017 commission. The work brought together architects, environmental psychologists, criminal justice experts, former detainees and community members from across the boroughs to help inform what a new generation of \u201cjustice hubs\u201d could be like. \u201cAccessibility came out top,\u201d says Jessica Lax, a director at the institute. \u201cRikers was totally inaccessible by design, making it very difficult for family members and lawyers to get there. Many former detainees we spoke to found the process of being taken on and off the island so horrific that they didn\u2019t want to go to court.\u201d She says smell and sound were other key factors, with Rikers known for its repulsive cocktail of urine and rotting food, and its echoing cacophony of banging and yelling. Their principles for what a decentralised jail network should look like focus on proximity to courthouses, to allow for easier due process and better access to lawyers, and emphasise improved post-release services to help former detainees return to a normal life. Crucially, the facilities can be used by both prisoners and local residents, to increase community connections and reduce the fear and stigma surrounding jails. Their proposals include dedicating multiple floors of the justice hubs to things such as libraries, community gardens, art studios, exercise facilities, medical clinics and social services \u2013 to be used at different times by both inmates and the public. It is a radical conception that could help reduce stigma and aid rehabilitation. As Jewkes puts it: \u201cSociety tends to turn prisoners into dangerous \u2018others\u2019, and prisons are shrouded in myth and mystique. We should always try to make jails feel more like part of the community. Incorporating facilities that other people could use would help to break down some of the ideas about \u2018them and us\u2019.\u201d Still, there is no guarantee that the Van Alen Institute\u2019s justice hub ideas will be taken forward. So far, the city has appointed corporate architecture giant Aecom, and consultants Hill International, to assist with developing the briefs, while detailed requests for proposals will be issued in early 2020. \u201cWe will ask for the best and most capable designers in the world,\u201d says Jamie Torres Springer, first deputy commissioner for the city\u2019s department of design and construction, insisting they will prioritise high quality design. He won\u2019t be drawn on details. \u201cWe\u2019re currently articulating our goals and converting them into guidelines for our design respondents,\u201d he says. Requests to speak to Aecom were denied. Glazer says the new prisons will be \u201ctruly civic assets, both inside and outside,\u201d with \u201ca lot of thought given to external retail space and the kind of community space that might be appropriate at each site.\u201d The Bronx site, she says, will include affordable housing too. At the rate the city\u2019s prison population is dropping, it might not be too long before the new jails are themselves converted into fortified apartment blocks.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been accused of breaking his word over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, three days before the general election The Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, said the prime minister betrayed unionist voters in Northern Ireland when he sealed a deal with the EU that would introduce a trade barrier down the Irish Sea, contrary to a personal promise he had made when he spoke at their annual conference last year. It meant the party could no longer take Johnson at his word. Foster said in future the party, if returned to Westminster, would have to check if what he said \u201cwas actually factually correct\u201d. She added: \u201cOnce bitten, twice shy, we will certainly be looking for the detail of what this [Brexit] is going to look like,\u201d Her comments put Johnson on notice once again that his Brexit deal is under threat if a hung parliament is returned on Thursday and the DUP\u2019s votes hold the balance of power. When Johnson announced his deal in October, the DUP was told by HM Revenue &amp; Customs that it would entail new checks on goods, Foster told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe asked them a number of questions on goods coming into Northern Ireland from GB, and they were very clear with us that all of the goods would have to be checked. Of course, only the goods going to Republic of Ireland would have tariffs, but that would be the default position,\u201d she said. Her comments came as a freshly leaked document, written by officials in the government\u2019s Brexit department, warns that Johnson\u2019s aim to implement his deal by the end of 2020 presents a major challenge because of the need to create new protocols and systems for business in Northern Ireland. The document, obtained by the Financial Times, claims that 98% of export businesses are \u201clikely to struggle to bear the cost\u201d of the extra paperwork, fuelling concerns of increased prices for consumers. The government dismissed a similar document leaked to the Labour party on Friday as instant analysis done when Johnson brought home his Brexit deal in October. The further document leaked to the FT over the weekend raises doubts that the new controls for Northern Ireland could be in place by the end of 2020, when Johnson pledges to have completed his exit deal The Department for Exiting the EU document was circulated last week and warns that in order to meet the December deadline, \u201cdelivery on the ground\u201d of the new protocols and systems would have to take place before officials know the outcome of the next stage of negotiations. \u201cDelivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge,\u201d it said. With three days to go until the election, the Conservative party has stuck rigidly to its claim, with the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, saying on Monday morning there would be no checks. Only a month ago, Johnson told businesses in Northern Ireland he was so sure there would be no checks and that if they got any forms they could \u201cthrow them in the bin\u201d. Foster was asked how it felt to be hailing Johnson as \u201cthe saviour of the union\u201d one moment and then for him to do a deal that her party believes is \u201cbetraying the union\u201d. \u201cI think it says more about who broke their word than me and the leadership of the unionist party,\u201d she said. On Sky News on Sunday, Johnson went so far as to say a leaked Treasury document claims by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, that exit declaration forms would be required on goods from Northern Ireland to GB were \u201cwrong\u201d. Pressed on the document stating there would be \u201cchecks both ways\u201d, Johnson said: \u201cThat\u2019s wrong because there won\u2019t be checks\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has sought to deny responsibility for long waits in A&amp;E departments amid media coverage of an NHS winter crisis by saying he leads a \u201cnew government\u201d in the last days of the election campaign. Speaking from the marginal Labour-held seat Grimsby, Johnson apologised to the family of Jack Williment-Barr, a four-year-old obliged to sleep under coats on a hospital floor in Leeds as he waited for a bed, despite having suspected pneumonia. He talked up planned new investments in the NHS, and sought to distance himself from nearly 10 years of Conservative rule, during some of which he served as foreign secretary. \u201cThis is a new government with a new approach, since I\u2019ve come in,\u201d he told LBC. \u201cWe\u2019re putting the biggest ever amount into the NHS, \u00a334bn, and we\u2019re hiring 50,000 more nurses.\u201d The 50,000 nurses figure includes the retention of 19,000 who are already employed. Asked what he would say to the boy\u2019s family, Johnson said: \u201cOf course, I sympathise very much, and I apologise to everybody who has a bad experience. By and large I think the NHS do an amazing job.\u201d Johnson started the day just after 6am at the fish market in Grimsby, a Tory target seat held by Labour\u2019s Melanie Onn with a majority of 2,565. He toured the market and watched a live auction before holding up a cod for the cameras and dragging a crate of fish across the warehouse. The PM got a mixed welcome with a number of fish wholesalers saying they were planning to vote for him but one started booing loudly. He was later due to travel to Sunderland to make a speech. While polling is consistently putting the Conservatives far enough ahead of Labour to seemingly ensure a majority, the party is stressing the need for voters to turn out. Speaking on Sky News, Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury and one of the most regular Tory spokespeople of recent weeks, rejected the idea that the party seemed well on course to win. \u201cPeople remember what happened last time around, and it is a tight election,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why the prime minister is out over these three days visiting all parts of this country.\u201d Speaking on LBC, Johnson promised to \u201cmake our case everywhere in the country\u201d, repeatedly hammering home familiar Conservative lines such as delivering Brexit, and the idea that the alternative to a Conservative government is a Labour-SNP coalition. However, he did not specifically back up a claim by the home secretary, Priti Patel, that Labour\u2019s approach to crime and policing would result in 4,000 extra violent assaults a year, as well as 52 more murders. Asked how Patel reached such figures, Johnson replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you must forgive me, I haven\u2019t been able to \u2026\u201d before trailing off. Asked if such predictions were \u201cproject fear\u201d, he said: \u201cWell, she\u2019s making a point about crime figures and the need to have robust policing. And I back that idea all the way.\u201d Elsewhere in the interview, Johnson expressed doubts about the HS2 rail project, saying he expected it to cost \u201cnorth of \u00a3100bn, probably\u201d, which was why the government had ordered a review into it. \u201cIt\u2019s only responsible to the taxpayer to ask whether it\u2019s being sensibly spent, and whether that funding is being prioritised rightly,\u201d he said. Johnson was similarly equivocal about his views on a third runway at Heathrow airport, something he himself in 2015 vowed to oppose by lying down in front of the construction bulldozers. Asked if this would happen, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t see much sign of any bulldozers yet.\u201d Pressed on the issue, Johnson added: \u201cI would have to find some way of honouring that promise. Let\u2019s wait and see when the bulldozers arrive.\u201d",

So is the speaker, a suitor well aware of the contrivance, exaggeration and contradiction of his ingenious but wobbly argument. From the moment he commands the woman in question to \u201cmark \u2026 / How little that which thou deniest me is\u201d, the reader has no doubt that the argument is one that the woman addressed will succeed in quashing \u2013 or rather squashing.</p> \n<p>The suitor\u2019s vain quest is to persuade her that he\u2019s asking nothing much of her, a thought amplified at the end of the poem, where he argues preposterously that the loss of her \u201chonour\u201d would be no more to her than the loss of blood incurred by the fleabite. Major issues are minimised, minor ones overblown. Donne\u2019s \u201cpampered\u201d flea swells with importance as well as blood, and shortly approaches godhead, as represented in the Christian concept of the holy trinity, three persons in one God. You might think the poet imagines the creature as a God-sized penis. But Donne has the science of the day to some extent on his side: conception was thought to occur through the mingling of the blood of man and woman.</p> \n<p>This idea of blood-mingling impels him to greater heights of nonsense, when he declares: \u201cThis flea is you and I, and this / Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is.\u201d The trio of overblown positive analogies (notice the \u201cI\u201d grandly substituting for the standard grammar of the accusative pronoun \u201cme\u201d) replaces the negatives \u2013 the sin, shame, and loss of maidenhead that were declared irrelevant to flea chemistry in the first stanza.</p> \n<p>The flea consolidates the union, and its shiny, armoured carapace, rather wonderfully evoked in the phrase \u201cwalls of jet\u201d, provides the new marital home. Man and wife are \u201ccloistered\u201d inside the flea, the religious symbolism expanded in the choice of verb. Holy matrimony has become a flea-shaped cathedral.</p> \n<p>Towards the end of the second stanza, the speaker seems to shift identity. We can imagine the performative backdrop, the woman teasing the speaker as she tries to catch the flea. The suitor seizes the opportunity to foresee his own \u201cdeath\u201d, observing that \u201cuse make you apt to kill me\u201d (\u201cuse\u201d here means habit). He concocts a new absurd trinity, this time, the offences the woman will commit in killing him: murder, suicide and sacrilege.</p> \n<p>There is more than poetic justice in the consummation that of course we\u2019ve guessed was coming. It happens between the end of stanza two and the beginning of three. The woman has crushed the flea, even in death a noble martyr: \u201cCruel and sudden, hast thou since / Purpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?\u201d By turning this accusation into a question, Donne nicely maintains the comic pitch.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/09/11-odes-to-europe-poets-brexit-carol-ann-duffy-andrew-mcmillan\">'Sometimes the world goes feral' \u2013 11 odes to Europe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While the woman doesn\u2019t speak in the poem, her reported comment is so plain and sensible that we\u2019re in no doubt she has won the argument. She is right in saying that the flea\u2019s death has not made any difference to either of the blood donors. The suitor\u2019s attempt to trump her argument is feeble, because the analogy is feeble: \u201cJust so much honour, when thou yield\u2019st to me, / Will waste, as this flea\u2019s death took life from thee.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the speaker had not steadily convinced us of his sense of his own absurdity, the poem would be less enjoyable. Donne was a young lawyer when he wrote it, and in building his case through exaggeration, he satirises both the ways of lawyers and the manners of suitor-poets.</p> \n<p>The movement of the argument is embodied in the structure, with those alternating tetrameter and pentameter lines depicting the contrast, perhaps, of great and small, physical and metaphysical, playfulness and mock solemnity. At first glance Donne\u2019s analogy is adventurous, but he was adding to a solid tradition: Ovid and the medieval Latin poets had already made a lively connection between <a href=\"https://www.purplemotes.net/2017/04/23/de-pulice-flea/\">fleas and sexuality</a>. A grim reality may underlie the playfulness. Fleas were a familiar, minor irritant but sometimes carried disease, including plague. They were ready symbols of the risks, as well as the pleasures, of proximity.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781784107796\">Smart Devices: 52 Poems from the Guardian Poem of the Week, edited by Carol Rumens</a>, is published by Carcanet.

This idea of blood-mingling impels him to greater heights of nonsense, when he declares: \u201cThis flea is you and I, and this / Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is.\u201d The trio of overblown positive analogies (notice the \u201cI\u201d grandly substituting for the standard grammar of the accusative pronoun \u201cme\u201d) replaces the negatives \u2013 the sin, shame, and loss of maidenhead that were declared irrelevant to flea chemistry in the first stanza. The flea consolidates the union, and its shiny, armoured carapace, rather wonderfully evoked in the phrase \u201cwalls of jet\u201d, provides the new marital home. Man and wife are \u201ccloistered\u201d inside the flea, the religious symbolism expanded in the choice of verb. Holy matrimony has become a flea-shaped cathedral. Towards the end of the second stanza, the speaker seems to shift identity. We can imagine the performative backdrop, the woman teasing the speaker as she tries to catch the flea. The suitor seizes the opportunity to foresee his own \u201cdeath\u201d, observing that \u201cuse make you apt to kill me\u201d (\u201cuse\u201d here means habit). He concocts a new absurd trinity, this time, the offences the woman will commit in killing him: murder, suicide and sacrilege. There is more than poetic justice in the consummation that of course we\u2019ve guessed was coming. It happens between the end of stanza two and the beginning of three. The woman has crushed the flea, even in death a noble martyr: \u201cCruel and sudden, hast thou since / Purpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?\u201d By turning this accusation into a question, Donne nicely maintains the comic pitch. While the woman doesn\u2019t speak in the poem, her reported comment is so plain and sensible that we\u2019re in no doubt she has won the argument. She is right in saying that the flea\u2019s death has not made any difference to either of the blood donors. The suitor\u2019s attempt to trump her argument is feeble, because the analogy is feeble: \u201cJust so much honour, when thou yield\u2019st to me, / Will waste, as this flea\u2019s death took life from thee.\u201d If the speaker had not steadily convinced us of his sense of his own absurdity, the poem would be less enjoyable. Donne was a young lawyer when he wrote it, and in building his case through exaggeration, he satirises both the ways of lawyers and the manners of suitor-poets. The movement of the argument is embodied in the structure, with those alternating tetrameter and pentameter lines depicting the contrast, perhaps, of great and small, physical and metaphysical, playfulness and mock solemnity. At first glance Donne\u2019s analogy is adventurous, but he was adding to a solid tradition: Ovid and the medieval Latin poets had already made a lively connection between fleas and sexuality. A grim reality may underlie the playfulness. Fleas were a familiar, minor irritant but sometimes carried disease, including plague. They were ready symbols of the risks, as well as the pleasures, of proximity. \u2022 Smart Devices: 52 Poems from the Guardian Poem of the Week, edited by Carol Rumens, is published by Carcanet.

And when car ownership is out of reach, too many people are cut off from the everyday realities of modern life: that you have to go beyond your immediate neighbourhood for work, social contact and a diet that does not rely on takeaways. Decent buses and trains, accessible to all, are not an option \u2013 they are a necessity. \u2022 Lynsey Hanley is a writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide",

Joe Schmidt, who stood down as the national side\u2019s head coach after the World Cup, never seemed to trust Jordan Larmour fully, certainly at full-back, but the 22-year old showed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/08/northampton-leinster-champions-cup\">Leinster\u2019s emphatic victory over Northampton</a> at Franklin\u2019s Gardens that he is ready to take over from Rob Kearney, who was among the province\u2019s replacements on Saturday. Larmour was the architect of Leinster\u2019s first two tries, showing how deadly he can be in broken play if given just a trace of time and space, and he was part of a defensive unit that prevented the Saints from turning considerable second-half pressure into points. The victory puts Leinster in charge of Pool One with Northampton\u2019s likeliest route to the quarter-finals being one of the best runners-up.

The writer and journalist Lucy Cavendish described meeting Gifford 20 years ago, describing her as \u201cmajestic, beautiful, slightly terrifying, talented, inspirational\u201d. \u201cI was in awe of her back then and that feeling never left me \u2026 she was interesting, fascinating, passionate,\u201d Cavendish wrote on Facebook. \u201cShe was magical. She will be much missed but she lives on in every single one of us who ever sat in that big top and glimpsed, even for a nanosecond, the glory of Nell Gifford.\u201d Gifford had undergone several rounds of chemotherapy for breast cancer in the last four years, but told her local paper a few months ago that doctors had given her 12 months to live after discovering it had spread to her bones and lymph nodes. Gifford had four siblings. She was close to her father Rick, a television producer, and her mother Charlotte, who had three children from her first marriage, including Emma Bridgewater, the celebrated pottery maker. She was no stranger to tragedy. Gifford was 18 and had been offered a place studying English at Oxford when Charlotte, then 52, fell from a horse while hunting and suffered a catastrophic brain injury. She never fully recovered but lived for a further 22 years needing round-the-clock care. \u201cSome people really close to me have never had a family tragedy, they\u2019ve never experienced severe loss when they were young, but that\u2019s just good luck. My sisters and I did. We lost our mum and when something like that happens you realise at what point things can go really wrong in your life,\u201d Gifford told the Guardian two years ago. Gifford took a gap year and ran away to New York, where she joined the circus. After returning to the UK to take up her studies, she then worked in various European circuses before meeting her husband, Toti, a farmer\u2019s son. The couple, who separated several years ago, set up Giffords Circus together. \u201cThe circus is my raison d\u2019\u00eatre, I suppose. This is my job and I feel lucky to have it. The circus is very therapeutic. It\u2019s a community and a really fun way of living,\u201d Gifford said. \u201cThe circus has been a great support network, especially when I\u2019ve been ill. When you walk into the tent, you leave your troubles at the door and celebrate. It\u2019s escapist, magical, beautiful, funny.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Michelle Northcote doesn\u2019t remember her paediatrician\u2019s face, but she does remember the ceiling in his office. It was covered with large tiles probably made of foam or cork-board. Each tile was large and rectangular, an off-white color flecked with grey.</p> <p>From the age of six to 13, Northcote spent a long time staring at it. Once a year, for the longest two minutes in history, she would force herself to concentrate on those tiles right after her doctor repeated the familiar phrase:</p> <p>\u201cAnd now, I have to check your hymen.\u201d</p> <p>Northcote (a pseudonym), is now 37, but \u201chymen checks\u201d as proof of virginity are still happening across the US. It\u2019s not clear exactly how common they are, since they are normally requested confidentially between a parent and a doctor. Quantifying their prevalence is therefore difficult, but a small 2017 study found that of 288 US obstetrician and gynaecologists who were asked, 45 (16%) had been asked at least once to perform virginity testing or virginity \u201crestoration\u201d. Thirteen of those doctors complied.</p> <p>Northcote, a New Yorker, recalls the check being \u201clike an awkward fingering\u201d. She never really knew why it happened \u2013 her doctor never told her. She never even realized it wasn\u2019t normal until a discussion with university friends years later. The look on their faces said everything when she shared her story \u2013 she immediately knew it shouldn\u2019t have happened.</p> <p>At first she assumed her doctor must have been a pervert. And then, after rapper TI disclosed last month that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/07/ti-rapper-daughter-hymen-check-outrage\">forces his daughter to have her hymen checked</a> every year to prove that she is a virgin, Northcote had to reconsider those visits and what they meant. </p> <p>\u201cI realized that my mother must have been asking for them, to see if I was a virgin,\u201d says Northcote. She doesn\u2019t know for sure \u2013 the relationship between the two is incredibly strained. But as a strictly conservative catholic who was obsessed with virginity, it seems about right.<br><br>Her mother\u2019s obsession with her virginity started when she was six, and continued until she was a teenager. One night, she dragged Northcote out of bed in the middle of the night to ask if she was having sex. She was so obsessed with her daughter having sex with men that she didn\u2019t even realize that her daughter was in fact a lesbian.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Despite years of research dispelling the long-held myth surrounding the hymen \u2013 that it breaks after a woman\u2019s first vaginal penetration \u2013 its power pertains.</p> <p>Its power remains even after a study from 1906 showed that a sex-worker\u2019s hymen was still intact \u2013 which should have been enough to dispel the myth. So too, should have been a 2004 study, which studied 36 pregnant women, 34 of which still had an intact hymen. Still, the myth is so compelling that people would rather believe in virgin pregnancies than facts. <br><br>The hymen, a fold of membrane at the vaginal opening, varies dramatically from woman to woman. In some women the hymen looks like a ring, in others it is crescent shaped. Some women have several holes, notches or clefts in their hymens, others have no hymen at all.</p> <p>In a TED talk called <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/nina_dolvik_brochmann_and_ellen_stokken_dahl_the_virginity_fraud?language=en#t-306566\">the virginity fraud</a>, doctors Nina D\u00f8lvik Brochmann and Ellen St\u00f8kken Dahl describe how the hymen is more like a scrunchie than a hole: \u201cIt\u2019s very elastic \u2013 for a lot of women, elastic enough to handle vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage.\u201d For many women, it doesn\u2019t break during sex. Its perforation is no sign of sexual activity, and the accompanying assumption that comes alongside it \u2013 that a virginal woman will bleed the first time she has sex \u2013 is little more than folklore.</p> <p>And yet, every year, women undergo surgery to \u201crestore\u201d their hymens. Tens of thousands of women also order fake hymen kits every year \u2013 thousands of which are in the US. The fake hymen is placed in the vagina before intercourse and spurts blood during the act. One company, HymenShop, told the Guardian it sells the most kits in California and North Carolina.</p> <p>Another Germany-based company, VirginiaCare, told the Guardian it sells thousands of kits across the US every year. Many of their customers, they say, call saying they need the fake hymen to protect themselves. Sometimes the women are virgins but want to make sure they bleed on their wedding night, fearing repercussions. Often, their partners know they plan to use the fake blood, but hitch a plan to deceive parents, who check their bedsheets after their wedding nights.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>You will never get this out of their heads.

Lindeman says that it\u2019s not the hymen kit that perpetuates the myth \u2013 it\u2019s that fact that people want to believe it.</p> <p>\u201cYou will never get this out of their heads. That\u2019s why the myth has been around for 2,000 years, that you need to be a virgin, and that you have to confirm it in this way,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Asked whether they feel a responsibility not to perpetuate lies, Lindeman says that they are providing a service: \u201cWe are just trying to help in any way and care about these girls or women. In the end, we are also saving their lives,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br><br>Dr Jennifer Gunter, a gynecologist and author of The Vagina Bible, says that \u201cthe patriarchy is invested in women holding women to biological standards that are impossible.\u201d</p> <p>That very system, she argues, ensures that women who are raped are not heard (hymen checks were, and still are, performed to determine sexual assault and rape); to mark a woman out as a man\u2019s property, and to keep women in fear of enjoying sex.</p> <p>\u201cA woman who has blood stained sheets on her wedding night has sexual trauma. But this culture implies that, as long as a woman is traumatized during her first sexual experience, then that satisfies some sort of ritual,\u201d says Gunter, adding:\u201cIt is so offensive. On a human level, and on a biological level.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437416/\">systematic review on hymen checks</a> summed up the incredibly harmful impacts of the practice.

      "bodyText": "Michelle Northcote doesn\u2019t remember her paediatrician\u2019s face, but she does remember the ceiling in his office. It was covered with large tiles probably made of foam or cork-board. Each tile was large and rectangular, an off-white color flecked with grey. From the age of six to 13, Northcote spent a long time staring at it. Once a year, for the longest two minutes in history, she would force herself to concentrate on those tiles right after her doctor repeated the familiar phrase: \u201cAnd now, I have to check your hymen.\u201d Northcote (a pseudonym), is now 37, but \u201chymen checks\u201d as proof of virginity are still happening across the US. It\u2019s not clear exactly how common they are, since they are normally requested confidentially between a parent and a doctor. Quantifying their prevalence is therefore difficult, but a small 2017 study found that of 288 US obstetrician and gynaecologists who were asked, 45 (16%) had been asked at least once to perform virginity testing or virginity \u201crestoration\u201d. Thirteen of those doctors complied. Northcote, a New Yorker, recalls the check being \u201clike an awkward fingering\u201d. She never really knew why it happened \u2013 her doctor never told her. She never even realized it wasn\u2019t normal until a discussion with university friends years later. The look on their faces said everything when she shared her story \u2013 she immediately knew it shouldn\u2019t have happened. At first she assumed her doctor must have been a pervert. And then, after rapper TI disclosed last month that he forces his daughter to have her hymen checked every year to prove that she is a virgin, Northcote had to reconsider those visits and what they meant. \u201cI realized that my mother must have been asking for them, to see if I was a virgin,\u201d says Northcote. She doesn\u2019t know for sure \u2013 the relationship between the two is incredibly strained. But as a strictly conservative catholic who was obsessed with virginity, it seems about right. Her mother\u2019s obsession with her virginity started when she was six, and continued until she was a teenager. One night, she dragged Northcote out of bed in the middle of the night to ask if she was having sex. She was so obsessed with her daughter having sex with men that she didn\u2019t even realize that her daughter was in fact a lesbian. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Despite years of research dispelling the long-held myth surrounding the hymen \u2013 that it breaks after a woman\u2019s first vaginal penetration \u2013 its power pertains. Its power remains even after a study from 1906 showed that a sex-worker\u2019s hymen was still intact \u2013 which should have been enough to dispel the myth. So too, should have been a 2004 study, which studied 36 pregnant women, 34 of which still had an intact hymen. Still, the myth is so compelling that people would rather believe in virgin pregnancies than facts. The hymen, a fold of membrane at the vaginal opening, varies dramatically from woman to woman. In some women the hymen looks like a ring, in others it is crescent shaped. Some women have several holes, notches or clefts in their hymens, others have no hymen at all. In a TED talk called the virginity fraud, doctors Nina D\u00f8lvik Brochmann and Ellen St\u00f8kken Dahl describe how the hymen is more like a scrunchie than a hole: \u201cIt\u2019s very elastic \u2013 for a lot of women, elastic enough to handle vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage.\u201d For many women, it doesn\u2019t break during sex. Its perforation is no sign of sexual activity, and the accompanying assumption that comes alongside it \u2013 that a virginal woman will bleed the first time she has sex \u2013 is little more than folklore. And yet, every year, women undergo surgery to \u201crestore\u201d their hymens. Tens of thousands of women also order fake hymen kits every year \u2013 thousands of which are in the US. The fake hymen is placed in the vagina before intercourse and spurts blood during the act. One company, HymenShop, told the Guardian it sells the most kits in California and North Carolina. Another Germany-based company, VirginiaCare, told the Guardian it sells thousands of kits across the US every year. Many of their customers, they say, call saying they need the fake hymen to protect themselves. Sometimes the women are virgins but want to make sure they bleed on their wedding night, fearing repercussions. Often, their partners know they plan to use the fake blood, but hitch a plan to deceive parents, who check their bedsheets after their wedding nights. \u201cA lot of girls tell us \u2018My husband knows I\u2019m going to use it \u2013 but we just need to be sure that there will be blood on the sheets after the wedding night\u2019,\u201d said Daniela Lindeman, a VirginiaCare spokesperson. The company knows that neither blood nor a hymen are indicative of a woman\u2019s virginity, but feel no moral obligation not to produce the product. Lindeman says that it\u2019s not the hymen kit that perpetuates the myth \u2013 it\u2019s that fact that people want to believe it. \u201cYou will never get this out of their heads. That\u2019s why the myth has been around for 2,000 years, that you need to be a virgin, and that you have to confirm it in this way,\u201d she said. Asked whether they feel a responsibility not to perpetuate lies, Lindeman says that they are providing a service: \u201cWe are just trying to help in any way and care about these girls or women. In the end, we are also saving their lives,\u201d she said. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Dr Jennifer Gunter, a gynecologist and author of The Vagina Bible, says that \u201cthe patriarchy is invested in women holding women to biological standards that are impossible.\u201d That very system, she argues, ensures that women who are raped are not heard (hymen checks were, and still are, performed to determine sexual assault and rape); to mark a woman out as a man\u2019s property, and to keep women in fear of enjoying sex. \u201cA woman who has blood stained sheets on her wedding night has sexual trauma. But this culture implies that, as long as a woman is traumatized during her first sexual experience, then that satisfies some sort of ritual,\u201d says Gunter, adding:\u201cIt is so offensive. On a human level, and on a biological level.\u201d A systematic review on hymen checks summed up the incredibly harmful impacts of the practice. In one case, an examinee had her arms broken after she \u201cfailed\u201d a test. In another case, the test resulted in suicide. Women scream, cry and faint during the tests, and reported self-hatred and loss of self-esteem following them. The fear of it alone can have disastrous consequences. Ashley Lee, 20, from Missouri, was threatened with a hymen check by her parents almost every year before she left home. It was a particular source of terror for her because she had been sexually abused by her brother\u2019s friend when she was young. \u201cI worried I was going to get in trouble for something that wasn\u2019t my fault. I felt like there\u2019d be no one there to help me, like I\u2019d be shamed what happened to me,\u201d she said during a phone interview. \u201cIt made me feel like it was my fault.\u201d In an incredible cruel twist to the story, her parents knew about the abuse, and yet continued to hang the test over her head to make sure she never felt comfortable enough to have sex under their roof. \u201cThey told me that a doctor would check my vagina and push on parts of my uterus to figure out whether I had sex or not. It terrified me,\u201d says Lee. It was enough to make her leave home aged 16, but the threat had long-lasting impacts. Perhaps contrary to what her parents intended, it made her value her body less, not more: \u201cIt made me feel like what\u2019s between my legs is what makes me who I am, that it was my worth,\u201d says Lee. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Medicine is a profession as vulnerable to dogma as any \u2013 particularly because of the lasting impact that outdated medical texts and a body of research that has historically focused on older white men continues to have. As Gunter puts it: \u201cSome dude writes something in a textbook in the 1920s and its like, goddamnit \u2013 it sticks! You have a really hard time undoing it.\u201d For the medical culture to change, something else needs to go first: sexism. \u201cYou have to remember doctors are part of society \u2013 they are all subject to prejudices and religious beliefs just like normal people are subject to,\u201d Gunter says.

At present, it is not considered medical malpractice to perform a hymen examination \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s completely legal.

      "bodyText": "Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping equal the carbon footprint of a quarter of passenger cars in Europe and stand in the way of countries reducing emissions and limiting runaway global heating, analysis reveals. Despite the scale of shipping emissions from both container and cruise ships, they are not part of emissions reduction targets made by countries as part of the Paris agreement on climate change. In France, Germany, UK, Spain, Sweden and Finland shipping emissions in 2018 were larger than the emissions from all the passenger cars registered in 10 or more of the largest cities in each country, according to the report published on Monday from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based NGO. The shipping sector emitted about 139m tonnes of CO2 in 2018 \u2013 equal to CO2 from a quarter of Europe\u2019s total passenger car fleet or 68m cars, the report, EU Shipping\u2019s Climate Record, said. Since 2015, shipping companies have had to declare data on their emissions under the EU Monitoring, Reporting and Verification Regulation (MRV). T&amp;E\u2019s report analyses the data and calculates that a container shipping operator has joined coal plants and Ryanair in the EU\u2019s list of top 10 carbon emitters. The operator \u2013 the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) \u2013 moves consumer goods, ranging from electronics and fresh fruit to clothes and toys. It was responsible for about 11m tonnes of CO2 emissions, the report claims. Faig Abbasov, shipping manager at T&amp;E, who wrote the report, said: \u201cA company that consumers have never heard of has joined the top 10 polluters list in Europe. This industry doesn\u2019t pay a cent for its carbon emissions and the EU has so far done nothing to curb its damage. European trade doesn\u2019t have to be dirty just because EU leaders have neglected to clean up shipping.\u201d MSC said: \u201cMSC operates a modern, green fleet and is investing heavily in low-carbon technologies and extensive new-build and retrofit programmes to boost performance and minimise our environmental impact.\u201d It added: \u201cMSC\u2019s fleet improvement programme has resulted in a 13% reduction in CO2 emissions per transport work in 2015-18 and will help the container shipping industry make progress towards the United Nations International Maritime Organization\u2019s (IMO) 2030 CO2 targets.\u201d The T&amp;E report said the EU had committed to \u201ceconomy-wide\u201d emissions reductions efforts by signing the Paris agreement. \u201cHowever, shipping is currently the only sector not yet contributing to the EU\u2019s emissions reduction targets and efforts,\u201d it said. Shipping emissions have risen since 1990 by about 26m tonnes of CO2, or 19%, the report says. Shipping is provided with fossil fuel subsidies under EU law of \u20ac24bn (\u00a320bn), as well as exemptions from taxes on tickets for passenger ships, VAT and corporate taxes. There are growing calls in the EU for the regulation of international shipping. The new president of the EU commission, Ursula von der Leyen, made extending the EU emissions trading scheme to maritime transport one of the top political priorities of her tenure. Abbasov said: \u201cIt\u2019s high time national leaders support President Ursula von der Leyen and the European parliament in reining in long-ignored maritime emissions. \u201cTo make shipping do its fair share, Europe must bring shipping into its carbon market and mandate CO2 standards for all ships calling at its ports.\u201d Since 2015, ships of more than 5,000 gross tonnage have had to report fuel consumption and associated CO2 emissions during voyages between the European Economic Area (EEA) ports. The T&amp;E analysis published on Monday examines the initial set of emissions reports from the data \u2013 giving for the first time a picture of shipping\u2019s carbon footprint in Europe. The report calls for the EU to impose a CO2 levy on EU shipping and calls for the setting up of a European maritime climate fund to reinvest in the sector to help it reduce its carbon footprint. It also wants shipping emissions included in the EU\u2019s 2030 reduction objective, as well as the upcoming EU 2050 decarbonisation target.",

I feel hopeless.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to other freedoms, including political expression, the voices I speak to are less optimistic. Last week when I asked the Saudi sports minister, Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal, about Amnesty International\u2019s criticisms, he replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to impose anything we can get a backlash from, that could reflect negatively around us.

Any journalist present should be questioning why Saudi women\u2019s rights activists who fought for the right to drive in Saudi Arabia remain banned from travel, on trial or behind bars.</p> <p>And when it comes to sportswashing, Human Rights Watch also has some salient advice. \u201cInstead of using sports to rehabilitate its global image, it would be cheaper and easier for Saudi Arabia to simply undertake fundamental human rights reforms and respect the basic rights of its citizens in order to improve its image and standing in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever you made of Joshua v Ruiz II coming to Diriyah, it is surely impossible to argue with that.</p>",

But socially things do seem different from in 2016, when 6,000 Saudi women responded to New York Times to outline their frustrations. The response of one 24-year-old woman was typical. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to even go to the supermarket without permission or a companion, and that\u2019s a simple thing on the huge, horrendous list of rules we have to follow,\u201d she wrote. Another was just as blunt. \u201cThe male guardianship makes my life like a hell!! We want to hang out with our friends, go and have lunch outside. I feel hopeless.\u201d When it comes to other freedoms, including political expression, the voices I speak to are less optimistic. Last week when I asked the Saudi sports minister, Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal, about Amnesty International\u2019s criticisms, he replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to impose anything we can get a backlash from, that could reflect negatively around us. But change is happening and it will come.\u201d I doubt if I could have asked such a question if I was a Saudi. After all, the regime has arrested several journalists in the past month. Another local I spoke to hoped that the lack of free speech was being used to control not only voices for democracy but powerful conservative clerics kicking up a fuss about the reforms. \u201cEventually they will have to create institutions that can govern apart from the royal family,\u201d he continued, his voice carrying more hope than expectation. For now, though, the best sport can do is shout about the issues whenever it visits countries like Saudi Arabia and China. As Human Rights Watch puts it: \u201cIncreased pressure from fans and consumers would also raise the bar for human rights.\u201d In January more than a dozen women drivers will take part in the Dakar Rally. Any journalist present should be questioning why Saudi women\u2019s rights activists who fought for the right to drive in Saudi Arabia remain banned from travel, on trial or behind bars. And when it comes to sportswashing, Human Rights Watch also has some salient advice. \u201cInstead of using sports to rehabilitate its global image, it would be cheaper and easier for Saudi Arabia to simply undertake fundamental human rights reforms and respect the basic rights of its citizens in order to improve its image and standing in the world.\u201d Whatever you made of Joshua v Ruiz II coming to Diriyah, it is surely impossible to argue with that.",

He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called \u201canos de chumbo\u201d (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happened during the dictatorship?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Supporters of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic \u201cmiracle\u201d.</p>\n    <p>It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio\u2019s Guanabara bay.</p>\n    <p>But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil\u2019s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel.</p>\n    <p>It was also a period of severe censorship.

The institution saw its budget slashed by nearly half and its financing activities have largely ground to a halt.</p> \n<p>Three of the four seats in the agency\u2019s directorial board are currently vacant, making it impossible for funding to be distributed or decisions made about future projects, said Valente, who worked there until 2016.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the most cruel and, in a way, invisible hand that is being played right now.

But the festival\u2019s fight for survival is symptomatic of a wider crisis engulfing Brazilian cinema under an ultra-conservative president who has identified the arts as a key source of opposition to his administration and declared the state has \u201cbigger priorities\u201d than culture. \u201cThe consensus is that the destruction of the Brazilian film industry is in full joyful swing by this far-right government,\u201d Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, one of Brazil\u2019s most celebrated directors, wrote on Facebook last week. \u201cWhat the government is doing is strangling Brazilian cinema,\u201d said Eduardo Valente, a film director and critic. \u201cThey are making it harder and harder for this sector to exist.\u201d Brazilian cinema \u2013 put on the map by global hits such as City of God and Aquarius \u2013 has suffered a succession of blows since Bolsonaro took office in January, from a general lack of interest in the arts to more pointed attacks on films dealing with themes such as sexual diversity and race. In September, Brazil\u2019s national cinema agency, Ancine, withdrew financial support helping film-makers promote their work at overseas festivals, affecting several works with racial and LGBTQ+ themes. Diego Paulino was among those whose funding vanished. A week before the 28-year-old was due to fly to Lisbon to promote his short film Negrum3 at an LGBTQ+ festival, Ancine withdrew the 4,600 reais (\u00a3883) grant slated to fund his trip. \u201cI was left with nothing,\u201d said Paulino, whose film deals with \u201cblackness and queerness\u201d and was produced last year with public funding. With the help of a crowdfunding campaign Paulino made it to the festival \u2013 but, to him, the government\u2019s message was clear. \u201cThey say it\u2019s about the money but we know that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about making a statement.\u201d In its most symbolic and explicit blow to the film sector, the Bolsonaro government in August also suspended a 70m reais (\u00a313.5m) public television grant scheme slated to finance several series focusing on LGBTQ+ issues, sexual diversity and race. The president personally attacked four projects earmarked for funding. \u201cIt\u2019s money thrown away,\u201d Bolsonaro said in a social media broadcast. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in making a movie with this theme.\u201d The assault on cinema exploring issues of diversity has struck a particularly sinister chord in Brazil, where censorship was a key tool of the 1964-1985 military dictatorship for which Bolsonaro often expresses admiration. Maur\u00edcio Mac\u00eado, whose project Sexo Reverso was among those lambasted by the president, believes cinema is being persecuted and has been \u201cchosen as the enemy\u201d by Bolsonaro\u2019s government. \u201cThis was undoubtedly censorship,\u201d said Mac\u00eado, whose project explores the curiosity of the Metis indigenous people in the sexual preferences of a white anthropologist studying the tribe. \u201cThe government isn\u2019t interested in discussing themes that try to give visibility to indigenous people, to LGBT people.\u201d Ancine, which many see as a crucial support structure for Brazil\u2019s nascent independent cinema, has also been dramatically weakened under Bolsonaro. The institution saw its budget slashed by nearly half and its financing activities have largely ground to a halt. Three of the four seats in the agency\u2019s directorial board are currently vacant, making it impossible for funding to be distributed or decisions made about future projects, said Valente, who worked there until 2016. \u201cThat\u2019s the most cruel and, in a way, invisible hand that is being played right now. The government is killing this industry through inaction,\u201d said Valente. \u201cBecause I\u2019m pretty convinced it\u2019s a conscious decision and not something that\u2019s just happening by chance.\u201d In an industry where long-term planning is central, the uncertainty has been crippling. Valente said the result would probably be a decline in the number of Brazilian films being produced. Ancine\u2019s gradual dismantling also poses a particular threat to independent film-makers and small production companies, said one film director who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on is going to destroy the independent film industry that was built with funding from Ancine,\u201d he said. \u201cA newcomer, someone with no experience, coming out of college \u2013 they\u2019re not going to be able to make movies anymore.\u201d Bruno Victor and Marcus Azevedo, whose project Afronte was also hit by the cancellation of the Ancine television grant, have found this out the hard way. The film-makers have yet to secure financing to produce their series. \u201cWe need public support to produce our projects because here in Brazil, it\u2019s the only option we have,\u201d said Victor, 28, whose film tells the story of a gay black man in suburban Bras\u00edlia. For many Brazilian film-makers, the future remains uncertain. Some are turning to streaming services such as Netflix for help producing work tackling LGBTQ+ issues or diversity themes. Others are leaning on more supportive municipal or state governments that still champion cinema. Others, however, are training their cameras on topics less likely to offend the government. \u201cI think we\u2019re all scared,\u201d the director said. \u201cSo we are self-censoring in the things we want to talk about \u2013 and that\u2019s the most dangerous part.\u201d This article was amended on 9 December 2019 to clarify that Ancine withdrew Diego Paulino\u2019s grant.",

For the middlemen who clean, prepare and store the creatures, the value increases to \u20ac7 a kilogram. By the time sea cucumbers enter the Chinese market, prices rocket to between $200 and $600 per kilogram.

      "bodyText": "Every night, dozens of wooden boats loaded with fishing equipment pass under the Punta Penna bridge and into the protected waters of the Mar Piccolo, a unique saltwater lagoon in the southern Italian port city of Taranto. Trawling nets, cage traps and even homemade bombs are deployed into the moonlit waters by those in search of lucrative prey. \u201cIt\u2019s like my father picking lemons and making limoncello at home,\u201d says Luciano Manna, a local activist who has been monitoring the illegal activity for five years. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy.\u201d The lagoon is so rich in biodiversity \u2013 with long-snouted seahorses, prized mussels, rare seaweeds, greater pipefish and loggerhead sea turtles among its native species \u2013 that marine biologists call it a \u201cliving eco-museum\u201d. But an organised illegal wildlife trade with links to China is quietly devastating the Mar Piccolo and many other coastal habitats across the Puglia region, with experts warning that endangered marine species are being pushed to the brink of extinction. Michele Gristina, who works for Italy\u2019s Institute for Coastal Marine Environment, has been studying the seahorses in Taranto for nearly 20 years. Once one of the largest concentrations in Europe, the seahorse population collapsed between 2016 and 2017. The only explanation, he says, is poaching. \u201cWe tried to explain it [the decline] with environmental reasons such as the spread of pollution, water temperature or oxygen depletion, but it wasn\u2019t the reason,\u201d says Gristina. \u201cPeople have seen there are a lot of seahorses and that money can be made, and they have begun to hunt them. In my opinion, seahorses along Italy\u2019s coasts are seriously endangered.\u201d In November, five people said to \u201cspecialise in the use of explosive devices\u201d were arrested by the Taranto coastguard in an operation that uncovered several kilograms of explosive material and TNT at the city\u2019s mooring dock. The previous month the coastguard seized 228 plastic buckets of sea cucumbers \u2013 weighing four tonnes \u2013 hidden in cargo ready to be shipped to Greece from Brindisi, one of the region\u2019s largest ports. \u201cThis was part of a bigger activity,\u201d says Giorgio Castronuovo, commander of the Taranto coastguard, who is leading a criminal investigation into wildlife trafficking. These were just two in a series of discoveries, despite a ban on the trade of sea cucumbers introduced in February 2018 by the ministry of agriculture, food and forestry policies that acknowledged the \u201cinvaluable\u201d role of the species in breaking down bacteria in the bio-marine system. \u201cWhat we can say is that the Italian market does not have a demand for these species, so it must be international,\u201d says Castronuovo. \u201cUntil a few years ago, there was no interest. When the demand started from abroad, fishing began.\u201d Manna, through the Italian investigation website Veraleaks, uncovered evidence that in addition to formalised trafficking transactions the species are sold on the Chinese social media site WeChat, where products are advertised as coming from \u201cItaly, the Mediterranean\u201d. They are also sold by third-party sellers, who claim to offer \u201cwild capture\u201d through online retailer Amazon. Tencent, the owner of WeChat, said in a statement: \u201cWe are vigilant against unscrupulous parties making unauthorised use of our platforms and services to pursue illegal activities. We encourage users to report illegal and inappropriate activities.\u201d A spokesperson for Amazon said: \u201cAll sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The product in question is no longer available.\u201d Authorities say that local fishermen have close ties with Chinese traffickers who transport species of seahorses and sea cucumbers in huge numbers, by air or by sea, often passing through Greece on the way to south-east Asia. The practice, they say, is happening all along the Puglia coast at fishing villages and towns. The coastguard says that on the bottom rung, local fishermen receive about \u20ac0.80 (\u00a30.70) per kilogram for sea cucumbers. For the middlemen who clean, prepare and store the creatures, the value increases to \u20ac7 a kilogram. By the time sea cucumbers enter the Chinese market, prices rocket to between $200 and $600 per kilogram. Seahorses can be worth $700 a kilogram in Asia at the end of the chain, according to the coastguard. In China many people believe seahorses are a powerful aphrodisiac. They are used in traditional medicine, to create a precious liqueur, or simply as ornaments. Sea cucumbers are consumed as food, or used for medicine and cosmetics. \u201cIt\u2019s anarchy,\u201d says Sergio Passarelli, a marine biologist at Mare per Sempre, an NGO that owns the only permit to scuba dive in the Mar Piccolo. \u201cFrom Taranto down to the Ionian Sea they fish everywhere there is sand, rocks and algae.\u201d Campaigners say they have received threats from criminal groups and are concerned about the limited efforts by authorities to thwart the trade. \u201cI have received warnings against my life for the work I do,\u201d says Manna. \u201cFishermen unload wherever they want, the fish is not checked, but weighed and sold on the black market.\u201d Rinaldo Melucci, the mayor of Taranto, says the authorities are doing all they can to tackle the problem. \u201cThe municipal administration will put any information from its current video surveillance system along the affected area at the disposal of the competent authority and is starting to strengthen this survey network, while at the same time preparing supplementary control services from the local police,\u201d he says. There are about 40 species of seahorse in the world, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and more than a quarter are considered vulnerable or endangered. An additional 17 species, including both of those found in the Mar Piccolo \u2013 the Hippocampus guttulatus and Hippocampus hippocampus \u2013 cannot be reliably classified in terms of global-level risk and are therefore listed as \u201cdata deficient\u201d. An estimated 37 million seahorses are caught each year, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora notes that they are threatened due to \u201coverfishing and unsustainable trade\u201d. Dr Miguel Correia, a Portugal-based collaborator with the international research institute Project Seahorse, who also carried out research in Taranto, warned that the trafficking network extends beyond Italy and across southern Europe. In 2017, Spanish police arrested traffickers in Cadiz in possession of more than 2,000 dried seahorses. \u201cThey are operating here in Portugal and other countries,\u201d says Correia. \u201cIf it continues they could completely disappear.\u201d This reporting was supported by the Internews Earth Journalism Network",

      "body": "<p>NFC royalty was on display Sunday as the 49ers beat the Saints on the road in a battle as enthralling <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=401127964\">as the 48-46 score suggests</a>. There were myriad lead changes, a showcase of offensive wizardry by Kyle Shanahan and Sean Payton, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/49ers/status/1203788065761705985\">a 30-yard game-winning field goal</a> by Robbie Gould as time expired.</p> <p>The 49ers are as stacked and well coached as any team in the NFL. San Francisco headed into Week 14 boasting the NFL\u2019s top defense, the second-best rushing attack and a quarterback in Jimmy Garoppolo who proved Sunday he can thrive in big moments. Now 11-2, the 49ers <em>should</em> have a viable path in the playoffs. But \u2026</p> <p>What they may get instead is a wildcard weekend matchup <em>in</em> Dallas against the putrid Cowboys who are currently 6-7, losers of three straight and poised to fire their head coach at season\u2019s end. Because the 49ers happen to share a division with the Seattle Seahawks, also one of the NFC\u2019s top three teams, San Francisco may have to travel and face a team who are only in the postseason because NFL law says someone has to win each division and that the winner of each division gets to host a playoff game (and if the Niners win the division the excellent Seahawks, who trail them by a game, may well find themselves in the same scenario).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/08/nfl-round-up-49ers-beat-saints-at-death-in-94-point-thriller\">NFL round-up: 49ers beat Saints in 94-point thriller; Chiefs gain revenge on Pats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NFC East is so dreadful this season that it is on pace to have the worst win-loss percentage of any division in NFL history. The whole division ought to be grounded for forcing NFL fans to watch their collective trainwreck, especially the Cowboys who have continued to let Jason Garrett waste talent.</p> <p>Yet despite the possibility of a team with just three losses playing on the road against a team with eight or nine losses, the NFL reconfirmed Sunday that reseeding the playoffs has <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28247371/source-reseeding-playoff-teams-never-consideration-nfl\">never been a consideration</a>. The logical solution would be to stick to the formula of six playoff teams with four division winners and two wildcard entrants <em>but </em>seed them by record. The top four teams deservedly get to host a playoff games, while the sanctity of division supremacy is protected. It\u2019s appalling that Roger Goodell, who has blathered on for years about preserving the \u201cintegrity of the NFL\u201d, won\u2019t even consider a playoff seeding upgrade that is rooted in equality.</p> <p>The reseeding idea last gained steam in the 2010 playoffs when the 7-9 Seahawks hosted, and surprisingly beat, the defending Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints, who were a wildcard team with an 11-5 record. That close contest only illustrated the importance of a home crowd.</p> <p>Who knows, perhaps the Cowboys will have the same stroke of luck. Even if the 49ers \u2013 or the Seahawks for that matter \u2013 destroy the Cowboys in January, why should a 12- or 13-win team be deprived of all the benefits that come from hosting a postseason game? For the franchise there is a nice chunk of additional revenue from tickets, merchandise and concessions, plus the greater prestige and optics which come from showing off your stadium and fanbase on a grand scale. Fans will travel well to Dallas but the potential reach is clearly not the same.</p> <p>The deepest layer of unfairness is to the 49ers season-ticket holders who have displayed unwavering loyalty while Levi\u2019s Stadium transformed from what felt like a morgue when it opened in 2014 to the raucous, filled-to-the-brim party it\u2019s been this year. Those fans deserve a home playoff game this year if the Niners continue their run of form, as do the players, coaches and everyone in the organization.</p> <p>There is no legitimate rationale for the NFL to continue the archaic seeding system. Is it laziness? Not wanting to mess with the status quo even as the outrage is rightfully swelling? Who knows, but as displayed by their respective performances this week, the idea of San Francisco having to travel to Dallas in the postseason is beyond unfair. It\u2019s utterly ridiculous.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>Matt Ryan tops 50,000 passing yards for career. </strong>The Falcons QB\u2019s fortunes have ebbed and flowed down the years but his prolific passing has never waned. Ryan hit a major milestone during a 40-20 win over the Panthers when he became the 10<sup>th</sup> player in NFL history to pass for more than 50,000 yards in a career. Ryan has been a model of passing excellence since he entered the league in 2008 and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/11237/matt-ryan\">has eclipsed 4,000 passing yards each season since 2011</a>.</p> <h2><strong>MVP of the week</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"710826c470ce17707efdde95f0f6e413cbba4811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/710826c470ce17707efdde95f0f6e413cbba4811/0_3_3968_2382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Tannehill\u2019s career has been revived in Tennessee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Tannehill\u2019s career has been revived in Tennessee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Szeto/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ryan Tannehill, QB, Tennessee Titans. </strong>Tannehill had played sound football during the Titans\u2019 three-game winning streak heading into Oakland, but Sunday\u2019s 42-21 clobbering of the Raiders on the road was a masterpiece. Tannehill\u2019s passing numbers \u2013 21-of-27 for 391 yards and three touchdowns \u2013 were higher than any put up by Marcius Mariota in his four years as the Titans starter.</p> <p>Since Tannehill took over as starter, the Titans are 6-1. They are 8-5 overall with Week 15 and 17 contests against the Texans, who have the same record, that will decide the division. A pretty remarkable comeback for Tannehill who many left for dead in Miami. Lamar Jackson continues to be the MVP frontrunner and barring catastrophe will win the award but Tannehill has played well enough to be considered a deep sleeper at this point.</p> <h2><strong>Quote of the week</strong></h2> <p><em>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to get fined\u201d</em> \u2013 the Patriots\u2019 Matthew Slater on the officiating during their loss to the Chiefs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuyBostonSports/status/1203828205414694913\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sure looks like N\u2019Keal Harry stayed in bounds... <a href=\"https://t.co/7smcOwJmjM\">pic.twitter.com/7smcOwJmjM</a></p>&mdash; Guy Boston Sports (@GuyBostonSports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuyBostonSports/status/1203828205414694913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 9, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Another week in the NFL marred by bad officiating.

      "bodyText": "NFC royalty was on display Sunday as the 49ers beat the Saints on the road in a battle as enthralling as the 48-46 score suggests. There were myriad lead changes, a showcase of offensive wizardry by Kyle Shanahan and Sean Payton, and a 30-yard game-winning field goal by Robbie Gould as time expired. The 49ers are as stacked and well coached as any team in the NFL. San Francisco headed into Week 14 boasting the NFL\u2019s top defense, the second-best rushing attack and a quarterback in Jimmy Garoppolo who proved Sunday he can thrive in big moments. Now 11-2, the 49ers should have a viable path in the playoffs. But \u2026 What they may get instead is a wildcard weekend matchup in Dallas against the putrid Cowboys who are currently 6-7, losers of three straight and poised to fire their head coach at season\u2019s end. Because the 49ers happen to share a division with the Seattle Seahawks, also one of the NFC\u2019s top three teams, San Francisco may have to travel and face a team who are only in the postseason because NFL law says someone has to win each division and that the winner of each division gets to host a playoff game (and if the Niners win the division the excellent Seahawks, who trail them by a game, may well find themselves in the same scenario). The NFC East is so dreadful this season that it is on pace to have the worst win-loss percentage of any division in NFL history. The whole division ought to be grounded for forcing NFL fans to watch their collective trainwreck, especially the Cowboys who have continued to let Jason Garrett waste talent. Yet despite the possibility of a team with just three losses playing on the road against a team with eight or nine losses, the NFL reconfirmed Sunday that reseeding the playoffs has never been a consideration. The logical solution would be to stick to the formula of six playoff teams with four division winners and two wildcard entrants but seed them by record. The top four teams deservedly get to host a playoff games, while the sanctity of division supremacy is protected. It\u2019s appalling that Roger Goodell, who has blathered on for years about preserving the \u201cintegrity of the NFL\u201d, won\u2019t even consider a playoff seeding upgrade that is rooted in equality. The reseeding idea last gained steam in the 2010 playoffs when the 7-9 Seahawks hosted, and surprisingly beat, the defending Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints, who were a wildcard team with an 11-5 record. That close contest only illustrated the importance of a home crowd. Who knows, perhaps the Cowboys will have the same stroke of luck. Even if the 49ers \u2013 or the Seahawks for that matter \u2013 destroy the Cowboys in January, why should a 12- or 13-win team be deprived of all the benefits that come from hosting a postseason game? For the franchise there is a nice chunk of additional revenue from tickets, merchandise and concessions, plus the greater prestige and optics which come from showing off your stadium and fanbase on a grand scale. Fans will travel well to Dallas but the potential reach is clearly not the same. The deepest layer of unfairness is to the 49ers season-ticket holders who have displayed unwavering loyalty while Levi\u2019s Stadium transformed from what felt like a morgue when it opened in 2014 to the raucous, filled-to-the-brim party it\u2019s been this year. Those fans deserve a home playoff game this year if the Niners continue their run of form, as do the players, coaches and everyone in the organization. There is no legitimate rationale for the NFL to continue the archaic seeding system. Is it laziness? Not wanting to mess with the status quo even as the outrage is rightfully swelling? Who knows, but as displayed by their respective performances this week, the idea of San Francisco having to travel to Dallas in the postseason is beyond unfair. It\u2019s utterly ridiculous. Stat of the week Matt Ryan tops 50,000 passing yards for career. The Falcons QB\u2019s fortunes have ebbed and flowed down the years but his prolific passing has never waned. Ryan hit a major milestone during a 40-20 win over the Panthers when he became the 10th player in NFL history to pass for more than 50,000 yards in a career. Ryan has been a model of passing excellence since he entered the league in 2008 and has eclipsed 4,000 passing yards each season since 2011. MVP of the week Ryan Tannehill, QB, Tennessee Titans. Tannehill had played sound football during the Titans\u2019 three-game winning streak heading into Oakland, but Sunday\u2019s 42-21 clobbering of the Raiders on the road was a masterpiece. Tannehill\u2019s passing numbers \u2013 21-of-27 for 391 yards and three touchdowns \u2013 were higher than any put up by Marcius Mariota in his four years as the Titans starter. Since Tannehill took over as starter, the Titans are 6-1. They are 8-5 overall with Week 15 and 17 contests against the Texans, who have the same record, that will decide the division. A pretty remarkable comeback for Tannehill who many left for dead in Miami. Lamar Jackson continues to be the MVP frontrunner and barring catastrophe will win the award but Tannehill has played well enough to be considered a deep sleeper at this point. Quote of the week \u201cI\u2019m trying not to get fined\u201d \u2013 the Patriots\u2019 Matthew Slater on the officiating during their loss to the Chiefs. Another week in the NFL marred by bad officiating. This time the Patriots were the most aggrieved in a 23-16 loss to Kansas City. Two would-be touchdowns were taken away, one on a Stephon Gilmore strip of Travis Kelce that didn\u2019t count because the official wrongly called the play dead. On the other, the officials said rookie wideout N\u2019Keal Harry stepped out of bounds at the three-yard-line when in fact it was a clear score. The Patriots were out of challenges and it wasn\u2019t a scoring play so the call stood. Both calls had an obvious impact on the final score. Yes, even the Pats are not immune. Video of the week It was fourth and two, time running out in an emotional, hard-fought battle in New Orleans. 49ers tight end George Kittle turned into a superhero and muscled his way into game-winning field-goal range. An incredible display of physicality. Elsewhere around the league -- The Baltimore Ravens won their ninth straight game, topping Buffalo 24-17. Lamar Jackson put on his usual show but it was the Ravens defense, particularly the defensive front, dominating the Bills offensive line, that was the difference. -- The Miami Dolphins followed up last week\u2019s remarkable trick play with more magic, this time from Ryan Fitzpatrick who executed a beautiful long run and lateral. Not bad for a 37-year-old quarterback on a team that is supposedly tanking. The Dolphins, however, went on to lose to the Jets 22-21. -- Devlin Hodges and the Pittsburgh Steelers continue to be a revelation. Hodges smoothly ran the Steelers offense (16-of-18, 152 yards, one touchdown, no turnovers) as Pittsburgh toppled Arizona 23-17. The Steelers are now 8-5, winners of three straight and poised for a wildcard berth in the AFC. Given what Mike Tomlin has produced without Ben Roethlisberger and following the departures of Le\u2019Veon Bell and Antonio Brown, a Coach of the Year honor seems well deserved. And if the NFL ever create an award for Best NFL QB Twitter Account, Hodges is a shoo in. -- According to Fox\u2019s Jay Glazer, Odell Beckham Jr could be one and done in Cleveland and has reportedly told opposing players and coaches throughout the year, \u201ccome get me.\u201d Beckham also revealed over the weekend that he has been playing with a painful sports hernia and will need surgery after the season. -- The Kansas City Chiefs escaped having to forfeit their game against New England after their equipment was accidentally sent to Newark, New Jersey. ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported that the equipment did arrive on time and also humorously clarified that, \u201cKansas City was responsible, not the Patriots or the league.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>1) Aston Villa\u2019s forward line needs improving in January</h2> \n<p>The difference between finishing 17th and 18th in the Premier League is often a striker who can score 10 goals a season. Aston Villa\u2019s line is being led by Wesley, a \u00a322m summer signing from Club Brugge. Thus far he has scored four goals in 16 Premier League appearances, the last coming more than two months ago. There is no doubting the Brazilian is short of confidence, not troubling Kasper Schmeichel on Sunday, but his hold-up play and lack of physicality must be a concern for Dean Smith whose reserve, Jonathan Kodjia, was deemed not worthy of replacing Wesley in Villa\u2019s thrashing. Admittedly, Leicester\u2019s defence is the best in the league but Jonny Evans and Caglar Soyuncu barely broke sweat. January is fast approaching and Smith will have to do some business to avoid the drop. Do nothing and Villa\u2019s fate could be sealed quickly. <strong>Will Unwin</strong> </p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/aston-villa-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Aston Villa 1-4 Leicester</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>2) Bournemouth up against it with back four all injured</h2> \n<p>Bournemouth are likely to face Chelsea without any of their first\u2011choice back four after Nathan Ak\u00e9 sustained a hamstring injury against Liverpool. Bournemouth\u2019s defensive frailties were exposed after Ak\u00e9, who left the stadium on crutches, was forced off 10 minutes before the interval. Steve Cook will be out for several weeks after a hand operation, while Adam Smith and Charlie Daniels are also injured. To make matters worse, Callum Wilson was also withdrawn with a suspected hamstring problem, leaving Dominic Solanke as the only fit first-team striker with Joshua King also injured. Bournemouth are on a five\u2011match losing run and Eddie Howe said: \u201cWe have players missing through injury but one result can change everything and galvanise. I believe we are good enough but we need that result quickly.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/bournemouth-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Bournemouth 0-3 Liverpool</a></em></p> \n<h2>3) Nuno needs to give his favoured players a rest</h2> \n<p>A long season could take its toll on Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo and Wolves. The head coach knows his best XI and is keen on playing it in every game, with as few changes as possible \u2013 11 Premier League games unbeaten prove it works. They have qualified from their Europa League group and are battling at the right end of the Premier League table but things are about to get more hectic as the pressure increases. There were signs of players switching off when Brighton scored twice in three minutes to turn the match around. Mental fatigue sets in quickly for players who are having to take concentration to new heights twice a week to keep Wolves at the desired level. It might be time for Nuno to have more faith in his squad \u2013 they are at home against Besiktas on Thursday \u2013 in order to achieve their long\u2011term aims. <strong>Will Unwin </strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/brighton-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Brighton 2-2 Wolves</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ce609e5c-b4e8-4cc2-ae33-61c84bde27ba\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/soZ_o6vvXkM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Lampard wants his young team to toughen up</h2> \n<p>Duncan Ferguson was so caught up in the emotion of leading Everton to victory against Chelsea that Frank Lampard was among the many he kissed after the final whistle. He gave the Chelsea manager little else on an emotional day at Goodison Park, and Lampard was quietly seething at his team\u2019s failure to match Everton\u2019s physicality, as they succumbed to a third defeat in four league games. \u201cThey have to get used to it quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou give them a tiny bit of room because of the youth of some of the team but at the same time they are not silly, they know that physical contact happens in games like this and we have to deal with it better.\u201d As for the smacker from Ferguson, Lampard took it well. \u201cI think he did, yes. But fair play, he was very in the moment and I understand how much passion he has for the club. I hate to lose but you have to give respect to someone like Duncan, because I am sure that meant a great deal to him.\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Everton 3-1 Chelsea</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/08/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-focus-europe\">Pep Guardiola and Manchester City should shift their focus to Europe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>5) Guardiola claims Manchester City are falling behind</h2> \n<p>With Manchester City 14 points behind Liverpool after this defeat Pep Guardiola admitted that maybe the side who won the past two league titles and claimed a historic domestic treble have fallen behind. \u201cUnited have the quality to defend and the quality to attack on the counterattack and you have to accept that is the level we face against United, Liverpool, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Juventus,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThat is the teams we have to face and the reality is maybe we are not able now to compete with them. So we have to improve and accept it and move forward. We are 14 points behind for the mistakes we have done, for the quality of our opponents and especially as well the things we cannot control. That is the reality but we have to continue. We are at the beginning of December and we have other competitions to play and other games to fight in.\u201d <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5e910711-0880-4306-a1fd-fcb0fda07a2d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cGI9BbMLu14?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>6) Wan-Bissaka is developing into United mainstay</h2> \n<p>Manchester United\u2019s transfer policy post-Sir Alex Ferguson has been at best opportunistic and at worst myopic. The most recent window, however, indicated a change in tack and a willingness to invest in heavily scouted young talent, particularly in the shape of Aaron Wan-Bissaka. He defends first and second, and attacks third, unlike many modern full-backs. His attitude, strength and pace all outdo his technical ability, but the number of one-on-one situations he wins is no fluke. His attacking threat is only likely to grow, given his stamina and ability to get into the right positions. United spent \u00a350m on the full-back but his rapid development suggests he can be a constant in the United side for the next decade. Wan-Bissaka should end up being fantastic value for a hierarchy lacking praise in recent years. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City 1-2 Manchester United</a></em></p> \n<h2>7) Bruce wants Ashley to drop ticket prices</h2> \n<p>A combination of industrial action on Newcastle\u2019s Metro, the demands of Christmas shopping, a cold, wet afternoon and enduring disenchantment with the club\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley, saw the crowd for Southampton\u2019s visit drop to 42,303. That is the lowest at St James\u2019 Park in the Premier League since November 2010, and 10,000 below capacity. The scores of empty grey plastic seats emphasised the shortfall. \u201cWe need to get St James\u2019 Park full again,\u201d said Steve Bruce, who advocated a cut in festive ticket prices. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for people to afford to come to the matches. Maybe the club has to try to help at this particular, difficult, time of year. Can they help our supporters when Christmas is coming? Maybe there\u2019s something we can do to get the numbers back up. But the crowd that were here were terrific, they stayed with the team.\u201d <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/newcastle-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Newcastle 2-1 Southampton</a></em></p> \n<h2>8) Wilder defends referees after VAR interference</h2> \n<p>After insisting last week that VAR was \u201csucking life\u201d out of him, Chris Wilder had enough energy left to return to the topic on Sunday. He did so in defence of referees. \u201cFor players and managers to get to the position they\u2019re in, they\u2019ve got to work hard. And so do refs and officials,\u201d he said after his side\u2019s 2-1 win against Norwich. \u201cI think [with VAR] we\u2019re doing a disservice to the officials we have in this country.\u201d The referee, Simon Hooper, certainly had a hard time of it at Carrow Road. The red card he showed to Chris Basham was reduced to a yellow by Stockley Park and a disallowed United goal subjected to a five-minute analysis (Hooper was cleared). This was far from the \u201cminimum\u201d interference that makes up VAR\u2019s motto and hardly the first time it has happened. That both sets of fans were chanting against VAR by the end should be of concern to the Premier League. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/norwich-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Norwich 1-2 Sheffield United</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bd7a45dfbc2cc02c855f16c405044aab9c5012c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bd7a45dfbc2cc02c855f16c405044aab9c5012c/0_72_3183_1909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Basham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Basham (centre) had a red card reduced to yellow by VAR.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Toth/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>9) Mourinho\u2019s front four are firing and in tune</h2> \n<p>While it would be wrong to get carried away by Tottenham\u2019s start to life under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 mainly because that is exactly what he wants \u2013 there is little doubt they have done well, especially against Burnley when Spurs delivered a stunning display capped off by a dazzling solo goal by Son Heung\u2011min. The hosts were well balanced and in tune, with the defence and two midfielders keeping their positions and looking to play sharp, forward passes to Lucas Moura, Dele Alli, Son and Harry Kane as quickly as possible. In turn they were devastating. Mourinho has clearly identified that quartet as being Tottenham\u2019s principal strength, especially on the counter-attack. So long as they are fit, in form and well serviced, the team should thrive. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong> </p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/tottenham-hotspur-burnley-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham 5-0 Burnley</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/football-club-next-manager-coaching-youth-team-premier-league-ferguson-ljungberg\">Where is your club's next manager?

A narrow 2-0 defeat against Leicester and a hard\u2011fought home draw against Crystal Palace are not incredible feats but, considering what had gone before, the duo can be very proud of their efforts in a short period of time. Mullins says he is waiting to see if the new manager, Nigel Pearson, will keep the pair on the coaching staff but it could be a wise move to create some continuity at a club which has drifted. Having the energy and novel ideas of younger coaches alongside the assistant, Craig Shakespeare, could be Pearson\u2019s smartest move to avoid more turbulence. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p>

      "bodyText": "1) Aston Villa\u2019s forward line needs improving in January The difference between finishing 17th and 18th in the Premier League is often a striker who can score 10 goals a season. Aston Villa\u2019s line is being led by Wesley, a \u00a322m summer signing from Club Brugge. Thus far he has scored four goals in 16 Premier League appearances, the last coming more than two months ago. There is no doubting the Brazilian is short of confidence, not troubling Kasper Schmeichel on Sunday, but his hold-up play and lack of physicality must be a concern for Dean Smith whose reserve, Jonathan Kodjia, was deemed not worthy of replacing Wesley in Villa\u2019s thrashing. Admittedly, Leicester\u2019s defence is the best in the league but Jonny Evans and Caglar Soyuncu barely broke sweat. January is fast approaching and Smith will have to do some business to avoid the drop. Do nothing and Villa\u2019s fate could be sealed quickly. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Aston Villa 1-4 Leicester 2) Bournemouth up against it with back four all injured Bournemouth are likely to face Chelsea without any of their first\u2011choice back four after Nathan Ak\u00e9 sustained a hamstring injury against Liverpool. Bournemouth\u2019s defensive frailties were exposed after Ak\u00e9, who left the stadium on crutches, was forced off 10 minutes before the interval. Steve Cook will be out for several weeks after a hand operation, while Adam Smith and Charlie Daniels are also injured. To make matters worse, Callum Wilson was also withdrawn with a suspected hamstring problem, leaving Dominic Solanke as the only fit first-team striker with Joshua King also injured. Bournemouth are on a five\u2011match losing run and Eddie Howe said: \u201cWe have players missing through injury but one result can change everything and galvanise. I believe we are good enough but we need that result quickly.\u201d Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 0-3 Liverpool 3) Nuno needs to give his favoured players a rest A long season could take its toll on Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo and Wolves. The head coach knows his best XI and is keen on playing it in every game, with as few changes as possible \u2013 11 Premier League games unbeaten prove it works. They have qualified from their Europa League group and are battling at the right end of the Premier League table but things are about to get more hectic as the pressure increases. There were signs of players switching off when Brighton scored twice in three minutes to turn the match around. Mental fatigue sets in quickly for players who are having to take concentration to new heights twice a week to keep Wolves at the desired level. It might be time for Nuno to have more faith in his squad \u2013 they are at home against Besiktas on Thursday \u2013 in order to achieve their long\u2011term aims. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Brighton 2-2 Wolves 4) Lampard wants his young team to toughen up Duncan Ferguson was so caught up in the emotion of leading Everton to victory against Chelsea that Frank Lampard was among the many he kissed after the final whistle. He gave the Chelsea manager little else on an emotional day at Goodison Park, and Lampard was quietly seething at his team\u2019s failure to match Everton\u2019s physicality, as they succumbed to a third defeat in four league games. \u201cThey have to get used to it quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou give them a tiny bit of room because of the youth of some of the team but at the same time they are not silly, they know that physical contact happens in games like this and we have to deal with it better.\u201d As for the smacker from Ferguson, Lampard took it well. \u201cI think he did, yes. But fair play, he was very in the moment and I understand how much passion he has for the club. I hate to lose but you have to give respect to someone like Duncan, because I am sure that meant a great deal to him.\u201d Andy Hunter \u2022 Match report: Everton 3-1 Chelsea 5) Guardiola claims Manchester City are falling behind With Manchester City 14 points behind Liverpool after this defeat Pep Guardiola admitted that maybe the side who won the past two league titles and claimed a historic domestic treble have fallen behind. \u201cUnited have the quality to defend and the quality to attack on the counterattack and you have to accept that is the level we face against United, Liverpool, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Juventus,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThat is the teams we have to face and the reality is maybe we are not able now to compete with them. So we have to improve and accept it and move forward. We are 14 points behind for the mistakes we have done, for the quality of our opponents and especially as well the things we cannot control. That is the reality but we have to continue. We are at the beginning of December and we have other competitions to play and other games to fight in.\u201d Jamie Jackson 6) Wan-Bissaka is developing into United mainstay Manchester United\u2019s transfer policy post-Sir Alex Ferguson has been at best opportunistic and at worst myopic. The most recent window, however, indicated a change in tack and a willingness to invest in heavily scouted young talent, particularly in the shape of Aaron Wan-Bissaka. He defends first and second, and attacks third, unlike many modern full-backs. His attitude, strength and pace all outdo his technical ability, but the number of one-on-one situations he wins is no fluke. His attacking threat is only likely to grow, given his stamina and ability to get into the right positions. United spent \u00a350m on the full-back but his rapid development suggests he can be a constant in the United side for the next decade. Wan-Bissaka should end up being fantastic value for a hierarchy lacking praise in recent years. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 1-2 Manchester United 7) Bruce wants Ashley to drop ticket prices A combination of industrial action on Newcastle\u2019s Metro, the demands of Christmas shopping, a cold, wet afternoon and enduring disenchantment with the club\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley, saw the crowd for Southampton\u2019s visit drop to 42,303. That is the lowest at St James\u2019 Park in the Premier League since November 2010, and 10,000 below capacity. The scores of empty grey plastic seats emphasised the shortfall. \u201cWe need to get St James\u2019 Park full again,\u201d said Steve Bruce, who advocated a cut in festive ticket prices. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for people to afford to come to the matches. Maybe the club has to try to help at this particular, difficult, time of year. Can they help our supporters when Christmas is coming? Maybe there\u2019s something we can do to get the numbers back up. But the crowd that were here were terrific, they stayed with the team.\u201d Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle 2-1 Southampton 8) Wilder defends referees after VAR interference After insisting last week that VAR was \u201csucking life\u201d out of him, Chris Wilder had enough energy left to return to the topic on Sunday. He did so in defence of referees. \u201cFor players and managers to get to the position they\u2019re in, they\u2019ve got to work hard. And so do refs and officials,\u201d he said after his side\u2019s 2-1 win against Norwich. \u201cI think [with VAR] we\u2019re doing a disservice to the officials we have in this country.\u201d The referee, Simon Hooper, certainly had a hard time of it at Carrow Road. The red card he showed to Chris Basham was reduced to a yellow by Stockley Park and a disallowed United goal subjected to a five-minute analysis (Hooper was cleared). This was far from the \u201cminimum\u201d interference that makes up VAR\u2019s motto and hardly the first time it has happened. That both sets of fans were chanting against VAR by the end should be of concern to the Premier League. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: Norwich 1-2 Sheffield United 9) Mourinho\u2019s front four are firing and in tune While it would be wrong to get carried away by Tottenham\u2019s start to life under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 mainly because that is exactly what he wants \u2013 there is little doubt they have done well, especially against Burnley when Spurs delivered a stunning display capped off by a dazzling solo goal by Son Heung\u2011min. The hosts were well balanced and in tune, with the defence and two midfielders keeping their positions and looking to play sharp, forward passes to Lucas Moura, Dele Alli, Son and Harry Kane as quickly as possible. In turn they were devastating. Mourinho has clearly identified that quartet as being Tottenham\u2019s principal strength, especially on the counter-attack. So long as they are fit, in form and well serviced, the team should thrive. Sachin Nakrani \u2022 Match report: Tottenham 5-0 Burnley 10) Continuity the key for new man Pearson In the two games Hayden Mullins and Graham Stack were in charge of Watford, they managed to create a positive atmosphere around the squad and got some desire back into a side which has been lacking it for a long time. A narrow 2-0 defeat against Leicester and a hard\u2011fought home draw against Crystal Palace are not incredible feats but, considering what had gone before, the duo can be very proud of their efforts in a short period of time. Mullins says he is waiting to see if the new manager, Nigel Pearson, will keep the pair on the coaching staff but it could be a wise move to create some continuity at a club which has drifted. Having the energy and novel ideas of younger coaches alongside the assistant, Craig Shakespeare, could be Pearson\u2019s smartest move to avoid more turbulence.

So there are no legal hurdles in not having a flushing toilet,\u201d he says. By not mixing liquid and solid waste together, \u201cthe poo is relatively dry and therefore smells a lot less than people imagine. And the volume is less than people would imagine, too. I totally appreciate that some people are not going to be comfortable [emptying their own buckets], but it\u2019s as simple as you can make it.

But thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s seemingly ceaseless trade wars this year is one of the most worrying in living memory.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the nightmare before Christmas,\u201d said Jay Foreman, chief executive of Basic Fun!</p> <p>Just days from now the Florida-based toy-maker, whose licenses include Tonka, Care Bears and Baby Shark, will learn whether or not the president will turn out to be the Grinch that stole Christmas.</p> <p>On 15 December the Trump administration is set to impose another $155bn of tariffs on Chinese-made products imported to the US. Previous rounds of tariffs have mainly hit industrial goods and America\u2019s farmers. This time the tariffs will include cellphones, laptops and tablets, office and schools supplies, Christmas ornaments, some clothing \u2013 and toys.</p> <p>Foreman is furious and he\u2019s not alone. Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Illinois-based Learning Resources, maker of hands-on educational toys like Botley the Coding Robot and Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog, can\u2019t quite believe what is happening.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s December 4 and I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m going to start paying duties at 15% in 11 days. This is incomprehensible to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m involuntarily part of a reality TV show now and I can\u2019t get off the stage. How did this happen?\u201d</p> <p>He predicts that the cost of the tariffs will wipe out all of 2019\u2019s profits and put the jobs, bonuses and raises for his staff at risk.</p> <p>Toy-making is a tough business.

      "bodyText": "For America\u2019s toy-makers the next few weeks are usually the most wonderful time of the year. But thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s seemingly ceaseless trade wars this year is one of the most worrying in living memory. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the nightmare before Christmas,\u201d said Jay Foreman, chief executive of Basic Fun! Just days from now the Florida-based toy-maker, whose licenses include Tonka, Care Bears and Baby Shark, will learn whether or not the president will turn out to be the Grinch that stole Christmas. On 15 December the Trump administration is set to impose another $155bn of tariffs on Chinese-made products imported to the US. Previous rounds of tariffs have mainly hit industrial goods and America\u2019s farmers. This time the tariffs will include cellphones, laptops and tablets, office and schools supplies, Christmas ornaments, some clothing \u2013 and toys. Foreman is furious and he\u2019s not alone. Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Illinois-based Learning Resources, maker of hands-on educational toys like Botley the Coding Robot and Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog, can\u2019t quite believe what is happening. \u201cIt\u2019s December 4 and I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m going to start paying duties at 15% in 11 days. This is incomprehensible to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m involuntarily part of a reality TV show now and I can\u2019t get off the stage. How did this happen?\u201d He predicts that the cost of the tariffs will wipe out all of 2019\u2019s profits and put the jobs, bonuses and raises for his staff at risk. Toy-making is a tough business. Margins are tight, consumers are extremely price sensitive and the toy makers are still reeling from the closure of Toys R Us, their largest year-round retailer. Trump\u2019s trade war will be the death knell for many businesses, Foreman predicts. \u201cMany companies will go out of business,\u201d he said. Messing with the toy sector isn\u2019t child\u2019s play. The industry\u2019s annual total economic impact is $110.9bn in the US and it employs 691,263 people (more than three times more than the mining industry) generating more than $35.1bn in wages and $14.98bn in taxes, according to The Toy Association, which is lobbying hard against the tariffs. Negotiations between the US and China continue and there is a possibility that the latest tariffs will be scrapped. But Trump\u2019s mercurial negotiating style has already done severe damage. In the last few weeks both sides have said talks were nearing agreement but Trump has warned he may not do a deal until after the 2020 election. The unintended consequences of the trade war are wide reaching and still being assessed economically, politically and even environmentally. In Brazil the Amazon is on fire in part because farmers are burning it to plant soy beans to sell to China, replacing US supplies now subject to tariffs. Economic growth in China has stalled. In Wisconsin, a state that helped hand Trump the White House, dairy farmers lead the nation for bankruptcies. While Trump has argued the tariffs pay for themselves by adding money to the US treasury, Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, a coalition of trade associations and agriculture commodity groups, calculates the trade war costs Americans $810 every second \u2013 more than $38bn so far. The industry is living with a sense of \u201cimpending doom\u201d, said Foreman. He compared the situation to the hurricanes that annually threaten his home state of Florida. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve got this hurricane of trade talks and friction and negotiations that have been lingering for a year or more.\u201d More infuriating still is Trump\u2019s attitude. \u201cBadly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad management,\u201d Trump tweeted in August. \u201cExcuses!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just galling coming from a guy who\u2019s bankrupted so many businesses in his career,\u201d said Foreman. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever heard a Republican president criticize small businessmen.

      "body": "<p>On clear days, Kevin Steele would peek through the cracked window of his six-by-eight foot solitary confinement cell on Rikers Island to get a glimpse of his Bronx neighbourhood and mentally escape.</p> <p>Steele was just 17 years old in June 2010 when he was brought to Rikers Island, arguably America\u2019s most notorious jail and the nation\u2019s largest penal colony. He had been arrested for his involvement in a fight and had no means to pay an assigned $85,000 bail. He spent three years at Rikers awaiting trial, 13 months of that in solitary confinement.</p> <p>\u201cThe conditions I faced on Rikers were really horrendous,\u201d says Steele. \u201cLooking out of that window was my way to survive.\u201d</p> <p>Steele is today an activist with No New Jails NYC, a grassroots prison abolitionist group formed last year that has become a major player in the campaign to close Rikers. The group has mobilised New Yorkers \u2013 including influential Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 against mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s controversial $8.7bn (\u00a36.6bn) plan to close the jail complex and replace it with four new, smaller jails in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx by 2026. More than 200 New York City public defenders have signed an <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/nnjattorneysletter\">open letter</a> stating their support for the No New Jails movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b38d2fce2be401a7fd5b69332e2ab5ad220aea41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b38d2fce2be401a7fd5b69332e2ab5ad220aea41/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Steele spent three years at Rikers awaiting trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Steele spent three years at Rikers awaiting trial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Medina</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mayor\u2019s proposal promises to reduce the city\u2019s jail population from its current level of roughly 7,000 to 3,300, the lowest in a century. No New Jails says the city could shut Rikers by banning pretrial detention, which would leave about 2,000 people in the city\u2019s remaining correctional facilities and eradicate the need to build any new jails. Subsequent phases of their <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NPW9cNv6AsbKYF_se4d8lIHQ5cyHOvOx/view\">plan</a> would close all remaining jails. The group has called for the money saved to be spent on universal housing, bail vouchers, conflict resolution and restorative justice programmes.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of conversations now about abolition that just weren\u2019t being had before,\u201d says Lauren Brooke Eisen, a senior fellow at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThe No New Jails group is forcing those conversations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e5a4601d78a4ead255adce0e30c7a4c23a55a59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e5a4601d78a4ead255adce0e30c7a4c23a55a59/0_120_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A solitary confinement cell at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A solitary confinement cell at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others have pushed back. Criticism has come both from those on the right, outraged at what they say is a plan that puts public safety at risk at a time of historically low crime in New York City, and from fellow activists on the left who, despite their own misgivings with the mayor, contend that while abolition is a commendable goal, it is not yet a realistic one.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t trust the mayor. We\u2019ve never trusted him,\u201d says Brandon Holmes, New York City Campaign Coordinator for Just Leadership USA, a national advocacy organisation which calls for cutting the US correctional population in half by 2030 and which supports De Blasio\u2019s bill. \u201cBut we recognise that it could be decades before we get another chance like this.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018You can\u2019t re-imagine prisons\u2019</h2> <p>Rikers Island, in the East River between the Bronx and Queens, is staggering in size and scope. There are 11 jails on 413 acres, holding an inmate population of 7,000 \u2013 down from a historic high of nearly 22,000 in 1991. Most inmates are at Rikers awaiting trial, unable to afford bail. The overwhelming majority are poor and disproportionally black or Latino.

      "bodyText": "On clear days, Kevin Steele would peek through the cracked window of his six-by-eight foot solitary confinement cell on Rikers Island to get a glimpse of his Bronx neighbourhood and mentally escape. Steele was just 17 years old in June 2010 when he was brought to Rikers Island, arguably America\u2019s most notorious jail and the nation\u2019s largest penal colony. He had been arrested for his involvement in a fight and had no means to pay an assigned $85,000 bail. He spent three years at Rikers awaiting trial, 13 months of that in solitary confinement. \u201cThe conditions I faced on Rikers were really horrendous,\u201d says Steele. \u201cLooking out of that window was my way to survive.\u201d Steele is today an activist with No New Jails NYC, a grassroots prison abolitionist group formed last year that has become a major player in the campaign to close Rikers. The group has mobilised New Yorkers \u2013 including influential Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 against mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s controversial $8.7bn (\u00a36.6bn) plan to close the jail complex and replace it with four new, smaller jails in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx by 2026. More than 200 New York City public defenders have signed an open letter stating their support for the No New Jails movement. The mayor\u2019s proposal promises to reduce the city\u2019s jail population from its current level of roughly 7,000 to 3,300, the lowest in a century. No New Jails says the city could shut Rikers by banning pretrial detention, which would leave about 2,000 people in the city\u2019s remaining correctional facilities and eradicate the need to build any new jails. Subsequent phases of their plan would close all remaining jails. The group has called for the money saved to be spent on universal housing, bail vouchers, conflict resolution and restorative justice programmes. \u201cThere are a lot of conversations now about abolition that just weren\u2019t being had before,\u201d says Lauren Brooke Eisen, a senior fellow at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThe No New Jails group is forcing those conversations.\u201d Others have pushed back. Criticism has come both from those on the right, outraged at what they say is a plan that puts public safety at risk at a time of historically low crime in New York City, and from fellow activists on the left who, despite their own misgivings with the mayor, contend that while abolition is a commendable goal, it is not yet a realistic one. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust the mayor. We\u2019ve never trusted him,\u201d says Brandon Holmes, New York City Campaign Coordinator for Just Leadership USA, a national advocacy organisation which calls for cutting the US correctional population in half by 2030 and which supports De Blasio\u2019s bill. \u201cBut we recognise that it could be decades before we get another chance like this.\u201d \u2018You can\u2019t re-imagine prisons\u2019 Rikers Island, in the East River between the Bronx and Queens, is staggering in size and scope. There are 11 jails on 413 acres, holding an inmate population of 7,000 \u2013 down from a historic high of nearly 22,000 in 1991. Most inmates are at Rikers awaiting trial, unable to afford bail. The overwhelming majority are poor and disproportionally black or Latino. For decades, Rikers has been synonymous with brutality. Calls to close the island complex intensified in 2015 after the death of Kalief Browder, a Bronx teenager who had been sent there accused of stealing a backpack. He spent three years on Rikers without trial \u2013 half that time in solitary confinement \u2013 and suffered beatings by inmates and jail staff. Browder took his own life at the age of 22 after struggling with severe mental health problems for two years after his release. His older brother Akeem, who runs the Kalief Browder Foundation to support youths impacted by mass incarceration, says the backpack \u201cbecame a death sentence for Kalief\u201d. \u201cThat was the calling card for everyone to wake up and say \u2018enough has been enough.\u2019\u201d Browder\u2019s family joined the Close Rikers movement and led large protests across the city. On March 31 2017, just two days before the release of a damning report on Rikers from the independent Lippman Commission, De Blasio promised to close Rikers Island within a decade. The timeline was ambitious and details vague. Two months later, he released a road map that outlined how Rikers would be replaced by the four borough-based jails. For nearly a year, Dana Kaplan studied where to build them. Kaplan, a deputy director at the Mayor\u2019s Office of Criminal Justice, recognised proximity to courthouses was the priority. \u201cWe did a pretty intensive amount of neighbourhood community engagement and focus groups,\u201d says Kaplan. \u201cWe worked to ensure that this [plan] was grounded in the feedback.\u201d The plan was also centred on decarceration, shrinking the city\u2019s jail population through a set of diversionary programmes such as supervised release. Instituted in 2016, it allows certain offenders to remain out of jail on condition they routinely meet case managers. It has been credited with a 38% reduction in the population at Rikers. Recent progressive bail reforms passed at state level in Albany \u2013 set to take effect on 1 January \u2013 allowed Kaplan to reduce the proposed inmate population further to 3,300. Although the designs of the jails remains in the planning stages, Kaplan has promised they will be \u201chumane\u201d. She says that means significant natural light in all facilities and individual cells, educational and cultural programming in every housing unit, ample outdoor recreational space and better visiting spaces for families. It also means a culture change at the troubled Department of Corrections, which will still run the jails. In September, Kaplan led a team of city officials, criminal justice advocates and former prisoners on a fact-finding mission to Europe. Most of the group\u2019s time was spent in Norway, whose correctional system has become an international model. What they found, Kaplan says, were well-designed facilities adorned with public art that provided ample mental health and educational programming and where corrections officers and inmates often got along \u2013 essentially, the antithesis of the American jail. The Department of Corrections has since formed a partnership with its Norwegian counterpart aimed at promoting culture change. No New Jails, though, argues that Kaplan\u2019s radical plan is merely cosmetic and fails to acknowledge the roots of mass incarceration in the United States that date back to slavery. \u201cYou can\u2019t re-imagine prisons,\u201d says Sophia Gurul\u00e9, a No New Jails activist. \u201cPrisons are places that were intentionally built to de-humanise people.\u201d Neighbourhoods mount fierce fightback In February 2018, the jail sites were revealed.

      "body": "<p>Apple\u2019s true wireless earbuds have gone \u201cpro\u201d and in doing so deliver on the promise of the 2017 originals. The new AirPods Pro are worth the wait.</p> <p>Apple managed two pieces of magic in 2017 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/25/apple-airpods-review-wireless-earbuds-devices\">the original \u00a3159 AirPods</a>. They just worked without the skips, blips or audio delay, and came in a tiny battery case that kept them charged and safe \u2013 a combination that competitors still find hard to match.</p> <p>But they had one big problem: no isolation from the outside world. It meant that in any noisy environment you struggled to hear your music.</p> <p>Three years later, the \u00a3249 AirPods Pro and their silicone earbud tips fix that fundamental problem, adding active noise cancelling for good measure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"916faf7b100b6bafece5d2d5701cd2e1bede2567\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/916faf7b100b6bafece5d2d5701cd2e1bede2567/631_484_3319_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"airpods pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The AirPods Pro have shorter stalks than the original AirPods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The look, feel and operation of the AirPods Pro will be familiar to anyone who has seen or used the original AirPods. Small white earbuds replete with stalks and a small flip-top white case into which they snap to store and charge.</p> <p>The stalks are a little smaller and have a squeezable control surface on them. But the biggest difference is the little silicone earbud tip that helps to block out noise.</p> <p>In true Apple fashion the ear tips aren\u2019t standard \u2013 replacements cost $4 per pair in the US but the UK cost is currently unknown. You get three sizes in the box and they are easy enough to swap between but hard to pull off by accident. There\u2019s also a fit test on the iPhone that detects if you\u2019ve got the correct size earbud with a good seal.</p> <p>At 5.4g per earbud the AirPods Pro are 1.4g heavier than the AirPods but still light and well balanced. Once inserted the AirPods Pro are some of the most comfortable and secure-fitting true wireless earbuds available rivalling Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/libratone-track-air-review-the-noise-cancelling-airpods-apple-wont-give-you\">Libratone Track Air+</a> on that front. Put them in and as long as you don\u2019t brush the stalks you\u2019ll forget there there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc858d3ac60ec048dc425e62ba595c291ffdabdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc858d3ac60ec048dc425e62ba595c291ffdabdf/715_665_3527_2117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"airpods pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The top of the case flips open to reveal the earbuds held in place by magnets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The charging case is a smidgen bigger and heavier than that of the AirPods, but that still makes it one of the smallest and best available. It fits in the money pocket of your jeans, holds the AirPods Pro tightly and the lid closes with a satisfying snap.</p> <p>The case charges via Qi wireless charging or Apple\u2019s proprietary Lightning cable. The AirPods Pro offer more than four hours of continuous listening with noise cancelling active and charge in the case about five times, with a total play time of more than 24 hours.</p> <p>While good, rivals such as the Track Air+ last for about six hours between charges with noise cancelling on. Four hours is certainly good enough for general wearing and commuting but not for long-haul flights.</p> <h2>Connectivity and controls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76b3d21112d563c0bb18e8dfbc5618a5e3bca70c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76b3d21112d563c0bb18e8dfbc5618a5e3bca70c/698_554_3599_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"airpods pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There\u2019s a fit test on the iPhone that uses the microphones within the earbuds to make sure you have a good seal with the silicone tips.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pairing is just as easy as previous versions of the AirPods. With an iPhone or iPad all you have to do is open them near the device and follow the instructions. The pairing information is then synced between all your Apple devices using iCloud, so you can seamlessly switch between an iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Mac or even Apple TV.</p> <p>They work well with non-Apple devices too, supporting the Bluetooth 5.0 standard or earlier revisions. With the earbuds in the open case, press the button on the back to pair them with anything else such as a Windows PC or Android device. But you need an Apple device to change settings and update the earbuds.</p> <p>The AirPods Pro have the same H1 chip as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/20/apple-launches-second-generation-airpods-with-wireless-charging\">AirPods 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/19/beats-powerbeats-pro-review-apple-fitness-airpods-rock\">Beats PowerBeats Pro</a>, and as such have similar bullet-proof, lag-free connectivity and the ability to share audio with other H1-supporting devices meaning two people can listen to one iPhone, iPad or Apple TV.</p> <p>New for the AirPods Pro is a pressure-detecting surface on the stalks. Squeeze the pad, rather than tap or swipe, once for pause, twice for skip forward or thrice to skip back. What felt odd to start with coming from the swipes and taps of other earbuds quickly became second nature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9d36be13b5aedde95ac5cea6aca5820b568e718\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9d36be13b5aedde95ac5cea6aca5820b568e718/664_477_3599_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"airpods pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The short stalk has a pressure-sensitive strip on the inside edge for controlling playback and noise cancelling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Squeeze and hold to either activate Siri or switch between noise control modes. By default that\u2019s straight from active noise cancelling to ambient listening mode, which lets in sound so you can hear announcements, but you can also turn both systems off too if you\u2019d prefer.</p> <p>Take one out and the music pauses (if used with an Apple device), put it back in to start again. The only thing missing is volume control, which is a shame. Apple\u2019s voice assistant can also listen out for its \u201cHey Siri\u201d wake-word via an iPhone and Siri can read out texts and iMessages, but not WhatsApps or other notifications for now.</p> <p>Settings and the fit test can be reached in the Bluetooth settings on an Apple device. But you can also switch between noise control modes in Control Centre on an iPhone or iPad by long pressing on the volume control.</p> <h2>Sound</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41bfaf585bd247550f24ad56f1961a862694f8b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41bfaf585bd247550f24ad56f1961a862694f8b2/364_839_3785_2272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"airpods pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Having a good seal with silicone tips immediately improve the sound quality of the AirPods Pro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The AirPods Pro are a step up in audio quality for Apple\u2019s own-brand headphones, which isn\u2019t a surprise as a good seal in the ear works wonders for full reproduction of sound. The earbuds produce tightly controlled, well-balanced highs and mids, with enough punch in the low end to produce a nice, rounded sound at pretty much any volume.</p> <p>They make a good go of most music genres, but those looking for real thumping basslines or who enjoy the raw energy of a thrashing guitar will have to look elsewhere. There\u2019s no equaliser either.</p> <p>As such AirPods Pro sound good \u2013 but you\u2019re not going to be discovering new nuances in your most-loved tracks in quite the same way you might with the very best-sounding headphones such as Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 or Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless.</p> <h2>Active noise cancelling</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43c579c14f2f35df275c239a77b21485aa387dd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43c579c14f2f35df275c239a77b21485aa387dd9/284_235_4437_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"airpods pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Long-press on the volume control in Control Center on the iPhone to quickly adjust noise control settings from your phone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The active noise cancelling on the AirPods Pro is surprisingly effective at reducing most background noise. It handled the majority of the day-to-day commute noise very well, and even stood up to engine drone on a long-haul flight. They weren\u2019t quite as noise deadening as the excellent Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds or full-size Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 letting a little more chatter through, but they also weren\u2019t miles off, which is remarkable given how tiny the AirPods Pro are in comparison.</p> <p>They also handle wind noise very well, which is something Sony\u2019s earbuds and many noise-cancelling over-ear headphones struggle with. Even when it\u2019s blowing a gale you can still clearly hear your music.</p> <p>Call quality was excellent, minimising background noise and coming across clearly to the other end of the call. But the AirPods Pro lack any sidetone, which is the ability to hear yourself in the call, making it hard to know whether you\u2019re shouting.</p> <h2>Unrepairable</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"43a0e698a722c82eb838aeecc9463335eceb4460\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43a0e698a722c82eb838aeecc9463335eceb4460/523_355_3797_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"airpods pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple will allow you to swap individual earbuds or the case when the battery wears out, but the devices themselves are not repairable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as the AirPods Pro work, they suffer from the same issue as any true wireless earbuds available at the moment. The case and each earbud has a non-replaceable battery that will eventually wear out. Repair gurus iFixit recently gave the AirPods Pro a <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+Pro+Teardown/127551\">repairability score of zero</a>. Apple only offers full replacements, not repairs, which makes the AirPods Pro disposable.</p> <p>The same could be said of many wireless headphones, but also for most earphones that do not have replaceable cables, which frequently break and then are simply thrown away. All of which has an environmental cost worth considering.</p> <h2>Observations</h2> <ul> <li><p>The fit test just tells you if you have a good seal, which you might get with two sizes of earbuds so best to start with the smallest</p></li> <li><p>You can activate the squeeze controls with gloves on</p></li> <li><p>The AirPods Pro are sweat resistant to IPX4 standards, which means they\u2019re fine for running or working out with</p></li> <li><p>Turning off noise cancelling frees up the bass a little at the low end</p></li> <li><p>A USB-C to Lightning cable is included in the box, but no charger</p></li> <li><p>They support AAC but not the higher-quality aptX or similar Bluetooth codecs often available on Android or Windows devices</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The AirPods Pro cost <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MWP22ZM/A/airpods-pro\">\u00a3249</a> in the UK or <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP22AM/A/airpods-pro\">$249</a> in the US.</p> <p>For comparison, the standard AirPods cost <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MV7N2ZM/A/airpods-with-charging-case\">\u00a3159</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/libratone-track-air-review-the-noise-cancelling-airpods-apple-wont-give-you\">Libratone Track Air+</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07SP524XM/\">\u00a3179</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-updated-noise-cancelling-earbuds-sound-great\">Sony WF-1000XM3</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/sony-wf-1000xm3-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-bluetooth-nfc-in-ear-headphones-with-mic-remote/black/p4237421\">\u00a3199</a>, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost <a href=\"https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/truewireless-details\">\u00a3280</a>, the B&amp;O E8 2.0 cost <a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bang-olufsen.com%2Fen%2Fearphones%2Fbeoplay-e8&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-updated-noise-cancelling-earbuds-sound-great\">\u00a3300</a> and the Master &amp; Dynamic MW07 cost <a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fmw07-true-wireless-earphones&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/sony-wf-1000xm3-review-updated-noise-cancelling-earbuds-sound-great\">\u00a3279</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The AirPods Pro are a triumph for Apple.

      "bodyText": "Apple\u2019s true wireless earbuds have gone \u201cpro\u201d and in doing so deliver on the promise of the 2017 originals. The new AirPods Pro are worth the wait. Apple managed two pieces of magic in 2017 with the original \u00a3159 AirPods. They just worked without the skips, blips or audio delay, and came in a tiny battery case that kept them charged and safe \u2013 a combination that competitors still find hard to match. But they had one big problem: no isolation from the outside world. It meant that in any noisy environment you struggled to hear your music. Three years later, the \u00a3249 AirPods Pro and their silicone earbud tips fix that fundamental problem, adding active noise cancelling for good measure. The look, feel and operation of the AirPods Pro will be familiar to anyone who has seen or used the original AirPods. Small white earbuds replete with stalks and a small flip-top white case into which they snap to store and charge. The stalks are a little smaller and have a squeezable control surface on them. But the biggest difference is the little silicone earbud tip that helps to block out noise. In true Apple fashion the ear tips aren\u2019t standard \u2013 replacements cost $4 per pair in the US but the UK cost is currently unknown. You get three sizes in the box and they are easy enough to swap between but hard to pull off by accident. There\u2019s also a fit test on the iPhone that detects if you\u2019ve got the correct size earbud with a good seal. At 5.4g per earbud the AirPods Pro are 1.4g heavier than the AirPods but still light and well balanced. Once inserted the AirPods Pro are some of the most comfortable and secure-fitting true wireless earbuds available rivalling Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds and Libratone Track Air+ on that front. Put them in and as long as you don\u2019t brush the stalks you\u2019ll forget there there. The charging case is a smidgen bigger and heavier than that of the AirPods, but that still makes it one of the smallest and best available. It fits in the money pocket of your jeans, holds the AirPods Pro tightly and the lid closes with a satisfying snap. The case charges via Qi wireless charging or Apple\u2019s proprietary Lightning cable. The AirPods Pro offer more than four hours of continuous listening with noise cancelling active and charge in the case about five times, with a total play time of more than 24 hours. While good, rivals such as the Track Air+ last for about six hours between charges with noise cancelling on. Four hours is certainly good enough for general wearing and commuting but not for long-haul flights. Connectivity and controls Pairing is just as easy as previous versions of the AirPods. With an iPhone or iPad all you have to do is open them near the device and follow the instructions. The pairing information is then synced between all your Apple devices using iCloud, so you can seamlessly switch between an iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Mac or even Apple TV. They work well with non-Apple devices too, supporting the Bluetooth 5.0 standard or earlier revisions. With the earbuds in the open case, press the button on the back to pair them with anything else such as a Windows PC or Android device. But you need an Apple device to change settings and update the earbuds. The AirPods Pro have the same H1 chip as the AirPods 2 and Beats PowerBeats Pro, and as such have similar bullet-proof, lag-free connectivity and the ability to share audio with other H1-supporting devices meaning two people can listen to one iPhone, iPad or Apple TV. New for the AirPods Pro is a pressure-detecting surface on the stalks. Squeeze the pad, rather than tap or swipe, once for pause, twice for skip forward or thrice to skip back. What felt odd to start with coming from the swipes and taps of other earbuds quickly became second nature. Squeeze and hold to either activate Siri or switch between noise control modes. By default that\u2019s straight from active noise cancelling to ambient listening mode, which lets in sound so you can hear announcements, but you can also turn both systems off too if you\u2019d prefer. Take one out and the music pauses (if used with an Apple device), put it back in to start again. The only thing missing is volume control, which is a shame. Apple\u2019s voice assistant can also listen out for its \u201cHey Siri\u201d wake-word via an iPhone and Siri can read out texts and iMessages, but not WhatsApps or other notifications for now. Settings and the fit test can be reached in the Bluetooth settings on an Apple device. But you can also switch between noise control modes in Control Centre on an iPhone or iPad by long pressing on the volume control. Sound The AirPods Pro are a step up in audio quality for Apple\u2019s own-brand headphones, which isn\u2019t a surprise as a good seal in the ear works wonders for full reproduction of sound. The earbuds produce tightly controlled, well-balanced highs and mids, with enough punch in the low end to produce a nice, rounded sound at pretty much any volume. They make a good go of most music genres, but those looking for real thumping basslines or who enjoy the raw energy of a thrashing guitar will have to look elsewhere. There\u2019s no equaliser either. As such AirPods Pro sound good \u2013 but you\u2019re not going to be discovering new nuances in your most-loved tracks in quite the same way you might with the very best-sounding headphones such as Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 or Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless. Active noise cancelling The active noise cancelling on the AirPods Pro is surprisingly effective at reducing most background noise. It handled the majority of the day-to-day commute noise very well, and even stood up to engine drone on a long-haul flight. They weren\u2019t quite as noise deadening as the excellent Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds or full-size Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 letting a little more chatter through, but they also weren\u2019t miles off, which is remarkable given how tiny the AirPods Pro are in comparison. They also handle wind noise very well, which is something Sony\u2019s earbuds and many noise-cancelling over-ear headphones struggle with. Even when it\u2019s blowing a gale you can still clearly hear your music. Call quality was excellent, minimising background noise and coming across clearly to the other end of the call. But the AirPods Pro lack any sidetone, which is the ability to hear yourself in the call, making it hard to know whether you\u2019re shouting. Unrepairable As well as the AirPods Pro work, they suffer from the same issue as any true wireless earbuds available at the moment. The case and each earbud has a non-replaceable battery that will eventually wear out. Repair gurus iFixit recently gave the AirPods Pro a repairability score of zero. Apple only offers full replacements, not repairs, which makes the AirPods Pro disposable. The same could be said of many wireless headphones, but also for most earphones that do not have replaceable cables, which frequently break and then are simply thrown away. All of which has an environmental cost worth considering. Observations The fit test just tells you if you have a good seal, which you might get with two sizes of earbuds so best to start with the smallest You can activate the squeeze controls with gloves on The AirPods Pro are sweat resistant to IPX4 standards, which means they\u2019re fine for running or working out with Turning off noise cancelling frees up the bass a little at the low end A USB-C to Lightning cable is included in the box, but no charger They support AAC but not the higher-quality aptX or similar Bluetooth codecs often available on Android or Windows devices Price The AirPods Pro cost \u00a3249 in the UK or $249 in the US. For comparison, the standard AirPods cost \u00a3159, the Libratone Track Air+ cost \u00a3179, Sony WF-1000XM3 cost \u00a3199, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost \u00a3280, the B&amp;O E8 2.0 cost \u00a3300 and the Master &amp; Dynamic MW07 cost \u00a3279. Verdict The AirPods Pro are a triumph for Apple. They\u2019re small, comfortable, last long enough for most listening sessions, slot into an unrivalled truly-pocketable case and \u2013 finally \u2013 offer not only proper noise isolation thanks to silicone tips, but also surprisingly effective active noise cancellation. They have the same magic that makes the standard AirPods effortless to use, particularly with Apple\u2019s devices. They simply work, even with Android or Windows machines. Sure, they\u2019re expensive, and they don\u2019t quite reach the exquisite audio highs of Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 while letting a little more chatter through the noise cancelling. But they\u2019re tiny by comparison, more comfortable to wear and have a case you can fit in the money pocket of your jeans - a convenience that simply can\u2019t be underestimated. The biggest issue you might face with the AirPods Pro is actually getting hold of a set, as of the time of writing they\u2019re sold out until January. Pros: secure fit, comfortable, rock-solid connectivity, good sound, great noise cancelling, sweat resistant, seamless connection between multiple Apple devices, works with Android and Windows, excellent case, wireless charging, good call quality Cons: expensive, no on-earbud volume control, no settings on Android/Windows, not repairable, stalks, only available in white Other reviews Best true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra and Anker compared and ranked Beats PowerBeats Pro review: Apple\u2019s fitness AirPods rock Libratone Track Air+ review: the noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won\u2019t give you Sony WF-1000XM3 review: updated noise-cancelling earbuds sound great",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson defended those who opposed gay people joining the military and the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet being arrested, in the latest controversial comments unearthed from his time as a journalist.</p> <p>In articles written when he was in his mid-30s, the prime minister also wrote that the police had been cowed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">the Macpherson report</a> \u2013 which found that the Metropolitan police were institutionally racist \u2013 and claimed that officers were too busy on \u201cracial awareness programmes\u201d to respond to crime reports.</p> <p>Johnson has been repeatedly criticised for statements he made during his career as a columnist, writer and editor, including referring to black people as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/07/boris-johnson-history-of-apologies-controversy-burqa-comments\">\u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d</a> and arguing that Islam has caused the Muslim world to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/boris-johnson-islam-muslim-world-centuries-behind-2007-essay\">\u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d the west</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/pms-single-mother-remarks-disgusting-says-angela-rayner\">Last week</a> he was condemned by the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner \u2013 who had her first baby at 16 \u2013 for once writing that single mothers were to blame for \u201cproducing a generation of ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI might be the shadow education secretary, but inside I\u2019m that 16-year-old that didn\u2019t think I was worth anything,\u201d Rayner said. \u201cAnd people like him make women who are already vulnerable feel that they\u2019re the problem. They\u2019re not the problem.\u201d</p> <p>In the most recently discovered comments, written in the Spectator magazine in 1999, Johnson said: \u201cAcross the country, there are many Tories who wish their party leadership would speak up more strongly against, say, gays in the military, or the cowing of the police by the Macpherson report, or the arrest of General Pinochet, or the impending abolition of the oath and the cap badge of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary], or the abolition of the hereditary peers and foxhunting. They are, of course, right.\u201d</p> <p>The Macpherson report, produced following the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993, sparked a debate about racism in policing.</p> <p>In a column in the Daily Telegraph in 2000, Johnson wrote that the reason why police were unable to investigate crime was because they were \u201cstuck on racial awareness programmes; or deployed in desperate attempts to catch paedophiles in ancient public schools; or lurking in lay-bys in the hope of penalising a motorist; or perhaps preparing for the great moment when they will be able to arrest anyone who allows his dogs to chase rabbits, let alone those who go foxhunting.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the comments, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was clear the prime minister was \u201ca deeply unpleasant individual\u201d and \u201ca danger to our country\u201d. \u201cThe more we learn, the worse it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a danger to women, to single mothers, the working class, minorities, LGBT+ people, and to anyone who doesn\u2019t look like him. He thinks he is born to rule and stands against everything that holds our communities together.\u201d</p> <p>During a special edition of the BBC\u2019s Question Time in November, audience members pressed Johnson on whether his writings had fuelled racism. The prime minister said he had \u201cgenuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody\u201d, but defended his right to \u201cspeak out\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you go through all my articles with a fine-tooth comb and take out individual phrases, there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive, and of course I understand that,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson defended those who opposed gay people joining the military and the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet being arrested, in the latest controversial comments unearthed from his time as a journalist. In articles written when he was in his mid-30s, the prime minister also wrote that the police had been cowed by the Macpherson report \u2013 which found that the Metropolitan police were institutionally racist \u2013 and claimed that officers were too busy on \u201cracial awareness programmes\u201d to respond to crime reports. Johnson has been repeatedly criticised for statements he made during his career as a columnist, writer and editor, including referring to black people as \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d and arguing that Islam has caused the Muslim world to be \u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d the west. Last week he was condemned by the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner \u2013 who had her first baby at 16 \u2013 for once writing that single mothers were to blame for \u201cproducing a generation of ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children\u201d. \u201cI might be the shadow education secretary, but inside I\u2019m that 16-year-old that didn\u2019t think I was worth anything,\u201d Rayner said. \u201cAnd people like him make women who are already vulnerable feel that they\u2019re the problem. They\u2019re not the problem.\u201d In the most recently discovered comments, written in the Spectator magazine in 1999, Johnson said: \u201cAcross the country, there are many Tories who wish their party leadership would speak up more strongly against, say, gays in the military, or the cowing of the police by the Macpherson report, or the arrest of General Pinochet, or the impending abolition of the oath and the cap badge of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary], or the abolition of the hereditary peers and foxhunting. They are, of course, right.\u201d The Macpherson report, produced following the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993, sparked a debate about racism in policing. In a column in the Daily Telegraph in 2000, Johnson wrote that the reason why police were unable to investigate crime was because they were \u201cstuck on racial awareness programmes; or deployed in desperate attempts to catch paedophiles in ancient public schools; or lurking in lay-bys in the hope of penalising a motorist; or perhaps preparing for the great moment when they will be able to arrest anyone who allows his dogs to chase rabbits, let alone those who go foxhunting.\u201d Responding to the comments, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was clear the prime minister was \u201ca deeply unpleasant individual\u201d and \u201ca danger to our country\u201d. \u201cThe more we learn, the worse it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a danger to women, to single mothers, the working class, minorities, LGBT+ people, and to anyone who doesn\u2019t look like him. He thinks he is born to rule and stands against everything that holds our communities together.\u201d During a special edition of the BBC\u2019s Question Time in November, audience members pressed Johnson on whether his writings had fuelled racism. The prime minister said he had \u201cgenuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody\u201d, but defended his right to \u201cspeak out\u201d. \u201cIf you go through all my articles with a fine-tooth comb and take out individual phrases, there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive, and of course I understand that,\u201d he said.",

Mooketsi Kgosibodiba, a bricklayer, had been on death row since 2017 after strangling his employer in a row over stolen cement. Last week the government made the unexpected announcement that he had been hanged in Gaborone central prison. It was the first execution since October\u2019s presidential elections and Botswana is the only country in southern Africa still consistently executing people, bucking regional and global trends, according to Amnesty International. Amnesty has joined Botswana\u2019s human rights lawyers and the EU in calling on President Mokgweetsi Masisi to revoke capital punishment. Before the death of Kgosibodiba, two others were hanged in Botswana in 2018. Amnesty has said that executions are often undertaken without prior notice, with families of those convicted only notified after execution. Internationally, Botswana stands out for its strong economy and stable democracy, with Masisi enforcing progressive new amendments and reforms within the country. But Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International\u2019s regional director for southern Africa, said that \u201cby signing Kgosibodiba\u2019s death warrant, newly elected President Mokgweetsi Masisi has missed an opportunity to immediately demonstrate strong leadership by abolishing the death penalty\u201d.

Lloyd (also named in the case as Efrem Lloyd) and his partner Vanessa Hunter are being sued by their former friend and business partner Cheryl Conway for $600,000 she invested between 2013 and 2015 to establish the Lupunaluz Foundation and build the Lupunaluz Retreat in Peru. The federal court heard on Monday in the opening argument from Conway\u2019s barrister, Harry Forrester, that Conway had become friends with Lloyd and Hunter after meeting them in 2012. They developed a plan for the retreat, with Conway to invest money, while Lloyd and Hunter would provide the 129-hectare land they owned in Peru for the eco-resort, Forrester said.

      "body": "<h2>Spiritual gifts<br></h2> <p>There are many more amazing churches and spiritual spots to visit than just the incredible cathedral with its 157-metre twin spires, one of Germany\u2019s most famous and visited buildings. For example, <strong>Melaten-Friedhof</strong> is among the most beautiful cemeteries in Europe, set in a huge park with wonderful trees and plants that attract lots of birds. It is 20 minutes\u2019 walk east of Br\u00fcsseler Platz, in the Lindenthal district, and was modelled on Paris\u2019s P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery. It has some beautiful tombs from the early 19th century to the present day \u2013 especially on Millionaire Avenue, where the city\u2019s wealthiest inhabitants were buried.</p> <p>There are 12 <strong>Romanesque churches</strong> in Cologne. Wherever you walk in the centre you\u2019ll come across at least one. For me the most fascinating is the <strong>Basilica of St Ursula</strong>, close to the main train station. Make sure to see the Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber), where the walls are decorated with an enormous mosaic made of thousands of human bones and skulls. According to one legend, these are the bones of 11,000 virgins killed because they refused to marry the Huns. It\u2019s an impressive place, both cruel and beautiful. Also worth visiting is <strong>St Peter\u2019s</strong>, close to main shopping street (Schildergasse), which has a huge painting by Peter Paul Rubens, and an altar by 20th-century sculptor Eduardo Chillida.</p> <h2>The Belgian Quarter</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fc356a20153761eee7babeb46a278a213be7abb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fc356a20153761eee7babeb46a278a213be7abb/0_74_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Br\u00fcsseler Platz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Br\u00fcsseler Platz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The district I\u2019ve lived and worked in for 30 years, Belgisches Viertel (the Belgian Quarter), has evolved over the decades from calm and residential to hip neighbourhood with little coffee bars, restaurants and creative stores. The heart of the quarter is <strong>Br\u00fcsseler Platz</strong>, where K\u00f6lsch, a typical Cologne beer served in 200ml glasses (about a third of a pint), flows abundantly, especially on summer evenings. Right on the square is <strong><a href=\"http://hallmackenreuther.d.dom.de/\" title=\"\">Hallmackenreuther</a></strong>, a 1970s-style coffee bar serving breakfast and snacks during the day that turns into a trendy bar in the evening.

There\u2019s also a restaurant serving light and healthy dishes. The building is strikingly beautiful, and large parts of the original decor remain, giving the changing rooms a special flair. The historic sauna is wonderful, as is the <strong>Emperor\u2019s Bath</strong> (Kaiserbad), in which you can drift along to underwater music.

Close to Br\u00fcsseler Platz, it serves the city\u2019s various subcultures well and has an unpretentious and friendly atmosphere. In addition to secondhand clothing, you can also find backpacks, trinkets and books, and small collections from local designers who print T-shirts, upcycle clothes from old shirts, and produce leather accessories from scraps.<br>\u2022 <em>Br\u00fcsseler Strasse 72, <a href=\"http://todd-the-shop.com/\" title=\"\">todd-the-shop.com</a></em></p> <h2>The art of books</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cb4b0419c4e5532f2959979420db0c3151e5942\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cb4b0419c4e5532f2959979420db0c3151e5942/0_73_4008_2404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buchhandlung Walther Koenig bookshop in Cologne, Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A wonderful bookstore, and an institution in Cologne when it comes to art books, is the three-floor <strong>Buchhandlung Walther K\u00f6nig</strong>. I can stay in there for hours looking at all the tomes on architecture, film, design, fashion and art. It\u2019s not only of interest for art lovers, but a paradise for lovers of beautifully made books on all subjects. The founder, Walther K\u00f6nig, and his son, Franz, are often in the shop and very approachable, and the ever-changing decorated store-window is regularly curated by artists.<br>\u2022 <em>Ehrenstra\u00dfe 4, <a href=\"https://www.buchhandlung-walther-koenig.de/koenig2/index.php?mode=display&amp;showcase=1&amp;old_search=false\" title=\"\">buchhandlung-walther-koenig.de</a></em></p> <h2>Gallery hopping</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a010bf6d767d0d0f36f7160a30910d337f17ff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a010bf6d767d0d0f36f7160a30910d337f17ff1/0_0_2480_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Galerie Gisela Capitain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Galerie Gisela Capitain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cologne has had a lively gallery scene since the 1960s. Two I recommend are <strong><a href=\"https://www.galeriecapitain.de/\">Galerie Gisela Capitain</a></strong>,<strong> </strong>just around the corner from Buchhandlung K\u00f6nig, which holds the estate of Martin Kippenberger in her spacious rooms, and <strong><a href=\"https://www.galeriebuchholz.de/\">Galerie Buchholz</a></strong>, hidden behind an antiquarian bookstore, where spacious rooms exhibit internationally established artists such as Isa Genzken and Anne Imhof. Younger galleries such as <strong><a href=\"http://ginervagambino.com/\" title=\"\">Ginerva Gambino</a></strong> or <strong><a href=\"http://www.drei.cologne/\" title=\"\">Raum Drei</a></strong> promote emerging talent. Most of these spaces are in the centre of Cologne. My favourite newer gallery is <strong><a href=\"https://jan-kaps.com/\" title=\"\">Jan Kaps</a></strong>, which represents a younger generation of international artists in a variety of media, from painting and conceptual art to photography, video and sculpture, as well as hosting lectures. Kaps also has two smaller galleries on the same street (J\u00fclicherstrasse).</p> <h2>Eastern influence</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"755fd8acc05a44b9189d2b8997d4ac479a20e5b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/755fd8acc05a44b9189d2b8997d4ac479a20e5b8/0_9_5315_3190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Museum of Eastern Arts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The <strong><a href=\"https://museum-fuer-ostasiatische-kunst.de/Collection\">Museum of East Asian Arts</a> </strong>(Museum fuer Ostasiatische Kunst), on the edge of the Aachener Weiher lake, is about 15 minutes\u2019 walk from Melaten cemetery, but still within the green belt. It\u2019s one of the smaller museums, and rather quiet, which is why it\u2019s so special. The 1970s red-brick building was built by Japanese architect Kunio Maekawa, a student of Le Corbusier. The collection is comprehensive, with furniture, woodcuts, utensils, lacquer work, painting, sculpture and much more from China, Korea and Japan, some pieces from early as the 15th century. At the centre of the complex is the beautiful Japanese meditation garden, which fits perfectly with the serenity of the museum. After visiting the collection, stop in the museum cafe, Schmitz, which is run by one of the top restaurateurs in Cologne. From the terrace, you can enjoy the best ice-cream in Cologne with views of the lake.<br>\u2022 <em>Permanent collection \u20ac6/\u20ac3.50, closed Mondays, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 100, <a href=\"https://museum-fuer-ostasiatische-kunst.de/Start\" title=\"\">museum-fuer-ostasiatische-kunst.de</a></em></p> <h2>Out of town</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f874964867765678f70a464463e18f53f090c26f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f874964867765678f70a464463e18f53f090c26f/0_307_4609_2766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruder Klaus Feldkapelle near Cologne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Around 45 minutes\u2019 drive, or train journey (to Satzvey station), south of the city, in the middle of a field in Mechernich, is the <strong>Bruder-Klaus-Feldkapelle</strong>, a small chapel designed (between 2005 and 2007) by the great Swiss architect <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/106352/bruder-klaus-field-chapel-peter-zumthor\" title=\"\">Peter Zumthor</a>, who also designed the famous Kolumba diocesan museum incentral Cologne. The interior is made of over 100 spruce trunks in a wigwam shape, covered in concrete and then set on fire to leave a sombre interior of charred wooden remains. The top of the chapel has been left open so that sunshine and rain alike fall into the otherwise dark space. It\u2019s a very peaceful place.<br>\u2022 <em>Open 10am-5pm in summer and 10am-4pm in winter, closed Mondays except on religious holidays, <a href=\"https://www.feldkapelle.de/\" title=\"\">feldkapelle.de</a></em></p> <h2>Jazz bar</h2> <p>Close to Barbarossaplatz is the cosy <strong>Metronom bar</strong>, which has been open for 50 years now and immediately transports you to another time. Rather than pretending to be hip and cool, it feels authentic and unique, with shelves full of old jazz vinyl that are played on the venue\u2019s record player. The furniture is also old, as are the yellowed photos of jazz legends on the walls, though you don\u2019t have to be a jazz aficionado to love this wonderful and atmospheric pub.<br>\u2022 <em>Weyerstrasse 59, on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/metronom/\" title=\"\">Facebook</a></em></p> <h2>Soul food</h2> <p>A five-minute walk from Br\u00fcsseler Platz is my favourite new restaurant, <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Br%C3%BCx-Freshfood/1734846386606258\" title=\"\">Br\u00fcx</a></strong>, which serves what it calls freshly cooked \u201csoul food\u201d \u2013 salads, pasta, potatoes with delicious toppings.

      "bodyText": "Spiritual gifts There are many more amazing churches and spiritual spots to visit than just the incredible cathedral with its 157-metre twin spires, one of Germany\u2019s most famous and visited buildings. For example, Melaten-Friedhof is among the most beautiful cemeteries in Europe, set in a huge park with wonderful trees and plants that attract lots of birds. It is 20 minutes\u2019 walk east of Br\u00fcsseler Platz, in the Lindenthal district, and was modelled on Paris\u2019s P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery. It has some beautiful tombs from the early 19th century to the present day \u2013 especially on Millionaire Avenue, where the city\u2019s wealthiest inhabitants were buried. There are 12 Romanesque churches in Cologne. Wherever you walk in the centre you\u2019ll come across at least one. For me the most fascinating is the Basilica of St Ursula, close to the main train station. Make sure to see the Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber), where the walls are decorated with an enormous mosaic made of thousands of human bones and skulls. According to one legend, these are the bones of 11,000 virgins killed because they refused to marry the Huns. It\u2019s an impressive place, both cruel and beautiful. Also worth visiting is St Peter\u2019s, close to main shopping street (Schildergasse), which has a huge painting by Peter Paul Rubens, and an altar by 20th-century sculptor Eduardo Chillida. The Belgian Quarter The district I\u2019ve lived and worked in for 30 years, Belgisches Viertel (the Belgian Quarter), has evolved over the decades from calm and residential to hip neighbourhood with little coffee bars, restaurants and creative stores. The heart of the quarter is Br\u00fcsseler Platz, where K\u00f6lsch, a typical Cologne beer served in 200ml glasses (about a third of a pint), flows abundantly, especially on summer evenings. Right on the square is Hallmackenreuther, a 1970s-style coffee bar serving breakfast and snacks during the day that turns into a trendy bar in the evening. Popular with artists and musicians, it has retro furniture, huge windows overlooking the square and a striking six-metre neon ballerina on one wall. Bath house On a rainy day I like to go to art nouveau Neptunbad, a public bath built in 1912 that now offers indoor and outdoor saunas, pools, relaxation areas and a Japanese garden. There\u2019s also a restaurant serving light and healthy dishes. The building is strikingly beautiful, and large parts of the original decor remain, giving the changing rooms a special flair. The historic sauna is wonderful, as is the Emperor\u2019s Bath (Kaiserbad), in which you can drift along to underwater music. The rest is very modern, with an Asian aesthetic. \u2022 Admission from \u20ac19.50 for two hours, Neptunplatz 1, neptunbad.de Upcycled heaven If you love fashion from the 1970s, 80s and 90s, head for the vintage shop Todd. Close to Br\u00fcsseler Platz, it serves the city\u2019s various subcultures well and has an unpretentious and friendly atmosphere. In addition to secondhand clothing, you can also find backpacks, trinkets and books, and small collections from local designers who print T-shirts, upcycle clothes from old shirts, and produce leather accessories from scraps. \u2022 Br\u00fcsseler Strasse 72, todd-the-shop.com The art of books A wonderful bookstore, and an institution in Cologne when it comes to art books, is the three-floor Buchhandlung Walther K\u00f6nig. I can stay in there for hours looking at all the tomes on architecture, film, design, fashion and art. It\u2019s not only of interest for art lovers, but a paradise for lovers of beautifully made books on all subjects. The founder, Walther K\u00f6nig, and his son, Franz, are often in the shop and very approachable, and the ever-changing decorated store-window is regularly curated by artists. \u2022 Ehrenstra\u00dfe 4, buchhandlung-walther-koenig.de Gallery hopping Cologne has had a lively gallery scene since the 1960s. Two I recommend are Galerie Gisela Capitain, just around the corner from Buchhandlung K\u00f6nig, which holds the estate of Martin Kippenberger in her spacious rooms, and Galerie Buchholz, hidden behind an antiquarian bookstore, where spacious rooms exhibit internationally established artists such as Isa Genzken and Anne Imhof. Younger galleries such as Ginerva Gambino or Raum Drei promote emerging talent. Most of these spaces are in the centre of Cologne. My favourite newer gallery is Jan Kaps, which represents a younger generation of international artists in a variety of media, from painting and conceptual art to photography, video and sculpture, as well as hosting lectures. Kaps also has two smaller galleries on the same street (J\u00fclicherstrasse). Eastern influence The Museum of East Asian Arts (Museum fuer Ostasiatische Kunst), on the edge of the Aachener Weiher lake, is about 15 minutes\u2019 walk from Melaten cemetery, but still within the green belt. It\u2019s one of the smaller museums, and rather quiet, which is why it\u2019s so special. The 1970s red-brick building was built by Japanese architect Kunio Maekawa, a student of Le Corbusier. The collection is comprehensive, with furniture, woodcuts, utensils, lacquer work, painting, sculpture and much more from China, Korea and Japan, some pieces from early as the 15th century. At the centre of the complex is the beautiful Japanese meditation garden, which fits perfectly with the serenity of the museum. After visiting the collection, stop in the museum cafe, Schmitz, which is run by one of the top restaurateurs in Cologne. From the terrace, you can enjoy the best ice-cream in Cologne with views of the lake. \u2022 Permanent collection \u20ac6/\u20ac3.50, closed Mondays, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 100, museum-fuer-ostasiatische-kunst.de Out of town Around 45 minutes\u2019 drive, or train journey (to Satzvey station), south of the city, in the middle of a field in Mechernich, is the Bruder-Klaus-Feldkapelle, a small chapel designed (between 2005 and 2007) by the great Swiss architect Peter Zumthor, who also designed the famous Kolumba diocesan museum incentral Cologne. The interior is made of over 100 spruce trunks in a wigwam shape, covered in concrete and then set on fire to leave a sombre interior of charred wooden remains. The top of the chapel has been left open so that sunshine and rain alike fall into the otherwise dark space. It\u2019s a very peaceful place. \u2022 Open 10am-5pm in summer and 10am-4pm in winter, closed Mondays except on religious holidays, feldkapelle.de Jazz bar Close to Barbarossaplatz is the cosy Metronom bar, which has been open for 50 years now and immediately transports you to another time. Rather than pretending to be hip and cool, it feels authentic and unique, with shelves full of old jazz vinyl that are played on the venue\u2019s record player. The furniture is also old, as are the yellowed photos of jazz legends on the walls, though you don\u2019t have to be a jazz aficionado to love this wonderful and atmospheric pub. \u2022 Weyerstrasse 59, on Facebook Soul food A five-minute walk from Br\u00fcsseler Platz is my favourite new restaurant, Br\u00fcx, which serves what it calls freshly cooked \u201csoul food\u201d \u2013 salads, pasta, potatoes with delicious toppings. The prices are low, between \u20ac5 and \u20ac10 to take away, but you can also eat in. From the outside, it\u2019s rather inconspicuous and small, but the chic-casual interior is decorated with secondhand furniture, ceramic tiles and industrial lighting. And you can look directly into the open kitchen where the food, usually organic and regional, is being prepared. \u2022 Br\u00fcsseler Stra\u00dfe 44, on Facebook When to go Cologne has loads of events all year round, but there are a few special times \u2013 not least the rambunctious carnival, which includes several days of costume parades, songs and beer (20-28 February). Art Cologne, involving 180 galleries (23-26 April 2020), is one of the world\u2019s oldest fairs for modern and contemporary art, and Sommer K\u00f6ln features concerts, theatre and more in July and August. Where to stay Smarty hotel (doubles from \u20ac98 room-only) has cool pods and dorms. The new 25 Hours The Circle (doubles from \u20ac139 room-only) has playfully upbeat rooms and a buzzy restaurant.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison\u2019s decision to abolish four federal departments in a massive public sector restructure was not canvassed in the Thodey review of the public service, a department secretary has said. Instead submissions by federal departments called for a relaxation of staffing caps and rules that demand offsets before they undertake new spending, with these policies blamed for spiralling consultant costs and a lack of investment in systems such as IT. The departments also highlighted the importance of the public service\u2019s role in delivering advice to government, in marked contrast to Morrison\u2019s view that its primary role was service delivery. On Thursday Morrison announced a major shake-up of the public service, a week before the government was expected to release its response to the review led by David Thodey, commissioned by Morrison\u2019s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. The restructure abolishes four departments and results in five departmental secretaries being sacked: Kerri Hartland, Ren\u00e9e Leon, Mike Mrdak, Daryl Quinlivan and Heather Smith. Mrdak, the head of the communications and arts department, told staff he was first informed of the changes on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the department of human services said its secretary, Renee Leon, also found out on Wednesday. One department secretary has confirmed to Guardian Australia that portfolio restructures were not raised in the Thodey review in multiple rounds of consultation. In a March 2019 issues paper, the Thodey review revealed it was considering calling for greater checks and balances on the termination and appointment of secretaries, and believed a \u201ccodified process\u201d for appointments and clear criteria for performance were needed. Government sources said Morrison plans to announce further changes consolidating the number of government agencies and proposing more investment in information technology systems. In its Thodey review submission, the agriculture and water department blamed underinvestment for the poor state of IT systems, warning the department \u201clags in digital transformation and the technical capabilities needed to keep pace with developments in agricultural industries\u201d. \u201cIt is not seen to be possible to fund the necessary level of investment within the current budget rules and processes, and the current arrangements require that we keep old systems operating or apply Band-Aid solutions beyond their natural lives,\u201d it said. The current funding level \u201cdoes not generate the step change in investment the department requires to overcome historical investment deficits and the absence of a financial model to support sufficient system investment\u201d. The home affairs department agreed that long-term investment was \u201champered by the short-term nature of the budget process\u201d. \u201cThe current approach to four-year budget estimates, coupled with the election cycle, inhibits APS agencies from building a case for significant long-term reform, and securing long-term funding to support it,\u201d it said. \u201cCurrent budget process operational rules require agencies to identify offsets for new proposals, even where there is no corresponding saving, or where the work is to address a specific risk that has been identified. \u201cChanges should be considered to the way departments manage risk, procurement rules, and the appropriation of funds for development work.\u201d The Nine newspapers have reported that Australia\u2019s Border Force cut patrols to achieve budget savings which were approved by minister Peter Dutton. In 2014 Morrison, then immigration minister, announced the creation of the home affairs mega-department, a move which the Australian National Audit Office later found failed to bring the budget savings it promised and was beset by poor record-keeping and high turnover. But the home affairs department submitted to the Thodey review that its creation from six original agencies was a success due to \u201cstrongly defined governance structures\u201d such as updated delegations. It suggested the review could \u201c[learn and adapt] its example more broadly across the for future machinery of government changes\u201d. The home affairs department also submitted that \u201cresponsibility for developing policy advice to government should remain a core role of the APS\u201d. In August Morrison warned public servants that they must be \u201can enabler of government policy not an obstacle\u201d and that once the government sets its policy direction he \u201cexpects them to get on and deliver it\u201d. Several departments called for greater flexibility in the average staffing level cap applied across the public service. The infrastructure department said the cap \u201cis a good discipline on recruitment\u201d but had also increased the use of labour-hire contractors, which cost \u201caround 40% more than permanent staffing\u201d and caused a loss of corporate knowledge when they leave. The home affairs department suggested \u201cmore flexibility and devolved authority to agencies to manage average staffing levels\u201d within certain budget limits would help \u201cmore optimally meet the demands of growth in workload, [and] deliver programs with improved services\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018You see that grey building?\u201d Leslie Ash says. We are standing at the window of her central London penthouse. \u201cThat\u2019s Charing Cross hospital. Now, see that bit sticking out on the left? That was my room, on the top floor.\u201d In 2004, Ash spent nearly three months there, recovering from the superbug methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), a variant of MRSA, perhaps watching her old life out of the window and wondering if she would ever get it back.</p> <p>She had contracted the infection from a different hospital, the Chelsea and Westminster \u2013 she believes from an epidural needle \u2013 after being admitted with cracked ribs, and for weeks it was unclear whether she would walk again. Her husband, the former footballer Lee Chapman, and her two sons, were warned that she might die. It must be strange to have her near-death experience perpetually hovering out of the corner of her eye. \u201cYes,\u201d she says mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shadow in the background there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShadow\u201d is an understatement, because although Ash walks well, darting around the living room in trainers or sitting as upright as a dancer on one of her enormous sofas, her ordeal, and her recovery, are never out of sight. She was 44 when she was admitted to hospital, still best recognised as the perkily luscious Debs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/03/men-behaving-badly-how-tony-betrayal-killed-the-flatshare-bromance\">in the BBC sitcom Men Behaving Badly</a>. At 59, she still looks perky, but with the slightly skittish movements of a creature emerging from an unscheduled hibernation.</p> <p>\u201cI really feel like I\u2019ve lost 10 years out of my life,\u201d she tells me as we sit down. In the years that followed her illness, Ash underwent endless physiotherapy, pilates and workouts, and swore off alcohol, but the doctors \u201ckept upping the doses of painkillers until I actually felt like a bit of a zombie,\u201d she says. It was her son Max who told her: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re slurring!\u2019... I thought: \u2018God, this is terrible! What can I do?\u2019 When you\u2019re on those pills, they are antidepressants, you don\u2019t feel any emotion at all.\u201d</p> <p>So two years ago she came off all medication. With her brain firing again, she has \u201cwoken up, like a film, like a dream\u201d. The duration of the dream appears to be as hazy as the outline of Charing Cross hospital, because sometimes Ash says it lasted eight years, sometimes 10. This feeling of having been dormant seems to have embedded itself in Ash\u2019s mind as a reality rather than a metaphor, because next time she refers to the experience, she says simply: \u201cAfter I woke up \u2026\u201d</p> <p>And what happened after she awoke was that Ash found herself locked out of an unrecognisable industry. She had spent years broadening her range of movement, regaining her balance, waking<strong> </strong>her nerves \u2013 they grow 1mm a month, she says, giving the impression that she watched them daily. She devoted herself to her physical recovery, and wrote monologues she hoped to perform but would struggle to remember. But when she tried to find work, she was hit with a fresh and unexpected disorientation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e03f5fc555c7eb8009e8ea8af6e9db67c02bb4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e03f5fc555c7eb8009e8ea8af6e9db67c02bb4e/0_87_2112_1267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Morrissey, Leslie Ash, Caroline Quentin and Martin Clunes in Men Behaving Badly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">(From left) Neil Morrissey, Leslie Ash, Caroline Quentin and Martin Clunes in Men Behaving Badly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan O\u2019Sullivan/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll doors were shut. All doors were shut.\u201d She says it twice as if they are rebounding in her face. \u201cWhen I was doing Men Behaving Badly, people were asking: \u2018Can you endorse this? Would you like this job?\u2019 I was inundated,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In those days, she says, if someone broke a leg during filming, the director would say: \u201cLet\u2019s shoot around it!\u201d So while she recovered, she thought, \u201cquite pretentiously, I suppose, that my career would carry on. They would just \u2018shoot around it\u2019. But in fact, I was quite amazed at how I got dropped. Completely. It was just ... it was quite suffocating,\u201d she says with a small gasp. \u201cIt\u2019s like the rug being brought up from beneath your feet. No one wants to know you ... I thought, I have to start again.\u201d</p> <p>It was in this spirit of a personal reset that Ash was browsing Spotlight, the casting platform, when she noticed an ad for a trailer for a pilot for a possible show. The person who posted the advert, Elaine Sturgess, is the writer of Gin and It, a short film that Ash liked the sound of, and which the two women have now made. They got on so well, they have launched a new venture, <a href=\"https://booksoffice.com/\" title=\"\">BooksOffice</a>, a website that allows users to vote on which unpublished or self-published books Ash and Sturgess should try to bring to the screen. They have meetups for authors and actors at the bar Ash and Chapman own in Clapham, south London \u2013 once her parents\u2019 painting and decorating shop; Michelle Collins is among those to have come along.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone wants content,\u201d Ash says, and of course she herself wants work, and BooksOffice can provide her with parts, and the chance to move into production or direction. All of this makes sense, but has it really been so hard to find work that she has had to devise a way to make it for herself?</p> <p>Did industry friends not check up on her, to make sure that she was OK? She gives a small laugh. \u201cErm. No. Not really. I can count on one hand how many people checked in. No. I was quite remote. I think a lot of people thought: \u2018Give her space to sort herself out.\u2019 And then years turned into a decade.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it comes from me as well,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just couldn\u2019t find a way of doing it.\u201d She would phone people up and say: \u201cHi, what are you doing? Let\u2019s meet for lunch!\u201d But when she got there, she couldn\u2019t push past the pleasantries. They would say: \u201cIt was lovely to see you. You\u2019re looking really well,\u201d she says sadly<strong>.</strong> \u201cYou go through a grieving process when you\u2019ve lost your career. You know. And it can catch you at moments where you just feel like shit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0fdde56b4b410cd97dc59344e7e6d94825c88f15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fdde56b4b410cd97dc59344e7e6d94825c88f15/0_262_2512_1507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Phil Daniels in Quadrophenia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Phil Daniels in Quadrophenia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Curbishley-Baird/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ash has recently played a small part in <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/leslie-ash-toyah-wilcox-reprise-20467351\" title=\"\">To Be Someone</a>, a film inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/sep/10/how-we-made-quadrophenia-by-phil-daniels-and-leslie-ash\">Who classic Quadrophenia, in which she starred at 18</a>, back in the days when she was buzzing around town in her little white Mini, smoking Consulates and imagining the life that lay ahead. So why can\u2019t she get it back?</p> <p>During the course of the afternoon she offers at least half a dozen explanations. She still attends auditions, but is \u201ccrap at doing self-tapes\u201d, a requirement for many roles. Being older means there are fewer parts for her, while having a disability places her in two overlapping categories of discrimination. You would think that the experience of swerving death and adapting to a hugely altered body must have added to her emotional range as an actor. \u201cThat was my thought,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is a very difficult business. If you\u2019re not the whole package, they just choose someone else. It\u2019s as brutal as that.\u201d</p> <p>Social media may also have contributed to her exclusion, and to combat this she has joined Instagram \u201cat the grand age of 59\u201d. She has only been on it a week and already got 70 followers, she says, sounding chuffed. \u201cI\u2019m actually very proud of that.\u201d</p> <p>She has a vague sense that during all those dormant years no one wanted to interrupt her. Which is funny since she was so desperate for someone or something to break the spell. I can\u2019t work out whether Ash thinks people didn\u2019t know how tough her recovery was, and that\u2019s why they left her alone, or if she thinks they did know, and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t approach her. \u201cYou know what, no one likes to speak to people when they\u2019re not doing well,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cWell, when you\u2019re not in the limelight any more, it\u2019s true. People don\u2019t particularly care.\u201d</p> <p>In 2006, Ash was awarded \u00a35m compensation from the NHS for loss of earnings following her MSSA ordeal. The lawyers came up with the figure, she says, and if anything her loss has probably been greater. For years, her accountancy bill exceeded her salary. But the payout outraged parts of the media. The Daily Mail headlined with \u201cThe \u00a35m trout pout\u201d, a reference to the swelling of Ash\u2019s lips caused by fillers she had in 2002. (The News of the World coined the phrase \u201ctrout pout\u201d in her honour, but the subject is off-limits for Ash, who will only say: \u201cIt is very much in the past.\u201d)</p> <p>\u201cI was quite amazed \u2013 they made me feel like I\u2019d won the lottery,\u201d Ash says. \u201cI felt that was probably the reason why I wasn\u2019t working. Because I think people thought I was putting it on.\u201d There is a pause. The sun has set while we\u2019ve been chatting, and her face is harder to read in the dark. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f037872d880ba272dd15b7b91cea2691cab8c8f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f037872d880ba272dd15b7b91cea2691cab8c8f5/0_0_2796_1862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Lee Chapman in 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Lee Chapman in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Ash has made a remarkable physical recovery, there is one issue that she has never been able to fully resolve. When she contracted MSSA, she was in hospital with two broken ribs, having fallen out of bed during \u201cenergetic lovemaking\u201d with Chapman. (This was at 7am after an all-night bender.)</p> <p>Chapman was later arrested on suspicion of assault, but never charged. Ash\u2019s sister subsequently claimed that Ash was a victim of domestic abuse. Ash and Chapman have always denied this claim. The sisters remain estranged.</p> <p>Chapman, who is downstairs in the apartment while Ash and I talk, had previously been arrested in 1997, when he pursued Ash, after an argument, to the home of her Men Behaving Badly co-star Caroline Quentin. He was arrested after trying to kick down Quentin\u2019s door. Ash took out an injunction against him but they quickly reconciled, and the injunction was dropped.</p> <p>At the time of those incidents, Ash and Chapman\u2019s marriage was routinely described as \u201ctempestuous\u201d or \u201cturbulent\u201d. Ash doesn\u2019t like these words. She prefers passionate. \u201cPassion, passion \u2026 Absolute passion!\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a person who walks out and slams the door. Always have been, always will be.\u201d</p> <p>She has spoken in the past about the time she chipped Chapman\u2019s teeth, when she threw a phone at him during one row. Indeed, some reviewers of her 2007 autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2224804.My_Life_Behaving_Badly\" title=\"\">My Life Behaving Badly</a>, objected to the degree of responsibility she took for problems within their relationship. But Ash says now that she did so because \u201cI didn\u2019t want everyone to think about Lee being a bad person. Because, no, it takes two to argue.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t help thinking that some people\u2019s suspicion that Ash was the victim of assault added an additional dimension to her recovery. She was suspected of suffering in silence, when silence is seen as weak or disobliging, and she was denigrated for it, her denials distrusted. And all this despite the fact that there has never been proof that an assault took place. \u201cNo!\u201d she says. \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing there!\u201d</p> <p>She and Chapman have been married for nearly 32 years. \u201cWe\u2019re growing old together,\u201d Ash says. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. We\u2019re just like the same person sometimes. I know what he\u2019s thinking. I can finish his sentences. I can be somewhere, walking the dog, and suddenly he\u2019ll come running past. I\u2019ve got this sense that he\u2019s always there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bec8a618b39647e860c19a2e6bac9d68e86fbc53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bec8a618b39647e860c19a2e6bac9d68e86fbc53/190_2159_4967_6204/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lesley Ash in November.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lesley Ash in November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wonder how Ash feels about the #MeToo movement, which draws its strength from women speaking out and the tendency sometimes now to see a person who chooses silence as irresponsible.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what worries me about social media,\u201d Ash says. \u201cEveryone is in this frame of mind that they have to tell everything. With #MeToo I can understand completely about horrible things that women have gone through ... But I just don\u2019t want women to lose their empowerment.\u201d She seems to be saying that talking frankly about a violent experience can be a double-edged sword. \u201cBecause it can make women look terribly weak. And at the moment we are trying to be strong. But at the same time you don\u2019t want to let people get away with it,\u201d she says. \u201cSo therefore I do agree with the #MeToo movement. But ... people have to be careful, and make sure that stories are told the right way.\u201d</p> <p>She herself, she says, feels stronger now than at any point in her life. \u201cI\u2019ve found my voice the older I\u2019ve got.\u201d In the 90s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/18/how-we-made-men-behaving-badly\">when she was filming Men Behaving Badly</a>, she mostly sat and listened on set. \u201cI was terrified that if I said anything, they wouldn\u2019t find it funny at all.\u201d</p> <p>And although in her 40s, in the aftermath of the MSSA, she dreaded ageing, now that her 60s are looming, the number doesn\u2019t seem so bad. In any case, she works out four times a week, \u201cand I know I can keep my face toned\u201d. She runs her fingers down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m going in certain areas. But I think you\u2019ve just got to take a deep breath,\u201d she says, exhaling heavily, \u201cand just go with it.\u201d</p> <p>So she isn\u2019t scared of the big number? \u201cNo,\u201d she says, and immediately adds, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Because my mum died at 68. So I\u2019ve got that feeling of: \u2018Oh God, have I only got eight years? So that\u2019s a thing.\u201d Maybe her mum is on her mind, because when she goes to the bar in Clapham, which was her parents\u2019 old shop, Ash can picture her there, sitting on her stool, with a photo of Ash by the counter. \u201cI\u2019d like to live,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou know. I just don\u2019t know whether I will.\u201d</p> <p>Ash believes she is a better actor now \u2013 all she needs is the chance. \u201cBut I am going to do it again,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if I have to make the shows myself.\u201d</p> <p><em>For more information, visit booksoffice.com</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018You see that grey building?\u201d Leslie Ash says. We are standing at the window of her central London penthouse. \u201cThat\u2019s Charing Cross hospital. Now, see that bit sticking out on the left? That was my room, on the top floor.\u201d In 2004, Ash spent nearly three months there, recovering from the superbug methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), a variant of MRSA, perhaps watching her old life out of the window and wondering if she would ever get it back. She had contracted the infection from a different hospital, the Chelsea and Westminster \u2013 she believes from an epidural needle \u2013 after being admitted with cracked ribs, and for weeks it was unclear whether she would walk again. Her husband, the former footballer Lee Chapman, and her two sons, were warned that she might die. It must be strange to have her near-death experience perpetually hovering out of the corner of her eye. \u201cYes,\u201d she says mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shadow in the background there.\u201d \u201cShadow\u201d is an understatement, because although Ash walks well, darting around the living room in trainers or sitting as upright as a dancer on one of her enormous sofas, her ordeal, and her recovery, are never out of sight. She was 44 when she was admitted to hospital, still best recognised as the perkily luscious Debs in the BBC sitcom Men Behaving Badly. At 59, she still looks perky, but with the slightly skittish movements of a creature emerging from an unscheduled hibernation. \u201cI really feel like I\u2019ve lost 10 years out of my life,\u201d she tells me as we sit down. In the years that followed her illness, Ash underwent endless physiotherapy, pilates and workouts, and swore off alcohol, but the doctors \u201ckept upping the doses of painkillers until I actually felt like a bit of a zombie,\u201d she says. It was her son Max who told her: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re slurring!\u2019... I thought: \u2018God, this is terrible! What can I do?\u2019 When you\u2019re on those pills, they are antidepressants, you don\u2019t feel any emotion at all.\u201d So two years ago she came off all medication. With her brain firing again, she has \u201cwoken up, like a film, like a dream\u201d. The duration of the dream appears to be as hazy as the outline of Charing Cross hospital, because sometimes Ash says it lasted eight years, sometimes 10. This feeling of having been dormant seems to have embedded itself in Ash\u2019s mind as a reality rather than a metaphor, because next time she refers to the experience, she says simply: \u201cAfter I woke up \u2026\u201d And what happened after she awoke was that Ash found herself locked out of an unrecognisable industry. She had spent years broadening her range of movement, regaining her balance, waking her nerves \u2013 they grow 1mm a month, she says, giving the impression that she watched them daily. She devoted herself to her physical recovery, and wrote monologues she hoped to perform but would struggle to remember. But when she tried to find work, she was hit with a fresh and unexpected disorientation. \u201cAll doors were shut. All doors were shut.\u201d She says it twice as if they are rebounding in her face. \u201cWhen I was doing Men Behaving Badly, people were asking: \u2018Can you endorse this? Would you like this job?\u2019 I was inundated,\u201d she says. In those days, she says, if someone broke a leg during filming, the director would say: \u201cLet\u2019s shoot around it!\u201d So while she recovered, she thought, \u201cquite pretentiously, I suppose, that my career would carry on. They would just \u2018shoot around it\u2019. But in fact, I was quite amazed at how I got dropped. Completely. It was just ... it was quite suffocating,\u201d she says with a small gasp. \u201cIt\u2019s like the rug being brought up from beneath your feet. No one wants to know you ... I thought, I have to start again.\u201d It was in this spirit of a personal reset that Ash was browsing Spotlight, the casting platform, when she noticed an ad for a trailer for a pilot for a possible show. The person who posted the advert, Elaine Sturgess, is the writer of Gin and It, a short film that Ash liked the sound of, and which the two women have now made. They got on so well, they have launched a new venture, BooksOffice, a website that allows users to vote on which unpublished or self-published books Ash and Sturgess should try to bring to the screen. They have meetups for authors and actors at the bar Ash and Chapman own in Clapham, south London \u2013 once her parents\u2019 painting and decorating shop; Michelle Collins is among those to have come along. \u201cEveryone wants content,\u201d Ash says, and of course she herself wants work, and BooksOffice can provide her with parts, and the chance to move into production or direction. All of this makes sense, but has it really been so hard to find work that she has had to devise a way to make it for herself? Did industry friends not check up on her, to make sure that she was OK? She gives a small laugh. \u201cErm. No. Not really. I can count on one hand how many people checked in. No. I was quite remote. I think a lot of people thought: \u2018Give her space to sort herself out.\u2019 And then years turned into a decade.\u201d \u201cI think it comes from me as well,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just couldn\u2019t find a way of doing it.\u201d She would phone people up and say: \u201cHi, what are you doing? Let\u2019s meet for lunch!\u201d But when she got there, she couldn\u2019t push past the pleasantries. They would say: \u201cIt was lovely to see you. You\u2019re looking really well,\u201d she says sadly. \u201cYou go through a grieving process when you\u2019ve lost your career. You know. And it can catch you at moments where you just feel like shit.\u201d Ash has recently played a small part in To Be Someone, a film inspired by the Who classic Quadrophenia, in which she starred at 18, back in the days when she was buzzing around town in her little white Mini, smoking Consulates and imagining the life that lay ahead. So why can\u2019t she get it back? During the course of the afternoon she offers at least half a dozen explanations. She still attends auditions, but is \u201ccrap at doing self-tapes\u201d, a requirement for many roles. Being older means there are fewer parts for her, while having a disability places her in two overlapping categories of discrimination. You would think that the experience of swerving death and adapting to a hugely altered body must have added to her emotional range as an actor. \u201cThat was my thought,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is a very difficult business. If you\u2019re not the whole package, they just choose someone else. It\u2019s as brutal as that.\u201d Social media may also have contributed to her exclusion, and to combat this she has joined Instagram \u201cat the grand age of 59\u201d. She has only been on it a week and already got 70 followers, she says, sounding chuffed. \u201cI\u2019m actually very proud of that.\u201d She has a vague sense that during all those dormant years no one wanted to interrupt her. Which is funny since she was so desperate for someone or something to break the spell. I can\u2019t work out whether Ash thinks people didn\u2019t know how tough her recovery was, and that\u2019s why they left her alone, or if she thinks they did know, and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t approach her. \u201cYou know what, no one likes to speak to people when they\u2019re not doing well,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cWell, when you\u2019re not in the limelight any more, it\u2019s true. People don\u2019t particularly care.\u201d In 2006, Ash was awarded \u00a35m compensation from the NHS for loss of earnings following her MSSA ordeal. The lawyers came up with the figure, she says, and if anything her loss has probably been greater. For years, her accountancy bill exceeded her salary. But the payout outraged parts of the media. The Daily Mail headlined with \u201cThe \u00a35m trout pout\u201d, a reference to the swelling of Ash\u2019s lips caused by fillers she had in 2002. (The News of the World coined the phrase \u201ctrout pout\u201d in her honour, but the subject is off-limits for Ash, who will only say: \u201cIt is very much in the past.\u201d) \u201cI was quite amazed \u2013 they made me feel like I\u2019d won the lottery,\u201d Ash says. \u201cI felt that was probably the reason why I wasn\u2019t working. Because I think people thought I was putting it on.\u201d There is a pause. The sun has set while we\u2019ve been chatting, and her face is harder to read in the dark. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. While Ash has made a remarkable physical recovery, there is one issue that she has never been able to fully resolve. When she contracted MSSA, she was in hospital with two broken ribs, having fallen out of bed during \u201cenergetic lovemaking\u201d with Chapman. (This was at 7am after an all-night bender.) Chapman was later arrested on suspicion of assault, but never charged. Ash\u2019s sister subsequently claimed that Ash was a victim of domestic abuse. Ash and Chapman have always denied this claim. The sisters remain estranged. Chapman, who is downstairs in the apartment while Ash and I talk, had previously been arrested in 1997, when he pursued Ash, after an argument, to the home of her Men Behaving Badly co-star Caroline Quentin. He was arrested after trying to kick down Quentin\u2019s door. Ash took out an injunction against him but they quickly reconciled, and the injunction was dropped. At the time of those incidents, Ash and Chapman\u2019s marriage was routinely described as \u201ctempestuous\u201d or \u201cturbulent\u201d. Ash doesn\u2019t like these words. She prefers passionate. \u201cPassion, passion \u2026 Absolute passion!\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a person who walks out and slams the door. Always have been, always will be.\u201d She has spoken in the past about the time she chipped Chapman\u2019s teeth, when she threw a phone at him during one row. Indeed, some reviewers of her 2007 autobiography, My Life Behaving Badly, objected to the degree of responsibility she took for problems within their relationship. But Ash says now that she did so because \u201cI didn\u2019t want everyone to think about Lee being a bad person. Because, no, it takes two to argue.\u201d I can\u2019t help thinking that some people\u2019s suspicion that Ash was the victim of assault added an additional dimension to her recovery. She was suspected of suffering in silence, when silence is seen as weak or disobliging, and she was denigrated for it, her denials distrusted. And all this despite the fact that there has never been proof that an assault took place. \u201cNo!\u201d she says. \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing there!\u201d She and Chapman have been married for nearly 32 years. \u201cWe\u2019re growing old together,\u201d Ash says. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. We\u2019re just like the same person sometimes. I know what he\u2019s thinking. I can finish his sentences. I can be somewhere, walking the dog, and suddenly he\u2019ll come running past. I\u2019ve got this sense that he\u2019s always there.\u201d I wonder how Ash feels about the #MeToo movement, which draws its strength from women speaking out and the tendency sometimes now to see a person who chooses silence as irresponsible. \u201cThat\u2019s what worries me about social media,\u201d Ash says. \u201cEveryone is in this frame of mind that they have to tell everything. With #MeToo I can understand completely about horrible things that women have gone through ... But I just don\u2019t want women to lose their empowerment.\u201d She seems to be saying that talking frankly about a violent experience can be a double-edged sword. \u201cBecause it can make women look terribly weak. And at the moment we are trying to be strong. But at the same time you don\u2019t want to let people get away with it,\u201d she says. \u201cSo therefore I do agree with the #MeToo movement. But ... people have to be careful, and make sure that stories are told the right way.\u201d She herself, she says, feels stronger now than at any point in her life. \u201cI\u2019ve found my voice the older I\u2019ve got.\u201d In the 90s, when she was filming Men Behaving Badly, she mostly sat and listened on set. \u201cI was terrified that if I said anything, they wouldn\u2019t find it funny at all.\u201d And although in her 40s, in the aftermath of the MSSA, she dreaded ageing, now that her 60s are looming, the number doesn\u2019t seem so bad. In any case, she works out four times a week, \u201cand I know I can keep my face toned\u201d. She runs her fingers down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m going in certain areas. But I think you\u2019ve just got to take a deep breath,\u201d she says, exhaling heavily, \u201cand just go with it.\u201d So she isn\u2019t scared of the big number? \u201cNo,\u201d she says, and immediately adds, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Because my mum died at 68. So I\u2019ve got that feeling of: \u2018Oh God, have I only got eight years? So that\u2019s a thing.\u201d Maybe her mum is on her mind, because when she goes to the bar in Clapham, which was her parents\u2019 old shop, Ash can picture her there, sitting on her stool, with a photo of Ash by the counter. \u201cI\u2019d like to live,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou know. I just don\u2019t know whether I will.\u201d Ash believes she is a better actor now \u2013 all she needs is the chance. \u201cBut I am going to do it again,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if I have to make the shows myself.\u201d For more information, visit booksoffice.com",

This is why my partner and I, having managed 15 years and two children together, had to stop watching Catastrophe in each other\u2019s company. There are some places couples can not go. Although in the merciless universe that is Catastrophe, there was some justice in Rob finally losing it at Sharon, who spent three seasons poking the sad, alcoholic, sellout American ad-man bear. It restored the equilibrium of cruelty in their relationship. It also meant I could be on Team Sharon again. (I know, I know, it\u2019s not about sides.)</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s all water under the bridge. How hilarious and raw it has been watching these two endure one of television\u2019s most savage, tender and real relationships in the same four years this country has gone down the tubes. Back on that beach, where they will for ever remain, Sharon and Rob kiss and make up. Sharon says the unsayable: that Rob makes her happy every day. Well, most days. Rob admits: \u201cIf I met you right now, I\u2019d still want to get you pregnant, marry you and mess it all up from there.\u201d Then Sharon goes for a swim. Rob notices the \u201cNo Swimming\u201d sign warning of rip tides, and we notice the giant signpost hanging over the entirety of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/12/catastrophe-finale-review-the-end-of-a-gloriously-monstrous-era\">Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney\u2019s masterpiece</a>. The one that was there all along: Catastrophe. Rob looks at the car, filled with their sleeping children, the life they have made together and the one neither can survive alone. After an exquisite second\u2019s hesitation, he undoes the button of his shirt. Chooses Sharon.</p> <p>In the final frame of this majestic, unflinching series, soundtracked by slaps of water and the rising strains of Arcade Fire\u2019s The Suburbs, the camera pans out and we hover over two bobbing heads in an expanse of blue, heading back to shore. Whether or not they make it depends entirely on us.</p>",

This is why my partner and I, having managed 15 years and two children together, had to stop watching Catastrophe in each other\u2019s company. There are some places couples can not go. Although in the merciless universe that is Catastrophe, there was some justice in Rob finally losing it at Sharon, who spent three seasons poking the sad, alcoholic, sellout American ad-man bear. It restored the equilibrium of cruelty in their relationship. It also meant I could be on Team Sharon again. (I know, I know, it\u2019s not about sides.) Anyway, that\u2019s all water under the bridge. How hilarious and raw it has been watching these two endure one of television\u2019s most savage, tender and real relationships in the same four years this country has gone down the tubes. Back on that beach, where they will for ever remain, Sharon and Rob kiss and make up. Sharon says the unsayable: that Rob makes her happy every day. Well, most days. Rob admits: \u201cIf I met you right now, I\u2019d still want to get you pregnant, marry you and mess it all up from there.\u201d Then Sharon goes for a swim. Rob notices the \u201cNo Swimming\u201d sign warning of rip tides, and we notice the giant signpost hanging over the entirety of Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney\u2019s masterpiece. The one that was there all along: Catastrophe. Rob looks at the car, filled with their sleeping children, the life they have made together and the one neither can survive alone. After an exquisite second\u2019s hesitation, he undoes the button of his shirt. Chooses Sharon. In the final frame of this majestic, unflinching series, soundtracked by slaps of water and the rising strains of Arcade Fire\u2019s The Suburbs, the camera pans out and we hover over two bobbing heads in an expanse of blue, heading back to shore. Whether or not they make it depends entirely on us.",

By contrast with Labour\u2019s 450,000-plus members, the Conservatives are reckoned to have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48395211\" title=\"\">around 160,000</a>. How many of them are active is unclear, but four out of 10 are aged over 65, and 70% are men. After a decade of cuts, many of their councillors seem to be in a state of despondency and disaffection, complaining that their colleagues in national positions of power will not listen.</p> <p>What is 21st-century Conservatism actually about?

Whatever its underlying cynicism, it\u2019s one of the few campaign slogans that has cut through to the public, and carries the promise of a quietening of the mad noise of recent politics. At a time when the public\u2019s weariness with Westminster has reached a peak, it may well be enough to get the Tories over the line. But what will they do when the noise around Brexit has abated?</p> <p>When a party is running out of steam, the signs are usually pretty clear. If you want an instant sense of malaise, consider the senior ministerial positions given to Dominic Raab, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg, not to mention the recent ubiquity of the indefatigable Mark Francois. Meanwhile, the British right\u2019s intellectual vanguard seems consumed by such issues as campus free speech, and the west\u2019s supposed civilisational clash with Islam. Brexit, of course, has already soaked Tory politics in such an ocean of minutiae and arcana that the space for any meaningful thinking about the state of society may simply not exist.</p> <p>Small wonder, then, that the <a href=\"https://vote.conservatives.com/our-plan\" title=\"\">Conservative manifesto</a> is awash with platitudes and piecemeal policies that fall far short of any convincing story about the present condition of Britain, let alone its future. \u201cWe will build a Britain in which everyone has the opportunity to make the most of their talents,\u201d it says. There is nothing that really fleshes this out, beyond old, very familiar pledges: tax rates being left alone, a points-based immigration system, and hardline noises on crime and punishment. Some of this is down to the way that parties are cast and recast in the image of their leaders \u2013 and under Johnson, a kind of meandering opportunism was always going to define the Tory offer. But the sense of a party with precious little to say that is convincing or relevant also reflects two growing gaps between Conservatism and the country at large.</p> <p>One is widely recognised. It is all about Brexit, the demise of David Cameron and George Osborne\u2019s dream of Conservative modernisation, and the way the Tories\u2019 ramped-up nationalism and air of nastiness are cutting across the party\u2019s old bond with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/10/surrey-commuters-marginal-voters-election-tories-guildford\" title=\"\">increasingly liberal English suburbs</a>, while distancing it even further from millions of voters aged under 50. The other, so far comparatively overlooked, is about the post-Thatcher settlement palpably falling apart, leaving a party still wedded to the small state and free market with increasingly little to say.</p> <p>Given the chance, it is obvious what some ambitious, energised Tories would still like to do: as evidenced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a>, the infamous book co-authored in 2012 by Patel, Raab and their fellow minister Liz Truss, theirs is a vision of Thatcherism on steroids and the market extended to the few parts of society it has not yet reached. But as I have talked to people over the past few weeks, one of the most striking things I keep hearing is the sense of a view of the country sharply at odds with all that, voiced by people irrespective of which party they might support on Thursday.</p> <p>Most people do not use the word \u201causterity\u201d, but you hear a lot of talk about \u201ccutbacks\u201d. Even voters minded to back the Conservatives usually agree that they have gone too far, and that society is now full of cracks that need to be mended. The NHS, to paraphrase that Tory sage Nigel Lawson, remains the closest thing English people have to a national religion, and they are worried about its predicament. People talk about low pay and insecurity, and the often forlorn state of their town centres.</p> <p>The fact that this does not lead many of them to consider voting Labour is partly an indication of the way Brexit has contorted our politics, but also an indictment of how Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have lost any strong message about the country\u2019s predicament in a haze of numbers and increasingly incredible offers to the public. Beyond what remains of the true-blue heartlands, there are significant chunks of the country where mistrust of Labour and its leader seems to run deeper than scepticism about Johnson and the Tories. But still: if I were a Tory, I would worry about the public\u2019s low, rumbling unease, and where it might go in the future.</p> <p>Two or three years into the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, there was talk of somehow turning the Tories into \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/16/renewal-tory-workers-party\" title=\"\">the workers\u2019 party</a>\u201d, and the need for a new \u201cblue-collar conservatism\u201d. A few years before, David Cameron had fleetingly embraced the devolving, localist visions of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/aug/08/phillip-blond-conservatives-david-cameron\" title=\"\">red Toryism</a>\u201d. There were also flashes of a potential way forward for the Tories in Theresa May\u2019s brief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister\" title=\"\">interest in inequality</a> and the power of the state fused with tradition and duty, and a tilt away from London. In the face of the Tories\u2019 unchanged Thatcherite beliefs, it was perhaps inevitable that few of these things ever resulted in any convincing policy ideas. There again, given their past talent for reinvention, and the skill at selling capitalism to the electorate that propelled them through the 20th century, such new thinking might conceivably have grown into something with electoral potential.</p> <p>But nothing happened. It is nearly 40 years since the advent of the last genuinely transformative Tory idea, which was actually borrowed from a reluctant Labour party: enabling people to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Buy\" title=\"\">buy their council houses</a>. This policy, aptly enough, now sits at the heart of the shortage of homes and defines so many of the country\u2019s current furies. The supposed natural party of government now hides from scrutiny, anxiously hanging on to Brexit while knowing it has almost nothing else to say. The Tories may be about to win, but if they do, it looks set to be the most pyrrhic of victories. This is what may yet be known as Johnsonism: a mixture of populist authoritarianism and unseriousness that refuses to think about the future, but stumbles on regardless, as the English ruling class so often does.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

But still: if I were a Tory, I would worry about the public\u2019s low, rumbling unease, and where it might go in the future. Two or three years into the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, there was talk of somehow turning the Tories into \u201cthe workers\u2019 party\u201d, and the need for a new \u201cblue-collar conservatism\u201d. A few years before, David Cameron had fleetingly embraced the devolving, localist visions of \u201cred Toryism\u201d. There were also flashes of a potential way forward for the Tories in Theresa May\u2019s brief interest in inequality and the power of the state fused with tradition and duty, and a tilt away from London. In the face of the Tories\u2019 unchanged Thatcherite beliefs, it was perhaps inevitable that few of these things ever resulted in any convincing policy ideas. There again, given their past talent for reinvention, and the skill at selling capitalism to the electorate that propelled them through the 20th century, such new thinking might conceivably have grown into something with electoral potential. But nothing happened. It is nearly 40 years since the advent of the last genuinely transformative Tory idea, which was actually borrowed from a reluctant Labour party: enabling people to buy their council houses. This policy, aptly enough, now sits at the heart of the shortage of homes and defines so many of the country\u2019s current furies. The supposed natural party of government now hides from scrutiny, anxiously hanging on to Brexit while knowing it has almost nothing else to say. The Tories may be about to win, but if they do, it looks set to be the most pyrrhic of victories. This is what may yet be known as Johnsonism: a mixture of populist authoritarianism and unseriousness that refuses to think about the future, but stumbles on regardless, as the English ruling class so often does. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

A report for Revive, a coalition of environmental and animal rights groups, has found grouse moors cause significant ecological damage by burning heather, allowing heavy grazing by deer and sheep, and using intensive predator control.

But the water minister, Melinda Pavey, urged people not to abandon their holiday plans, saying the new list of \u201cday zero\u201d dates for NSW towns was a worst-case scenario based on how long water supplies would last with no inflows and without water restrictions. Sydney and the Illawarra were placed on level 2 water restrictions on Monday. The Hunter will follow in January. This means people may water their gardens with only a bucket before 10am and after 4pm, and car washing is also restricted to bucket and sponge. Watering with a hose is banned and residents are urged to restrict their showers to four minutes. The Sunday Telegraph published a list of \u201cday zero\u201d dates for coastal towns, which showed Bellingen running out of water by January, Taree by February, and Port Macquarie and Batemans Bay within a year. Newcastle has only 18 months\u2019 supply, according to the report. But Pavey played down the extreme urgency of the dates, saying this assumed no rain at all and that usage remained the same. \u201cI hope we get the beautiful summer rain that we are used to in Sydney and the coastal areas,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope we get some east coast lows. But we have to look at the evidence. We have to look at the inflows, we have to look at the outflows, but this is what the plan says at the moment. \u201cBellingen is in my electorate and that\u2019s where I get my showers from. That river is still flowing \u2013 it\u2019s only two megalitres a day, which is incredibly low, but it\u2019s still flowing.\u201d The prediction for day zero dates was based on the river stopping flowing altogether, she said. As well as implementing water restrictions, the government was working with councils to explore alternative water supplies. \u201cBecause it is an estuarine system as it goes up the river, we are working with council to look at reverse osmosis plants and looking at more groundwater supplies from underneath the river,\u201d she said. In the case of the Manning, which serves Taree, Pavey said the river had not flowed for 30 days, the longest period of no-flow recorded. The government was looking at more bore fields and treated water from other catchments to assist the dairy industry. Pavey said the Bureau of Meteorology was hoping for a better outlook in January, although not above average. \u201cIf we get a few storms on the coast that can make a big difference and fill up catchments quite quickly,\u201d she said. Pavey sought to reassure country residents that level 2 restrictions in the cities were comparable to some of the restrictions in country areas. She said it was frustrating that water restrictions varied from council to council and between water agencies. Meanwhile Pavey appeared to offer a more conciliatory bargaining stance on the Murray-Darling Basin plan, after the NSW Nationals\u2019 leader, John Barilaro, said last week he was prepared to pull NSW out of the plan and had sought legal advice about it. \u201cThere is capacity for us to walk away,\u201d Pavey said. \u201cI would prefer to get a better outcome for our nation and our state working collaboratively.\u201d Water ministers are due to meet next Tuesday. \u201cThe fact that we are having a look at the [South Australian] lakes management, that\u2019s a positive result,\u201d she said. Pavey also said she supported the appointment of former federal police chief Mick Keelty as the inspector general for the Murray-Darling Basin plan, saying he had a good understanding of the plan.

      "body": "<p>Helen Carroll still remembers meeting two officials from Glasgow city council two years ago. She was then secretary to Springburn community council, and the meeting seemed to confirm their fears. \u201cI asked if there was anything planned and they said: \u2018No, there\u2019s nothing planned in the foreseeable future for Springburn. There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe were literally coloured grey on the map. I couldn\u2019t believe it. They just didn\u2019t expect anyone to ask the question.\u201d</p> <p>Her riposte to that hangs on the wall of the community drop-in centre that Carroll helped found earlier this year in Springburn shopping centre. A laminated aerial photograph of Springburn has been pinned above a table carrying a coffee pot and tea bags.</p> <p>Taken on a bright cloudless day, the image picks out the neighbourhood\u2019s parks, industrial estates and housing schemes. It is clustered with stars and dots in red, green, blue, yellow and gold. The red stickers mark out places the locals want to see improved, green and blue the places they cherish, and yellow marks out homes.</p> <p>Red, green and blue stars are dotted across Springburn Park to the north, built when the area was an industrial powerhouse and home to the Winter Gardens pavilion. Once the largest single-span glasshouse in Scotland, the pavilion is now a rusting and derelict skeleton.</p> <p>The widely disliked dual carriageways and flyovers that bisect Springburn and its surrounding Westminster constituency of Glasgow North East are marked out by lines of red dots and stars. And a particularly dense cluster of red stickers covers the shopping centre, which houses the drop-in centre.</p> <p>The drop-in centre\u2019s walls are crowded with job adverts and training course flyers, and an offer from Timpsons, the shoe repair chain, to dryclean suits for free if a jobseeker has an interview. There are rails of free clothes and neatly pressed school uniforms, and locals can borrow DVDs and books, or toys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2019/interactive-constituency-profiles/embed/iframe.html?id=S14000032&amp;copy=Historically%20a%20Labour%20stronghold%2C%20the%20Scottish%20National%20party%20won%20it%20for%20the%20first%20time%20in%202015.%20Labour%20regained%20it%20in%202017%2C%20so%20holding%20this%20again%20is%20a%20key%20test%20for%20Jeremy%20Corbyn.%20The%20closure%20of%20its%20last%20railway%20works%2C%20drugs%20deaths%20and%20deprivation%20are%20key%20local%20issues.&amp;leave=true&amp;majority=true&amp;income=true&amp;unemployment=true&amp;deprivation=true\" data-alt=\"Constituency profile for Glasgow North East\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2019/interactive-constituency-profiles/embed/iframe.html?id=S14000032&copy=Historically%20a%20Labour%20stronghold%2C%20the%20Scottish%20National%20party%20won%20it%20for%20the%20first%20time%20in%202015.%20Labour%20regained%20it%20in%202017%2C%20so%20holding%20this%20again%20is%20a%20key%20test%20for%20Jeremy%20Corbyn.%20The%20closure%20of%20its%20last%20railway%20works%2C%20drugs%20deaths%20and%20deprivation%20are%20key%20local%20issues.&leave=true&majority=true&income=true&unemployment=true&deprivation=true\">Constituency profile for Glasgow North East</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hub; it\u2019s a place for folk to come to,\u201d Carroll, now chair of the community council, said. The centre, its utility bills paid by the shopping centre owners, hosts community and police liaison meetings, and surgeries for the local Scottish National party MSP, Bob Doris. Spurred on by Doris, council officers now come to meetings too.</p> <p>Half a dozen women are chatting on sofas grouped together just beyond the aerial map. \u201cIt\u2019s the living room, that\u2019s what we call it,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have chats about whatever is going on. It could be relationships; it\u2019s often money.\u201d</p> <p>Brian Casey, a Church of Scotland minister who works closely with Carroll, said the hub was visible evidence of a resurgence in community activism in Springburn. \u201cUntil the 60s and 70s, it was such a big industrial area we had shop stewards and people who knew how to run communities,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat declined during the Thatcher era. It\u2019s now coming back with people in their 30s and 40s, people who want to make this a better place to live, a new generation of activists who can do these things.\u201d</p> <p>Glasgow North East, which had the lowest turnout of any constituency in the UK in 2017, has been a Labour-Scottish National party battleground for a decade. During Alex Salmond\u2019s leadership, the SNP tried to seize it in a byelection after Michael Martin, a Labour MP then speaker of the House of Commons, resigned after a no-confidence motion was tabled against him in 2009.</p> <p>Many locals blamed Martin for a decade of neglect, yet Labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgow-north-east-byelection\">comfortably held the seat</a>. In the SNP landslide election of 2015, Anne McLaughlin finally took the seat for the SNP by 9,222 votes, only to lose it to Labour\u2019s Paul Sweeney by 242 votes in 2017. McLaughlin and Sweeney are competing again at this election.</p> <p>Labour strategists acknowledge holding this seat is a significant test of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s agenda and his popularity. Setting aside Brexit and independence, Labour and the SNP are fighting on similar territory: both want to scrap universal credit and increase benefits; both promise industrial reinvestment and heavy spending on new and upgraded housing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe09c0f96b702c78d2032f7c271723c17399782a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe09c0f96b702c78d2032f7c271723c17399782a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Sweeney, Labour candidate for Glasgow North East, joins former employees from the Caley railway works at a protest last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Sweeney, Labour candidate for Glasgow North East, joins former employees from the Caley railway works at a protest last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In common with other deprived constituencies across the UK, the intricacies of Brexit have little traction here and nor \u2013 for now, at least \u2013 does the lure of independence. Carroll and Casey said their concerns are those of day-to-day survival.</p> <p>UK government data shows there are 22,300 economically inactive adults in Glasgow North East, 37.6% of the population; in September, nearly 3,200 people there claimed unemployment benefit, 8.1% of the constituency\u2019s economically active population, more than double the UK rate.</p> <p>A further 6,460 adults receive personal independence disability (PIP) payments, with depression and other psychiatric disorders accounting of 42% of those. The End Child Poverty coalition estimates 39% of children in Glasgow North East live in poverty after housing costs, nearly double the Scottish average.</p> <p>Much may turn on local issues: Sweeney is campaigning to reopen the Caley, the last of Springburn\u2019s once famous railway works. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-49116426\">It finally closed in July</a>, with the loss of 200 jobs, ending 178 years of train-building in the area. By the late 1800s, Springburn\u2019s railway works \u2013 Cowlairs, St Rollox, Hyde Park and the Caley \u2013 were building and exporting most of the world\u2019s steam locomotives.</p> <p>McLaughlin was at the forefront of a unanimous vote at SNP conference in October calling for drug-control legislation to be devolved from the Home Office to Scotland; she wants decriminalisation and safe injection rooms for addicts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/01/scottish-government-urged-to-declare-drug-addiction-emergency\">There were </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/01/scottish-government-urged-to-declare-drug-addiction-emergency\">1,187</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/01/scottish-government-urged-to-declare-drug-addiction-emergency\"> drug</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/01/scottish-government-urged-to-declare-drug-addiction-emergency\"> deaths in Scotland in 2018</a>, the highest number on record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"42f7dee47396a5269b2dba51f2e2091325feab0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42f7dee47396a5269b2dba51f2e2091325feab0a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rev Brian Casey at Springburn parish church.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rev Brian Casey at Springburn parish church.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>News about the drop-in centre\u2019s activities has spread. Staff from a local nursery came by with six large shopping bags of nappies, rusks and organic baby food for a new initiative two of the centre\u2019s volunteers launched last month: a food bank for babies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m tired of burying people because of drugs and suicide</p> <footer> <cite>Rev Brian Casey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nine families, some penniless during their transfer to universal credit, others asylum seekers, have been given free food and formula. The neighbourhood\u2019s food banks could not provide them, so they did. Donations have flooded in. A local Salvation Army hall is now storing a small mountain of supplies: infant formula, nappies, antiseptic creams, baby wipes and food.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting in this day and age that people can\u2019t afford baby milk,\u201d said Tracy Pender, the volunteer who initiated it. Her benefits were frozen in 2017, she said, so she understands. \u201cEvery one of us knows what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p> <p>There is deep alarm too about so-called \u201cstreet valium\u201d, an extremely cheap and potent sedative churned out in backroom factories in the city on pill presses dealers can buy on Amazon, with ingredients sourced in China. It has killed scores of people in Springburn.</p> <p>Casey said users buy the pills, frequently laced with adulterants, in bulk at 100 tablets for \u00a330. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to buy than a bottle of cider,\u201d he said. \u201cKids don\u2019t need to show any ID to buy street valium.\u201d Many addicts use it to top up their methadone, often with fatal results.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of burying people because of drugs and suicide,\u201d Casey added. In one recent seven-week period, he held six funerals for men who had taken their own lives, and estimates a third of the 180 funerals he has led in the last year involved drug-related deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really bad.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie McLean, a former addict who lost her father and six other relatives to addiction and helps run a drugs recovery cafe at Casey\u2019s church, points to the shops that thrive on the high street close by.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed3c695b2c524125232f560b34773aae7c22b6e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed3c695b2c524125232f560b34773aae7c22b6e6/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Carroll at Springburn Community Hub.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Carroll at Springburn Community Hub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three chemists run by the chain Rowlands are grouped in a triangle tens of metres across from each other across the street; there is another branch in the shopping centre. Every morning they dispense methadone to a regular queue of heroin addicts. There are five bookies and three pawnbrokers.</p> <p>\u201cPoverty and inequality; that\u2019s absolutely why they\u2019re there,\u201d she said. \u201cThat speaks volumes to me.\u201d</p> <p>The church, a squat single-storey red-brick building built in the 1970s, has become another focus for community activists. It hosts an afterschool club, a \u201cmusical memories\u201d club for dementia-sufferers, a Peekaboo preschool play caf\u00e9 popular with refugee families, and also distributes vouchers for local food banks.</p> <p>\u201cI now have lots of people who are volunteering, who would never normally come to church apart from baptisms or weddings,\u201d Casey said. He sees his role as a form of community chaplaincy. \u201cThere\u2019s a big push to say to people: \u2018you have value\u2019. There are families we deal with who are third-generation unemployed.\u201d He wants, he says, \u201cto give them a sense of self-worth\u201d.</p> <p>Carroll has the same optimism. She hopes eventually to see the Winter Gardens reopened; it would be a fine symbol of Springburn\u2019s regeneration, she says. A Grade-A listed building, Sweeney is leading a campaign to raise funds to rebuild it. She remembers watching a young cousin sing Flower of Scotland there in the 1970s. She had \u201ca wee nervous voice and as soon as she got two or three verses into it, the whole place erupted and burst into song\u201d, she recalls. \u201cThere is a sense of change here. I really do feel it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Helen Carroll still remembers meeting two officials from Glasgow city council two years ago. She was then secretary to Springburn community council, and the meeting seemed to confirm their fears. \u201cI asked if there was anything planned and they said: \u2018No, there\u2019s nothing planned in the foreseeable future for Springburn. There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe were literally coloured grey on the map. I couldn\u2019t believe it. They just didn\u2019t expect anyone to ask the question.\u201d Her riposte to that hangs on the wall of the community drop-in centre that Carroll helped found earlier this year in Springburn shopping centre. A laminated aerial photograph of Springburn has been pinned above a table carrying a coffee pot and tea bags. Taken on a bright cloudless day, the image picks out the neighbourhood\u2019s parks, industrial estates and housing schemes. It is clustered with stars and dots in red, green, blue, yellow and gold. The red stickers mark out places the locals want to see improved, green and blue the places they cherish, and yellow marks out homes. Red, green and blue stars are dotted across Springburn Park to the north, built when the area was an industrial powerhouse and home to the Winter Gardens pavilion. Once the largest single-span glasshouse in Scotland, the pavilion is now a rusting and derelict skeleton. The widely disliked dual carriageways and flyovers that bisect Springburn and its surrounding Westminster constituency of Glasgow North East are marked out by lines of red dots and stars. And a particularly dense cluster of red stickers covers the shopping centre, which houses the drop-in centre. The drop-in centre\u2019s walls are crowded with job adverts and training course flyers, and an offer from Timpsons, the shoe repair chain, to dryclean suits for free if a jobseeker has an interview. There are rails of free clothes and neatly pressed school uniforms, and locals can borrow DVDs and books, or toys. \u201cIt\u2019s a hub; it\u2019s a place for folk to come to,\u201d Carroll, now chair of the community council, said. The centre, its utility bills paid by the shopping centre owners, hosts community and police liaison meetings, and surgeries for the local Scottish National party MSP, Bob Doris. Spurred on by Doris, council officers now come to meetings too. Half a dozen women are chatting on sofas grouped together just beyond the aerial map. \u201cIt\u2019s the living room, that\u2019s what we call it,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have chats about whatever is going on. It could be relationships; it\u2019s often money.\u201d Brian Casey, a Church of Scotland minister who works closely with Carroll, said the hub was visible evidence of a resurgence in community activism in Springburn. \u201cUntil the 60s and 70s, it was such a big industrial area we had shop stewards and people who knew how to run communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThat declined during the Thatcher era. It\u2019s now coming back with people in their 30s and 40s, people who want to make this a better place to live, a new generation of activists who can do these things.\u201d Glasgow North East, which had the lowest turnout of any constituency in the UK in 2017, has been a Labour-Scottish National party battleground for a decade. During Alex Salmond\u2019s leadership, the SNP tried to seize it in a byelection after Michael Martin, a Labour MP then speaker of the House of Commons, resigned after a no-confidence motion was tabled against him in 2009. Many locals blamed Martin for a decade of neglect, yet Labour comfortably held the seat. In the SNP landslide election of 2015, Anne McLaughlin finally took the seat for the SNP by 9,222 votes, only to lose it to Labour\u2019s Paul Sweeney by 242 votes in 2017. McLaughlin and Sweeney are competing again at this election. Labour strategists acknowledge holding this seat is a significant test of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s agenda and his popularity. Setting aside Brexit and independence, Labour and the SNP are fighting on similar territory: both want to scrap universal credit and increase benefits; both promise industrial reinvestment and heavy spending on new and upgraded housing. In common with other deprived constituencies across the UK, the intricacies of Brexit have little traction here and nor \u2013 for now, at least \u2013 does the lure of independence. Carroll and Casey said their concerns are those of day-to-day survival. UK government data shows there are 22,300 economically inactive adults in Glasgow North East, 37.6% of the population; in September, nearly 3,200 people there claimed unemployment benefit, 8.1% of the constituency\u2019s economically active population, more than double the UK rate. A further 6,460 adults receive personal independence disability (PIP) payments, with depression and other psychiatric disorders accounting of 42% of those. The End Child Poverty coalition estimates 39% of children in Glasgow North East live in poverty after housing costs, nearly double the Scottish average. Much may turn on local issues: Sweeney is campaigning to reopen the Caley, the last of Springburn\u2019s once famous railway works. It finally closed in July, with the loss of 200 jobs, ending 178 years of train-building in the area. By the late 1800s, Springburn\u2019s railway works \u2013 Cowlairs, St Rollox, Hyde Park and the Caley \u2013 were building and exporting most of the world\u2019s steam locomotives. McLaughlin was at the forefront of a unanimous vote at SNP conference in October calling for drug-control legislation to be devolved from the Home Office to Scotland; she wants decriminalisation and safe injection rooms for addicts. There were 1,187 drug deaths in Scotland in 2018, the highest number on record. News about the drop-in centre\u2019s activities has spread. Staff from a local nursery came by with six large shopping bags of nappies, rusks and organic baby food for a new initiative two of the centre\u2019s volunteers launched last month: a food bank for babies. Nine families, some penniless during their transfer to universal credit, others asylum seekers, have been given free food and formula. The neighbourhood\u2019s food banks could not provide them, so they did. Donations have flooded in. A local Salvation Army hall is now storing a small mountain of supplies: infant formula, nappies, antiseptic creams, baby wipes and food. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting in this day and age that people can\u2019t afford baby milk,\u201d said Tracy Pender, the volunteer who initiated it. Her benefits were frozen in 2017, she said, so she understands. \u201cEvery one of us knows what it\u2019s like.\u201d There is deep alarm too about so-called \u201cstreet valium\u201d, an extremely cheap and potent sedative churned out in backroom factories in the city on pill presses dealers can buy on Amazon, with ingredients sourced in China. It has killed scores of people in Springburn. Casey said users buy the pills, frequently laced with adulterants, in bulk at 100 tablets for \u00a330. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to buy than a bottle of cider,\u201d he said. \u201cKids don\u2019t need to show any ID to buy street valium.\u201d Many addicts use it to top up their methadone, often with fatal results. \u201cI\u2019m tired of burying people because of drugs and suicide,\u201d Casey added. In one recent seven-week period, he held six funerals for men who had taken their own lives, and estimates a third of the 180 funerals he has led in the last year involved drug-related deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really bad.\u201d Natalie McLean, a former addict who lost her father and six other relatives to addiction and helps run a drugs recovery cafe at Casey\u2019s church, points to the shops that thrive on the high street close by. Three chemists run by the chain Rowlands are grouped in a triangle tens of metres across from each other across the street; there is another branch in the shopping centre. Every morning they dispense methadone to a regular queue of heroin addicts. There are five bookies and three pawnbrokers. \u201cPoverty and inequality; that\u2019s absolutely why they\u2019re there,\u201d she said. \u201cThat speaks volumes to me.\u201d The church, a squat single-storey red-brick building built in the 1970s, has become another focus for community activists. It hosts an afterschool club, a \u201cmusical memories\u201d club for dementia-sufferers, a Peekaboo preschool play caf\u00e9 popular with refugee families, and also distributes vouchers for local food banks. \u201cI now have lots of people who are volunteering, who would never normally come to church apart from baptisms or weddings,\u201d Casey said. He sees his role as a form of community chaplaincy. \u201cThere\u2019s a big push to say to people: \u2018you have value\u2019. There are families we deal with who are third-generation unemployed.\u201d He wants, he says, \u201cto give them a sense of self-worth\u201d. Carroll has the same optimism. She hopes eventually to see the Winter Gardens reopened; it would be a fine symbol of Springburn\u2019s regeneration, she says. A Grade-A listed building, Sweeney is leading a campaign to raise funds to rebuild it. She remembers watching a young cousin sing Flower of Scotland there in the 1970s. She had \u201ca wee nervous voice and as soon as she got two or three verses into it, the whole place erupted and burst into song\u201d, she recalls. \u201cThere is a sense of change here. I really do feel it.\u201d",

Their ordeal has been a constant source of friction between Japan and South Korea since the early 1990s, when the first survivor went public with her story. One dispatch sent to the foreign ministry from the consul general of Qingdao in China\u2019s Shandong province cites a request from the imperial army to provide one woman for every 70 soldiers, the Kyodo report said.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s plan to use an accounting loophole to meet its international emissions targets has been formally challenged at UN climate talks, with about 100 countries wanting the practice banned under the Paris agreement. Delegates from developing countries led by Belize and Costa Rica have introduced a ban on using carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol into the text of the rulebook for the Paris climate agreement, which is being debated at a meeting in Madrid. It is a crucial debate for the Morrison government as it relies on using the accounting measure to meet its commitment under the Paris deal. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, arrived in Madrid on Sunday to make Australia\u2019s case at the second week of the talks. Emissions projections released as Taylor left Australia suggested the Morrison government was on track to meet its 2030 target (at least a 26% emissions cut below 2005 levels), but only if it used carryover credits. Without them it expected emissions to achieve just a 16% cut. Government advisers found Australia\u2019s fair share under a meaningful global deal would be at least 45%. Carryover accounting rules allow countries to claim credit for exceeding previous targets against future targets. They were allowed under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol to encourage countries to be as ambitious as possible. They were not mentioned in the original text of the Paris agreement. The introduction of a ban on what are described as \u201cKyoto units\u201d into the negotiating was the clearest sign that countries that had expressed opposition to their use were determined to follow through. Some observers at the talks described the clause as an \u201canti-Australia\u201d option. Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics in Berlin and a long-time adviser to developing countries at climate talks, said using carryover credits was opposed by three major negotiating blocs \u2013 the alliance of small island states, the least developed countries group and the independent alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean \u2013 as well as Canada, Switzerland and Norway. \u201cThere [are about] 100 countries supporting this [challenge],\u201d Hare said from Madrid. The government has said it earned the right to use the credits through previous efforts. Opponents say it could claim access to the credits only because Australia set unambitious targets under the Kyoto protocol, including allowing emissions to increase by up to 8% between 1990 and 2012. They say using the credits was at odds with the Paris agreement, which committed countries to escalating action that reflected their \u201chighest possible ambition\u201d. Officials told Senate estimates earlier this year that as far as they were aware Australia was the only country planning to use carryover credits. Several developed countries had explicitly ruled out using them. Hare said the European Union, South Africa and Papua New Guinea, representing a group known as the coalition of rainforest nations, had not embraced an outright ban in Madrid but supported a time limit on their use. Some major countries including China, India and Brazil have sided with Australia in opposing the ban, at least in part because as written it would also outlaw using Kyoto protocol-era offsets generated in their countries that can be sold to developed nations in lieu of reducing their own pollution. Richie Merzian, a former Australian climate negotiator and now climate energy director with the Australia Institute, said it was possible the wording of the text would be altered to ban just carryover credits but not carbon offsets. He said China, India and Brazil were far more influential with developing countries than Australia and had a specific interest that could be catered for without allowing carryover credits. \u201cAustralia has a single issue that could be targeted and that\u2019s always risky,\u201d Merzian said. \u201cIt means the minister has to start the week on the defensive.\u201d Australian officials have indicated the government\u2019s position is that using the credits is non-negotiable. As decisions at UN climate talks are by consensus, Australia could stand alone to block a ban, although it would be expected to face significant pressure if isolated. Faced with objections from the British high Commission at a meeting with business groups last month, Australian officials said there would need to be a diplomatic solution to the standoff. Official data shows Australia\u2019s emissions have not come down and several analysts have found it was not on track to meet its Paris target. But the government released two sets of data over the past 10 days to support the argument that Taylor will make at the conference: that the country has \u201ca track record of which all Australians can be proud\u201d. The first new report used newly adjusted emissions data to suggest national pollution was flat, and had dipped slightly over the past two years, rather than increasing year-on-year as official greenhouse accounts had previously shown. The second updated projections of how much pollution would be released to 2030 and found, contrary to other evidence, the country was expected to meet its Paris target by using the accounting loophole. The department projections suggested Australia would exceed its 2020 target (a 5% cut compared with 2000) by 411m tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is 44m tonnes more than a year ago. As analysts have pointed out, 44m tonnes is about 8% of Australia\u2019s annual pollution. It is equivalent to the annual emissions of Switzerland, or 10 times the emissions of Lesotho.

Today, one in six Australian children live in poverty. Improving equity in education starts with high-quality early childhood education for all, individualised support in school for those who need it and valuing whole-child development throughout schooling.</p> <p>International organisations and Australian scholars have stressed the urgency to understand how inequalities in our school systems prevent education outcomes from improving. Recent survey by the Gonski Institute for Education found that 90% of Australians think equity is an important part of our current education. They are right. Equity is not only a social justice imperative \u2013 it is also a way to use resources more effectively.</p> <h2>Second, make health in schools another priority</h2> <p>Healthier students are better learners. Yet education reforms have not sufficiently addressed reduction of educationally relevant health issues in schools.</p> <p>Low levels of academic achievement in Pisa among disadvantaged and Indigenous children undermine the quality of individual, family and community life that puts the very integrity of Australian society at risk. We know that educationally relevant health disparities exert a powerful influence on how different children learn in school.

Even if a causal correlation is hard to prove, it is probable that a student who suffers from anxiety disorders, depression, sleep deprivation or suicidal behaviours is not likely to be successful in school. Improving children\u2019s health and wellbeing in school and at home would immediately affect the quality of their being and learning in school.</p> <h2>Third, avoid employing quick fixes</h2> <p>Believing that \u201cback to basics\u201d \u2013 insisting on phonics tests \u2013 or that attracting the academically best to become teachers would make Australia\u2019s education system the best in the world is a poor strategy. <br><br>It is a wrong strategy because it doesn\u2019t address educational equities and enhance students\u2019 wellbeing so that every student would have fair chance to succeed.</p> <p>So, where to start improving education systems then? Let\u2019s ask Einstein. He is reported to have said: <em>\u201c</em>If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask \u2026 for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.\u201d Rarely is this the case in solving educational problems, even when millions of lives depend on the outcome. Instead, we rush to suggest solutions that have a poor evidence base and only a loose connection to the actual problem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/01/poorer-and-regional-australian-students-lag-behind-richer-peers-report-finds\">Poorer and regional Australian students lag behind richer peers, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Schools around the world are not what they could be. Students are not learning what we expect them to learn, and teachers don\u2019t find teaching intellectually attractive any more. Yet, no need to panic.</p> <p>There is a lot of helpful work done already about possible solutions. The new Alice Springs Declaration that is based on the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians (2008) should continue to have equity, excellence and wellbeing as the key goals of school education. The Review of Funding for Schooling (2011), led by David Gonski, is another important plan aiming at fairer funding framework for schools to even a growing gap between Australia\u2019s wealthy and disadvantaged schools. Both of these need to be implemented as planned.</p> <p>Take heart. Improving education systems is not rocket science \u2013 it\u2019s more complicated than that. It is good to keep in mind that to rush the reform is to ruin it.</p> <p>\u2022 Pasi Sahlberg is professor of education at the Gonski Institute for Education, UNSW Sydney.

It is a wrong strategy because it doesn\u2019t address educational equities and enhance students\u2019 wellbeing so that every student would have fair chance to succeed. So, where to start improving education systems then? Let\u2019s ask Einstein. He is reported to have said: \u201cIf I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask \u2026 for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.\u201d Rarely is this the case in solving educational problems, even when millions of lives depend on the outcome. Instead, we rush to suggest solutions that have a poor evidence base and only a loose connection to the actual problem. Schools around the world are not what they could be. Students are not learning what we expect them to learn, and teachers don\u2019t find teaching intellectually attractive any more. Yet, no need to panic. There is a lot of helpful work done already about possible solutions. The new Alice Springs Declaration that is based on the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians (2008) should continue to have equity, excellence and wellbeing as the key goals of school education. The Review of Funding for Schooling (2011), led by David Gonski, is another important plan aiming at fairer funding framework for schools to even a growing gap between Australia\u2019s wealthy and disadvantaged schools. Both of these need to be implemented as planned. Take heart. Improving education systems is not rocket science \u2013 it\u2019s more complicated than that. It is good to keep in mind that to rush the reform is to ruin it. \u2022 Pasi Sahlberg is professor of education at the Gonski Institute for Education, UNSW Sydney. He is former director general of Finland\u2019s ministry of education, and a maths and science teacher in Helsinki",

The crown prince also assured Trump that Saudi authorities would offer their absolute cooperation with the US and provide all information that would help the investigations. The defense secretary, Mark Esper, said he had asked the Pentagon to review screening procedures for soldiers from other countries sent to the US for training. Key allies of Donald Trump called for Saudi Arabia to be suspended from such programs. The FBI identified the gunman as Mohammed Alshamrani, 21. A US official told the AP investigators believe Alshamrani visited New York City, including Rockefeller Center, days before the shooting. The FBI was attempting to question anyone who may have interacted with him, the official said. Authorities also believe the gunman made social media posts about US support for Israel and alleging Americans were anti-Muslim, the official said. Investigators were continuing to examine his online profiles and social media postings. On Saturday, a US official told the Associated Press the Saudi gunman hosted a dinner party this week where he and three others watched videos of mass shootings. The official said one of the three students who attended the party then recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting took place, while two Saudi students watched from a car. Rojas said the FBI was \u201clooking very hard at uncovering his motive and I would ask for patience so we can get this right\u201d.

Almost all, the comforting story ran, had stolen loaves of bread.</p> <p>By then the condition of our ancestors had folded into a self-congratulatory mythos: our convict past, as Russel Ward first asserted in the 1950s, was the font of our subversive, anti-authoritarian sense of humour.</p> <p>More recent Australian history forces us to consider another side of those penal arrangements: even an open-air prison requires snitches and screws.

      "bodyText": "Any shame white Australians might have felt about the country\u2019s origins as a penal colony has long since disappeared. For many decades those with convict ancestors have tended to proudly claim them. By the time of my primary education in the 1980s, the crimes of those transported tended to be minimised by teachers. Almost all, the comforting story ran, had stolen loaves of bread. By then the condition of our ancestors had folded into a self-congratulatory mythos: our convict past, as Russel Ward first asserted in the 1950s, was the font of our subversive, anti-authoritarian sense of humour. More recent Australian history forces us to consider another side of those penal arrangements: even an open-air prison requires snitches and screws. The uniformed men who flayed or executed troublesome prisoners also formed the country and sired children \u2013 the administrators of this exceptionally brutal system were the country\u2019s original ruling class. Prisons function only if most people, most of the time, bring themselves to knuckle under. A prisoner\u2019s personal position might well be improved by throwing a likewise incarcerated person to the wolves. With this in mind a case might even be made that for a proud liberal democracy Australia is more and more authoritarian. Governments increasingly legislate to curtail rights of protest, assembly, property and privacy. Police and security services frequently trample the civil rights that do exist. Feral, rightwing media hound prominent dissenters and millions of citizens acquiesce. Some even cheer. At the federal level governments and oppositions, at the behest of security services, have eroded what few protections exist in our age of ubiquitous surveillance. Last year\u2019s anti-encryption measures were hurriedly passed without serious challenge from Labor. The measures compel tech companies to help police spy on people and undo encryption. Tech companies consider Australia an unsafe place to store data. These powers have been used extensively against journalists and to circumvent the few protections that reporters have over their information. There is no widespread protest against such laws, even if opposition to them has provided a rare show of unity across media organisations. The last year has been equally concerning at the state level. This year the Queensland government criminalised certain forms of nonviolent protest involving the self-immobilisation of protesters. At the same time it expanded police powers to allow search and seizure of devices that protesters might use to lock themselves in place. Their target was Extinction Rebellion protesters, and among that group\u2019s concerns is the Adani coalmine. There was some muted concern from the Queensland government\u2019s allies in the trade union movement, but they didn\u2019t take any action. There was reporting in outlets including Guardian Australia, but not much concern was evident among ordinary citizens. Just two months earlier, the same government stripped native title holders of land rights, also to facilitate Adani\u2019s mine. White Australia\u2019s original destruction of Indigenous sovereignty was repeated in miniature for a project that will accelerate climate crisis. Separate climate protests in Melbourne in the early part of this month were marked by police beating protesters, one officer apparently flashing a white power hand signal (his social media posts were later found to be festooned with 4chan memes), and another sporting a sticker reading \u201cEAD (eat a dick) hippy\u201d on his chest-mounted body camera. The officers were subject to a day or two of critical coverage across a range of outlets and Victoria police expressed disappointment. But the men are still serving. And there was no broader, more searching consideration of how widely such attitudes were held among police, and whether they were compatible with the duties involved with policing protests. Police are still given the benefit of every doubt in Australia; even the most egregious and obvious exemplars of bias and corruption will find defenders. Coverage and debate often seems to begin with the premise that police are constitutionally incapable of wrongdoing. Often police are coddled by the same media organisation that mounts extended campaigns against people who express public opinions \u2013 most enthusiastically when they are members of marginalised groups. Attempts to crush protest and dissent and the repetition of Indigenous dispossession are not the actions of a cheeky, irreverent or anti-authoritarian people. I am far from the first to critically point to the hollow nature of contemporary larrikinism, and Australia\u2019s apparent thirst for authority. I\u2019ll likely not be the last either \u2014 the climate emergency, a consequent increase in the flow of refugees, and the increasing probability of economic headwinds will lead to righteous anger and protest in the future. If current trends are any guide, they will be met by an increasingly authoritarian response from the state and police. And we\u2019ll once again have occasion to compare the myth of our national character against the limits that have been imposed on our capacity to voice political dissatisfaction. There is an element of our penal past that we can draw on in resisting that outcome. A subset of convicts were Irish rebels, political prisoners of rebellions against the colonial British government in Ireland. Some of these people also fed political rebellions in Australia, like the one at Castle Hill in 1804. The rebellions failed but they originated a strain of Australian radicalism that really was anti-authoritarian, which was visible in the labour movement in its best moments, the struggle against conscription in the first world war, resistance to authoritarian populists such as Joh Bjelke-Petersen, protests against apartheid and the Vietnam war, the long struggle for Indigenous rights, and actions against refugee detention such as those in Woomera at the turn of the century. Climate protesters and those who protested the death of Kumanjayi Walker this month are the heirs of that. We\u2019ll need to rediscover that determination to place limits on authority \u2013 to suspect and resist it \u2013 if we\u2019re going to confront the powerful vested interests who don\u2019t want us to address mounting crises (water, fire, land degradation, climate) and the injustices wrought in our names on Indigenous Australians, refugees and migrants. If we don\u2019t, Australia might start looking like a prison again. Jason Wilson is a Guardian Australia columnist Comments on this post will be pre-moderated",

      "bodyText": "Reg Livermore\u2019s 1975 one-man show, Betty Blokk-Buster Follies, upended Australia\u2019s theatre establishment - and held a mirror up to a changing world. Few productions have shaken up the story of Australian theatre quite like this one. When the raunchy cabaret, the handiwork of Livermore, a then-fledgling performer who\u2019d previously starred in The Rocky Horror Show, premiered at the Balmain Bijou in 1975 it played to sell-out audiences over its eight-month season before touring around the country. Despite animosity from the media, the one-man show - which starred Livermore as Betty Blokk-Buster, a German maid who headed up a troupe of down-and-out characters such as the Football Ballerina and Vaseline Amyl Nitrate - connected powerfully with Australians, reflecting and challenging their social mores. Ahead of Betty Blokk-Buster Reimagined, a new production that will premiere at the Sydney Festival in 2020, we speak with Livermore and the show\u2019s star Josh Quong Tart about the significance of Betty Blokk-Buster - and what the show means now. Cabaret, a form with roots in 19th-century France, draws on bawdy humour and marginalised characters to hold up a mirror to middle-class audiences. Why do you think it is subversive? Reg Livermore: I never considered what I was doing as cabaret as such. I was actor-driven and the predicaments of my characters were important to me.

She would give a Nazi salute and there was a big cricket scoreboard that rolled on behind her with instructions for the audience. But she was there to make people happy. [Josh] is an all-round great performer who is prone to moments of wildness, which will stand him in good stead. Quong Tart: Betty sets up the show, she has a very important function and that is to get the audience to be an active participant in the show, she gives, no, she \u2018demands\u2019 participation. It sets up a hell of a night out. Reg is a legend. Reg told me that the spirit of the show is important, that is what we are trying to capture with this \u2018reimagined version\u2019 so I want to do something that will make him proud. How do you hope audiences will respond to Betty Blokk-Buster in 2020? Livermore: There are people for whom the memory of it is quite precious, so I hope that it is a jolly good show and that people get a buzz out of it. Quong Tart: I\u2019m so excited to be getting in that room with the full band. When the costumes, the lighting, the music and the material come together, it will be incredible. Betty Blokk-Buster Reimagined has its world premiere at the Magic Mirrors Spiegeltent in Hyde Park from 7-26 January 2020 Book your Betty Blokk-Buster Reimagined tickets now.",

The FT reported that the document was sent to senior Whitehall officials last week and said that implementing the Northern Ireland protocol before next December was a \u201cstrategic, political and operational challenge\u201d. The protocol would implement a form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK \u2013 an alternative arrangement to the Northern Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d in the withdrawal agreement. Civil servants reportedly highlighted the \u201clegal and political\u201d repercussions both within the UK and Europe of failing to deliver Brexit on time, which Boris Johnson has made it the focal issue of his election campaign. Doubt was also cast on the free-trade agreement that Johnson has pledged to establish with the EU next year, with the document, marked \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d, reportedly stating that \u201cdelivery on the ground would need to commence before we know the outcome of negotiations\u201d. The government said it did not comment on leaks, but insisted that its deal with the EU would comprehensively withdraw the whole of the UK \u2013 including Northern Ireland. It reiterated its commitment to complete the process before December 2020. The exposure came after Labour released leaked Treasury reports last week that concluded customs checks could be required on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, with the possibility that tariffs could also be imposed. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and the government\u2019s impact assessment have both suggested checks could be implemented. Despite this, Johnson told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge that the report was \u201cwrong\u201d, in an interview on Sunday morning, insisting that there \u201cwon\u2019t be checks\u201d on the goods.

The group has warned that unless the ECT undergoes a fundamental overhaul in talks this week, it risks undermining the European green new deal, which is to be unveiled on Wednesday by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission.

That has led many to decry a clear conflict of interest \u2013 something the RFL denies \u2013 and Lenagan admits he can see where those concerns come from. \u201cThe complexity and situation surrounding the RFL acquiring the lease certainly is peculiar,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand the scepticism surrounding it. The whole issue of conflict of interest does make things difficult here but I have experienced those difficulties with the EFL in the past due to my involvement in other business. Nigel knows a lot about rugby and he was in a strong position at the RFL \u2013 though I\u2019m not suggesting he was a party to anything that\u2019s happened. Some of the things that have occurred there are unfortunate but it\u2019s been a mess for seven or eight years now.\u201d",

The sum depends on the severity of the GDPR breach, and factors including the level of cooperation of the company involved. For example, British Airways, which cooperated with the ICO investigation,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/08/ba-fine-customer-data-breach-british-airways\">was fined 1.5% of global turnover</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Where does the money go?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Fines received by the ICO go back to the Treasury.

Companies are allowed to appeal against the scale of the fines \u2013 British Airways and Marriott have said they will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/09/marriott-fined-over-gdpr-breach-ico\">put up a \u201cvigorous\u201d defence</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So how much tougher are the fines under the new GDPR legislation?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A lot tougher. Last year Facebook was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/25/facebook-fined-uk-privacy-access-user-data-cambridge-analytica\">fined \u00a3500,000 by the ICO</a>&nbsp;over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/04/facebook-cambridge-analytica-user-data-latest-more-than-thought\">data of up to 87</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/04/facebook-cambridge-analytica-user-data-latest-more-than-thought\">&nbsp;million users improperly shared with third-party developers without sufficient consent</a>. At the time the ICO lamented the fact that this was the maximum fine it was allowed to impose under the old data protection legislation - it could have handed down a fine of up to \u00a31.26bn (4% of revenue) had the case had been eligible under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gdpr\">GDPR</a>.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marksweney\"><b>Mark Sweney</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pascal Crowe, Open Rights Group\u2019s data and democracy project officer, said abuse of personal data was a \u201csystemic\u201d issue in UK politics and there were serious concerns about the legality of the parties\u2019 practices.</p> \n<p>Data subject access requests to the Labour party had returned \u201cunintelligible\u201d data.

In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2020?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further potential Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing another tough year in 2020. The latest rise in the national minimum wage in April will also add to costs and hit profits. On the plus side, there are hopes of a boost to the housing market from increased certainty about Brexit after the general election. There are also signs that the shift to online shopping is slowing, potentially easing the pressure on high streets.</p>\n    <p><b>Sarah Butler</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Springboard analyst Diane Wehrle said that while high streets always tend to suffer more from rain than other shopping destinations, many retail parks had also taken action to slow their rate of decline, including by adding more restaurants.</p> \n<p>Overall retail footfall across the high street, shopping centres and retail parks declined by 3.4% year on year in November, said Springboard, based on data from 480 shopping locations.</p> \n<p>Black Friday, the day on which retailers offer heavy discounts to kick off the Christmas shopping season, fell on 29 November this year, meaning it was outside of the period covered by Springboard\u2019s figures.</p> \n<p>Early figures suggested that the event may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/02/uk-retailers-outstanding-black-friday-sales\">offered some relief to struggling retailers</a>, with Barclaycard reporting transaction values up 16.5% year on year from data covering about a pound in every \u00a33 spent in the UK.

The ONS retail figures showed that the quantity bought in retail sales increased by only 0.2% in the three months to October 2019 when compared with the previous three months, the lowest growth since April 2018. The pressures on retailers have prompted drastic action: more than 85,000 jobs were axed over the 12 months to October, according to the British Retail Consortium. It has also put particular scrutiny on retail property owners. The investment manager M&amp;G on Wednesday announced that it had suspended withdrawals of money from its property portfolio fund, saying that an unusually high level of investors had asked to get their money back. Investors have withdrawn \u00a32.8bn from 15 major open-ended commercial property funds in the past year, according to the data firm Morningstar.",

The government directive is likely to be a blow to US multinational companies such as HP, Dell and Microsoft, and mirrors attempts by Washington to limit the use of Chinese technology, as the trade war between the countries turns into a tech cold war. The Trump administration banned US companies from doing business with the Chinese telecoms company Huawei this year and Google, Intel and Qualcomm announced they would freeze cooperation with Huawei. By excluding China from western knowhow, the Trump administration has made it clear that the real battle is about which of the two economic superpowers has the technological edge for the next two decades. This is the first known public directive from Beijing setting specific targets limiting China\u2019s use of foreign technology, though it is part a wider move within China to increase its reliance on domestic technology. The FT reported that the directive would result in an estimated 20m to 30m pieces of hardware needing to be replaced and that this work would begin in 2020. Analysts told the FT that 30% of substitutions would take place in 2020, 50% in 2021 and 20% in 2022. The order had come from the Chinese Communist party\u2019s central office earlier this year, the analysts said.
