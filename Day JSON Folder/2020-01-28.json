In 2018-19 the department racked up a bill of $5.7m for charter flights and $400,000 for commercial flights, according to an answer to a question on notice provided in December. The figures exclude standing costs to keep planes at the ready for departmental use and do not include transport costs for personnel accompanying the person being transferred. The questions on notice also reveal the department spent $111m on legal costs in 2018-19, including $72m on external lawyers and $39m on internal legal expenditure. Last year\u2019s legal bill is a $19m increase on the $92m the department spent in 2017-18 and is up from $79m in 2016-17, figures in those years\u2019 annual reports show. The home affairs legal bill also dwarfs that of other major departments including the department of human services, which spent $47.6m last year, the health department ($26m), social services ($7.6m) and treasury ($4.4m). The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, called on the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, to explain \u201cwhy these costs within his mega-department \u2026 continue to go up year after year and if he is even bothering to keep account of how taxpayers\u2019 money is being administered in his portfolio\u201d. Keneally accused Dutton of \u201cwaste and mismanagement\u201d, citing the $423m contract given to garrison services contractor Paladin and the Australian Federal Police\u2019s unpaid superannuation bill. Guardian Australia contacted Dutton for comment. In October 2018 the home affairs department revealed it spent more than $275,000 in 2017-18 challenging requests for urgent medical transfers of asylum seekers and refugees on Nauru and Manus Island. The Greens immigration spokesman, Nick McKim, said Australia\u2019s immigration detention regime \u201cis not only unnecessarily punitive and cruel, it\u2019s also a colossal waste of money\u201d. \u201cThere are hundreds of people who have been detained for years, many of whom are constantly moved around the detention network, far away from their families and support networks, for no apparent reason,\u201d he said. \u201cThe family from Biloela currently detained on Christmas Island is a classic example of this. \u201cHome affairs is also wasting vast amounts of public funds fighting unwinnable cases in courts and tribunals.\u201d In the latest figures, the home affairs department also reveals it spent $17m on staff overtime in 2018-19. The Commonwealth director of public prosecutions disclosed that its prosecution of the whistleblower Witness K, who revealed Australia\u2019s spying on East Timor, and his lawyer, Bernard Collaery, has cost $227,971 to date. Witness K has indicated he will plead guilty to a summary offence in the ACT magistrates court, while Collaery is fighting the prosecution in the ACT supreme court.",

She said it was difficult to know how long the outbreak would last, adding: \u201cIt is hard to predict but, certainly, the cat is out of the bag. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know the full picture \u2013 they are running very short on diagnostic kits in China \u2013 and the truth is we don\u2019t know where all the people are who are infected.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>It was likely far more thousands of people are infected than the cases confirmed in China, she said. </p> \n  <p>Dr Rohn said it was possible the virus could last several months but it could also end as the seasons change. \u201cSome of these respiratory viruses are seasonal \u2013 there could be a peak and then there\u2019s a lull,\u201d she said. \u201cWe may have some breathing space but to be honest we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T13:45:17.223Z\">at 1.45pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e3033a38f086a28115a0e5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T13:18:41.027Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Health experts say they are unsurprised by the human to human transmissions of coronavirus in Japan, Vietnam and Germany. </p> \n  <p><strong>Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The reported human to human transmission in Germany and Japan is unsurprising to see. We will continue to see further similar cases outside of China, but the indications are at this stage that onwards transmission will be limited, so there will likely not be too many cases for example across Europe, and on a much lesser scale than we are seeing in China.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p> <strong>Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine, the Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, said:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The recent reports would now bring to a total of three confirmed cases \u2013 in Vietnam, Japan and Germany \u2013 who have not visited China but only been in contact with cases from China. The fact that person to person transmission is occurring outside of China is not too surprising. The Vietnamese case was reported by WHO and he was in contact with his sick father who had returned from China. The Japanese case was a tour bus driver who had driven around two groups of Chinese tourists and the German cases had attended a work-based training event also attended by a woman who only became ill two days later during her return to China two days later.

      "bodyText": "A German man who tested positive for the strain of coronavirus sweeping across China was infected by a work colleague, officials said on Tuesday, in what is believed to be the first human transmission in Europe. The Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday the high-speed rail service between the city and mainland China would be suspended from Thursday, and all cross-border ferry services would also be suspended in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said the government is working on plans to repatriate UK nationals in Wuhan, the Chinese region at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. He called on Britons in the region to contact the British consulate. The head of the World Health Organization has said he is confident in China\u2019s ability to contain a new coronavirus that has killed 106 people and he called for calm, Chinese media reported. Footage has emerged appearing to show a man being forcibly removed from the Guangzhou metro by security staff for not wearing a face mask, after the South China province implemented a mandatory order to wear them because of the coronavirus crisis. Chinese companies are working overtime to produce masks amid soaring demand caused by the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday China was sure of defeating the \u201cdevil\u201d coronavirus, in comments carried by Chinese state television. Xi spoke after he met the World Health Organization (WHO) chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Beijing to discuss how to protect Chinese and foreigners in areas affected by the virus and \u201cpossible\u201d evacuation alternatives, a WHO spokesman said. State television quoted Xi as saying: The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide. China will strengthen international cooperation and welcomes the WHO participation in virus prevention \u2026 China is confident of winning the battle against the virus. A WHO panel of 16 independent experts twice last week declined to declare an international emergency. Traditionally, the WHO is reluctant to antagonise or ostracise countries dealing with epidemics for fear of undermining future willingness to report cases of infectious disease outbreaks. There have been 97 cases of suspected coronavirus tested in the UK, but so far no positive diagnoses. Taiwan has reported its first case of domestic transmission of the new coronavirus. Taiwan\u2019s central epidemic command centre said the latest patient, the eighth, was the first case of transmission on the island as in all the previous cases the people had been infected first in China. The new patient, a man in his 50s from central Taiwan, was infected by his wife after she returned from working in China and before she was subsequently diagnosed, the command centre said. The man is in a stable condition, it said. The academic pubilsher Wiley has compiled 54 research articles relating to the coronavirus, listed them on a single page, and has made them free to read for the next few months, as the world battles to contain the outbreak. Here is Wiley\u2019s announcement: Wiley has identified 54 articles related to the coronavirus and is providing free access to this research to support outbreak relief efforts in China and other countries. These important pieces of literature will remain free until April 2020, with the window of time extended as needed. Newly published articles related to coronavirus will immediately be free to access during this time period, and will be posted to the coronavirus research page. Access to 54 medical and scientific articles includes research from the Journal of Medical Virology, Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, Zoonoses and Public Health and many more. The coronavirus outbreak could last several months and its course is unpredictable, with many thousands more people likely to have been affected than official figures suggest, according to Dr Jennifer Rohn, a specialist in cell biology at University College London. In an interview with the PA Media news agency, Rohn said it was possible the UK already has cases of coronavirus that have not been detected. \u201cIt is possible that somebody has slipped through the net,\u201d she said. \u201cThe symptoms are incredibly common to lots of other things that aren\u2019t harmful at all.\u201d But she added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we got a couple of cases soon.\u201d According to Rohn, the virus was spreading more quickly than Sars but was less deadly. She said it was difficult to know how long the outbreak would last, adding: \u201cIt is hard to predict but, certainly, the cat is out of the bag. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the full picture \u2013 they are running very short on diagnostic kits in China \u2013 and the truth is we don\u2019t know where all the people are who are infected.\u201d It was likely far more thousands of people are infected than the cases confirmed in China, she said. Dr Rohn said it was possible the virus could last several months but it could also end as the seasons change. \u201cSome of these respiratory viruses are seasonal \u2013 there could be a peak and then there\u2019s a lull,\u201d she said. \u201cWe may have some breathing space but to be honest we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Health experts say they are unsurprised by the human to human transmissions of coronavirus in Japan, Vietnam and Germany. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: The reported human to human transmission in Germany and Japan is unsurprising to see. We will continue to see further similar cases outside of China, but the indications are at this stage that onwards transmission will be limited, so there will likely not be too many cases for example across Europe, and on a much lesser scale than we are seeing in China. Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine, the Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, said: The recent reports would now bring to a total of three confirmed cases \u2013 in Vietnam, Japan and Germany \u2013 who have not visited China but only been in contact with cases from China. The fact that person to person transmission is occurring outside of China is not too surprising. The Vietnamese case was reported by WHO and he was in contact with his sick father who had returned from China. The Japanese case was a tour bus driver who had driven around two groups of Chinese tourists and the German cases had attended a work-based training event also attended by a woman who only became ill two days later during her return to China two days later. The German case is most worrying because if the Chinese woman was indeed asymptomatic at the time of the training session it would confirm reports of spread before symptoms develop making standard control strategies less effective. This new information reinforces the importance of Public Health England\u2019s current advice that if anyone has returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days they should \u201dstay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with other flu viruses\u201d and \u201dcontact NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the city\u201d. I would add that this advice should also be followed by anyone who has been to any other area in China where the infection is known to be common or if they know they have been in contact with a presumed case. There have now been 45 confirmed cases in 13 countries outside of China, with no deaths so far, the WHO\u2019s spokesman, Christian Lindmeier, told a briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. Reuters reports: The WHO said a case in Vietnam involved human-to-human transmission outside China and a Japanese official has said there was a suspected case of human-to-human transmission there, too. Andreas Zapf, the president of Bavaria\u2019s office for health and food safety, said on Tuesday the person infected was 33 years old and had come into contact with a Chinese woman on 21 January. Zapf said the woman was from Shanghai but her parents, who are from the Wuhan region, had visited her a few days earlier. He added that she had arrived in Germany on 19 January, appearing not to have any symptoms, but began to feel ill on her flight home on 23 January. She sought medical treatment after landing and tested positive for coronavirus. When that information was relayed back to the German company, a male employee said he felt like he had flu over the weekend and was on Monday advised to get medical treatment. The head doctor at the clinic where the man is being treated told a news conference the patient was awake and responsive and he did not think the man\u2019s life was at risk. Bavaria\u2019s health ministry said people who had been in contact with the man had been informed of possible symptoms, hygiene measures and transmission channels. Good afternoon, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the blog while Damien has lunch. According to a recent update from Public Health England, of the 73 UK tests that have been carried out, 73 were confirmed negative and none positive. The health body notes: The risk to the UK population has been assessed as low. This has been raised from very low due to current evidence on the ability for the virus to spread between people. Taiwan has raised its travel warning for China, saying people should avoid going unless absolutely necessary amid an outbreak of the new coronavirus there, Reuters reports. The island has reported seven confirmed cases of the virus so far. Taiwan\u2019s central epidemic command centre said it had raised its previous advice and would extend to the rest of China an existing warning not to go to Hubei province unless totally necessary, though Hong Kong and Macau are excluded. Taiwan also has rolled out strict curbs on Chinese visitors, restricting a vast majority of them. Last week, Taiwan\u2019s government announced a one-month ban on the export of specialist masks designed to be used for medical personnel, saying it had to look after the needs of its own people first. Some pharmacies in Taiwan have reported shortages of face masks since the island reported its first case a week ago, and the government says it is working to ensure supplies. In a separate notice on Tuesday, the government said it would release more stock of masks, but limit each person to buying a maximum of three. However, it also issued a reminder that most healthy people do not need to wear masks all the time. The Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, visiting people on Tuesday to extend lunar new year wishes, said the government was fully prepared to deal with the virus and people should not panic. \u201cOur anti-epidemic work does not take holidays, and is taking place 24 hours a day,\u201d the presidential office quoted her as saying. A German man who tested positive for the strain of coronavirus sweeping across China was infected by a work colleague, officials said on Tuesday, in what is believed to be the first human transmission in Europe, AFP reports. The man had not visited China but a Chinese work colleague who was in Germany last week had started to feel sick on the flight home on 23 January, said Andreas Zapf, the head of the Bavarian state office for health and food safety. He had attended a training session given by his Chinese colleague on 21 January at the office of a car parts supplier Webasto in Stockdorf in Bavaria and tested positive for the virus on Monday evening. Unlike the other patients, the 33-year-old had not recently travelled to China. He remains in hospital in an isolation ward, but Zapf said he \u201cwas doing well\u201d. The Chinese woman immediately sought medical attention on her return to China and was confirmed to have caught the virus, which has spread rapidly in recent weeks after first emerging in the city of Wuhan. The woman had recently returned from visiting her parents in the Wuhan region, Zapf said. In a statement, the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China \u201cfor at least the next two weeks\u201d. Health officials are checking 40 people that the two infected workers have been in contact with recently, including colleagues and family members. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, have discussed ways to protect Chinese and foreigners in areas affected by the coronavirus and \u201cpossible alternatives\u201d to evacuations, Reuters reports. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who arrived in Beijing on Monday, will return to Geneva on Wednesday, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a Geneva briefing. The WHO emergency committee is being \u201ckept in the loop\u201d on the evolution of the outbreak, which has spread to 13 other countries, he said. The WHO has not seen onward human-to-human spread of the virus by travellers returning from China apart from a second family member infected by a returning relative in Vietnam, which is \u201cgood news but of course this could change\u201d, Lindmeier said. This startling footage shows football teams playing in China\u2019s domestic league arriving in facemasks, then playing their match in an empty stadium in Shanghai. The Chinese embassy in Copenhagen is demanding that one of Denmark\u2019s biggest newspapers apologise for a cartoon on the outbreak of a deadly virus, which it considers an insult to China, the Associated Press reports. The chief editor at Jyllands-Posten, Jacob Nybroe, said the cartoon, which shows the Chinese flag with what resembles viruses instead of stars, did not intend to mock or ridicule China. \u201cWe can\u2019t apologise for something we don\u2019t think is wrong,\u201d Nybroe said on the newspaper\u2019s website. \u201cAs far as I can see, there are two different types of cultural understanding here.\u201d The embassy expressed its strong indignation and said the cartoon, which was printed on Monday, was an insult to China and crossed the bottom line of civilised society and the ethical boundary of free speech and offended human conscience. Jyllands-Posten was embroiled in a previous cartoon-related controversy in 2005 when it published 12 editorial cartoons depicting the Muslim prophet Muhammad, leading to protests around the world, including violent demonstrations and riots in some Muslim countries. The Japanese health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said a person in Japan who had not visited Wuhan has contracted the new coronavirus, Reuters cited the Jiji news agency as reporting on Tuesday. Japanese media reported that the patient was a tour bus driver in his 60s from Nara Prefecture who drove tourists from Wuhan twice a month. He was diagnosed with pneumonia on 25 January, Fukui Shimbun reported. If confirmed, it is the first case of human to human transmission of the new coronavirus in Japan. The Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday the high-speed rail service between the city and mainland China would be suspended from Thursday, and all cross-border ferry services would also be suspended in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus, Reuters reports. Wearing a green face mask, Lam told a press briefing the number of flights to mainland China would also be halved and personal travel permits for mainland Chinese to the city would be suspended. It comes as Hong Kong health workers threatened to strike from tomorrow over the territory\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. One of their demands is to close the border with the mainland. Two more confirmed cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed in Singapore, bringing the total number of infected patients in the city state to seven, the Straits Times reports, citing the Singaporean heath ministry. The country is imposing new entry restrictions on travellers with passports issued in Hubei, the Chinese province where the outbreak began, or those who have recently travelled there. Quarantine orders are to be imposed on the most high risk among 2,000 recent travellers to the area already in Singapore. All seven coronavirus patients diagnosed in Singapore so far have been from Wuhan. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said the government is working on plans to repatriate UK nationals in Wuhan, the Chinese region at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. He called on Britons in the region to contact the British consulate. His call comes as the UK appeared to be lagging behind other countries in efforts to get their nationals out of the region. Speaking on BBC Breakfast this morning, Shapps said: We are working on it. For anybody who is there, one of the issues we have, working with our partners internationally on this, is actually identifying how many British citizens there are in Wuhan. One of the things we\u2019re asking people to do is to contact the consulate there to make them aware. People have started to do that. We are working on arrangements as well. So making contact would be very helpful indeed ... If they actually contact the consulate where they are then that consulate is in fact gathering together all the information of the people who are there in order to help repatriate where that\u2019s appropriate. That is very much what\u2019s required at this stage. More than half a million South Koreans have signed a petition calling for a ban on people from China entering the country, Reuters reports. A petition filed with the presidential Blue House on Thursday had gathered more than 530,000 signatures by Tuesday, highlighting a growing fear in South Korea that the coronavirus could spread widely. The first confirmed case detected in South Korea was a Chinese national, but the other three so far are South Koreans who travelled from Wuhan, where the outbreak appears to have started. That has not stopped the calls for Chinese visitors to be banned. \u201cCoronavirus is spreading from China. Even North Korea is banning Chinese people from entering the country,\u201d wrote the anonymous author of the petition, adding that even a temporary ban would help stop the virus from spreading too widely. The Blue House has not directly responded to the petition. When asked about other countries\u2019 bans on Chinese entries, its spokesman on Tuesday said only that the issue should be handled in close consultation with the World Health Organisation. The head of the World Health Organization has said he is confident in China\u2019s ability to contain a new coronavirus that has killed 106 people and he called for calm, Chinese media reported. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a meeting with State Councilor Wang Yi in Beijing, said he approved of the government\u2019s measures to curb the outbreak, the Xinhua state news agency said. He said he did not think foreigners should be evacuated. Ghebreyesus was not available for comment but his agency said his aim was to strengthen the partnership with China, in particular on the response. A WHO panel of 16 independent experts twice last week declined to declare an international emergency over the outbreak. While more cases have been emerging outside China in people who have travelled from there recently, the WHO said only one of the overseas cases involved human-to-human transmission. \u201cThat\u2019s still one case too many. But we\u2019re encouraged that so far we have not seen more human-to-human transmission outside China,\u201d the WHO said on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring the outbreak constantly.\u201d Countries around the world are planning to evacuate diplomatic staff and private citizens from Chinese areas hit by the new coronavirus, Reuters reports. The news agency has compiled some countries\u2019 evacuation plans, and how they are planning to manage the health risk from those who are returning. France\u2019s first plane to repatriate nationals from Wuhan will leave Paris on Wednesday and return the next day. The flight will carry people with no symptoms, junior transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebarri told television channel CNews. \u201cThese people will be put under quarantine. And then there will be a second flight, at a yet undefined date, with people showing symptoms ... who will be cared for in Paris,\u201d he said. South Korea plans to send charter flights this week to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Tuesday. The planes will arrive in the city as early as Thursday, he told a ministerial meeting aimed at discussing efforts to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Japan will send a charter flight to Wuhan on Tuesday night. Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said the flight can carry around 200 passengers, but added about 650 citizens hope to return to Japan. Motegi said Tokyo is making arrangements for extra flights to Wuhan as early as Wednesday. Those with symptoms such as fever will be sent to hospital on landing at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport, while those with no signs of virus can go home and then to work or school, but will be advised to avoid crowds and take their temperatures twice a day. Kazakhstan has asked Beijing to allow 98 Kazakh students to leave the city of Wuhan, deputy foreign minister Shukhrat Nuryshev said. Germany will evacuate 90 citizens living in China\u2019s Wuhan region. Morocco will evacuate 100 citizens, mostly students, from the Wuhan area. Spain\u2019s government is working with China and the European Union to repatriate Spanish nationals from the Wuhan area, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said. The U.S. State Department said it will evacuate personnel from its Wuhan consulate to the United States and offer a limited number of seats to private U.S. citizens on a flight. Some private citizens will be able to board the \u201csingle flight\u201d leaving Wuhan on Jan. 28 for San Francisco, it said. Canada has about 167 nationals in the Wuhan area, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said on Monday, and eight people have sought consular assistance, which is being provided. While the minister did not rule out possible evacuations, he did not indicate there were any planned at the moment, adding that each consular request would be evaluated on a \u201ccase by case basis\u201d. Russia has been in talks with China about evacuating its nationals from Wuhan and Hubei province, Russia\u2019s embassy in China said. The Dutch government is assessing ways to evacuate 20 Dutch citizens from Wuhan, press agency ANP reported. Authorities in Myanmar said they had cancelled a planned evacuation of 60 students from Mandalay who were studying in Wuhan. Kyaw Yin Myint, a spokesman for the Mandalay municipal government, told Reuters that a \u201cfinal decision\u201d had been made to send them back after 14 days, once the virus\u2019 incubation period had passed. Britain is talking to international partners to find solutions to help British and other foreign nationals leave Wuhan, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. Doctors and nurses in Hong Kong are planning to strike tomorrow out of anger at the way authorities have dealt with the coronavirus crisis, sources within the territory\u2019s protest movement have confirmed to the Guardian. People in Hong Kong are furious that the border with the mainland has remained open, that authorities have failed to hand out enough face masks to prevent the spread of infection, and that they are allowing people from the mainland to come over for free medical checks. DW News\u2019s east Asia correspondent, William Yang, has tweeted a translation of the latest advice from China\u2019s national health commission, which says that patients with less severe cases of coronavirus are still contagious - but perhaps less so. Hello, this is Damien Gayle, in London, taking over the reins of the live blog this morning. If you have any updates or comments on the coronavirus outbreak and you want to get in touch then you can email me at damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via my Twitter profile @damiengayle. Here\u2019s a summary of what we now about the coronavirus outbreak so far on Tuesday: 106 people have died from coronavirus in China China has more than 4,500 confirmed cases, with nearly 1,000 in a critical condition China\u2019s Health Commission says that the main transmission is through \u201crespiratory droplets\u201d (coughing) and then touch. Incubation is generally 3-7 days, maximum 14 days, the commission says The US has updated its travel advice to the highest level which means avoid all non-essential travel to China Asian markets have fallen on concerns about the virus spreading Germany has recorded its first case of the virus as has Sri Lanka Australian state of NSW advises school children returning from summer break not to go back if they have been in China in past two weeks Several countries are sending charter flights to evacuate their citizens Thailand on Tuesday confirmed six more cases of coronavirus among visitors from China, bringing the country\u2019s total to 14 cases, a health official said. Five of the new cases, aged 6 to 70 years, came from Hubei province and are part of the same family, the deputy director-general of the Department of Disease Control, Tanarak Plipat, told reporters. The other patient came from Chongqing, For foreign citizens trapped in Wuhan, attention will turn in the next few days to airlifts. Japan said it would send a chartered flight to Wuhan on Tuesday night to evacuate its citizens, while the US government is also preparing an airlift. France and South Korea are also preparing an evacuation but there\u2019s been criticism of the slow response by the British authorities. You can read our full story below. South Korea plans to send charter flights this week to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, the epicentre of a virus outbreak in China, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Tuesday, according to the Reuters news agency. The planes will arrive in the city as early as Thursday, he told a ministerial meeting aimed at discussing efforts to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency says six people are being tested for coronavirus. There are four confirmed cases. The Global Times is reporting that the Chinese city of Tianjin, in northern China, is to launch a \u201cwartime mechanism\u201d, putting one of its general hospitals and 500 medical teams in the city under military management. It\u2019s the first Chinese city to take the step, according to the Global Times. Tianjin is about 120km south-east of Beijing. Its population is around 15 million people. There are a few interesting sites tracking the increase in coronavirus cases. This one from John\u2019s Hopkins university in the US is one of the best. It clearly shows the steep rise in confirmed infections each day in the past week, from around 280 on 20 January, to over 4,500 today. One of the curious thing to come out of the Australian news conference about school advice with regards to coronavirus, is that speakers reiterated that there hasn\u2019t been person-to-person transmission of the virus in Australia. \u201cThere is no evidence,\u201d said the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant. Yesterday the federal health minister also said there was no human-to-human transmission in Australia. It does seem difficult to see why the virus would behave differently in Australia, given the Chinese health authorities have said that transmission is through \u201crespiratory droplets\u201d (coughing) and touch. I\u2019m assuming the ministers mean there has been no evidence so far of human-to-human transmission in Australia. The NSW education minister Sarah Mitchell was also at the press conference regarding change of advice for children returning after the long summer break. She said it is the right decision: \u201cWe know that many in the community have been wanting to see this. I think it is important we are taking this precautionary measure in line with community sentiment but also knowing we are doing everything we can even though the risk is low, to ensure the safety in that school environment,\u201d she said. Whether to allow children to return to school has been the subject of considerable controversy in Australia over the past few days. On Monday, a number of Sydney private schools issued much stricter restrictions on children who had been in China returning to school. As of yesterday afternoon, one asked that any children who had travelled to China in the holidays remain at home for 14 days after they returned, and do not return to school without a medical certificate. The decision is particularly controversial in Australia as only this morning the federal education minister, Dan Tehan, chastising schools for telling students to stay away. The exclusion period announced in Australia for school children is for 14 days since returning to the country. So if NSW school students arrived back in Australia in mid-January, they would be able to start school this week if the 14-day period had passed. At the new conference, Hazzard was asked if it was compulsory for children who had travelled in China to keep their children home from school until the 14-day incubation period had passed, and essentially the answer was that it is a request and they hope people will comply. In Australia the New South Wales government has announced that it is changing its advice with regards to parents sending their children back to school after the long summer break. Children who have returned from China in the past two weeks have been asked to stay home from school. \u201cThis is one of the most difficult decisions I have made,\u201d said the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard. \u201cWe have decided that New South Wales is the epicentre of what\u2019s occurring,\u201d he said. \u201cWe apologise to parents who may find themselves in this situation.\u201d The decision will apply to teachers and students in the NSW health system as well. Japan\u2019s government will send a chartered flight to Wuhan on Tuesday night to evacuate its nationals wishing to return home, according to the Reuters news agency. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, told reporters the flight could carry around 200 passengers, but added about 650 Japanese citizens are hoping to come back to Japan. Motegi said the government is making arrangements for additional flights that will leave for Wuhan as early as Wednesday. We reported earlier that the National Health Commission had issued new figures for deaths and infections, including 4,515 confirmed cases of the virus. State media is reporting that 976 - or just over 20% of cases \u2013 are patients in a critical condition. It also says there are 6,973 suspected cases in China. China Global TV Network published a map of infections in China (in which it includes Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan). The streets of Wuhan are still largely empty says the New York Times\u2019 reporter Chris Buckley. With millions largely confined to their homes because of the coronavirus in China, social media is awash with novel ways to stave off boredom \u2013 from indoor fishing to singing challenges, as our correspondent Michael Standaert reports. The Philippines has suspended its usual practice of issuing visas upon arrival (VUA) to Chinese visitors in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. The bureau of immigration commissioner Jaime Morente said in a statement: \u201cThe Civil Aeronautics Board has already suspended direct flights from Wuhan province,\u201d said Morente. \u201cWe are now temporarily suspending the issuance of VUA for Chinese nationals to slow down the influx of group tours,\u201d he added. The VUA facility is often used by groups of Chinese tourists but Morente emphasised that Chinese visitors were not barred from the Philippines, but would be subject to checks for the virus. China accounts for around 20% of tourist visits to the Philippines. \u201cWe have not received any directive imposing policy changes on Chinese nationals,\u201d said Morente. \u201cBut we are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry of the 2019-nCov,\u201d he stated. Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, has just been been speaking about the virus and its impact on Australian in China and at home, where there have been five confirmed cases. He said the cabinet\u2019s national security committee met yesterday to discuss the threat posed by the virus and would continue to meet every few days. Australia is working with the Chinese government to deploy consular officials into Hubei province and into Wuhan. \u201cThis is essential to assist us as we then consider the further options of support that we can provide to Australian citizens who are in Wuhan and in Hubei Province more broadly,\u201d he said amid growing calls for Australia to follow the example of the US and Japan and evacuate its citizens from the virus epicentre. The virus sent Australia\u2019s stock market tumbling today. Read all about it, and the potentially negative impact on tourism, with this report from our business writer Ben Butler: Sri Lanka has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus, according to the Chinese state news service CGTN. It said the victim was a Chinese tourist who arrived in the south Asian country on 19 Janaury but became ill on 25 January. A report on the website of the Hindu newspaper said the victim was a woman in her 40s and was from the locked down Chinese province of Hubei. With regards to the number of infections, it seems the figure issued just over an hour ago of 4,193 cases in China has been updated to 4,515, according to the state-run Global Times. According to CGTN, this includes 8 in Hong Kong, 7 in Macao and 5 in Taiwan. The death toll remains 106. China\u2019s National Health Commission issued guidance on treating the coronavirus last night (27 January). It says \u201crespiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission\u201d, but it can also be transmitted through contact. It says \u201cbased on current epidemiological investigations, the incubation period is generally 3-7 days, with the longest no more than 14 days\u201d. As I mentioned earlier, the US consulate in Wuhan is preparing to fly its diplomats and some other Americans out of the country. Many other countries are also considering this, such as Japan, Mongolia, and France. Australia has identified about 400 citizens how have registered for help to get out of Hubei, but it does not have an embassy in Wuhan, which is likely making the situation more complicated. Indian diplomatic officials are also apparently in talks about how to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan. In Australia, there\u2019s been conflicting advice between public and private schools about when to send children back for the start of the school year after the long summer break. Australia\u2019s federal education minister, Dan Tehan, weighed into the debate today, chastising schools for forcing healthy students returning from China to stay away. Some private schools are telling children to stay away from school for 14 days if they have recently travelled to any part of China. Publicly funded state schools say only students who have been in contact with known cases of coronavirus should be excluded until medically cleared. \u201cIndividual schools make their own decisions but the advice from the Australian government is to follow our medical advice,\u201d Tehan told ABC radio. \u201cI would say to all schools that they should be following the advice of the health department, that is the clear position of the Australian government. \u201cObviously in the end they will have to answer to their parents, but also they will have to answer to state and territory governments, who have responsibility for schools.\u201d We have reported quite a bit about the new hospital Chinese authorities are building in a very short time to cope withe rising number of infections. Below is a time-lapse video of the 1,000-bed facility that is expected to open in the next few days. Just to put those figures into context ... yesterday the toll was 82, so today\u2019s figures of 106 is an increase of 29%. Infections are up from 2,887 to 4,193, an increase of 45%. But it\u2019s worth remembering these are still relatively small numbers of people affected relative to the population size. Wuhan \u2013 where most deaths have occurred \u2013 has a population of 11 million people Chinese state media is reporting the new figures for deaths and those infected by the coronavirus. The People\u2019s Daily says: 106 deaths 4,193 cases confirmed in China We are starting to get some revised figures on infections in China from coronavirus. The official broadcaster CGTN has just tweeted that there are now 100 deaths confirmed in Hubei province, where the city of Wuhan is the epicentre. It says there are 2,714 confirmed cases in the province, which has a population of just under 60 million people. The Global Times has also reported that Beijing has suspended 28 bus routes to neighbouring cities in an attempt to control the spread of the virus. China\u2019s official Global Times is reporting 13 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Shanghai on Monday, taking the total in the city to 66. I\u2019ll bring you an update on overall figures as soon as I can confirm it. As I mentioned earlier, the US has upgraded its travel advice to China to level 3 \u2013 its highest level _ which advises Americans to avoid all non-essential travel to China. Meanwhile the Associated Press is reporting that US State Department has ordered it employees in Wuhan to leave the city and is offering seats on a charter flight to US citizens who also want to leave. Here\u2019s the AP report: State department officials said on Monday in a statement that the the flight to Ontario, California, is expected to leave Wuhan on Wednesday morning local time. Priority will be given to citizens who are most at risk of contracting the virus. Alaska health officials say the flight is expected to make a refuelling stop in Anchorage and that about 240 Americans are expected to be aboard. The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services says the passengers will be screened for coronavirus before they leave Wuhan by US and Chinese health officials and that anyone with symptoms will not be allowed to board the aircraft. The department in a statement says they would be screened again at Anchorage. China\u2019s largest steelmaking city of Tangshan \u2013 about 200km east of Beijing \u2013 has announced it is suspending all public transit in an effort to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The city has a population of around 7.5 million people. The statement was posted on the city government\u2019s official Weibo account, the Reuters news agency reported. In New Zealand there are as yet no reported cases of coronavirus, but experts say it is only a matter of time before the illness breaches the country\u2019s borders. Health experts are currently meeting passengers off flights arriving from China in Auckland and Christchurch. Some schools in Auckland are taking precautions by asking pupils who have spent their summer holidays in or near Wuhan to stay at home for a week to make sure they are not carrying the virus. On Tuesday a hotel in Queenstown became the site of panic after rumours spread that it was in lockdown due to a suspected case of the illness, but the ministry of health said it was not investigating any cases in the region. The hotel at the centre of the speculation said the episode caused \u201cunnecessary distress\u201d. Hundreds of Chinese tourists have also cancelled their planned holidays to New Zealand, tourism operators say, while others have extended their stay to avoid the risk of catching the illness back home. The ministry of health said authorities are taking the outbreak \u201cextremely seriously\u201d with the ministry\u2019s director general of Health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, saying health departments are well-prepared, but the risk of a sustained outbreak in New Zealand remains low. A spokesperson for the Bavarian health ministry has confirmed that a man from Starnberg, near Munich. He is in a \u201cclinically good condition\u201d and is being monitored in isolation. Still in Australia, where the country\u2019s schools are returning this week after the long summer break, health authorities in the state of New South Wales have confirmed there are four confirmed cases of the virus and 8 other cases are under investigation. Chris Weston, head of research at the online trading company Pepperstone in Melbourne, Australia, said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d the virus was going to have an impact on the world\u2019s second biggest economy. \u201cThe question is how dramatic the impact will be and what will be the ramifications on the global economy and demand in general,\u201d he said a short time ago. \u201cWhat we are trying to understand is the economic impact shutting transport links and imposing strict travel controls in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as effectively quarantining 14 cities and millions of people will have. The situation was complicated by the lack of understanding about how the virus is spreading, making it \u201cvery hard to comprehend just how bad it is, or how much worse it can get\u201d. The economic and financial impacts of the virus are beginning to bite. After heavy losses on Asian, European and US losses on Monday, the Australian stock market \u2013 closed on Monday for the Australia day holiday \u2013 has suffered a 1.7% fall this morning. The Australian economy is heavily exposed to any economic disruption in China so the ASX200 index is a decent proxy to watch for how investors are reading the outbreak. The Aussie dollar is also used as a proxy for China and it has duly dipped to its lowest for nearly two months at US67.6c. We are waiting for the latest daily figures on infections of the coronavirus, but at the moment the number of deaths has been confirmed as 82, with at least 2,887 confirmed cases globally, out of which 2,827 are in mainland China. Canada has also upgraded its travel advice for China, asking its citizens to avoid all travel to Hubei province, where the virus outbreak began. It says its citizens should \u201cexercise a high degree of caution\u201d in China due to \u201cthe risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws\u201d. However, it says the \u201cdecision to travel is your choice and you are responsible for your personal safety abroad\u201d. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has upgraded its warning for novel coronavirus to Level 3, which is to avoid all non-essential travel to all of China. This means the outbreak is of \u201chigh risk to travellers and no precautions are available to protect against the identified increased risk\u201d. It warns of person-to-person transmission and that \u201colder adults and people with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease\u201d. The advice also notes that there is \u201climited access to adequate medical care in affected areas\u201d in China. Level 3 is the US\u2019s highest warning level. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with me, Alison Rourke. I hope to be bringing you an update on infection figures shortly \u2013 they are usually announced at around this time. In the mean time, here\u2019s a short summary of the top news on this story at the moment. Beijing has recorded its first death from the virus More cities, including in Hubei province where the outbreak started, have introduced travel bans Wuhan\u2019s mayor has admitted authorities were too slow in releasing information about the virus The US recommends that travellers avoid all nonessential travel to China Canada advises against all travel to Hubei province You can see our latest story on the mayor of Wuhan below And our two explainers are here \u2013 on how worried we should be about the virus and our quick guide on how to protect yourself from infection.",

This attempt to take the moral high ground was pretty rich coming from a team that has pushed bogus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/30/trump-impeachment-five-conspiracy-theories-ukraine-dilemma\">conspiracy theories</a> about Biden.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/30/trump-impeachment-five-conspiracy-theories-ukraine-dilemma\">Five fantasies Trump is pushing about the Ukraine scandal \u2013 and the truth</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sekulow also repeatedly entreated senators to put themselves in Trump\u2019s shoes. Brimming with indignation, he ran through a parade of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a> villains: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/intelligence-sources-vouch-credibility-donald-trump-russia-dossier-author\">Steele dossier</a>, FBI agents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/02/trump-lisa-page-fake-orgasm-fbi-russia-investigation\">Lisa Page and Peter Strzok</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/09/fbi-trump-russia-investigation-ig-report\">F</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/09/fbi-trump-russia-investigation-ig-report\">isa warrants</a>, former FBI director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey\">James Comey</a> and special counsel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-mueller\">Robert Mueller</a>. The unspoken message was that Trump is the victim of deep state conspiracy.</p> \n<p>What, you may ask, did all this have to do with coercing Ukraine? Sekulow insisted: \u201cYou can\u2019t view this case in a vacuum. You are being asked to remove a duly elected president of the United States and you\u2019re being asked to do it in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">election year</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Indeed, Democrats would agree this is not occurring in a vacuum. During their presentation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/15/who-are-impeachment-managers-trump-senate-trial\">House managers</a> carefully explained how Trump\u2019s bullying of Ukraine, which is in constant peril from Russia, goes hand in hand with his peculiar affection for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\">Vladimir Putin</a>. Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/25/trumps-phone-call-with-ukraines-president-read-the-full-transcript\">phone call</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy\">Ukraine\u2019s president</a> came a day after Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cad27af31e5619aa8c7d414c138b4b73964464d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cad27af31e5619aa8c7d414c138b4b73964464d/0_155_4656_2794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, had his words from the Clinton impeachment quoted back at him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, had his words from the Clinton impeachment quoted back at him.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Inevitably, Sekulow griped about the backlash against his team\u2019s criticism of Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. \u201cDo we have, like, a Biden-free zone?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou can impeach a president for asking a question?\u201d</p> \n<p>Then he returned to the Bolton imbroglio. Sekulow dismissed \u201can unpublished manuscript that maybe some reporters have an idea of maybe what it says ... I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call that. I\u2019d call it inadmissible, but that\u2019s what it is \u2026 You cannot impeach a president on an unsourced allegation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sekulow quoted Trump and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence\">Mike Pence</a>\u2019s office denying Bolton\u2019s allegation. He warned against an impeachment based on policy differences. Democrats looked underwhelmed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amy-klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar</a> of Minnesota whispered behind her hand to Chris Coons of Delaware, who smiled.</p> \n<p>Again that cry of \u201cDanger, danger, danger!\u201d</p> \n<p>Klobuchar sighed.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mittromney\">Mitt Romney</a>, among those who may well vote to call Bolton and other witnesses, was reportedly told off for breaking Senate rules by bringing in a bottle of chocolate milk. He later came back with it in a glass instead.</p> \n<p>In what may come to look like wild overconfidence, the defence rested its case after using less than half its allotted 24 hours. Clips of Democrats warning against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton\">Bill Clinton</a> impeachment two decades ago were played, culminating with Chuck Schumer, now Senate minority leader, saying: \u201cMy fear is that when a Republican wins the White House, Democrats will demand payback.\u201d</p> \n<p>The White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, looked at Schumer and said: \u201cYou were right.\u201d The senator\u2019s face remained a mask frozen with a bemused smile.</p> \n<p>But this could not be described as a barnstorming finish. Cipollone claimed they had made a \u201ccompelling case\u201d and pleaded for senators to \u201crespect and defend the sacred right of every American to vote and to choose their president\u201d a few months from now.</p> \n<p>There was an outbreak of muttering among Democrats. It was as if, collectively, they were saying: is that all you got?</p>",

That\u2019s politics, unfortunately, and [Alexander] Hamilton,\u201d \u2013 yes, him again \u2013 \u201cput impeachment in the hands of this body, the Senate, precisely and specifically to be above that fray. This is the greatest deliberative body on Earth.\u201d He added: \u201cIn our presentation so far, you\u2019ve now heard from legal scholars from a variety of schools of thought, from a variety of political backgrounds. But they do have a common theme with a dire warning: danger, danger, danger! \u201cTo lower the bar of impeachment based on these articles of impeachment would impact the functioning of our constitutional republic and the framework of that constitution for generations.\u201d It was a point he made over and over again. This attempt to take the moral high ground was pretty rich coming from a team that has pushed bogus conspiracy theories about Biden. Sekulow also repeatedly entreated senators to put themselves in Trump\u2019s shoes. Brimming with indignation, he ran through a parade of Fox News villains: the Steele dossier, FBI agents Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, Fisa warrants, former FBI director James Comey and special counsel Robert Mueller. The unspoken message was that Trump is the victim of deep state conspiracy. What, you may ask, did all this have to do with coercing Ukraine? Sekulow insisted: \u201cYou can\u2019t view this case in a vacuum. You are being asked to remove a duly elected president of the United States and you\u2019re being asked to do it in an election year.\u201d Indeed, Democrats would agree this is not occurring in a vacuum. During their presentation, House managers carefully explained how Trump\u2019s bullying of Ukraine, which is in constant peril from Russia, goes hand in hand with his peculiar affection for Vladimir Putin. Trump\u2019s phone call to Ukraine\u2019s president came a day after Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony. Inevitably, Sekulow griped about the backlash against his team\u2019s criticism of Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. \u201cDo we have, like, a Biden-free zone?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou can impeach a president for asking a question?\u201d Then he returned to the Bolton imbroglio. Sekulow dismissed \u201can unpublished manuscript that maybe some reporters have an idea of maybe what it says ... I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call that. I\u2019d call it inadmissible, but that\u2019s what it is \u2026 You cannot impeach a president on an unsourced allegation.\u201d Sekulow quoted Trump and Mike Pence\u2019s office denying Bolton\u2019s allegation. He warned against an impeachment based on policy differences. Democrats looked underwhelmed. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota whispered behind her hand to Chris Coons of Delaware, who smiled. Again that cry of \u201cDanger, danger, danger!\u201d Klobuchar sighed. Meanwhile, Senator Mitt Romney, among those who may well vote to call Bolton and other witnesses, was reportedly told off for breaking Senate rules by bringing in a bottle of chocolate milk. He later came back with it in a glass instead. In what may come to look like wild overconfidence, the defence rested its case after using less than half its allotted 24 hours. Clips of Democrats warning against the Bill Clinton impeachment two decades ago were played, culminating with Chuck Schumer, now Senate minority leader, saying: \u201cMy fear is that when a Republican wins the White House, Democrats will demand payback.\u201d The White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, looked at Schumer and said: \u201cYou were right.\u201d The senator\u2019s face remained a mask frozen with a bemused smile. But this could not be described as a barnstorming finish. Cipollone claimed they had made a \u201ccompelling case\u201d and pleaded for senators to \u201crespect and defend the sacred right of every American to vote and to choose their president\u201d a few months from now. There was an outbreak of muttering among Democrats. It was as if, collectively, they were saying: is that all you got?",

      "bodyText": "President Donald Trump has unveiled his much-touted Middle East peace plan, tweeting a map showing his vision for an even further depleted Palestinian state than that envisioned by the Oslo peace agreement in 1993. The crude \u201cconcept\u201d map in the plan shows the occupied Jordan valley under Israeli control \u2013 although Trump suggests that could be eased in the future \u2013 and a West Bank split north and south around Jerusalem, heavily eaten into by Israeli settlements which the plan proposes to recognise under Israeli sovereignty. In a concession to the Palestinians, however, a plan to link Gaza to the West Bank by road has been revived. Despite Trump\u2019s promise \u201cto be fair\u201d to Palestinians in his speech, the actual document itself represents a far less conciliatory if garbled vision, often reading like a series of Israeli government talking points. The overall message, however, is that what the Trump administration has in mind is something far less meaningful than the two-state solution conceived by previous administrations or Oslo, with emphasis being placed on Israel\u2019s security rather than Palestinian self-determination. \u201cA fundamentally different peace plan\u201d While Trump described the plan in his speech as a \u201chistoric\u201d and a \u201cfundamentally different plan\u201d, it borrows much from previous plans [although with some glaring departures] mixing old elements of the Oslo peace accords with bits designed to explicitly please Israel\u2019s hard right. A four-year settlement freeze One of the biggest surprises of the Trump proposal is the proposal that Israel freezes settlement construction for four years, while increasing the amount of territory under direct Palestinian control. While successive US administrations, as well as the EU, have encouraged Israel to halt settlement building, that will be hugely undermined by recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the major settlement blocks which is rejected by the Palestinians, not least following Netanyahu\u2019s announcement he plans to ask his cabinet to vote on an annexation plan on Sunday. Proposed Israeli sovereignty over major settlement blocs This is perhaps the biggest dealbreaker in the Trump peace plan. The plan\u2019s suggested recognition of Israeli sovereignty over illegal settlements in the West Bank is a move that is also likely to be opposed by many in the international community, as well as Palestinians. \u201cApproximately 97% of Israelis in the West Bank will be incorporated into contiguous Israeli territory, and approximately 97% of Palestinians in the West Bank will be incorporated into contiguous Palestinian territory. Land swaps will provide the State of Palestine with land reasonably comparable in size to the territory of pre-1967 West Bank and Gaza.\u201d The plan makes clear that those Israelis in \u201cenclaves\u201d that are not contiguous with Israel should remain if they want, with access to Israel and under Israeli protection. Future Palestinian state and Gaza Under the terms of the \u201cpeace vision\u201d Trump affirms his support for a two-state solution which he had previously failed to articulate. The plan sees a future Palestinian state consisting of the West Bank and Gaza, connected by a combination of above-ground roads and tunnels \u2013 again an old notion. Palestinians in Gaza, currently ruled by Hamas, would be offered land swaps in Israel close to the Egyptian border but remain largely excluded from planning until a ceasefire and the removal of Hamas. Israel would retain sovereignty over Gaza\u2019s territorial waters. Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s \u201cundivided capital\u201d This is another dealbreaker rather than a dealmaker, and is one of the most problematic final status issues. In his speech Trump quickly contradicted himself by suggesting that the future capital of a Palestinian state could be in east Jerusalem \u2013 but only if Palestinians rose to the challenges of statehood. Netanyahu later confirmed that Trump meant Abu Dis, a neighbourhood on the outskirts of Jerusalem and beyond the separation wall. The document itself suggests Palestinians could engage in a bizarre rebranding of Abu Dis, and rename it \u2018Al Quds\u2019 \u2013 the historic Arabic name for Jerusalem \u2013 \u201cor another name as determined by the State of Palestine\u201d. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas immediately responded saying \u201cJerusalem was not for sale\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll do a lot for Palestinians\u201d Trumpeting how much he has done for Israel \u2013 including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, unilaterally recognising Israeli sovereignty over the Golan heights and withdrawing from the Iran deal \u2013 Trump said that he\u2019d be \u201cfair\u201d and do a lot for the Palestinians. In keeping with his transactional world vision, that means doubling the amount of territory under direct Palestinian control and supporting a future Palestinian state with up to $50bn in assistance. Palestinians were promised a similar increase in autonomy in a five-year transition period that followed the Oslo agreements. That never occurred and Israel expanded its settlement building in the intervening period. Population transfer The plan also appears to have taken onboard a proposal previously mooted by the far-right Israeli politician and former defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, to transfer Israeli citizens of Palestinian origin who live in the so-called \u201cTriangle\u201d in Israel next to the occupied Palestinian Territories into any new Palestinian state. \u201cThese communities, which largely self-identify as Palestinian, were originally designated to fall under Jordanian control during the negotiations of the Armistice Line of 1949, but ultimately were retained by Israel for military reasons that have since been mitigated. The Vision contemplates the possibility, subject to agreement of the parties that the borders of Israel will be redrawn such that the Triangle Communities become part of the State of Palestine.\u201d The Jordan Valley The Jordan valley has been under Israeli occupation since 1967.

Morgan denied that the Labour-led government was acting as a nanny state. \u201cI really feel that parents want as much advice and help as they can get. Parenting is a really difficult job. We want parents to retain the rights to bring up children as they wish to do but we want to provide the parameters. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the legislation that stops you protecting your children, nothing that stops you from grabbing a child that is running into the road, nothing that stops you pulling a child back if they are going to grab a boiling hot cup.\u201d There are no plans to introduce bans in Northern Ireland or England.",

      "bodyText": "Dozens of people are feared dead following an attack by Islamic militants on a village in Burkina Faso, the latest bloody incident in an unprecedented surge of violence across the restive Sahel region. Details of the attack, which occurred on Saturday and targeted the village of Silgadji in the northern Soum province, were still unclear on Tuesday but a security official said casualties in the assault totalled between \u201c10 and 30 dead\u201d. In many such instances, initial death tolls are revised upwards when investigators reach the often remote areas where the raids take place. Islamic extremists were still in the vicinity of the village on Monday, a resident in nearby Bourzanga town said, citing accounts from those who had fled. \u201cThe terrorists surrounded the people at the village market, before separating them into two groups. The men were executed and the women were ordered to leave the village,\u201d the source said. \u201cSecurity teams are trying to get to the site but access to the village has probably been booby-trapped with homemade mines, and they are having to proceed carefully.\u201d Though once considered resistant to the phenomenon of Islamic extremism, Burkina Faso has suffered a rapid rise in Islamist extremism in recent years, a spillover of violence in neighbouring Mali. The number of deaths from Islamist-linked attacks in Burkina Faso rose from about 80 in 2016 to more than 1,800 in 2019. There were more than 4,000 deaths across the Sahel reported last year, according to the UN. Saturday\u2019s attack follows a massacre of 36 people at two villages in the northern Sanmatenga province earlier this month. Extremist violence in the Sahel intensified after a coalition of Islamists and local separatist tribesmen took control over much of northern Mali in 2012. A seven-year campaign led by French troops, the deployment of hundreds of US special forces, massive aid for local militaries and a billion dollar-a-year United Nations peacekeeping operation have been unable to decisively weaken the multiple overlapping insurgencies in the region and security has continued to deteriorate. European officials are worried the Sahel is close to a tipping point that could see an irreversible slide into violent chaos that will strengthen extremist groups and send a new wave of migrants to Europe. There are also concerns that the US will withdraw a significant proportion of its troops deployed in Africa, possibly undermining French military efforts in the region. On Monday French officials said they hoped \u201cgood sense\u201d would prevail and the United States would not cut crucial intelligence and logistics support for the French force of 4,500 troops based in Mali. The Pentagon has announced plans to withdraw hundreds of military personnel from Africa as it redirects resources to address challenges from China and Russia after two decades focused on counter-terrorism operations. Those cuts could deepen following an ongoing global troop review. France believes it is time to increase, not ease, pressure on militants to prevent \u201cIslamic State from rebuilding in the Sahel\u201d, a senior French defence ministry official said. The US currently has 6,000 military personnel in Africa, though only several hundred are deployed against militants in the Sahel. Although some experts say a repositioning of forces is overdue, many US officials share French concerns about relieving pressure on militants in Africa. \u201cAny withdrawal or reduction would likely result in a surge in violent extremist attacks on the continent and beyond,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democrat Chris Coons wrote earlier this month. Gen Fran\u00e7ois Lecointre, chief of staff of the French armed forces, said the loss of US intelligence from intercepted communications would be the \u201cbiggest setback\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m doing my utmost to prevent this from happening,\u201d he said, adding that French drone-based spying systems would not be operational until year-end. France said this month it would deploy 220 additional troops to the region, despite rising anti-French sentiment in some countries and criticism at home that its forces are bogged down. Some French analysts have dismissed the decision as a political gesture and called for greater emphasis on a strategy that addresses the failings of local states in the Sahel and broader economic issues. Burkina Faso, one of the most impoverished countries in the world, saw a tenfold rise in those displaced by the violence over 2019, with more than 560,000 forced out of their homes by December, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council. The figure is predicted to rise to 900,000 people by April \u201cBurkina Faso needs more than bullets and bombs. Military engagement alone is failing to protect vulnerable communities. Donors \u2026 have not yet responded to the enormous humanitarian needs with equal emphasis,\u201d warned NRC\u2019s secretary general Jan Egeland, on a visit to the country this week. Hunger is also a threat, with one in ten people in Burkina Faso likely to need food assistance by June. Attacks on children in the Sahel have also risen dramatically over the past year. Mali recorded 571 grave violations against children during the first three quarters of 2019, compared to 544 in 2018 and 386 in 2017, according to Unicef. Since the start of 2019, more than 670,000 children across the region have been forced to flee their homes because of armed conflict and insecurity. Burkina Faso\u2019s army is ill-equipped and poorly trained to deal with assaults that usually involve hundreds of highly mobile, lightly-armed militants travelling on motorbikes or in pick up trucks.",

      "bodyText": "They came to see the new signing Mbwana Samatta but left talking about a player whose roots lie much closer to home. Jack Grealish was born just up the road and joined Aston Villa\u2019s academy at the age of six so he knows what a first piece of silverware since 1996 would mean in these parts. On the evidence of this thrilling performance, during which Villa\u2019s talisman dominated against a Leicester side featuring his potential England rival James Maddison, there can be only one choice for Gareth Southgate when he names his next squad for the friendlies against Italy and Denmark in March. Grealish has still yet to make his senior debut having controversially chosen to represent the land of his birth over the Republic of Ireland back in 2015 but surely now he deserves an opportunity to stake a claim having helped Villa reach their first major final since that season\u2019s FA Cup defeat to Arsenal. News of Samatta\u2019s inclusion had been greeted with a huge roar from the home supporters just before kick-off, with the 27-year-old handed his debut despite last having played competitively at the start of last month. Such is Villa\u2019s desperation for a goalscorer in the absence of their record signing Wesley, however, that Dean Smith will be aware the \u00a38.5m paid to Belgian champions Genk could end up deciding whether they stay in the Premier League or not. Samatta\u2019s transfer has been big news back home in Tanzania, where images of the son of a retired policeman already adorn most billboards in the capital city, Dar es Salaam, following his exploits at Genk and for the Taifa Stars national team. His impact in Belgium after signing from TP Mazembe in 2016 is illustrated by the fact that 16-year-old Tanzanian starlet Kelvin John has already been snapped up by the club whose celebrated youth academy produced Kevin De Bruyne, Divock Origi and Wilfred Ndidi in the past. It is actually more than 50 years since Villa became the first English club to field an east African player, with Zambia\u2019s Freddie Mwila and Emment Kapengwe both featuring in the First Division back in 1969 after being signed by Tommy Docherty. They ended up playing just four games in total but if Samatta, who claimed he used to be a big fan of Gabriel Agbonlahor as a young man, is to prove successful in the Midlands then Grealish will surely be pivotal in providing the opportunities in front of goal. The 24-year-old\u2019s impudent flick to set up Matt Targett\u2019s goal which edged Villa in front in this tie was a sign of his growing confidence in a stadium where he can do no wrong.

At the other end, Villa had Orjan Nyland to thank for protecting their slender advantage after a number of spectacular saves, culminating in the acrobatic effort to somehow tip a shot from Youri Tielemens on to the crossbar. With Jamie Vardy watching on from the bench having been deemed not quite fit enough to start, Brendan Rodgers opted to select Kelechi Iheanacho in his place and the Nigeria striker proved a handful for Villa\u2019s central defensive pairing of Tyrone Mings and Ezri Konsa even if he could not find a way past the Norwegian goalkeeper. Samatta\u2019s next big chance came on the half-hour mark when he failed to connect cleanly with Targett\u2019s cross after another brilliant piece of play from Grealish. He will be relieved it did not prove to be crucial. The introduction of Vardy, the pantomime villain, 10 minutes into the second half raised the temperature in the stands on a chilly night in Birmingham.

Yet everything changed in an instant when Iheanacho side-footed home from a sumptuous cross by Harvey Barnes just as Demarai Gray was being readied to replace him. In the end, it was Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet who stole the headlines with his injury-time winner to send the home supporters into raptures and to Wembley on 1 March for a final against Manchester City or United. But, make no mistake, it was Grealish who pulled the strings.",

      "body": "<p>Belsen: Our Story (BBC Two) is difficult to watch, but as many people should watch it as possible. Over one hour, this sober and simple film, unsparingly matter-of-fact, uses archival audio and video footage to show the horrors of what happened at Bergen-Belsen in Germany between 1940 and 1945. Almost 75 years after the camp was liberated, the film collects together the testimonies of survivors, mostly children at the time, now among the last people able to give first-person accounts of what they suffered, and what was done to them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.het.org.uk/index.php/component/content/article/8-cat-the-holocaust-cat-the-holocaust/258-survivors-mt\" title=\"\">Mala Tribich</a> was 14 when she was sent to Belsen. In the film, she returns to the ground on which it once stood, and the experience of being there for the first time in 75 years is emotional and traumatic. \u201cIt brings it back more vividly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bear, even after all these years.\u201d Before Belsen, some of her family members were rounded up by the Nazis, marched into a nearby forest and executed. \u201cSo that\u2019s how I lost my mother and sister,\u201d she says, with a gentle, crushing sigh. She recalls finding her way to the children\u2019s barracks at Belsen and how Luba Tryszynska, \u201cthe angel of Belsen\u201d, took care of them. She recalls that, on the day British troops liberated the camp, she saw people running. \u201cAll I could think was: how have they got the strength to run?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mauriceblik.com/biography\" title=\"\">Maurice Blik</a> was four when he arrived at Belsen, having previously been imprisoned at Westerbork in the Netherlands. His little sister was born and died there; he is racked with grief as he talks about his feelings of having failed her, even as a small child. He encountered Irma Grese, the notoriously sadistic young SS guard who had previously selected prisoners for the gas chambers at Auschwitz and was executed for her crimes in 1945. When Blik was starving, she ate an apple in front of him, dropped the core on the floor and left the room, instructing her dog to guard it. When she returned, the apple core was untouched; she trod it down to mush.</p> <p>The cellist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/27/the-last-survivors-review-an-extraordinary-memorial-to-children-of-the-holocaust\" title=\"\">Anita Lasker-Wallfisch</a>, who played in the Women\u2019s Orchestra of Auschwitz, remembers Grese trying to talk to her when it became apparent the regime would soon fall. Lasker-Wallfisch says Grese told her: \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll soon be home.\u2019 She was trying to make herself room in my heart.\u201d She chuckles. \u201cShe was such a bastard.\u201d Lasker-Wallfisch wrote a memoir in the 90s about her experiences and she speaks with clear-eyed eloquence here. She remembers her first encounter with antisemitism at school and being baffled as to why she had been singled out. She addresses those who said: \u201cHow could you?\u201d when they discovered that she played in the orchestra. \u201cWhat else are you going to do? Say: I\u2019m sorry, I only play at Carnegie Hall?\u201d She considers survivors\u2019 guilt. \u201cSomebody has to survive to speak for the people who can no longer speak. That is now my purpose.\u201d</p> <p>There are other accounts, equally as vivid and horrifying. Gena Turgel speaks of seeing Anne Frank delirious and on the verge of death from typhoid. Peter Lantos returns to Belsen to attempt, in some way, to see the grave of his father, who died there of starvation just a month before the camp was liberated. But there are no individual markers and the mass graves are marked with only estimates of the numbers of bodies they contain. The two British soldiers who offer their recollections of what they saw when they arrived at Belsen in April 1945 remain stunned by it, even today. \u201cIt tears the guts out of me now,\u201d says George Leonard, who had heard the rumours of what might be happening there, but could not believe it until he saw the carnage with his own eyes.</p> <p>This is shamefully recent history, recent enough for some of those who lived through it to still be alive. We are privileged to be able to hear their accounts. I remember a Holocaust survivor coming in to my school in the 90s to talk to us about his experiences. My year was a large one, so he was asked if he would mind doing the talk twice, once in the morning and again after lunch. He told us this during the first and only session. Even now, he said, it took so much to talk about it that he could not do it twice in one day.</p> <p>Each remarkable person interviewed in this documentary finds the strength to describe the nightmarish barbarism they endured, and it is clearly difficult beyond belief for them to relive it. But they are doing so in order for it not to be forgotten. While this is a desperately horrifying film to watch, it seems as if, in these worrying times, watching it, and being horrified by it, is the very least we can do.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Belsen: Our Story (BBC Two) is difficult to watch, but as many people should watch it as possible. Over one hour, this sober and simple film, unsparingly matter-of-fact, uses archival audio and video footage to show the horrors of what happened at Bergen-Belsen in Germany between 1940 and 1945. Almost 75 years after the camp was liberated, the film collects together the testimonies of survivors, mostly children at the time, now among the last people able to give first-person accounts of what they suffered, and what was done to them. Mala Tribich was 14 when she was sent to Belsen. In the film, she returns to the ground on which it once stood, and the experience of being there for the first time in 75 years is emotional and traumatic. \u201cIt brings it back more vividly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bear, even after all these years.\u201d Before Belsen, some of her family members were rounded up by the Nazis, marched into a nearby forest and executed. \u201cSo that\u2019s how I lost my mother and sister,\u201d she says, with a gentle, crushing sigh. She recalls finding her way to the children\u2019s barracks at Belsen and how Luba Tryszynska, \u201cthe angel of Belsen\u201d, took care of them. She recalls that, on the day British troops liberated the camp, she saw people running. \u201cAll I could think was: how have they got the strength to run?\u201d Maurice Blik was four when he arrived at Belsen, having previously been imprisoned at Westerbork in the Netherlands. His little sister was born and died there; he is racked with grief as he talks about his feelings of having failed her, even as a small child. He encountered Irma Grese, the notoriously sadistic young SS guard who had previously selected prisoners for the gas chambers at Auschwitz and was executed for her crimes in 1945. When Blik was starving, she ate an apple in front of him, dropped the core on the floor and left the room, instructing her dog to guard it. When she returned, the apple core was untouched; she trod it down to mush. The cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who played in the Women\u2019s Orchestra of Auschwitz, remembers Grese trying to talk to her when it became apparent the regime would soon fall. Lasker-Wallfisch says Grese told her: \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll soon be home.\u2019 She was trying to make herself room in my heart.\u201d She chuckles. \u201cShe was such a bastard.\u201d Lasker-Wallfisch wrote a memoir in the 90s about her experiences and she speaks with clear-eyed eloquence here. She remembers her first encounter with antisemitism at school and being baffled as to why she had been singled out. She addresses those who said: \u201cHow could you?\u201d when they discovered that she played in the orchestra. \u201cWhat else are you going to do? Say: I\u2019m sorry, I only play at Carnegie Hall?\u201d She considers survivors\u2019 guilt. \u201cSomebody has to survive to speak for the people who can no longer speak. That is now my purpose.\u201d There are other accounts, equally as vivid and horrifying. Gena Turgel speaks of seeing Anne Frank delirious and on the verge of death from typhoid. Peter Lantos returns to Belsen to attempt, in some way, to see the grave of his father, who died there of starvation just a month before the camp was liberated. But there are no individual markers and the mass graves are marked with only estimates of the numbers of bodies they contain. The two British soldiers who offer their recollections of what they saw when they arrived at Belsen in April 1945 remain stunned by it, even today. \u201cIt tears the guts out of me now,\u201d says George Leonard, who had heard the rumours of what might be happening there, but could not believe it until he saw the carnage with his own eyes. This is shamefully recent history, recent enough for some of those who lived through it to still be alive. We are privileged to be able to hear their accounts. I remember a Holocaust survivor coming in to my school in the 90s to talk to us about his experiences. My year was a large one, so he was asked if he would mind doing the talk twice, once in the morning and again after lunch. He told us this during the first and only session. Even now, he said, it took so much to talk about it that he could not do it twice in one day. Each remarkable person interviewed in this documentary finds the strength to describe the nightmarish barbarism they endured, and it is clearly difficult beyond belief for them to relive it. But they are doing so in order for it not to be forgotten. While this is a desperately horrifying film to watch, it seems as if, in these worrying times, watching it, and being horrified by it, is the very least we can do.",

      "bodyText": "Leeds climbed back to the top of the Championship after fighting back from 2-0 down at Elland Road to beat Millwall 3-2. Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side appeared to be heading for a fourth straight defeat in all competitions but turned it round after the break as Patrick Bamford\u2019s double sandwiched Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s effort. Shaun Hutchinson\u2019s header had given Millwall a fourth-minute lead and Jed Wallace\u2019s penalty made it 2-0 after Ezgjan Alioski\u2019s challenge on Jon Dadi Bodvarsson. Leeds leapfrogged West Bromwich Albion into pole position after Slaven Bilic\u2019s side slipped to a 2-1 defeat at Cardiff. Callum Paterson broke the deadlock for Cardiff at the start of the second half before Charlie Austin fired West Brom level from the penalty spot after Jazz Richards had fouled Filip Krovinovic. But Lee Tomlin\u2019s free-kick put Cardiff back in front and extended West Brom\u2019s winless league run to seven matches. Nottingham Forest closed the gap on West Brom to two points as Joe Lolley\u2019s solitary first-half goal was enough to clinch them a 1-0 win at Brentford, who remain fifth. Forest extended their unbeaten league run to seven matches, while Bristol City made it three straight wins thanks to Jamie Paterson\u2019s second-half goal in a 1-0 win at Reading. Wayne Rooney scored his first goal for Derby, but his side slipped to a 3-2 defeat at bottom club Luton. Rooney fired Derby ahead in the 63rd minute before Luton hit back through Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu and Donervon Daniels. Chris Martin headed Derby level, but a minute later Jayden Bogle\u2019s own goal sealed Luton\u2019s first win since 7 December. Derby defender Max Lowe was shown a straight red card in the closing stages for foul and abusive language. Jamal Lowe\u2019s last-minute header clinched Wigan a 2-1 home win against Sheffield Wednesday. Blackburn made it back-to-back wins to keep up the pressure on the play-off chasers by defeating QPR 2-1. Jordan Hugill cancelled out Adam Armstrong\u2019s opener for Blackburn before Darragh Lenihan\u2019s header restored the home side\u2019s lead before half-time. Steve Mouni\u00e9\u2019s stoppage-time header secured Huddersfield a 2-1 win at Hull. Richard Stearman\u2019s own goal cancelled out Karlan Grant\u2019s first-half opener for Huddersfield in a game that was delayed for 10 minutes in the second period due to an injury to visiting goalkeeper Kamil Grabara. Grabara was carried off on a stretcher in the 82nd minute after colliding with team-mate Christopher Schindler. Rotherham return to top Rotherham returned to the summit of League One with a 1-0 win over Ipswich in the top-of-the-table clash, as Wycombe climbed to second. Richard Wood\u2019s first-half header was enough for Paul Warne\u2019s side to re-take pole position in the table. Wycombe managed to hold on for a 2-1 win over Blackpool after two early goals in a game delayed to 8.50pm after a spectator was taken ill. Nick Freeman and Alex Samuel struck in the first 10 minutes and Wanderers managed to hold on for all three points despite Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall\u2019s 86th-minute goal on his Blackpool debut. Peterborough edged closer to securing a place in the play-offs following a 2-0 win at struggling Accrington, who have yet to win in 2020. Bristol City loanee Sammie Szmodics scored early on, with Joe Ward tapping home in the second half as the visitors secured their third consecutive victory. Portsmouth moved back into the play-off places after making it seven straight wins in all competitions with a 2-0 success at Lincoln. Ronan Curtis\u2019s first-half free-kick and a late spot-kick from John Marquis ensured the visitors moved up the table with all three points. Colchester beat leaders Swindon In League Two, Colchester striker Theo Robinson scored two late goals for a 3-1 home win against leaders Swindon. The visitors went ahead early in the second half through Diallang Jaiyesimi, but Luke Norris headed Colchester level and Robinson struck twice in the final six minutes.

Tonight\u2019s match is a cynicism-free zone. There will be no entitlement, no ennui at the prospect of <em>another </em>trip to Wembley; just two teams and sets of supporters who are desperate to reach a cup final.</p> <p>Leicester have not done so since beating Tranmere in the final of this competition 20 years ago. It was known as the Worthington Cup back then, so sponsorship has progressed from booze to energy drinks. By the year 2040, they\u2019ll be competing for the Matcha Latte Cup. </p> <p>The last final Villa reached was the painful FA Cup hammering by Arsenal in 2015. The last time they won a trophy \u2013 not counting the <strike> mezzanine </strike> Intertoto Cup \u2013 was when they hammered Leeds 3-0 in the final of this competition in 1996. </p> <p>Villa, in particular, will be big underdogs should they reach the final, as they are likely to face the same Manchester City side that plugged them 6-1 the other week. But they\u2019d happily take their chances, because no side in history has won a trophy without first risking their dignity. Besides, beating one of the best teams in Leicester\u2019s history would in itself be a memorable triumph.</p> <p>Leicester start the match as favourites, despite being held to a 1-1 draw in the home leg. You probably know the revised regulations by now: no away-goals rule, no extra-time. If the teams are level after 90 minutes, it goes straight to penalties. May the best team win, and may their fans celebrate until all hours.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off is at 7.45pm GMT.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T18:27:19.887Z\">at 6.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Dean Smith is a happy man. Ed Aarons kept a close eye on Aston Villa\u2019s new signing. That\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s blog. I\u2019m off to book my tickets for Wembley in March; Lewis Capaldi\u2019s doing a two-night residence. Thanks for your company and emails - goodnight. \u201cWho do you support Rob?\u201d says Sean Tizzard. \u201cBe honest? Without Nyland, Villa would have been dead and buried. But still you can only praise Grealish\u2019s 40-yard wonder balls and get the balance of your tweets all wrong. Read them again. A journalist didn\u2019t offer them - a Villa fan did\u2026\u201d I am so busted. I have Peter Withe underpants you know. Orjan Nyland speaks \u201cIt was crazy at the end of the game, through the roof really. Unbelievable. The first 15 minutes they put a lot of pressure on us, so they take the lead was massive. We did well in the second half - we dug in another time and got the winner. [Is that your best performance for Villa?] Yeah, definitely. The first leg was my best performance, but to come out and do it again was amazing. I hope to play at Wembley, yeah!\u201d \u201cBiased Guardian shit...\u201d says Sean Tizzard. \u201cHave you got a Villa supporter doing your comments tonight? Lovely scenes for who? Let\u2019s have some balance.\u201d Oh for heaven\u2019s sake. There were lovely scenes for any neutral who quite enjoys it when nice things happen to underdogs and decent human beings. Like at the King Power Stadium on - ooh, let\u2019s pick a date at random - the 7th May 2016. \u201cCracking game, but both Villa goals came from Pereira\u2019s side,\u201d says Rob Moore. \u201cHe\u2019s great going forward but Leicester have been gradually found out over the last month, largely through those holes where Perez should be.\u201d Yeah, he could have done better for the second goal. Not sure about the first, as he was left one against two. Jack Grealish speaks \u201cI just think it shows what character we\u2019ve got in the team. This time last month we were in a sticky patch \u2013 we couldn\u2019t string five passes together, never mind a win. It\u2019s brilliant for the club: another trip to Wembley, and we\u2019re looking forward to it. \u201cIn the first leg we were under so much pressure; today I thought we were brilliant. I\u2019m over the moon to be going back to Wembley. Now we have to try to get out of the bottom five.\u201d Dean Smith, the Villa supporter and manager, gives Nyland a never-ending pat on the back in the tunnel. These are lovely scenes. Ezri Konsa will be able to play in the final. I thought he would miss out after his yellow card, but the FA have said that isn\u2019t the case. Trezeguet, who scored the winner, and Orjan Nyland, who made umpteen saves across both legs, will take a long time to get off the field. Jack Grealish and Matt Targett were also immense. The final whistle goes: Villa are back at Wembley, and there\u2019s an almighty pitch invasion! 90+7 min Maddison hits the wall - and that\u2019s it! 90+6 min It\u2019s still not over! Maddison has been fouled 30 yards from goal. This should be the last kick of the game... 90+5 min The corner is headed away to the edge of the box, and Ricardo lashes it over the bar. That should be it. 90+4 min Leicester have a corner. Schmeichel is forward... What a finish! Elmohamady, deep on the right, curled a glorious ball between the Leicester defenders and keeper. It went beyond the far post to Trezeguet, who cushioned a beautiful left-footed volley across Schmeichel and into the far corner. Aston Villa are going to Wembley!!!! 90+1 min \u201cWith 15 shots at goal,\u201d deadpuns Matt Stephens, \u201care Leicester City overusing the Maddison Avenue?\u201d 90 min Four minutes of added time, and then a penalty competition. 89 min Maddison curls a corner to the far post, where the under-pressure heads this far wide. Actually, it was even closer than that. It may have got a touch off Konsa as well. Either way, it was inches wide. 86 min Demarai Gray belatedly replaces Harvey Barnes. 85 min I reckon James Maddison has had 15 shots in this tie. Maybe he\u2019s due. 84 min Another Villa change, with the right wing-back Guilbert replaced by Ahmed Elmohamady. 82 min: Chance for Villa on the break! Davis slides an angled through pass to Trezeguet, who moves into the area on the left but hits a fairly tame shot that is comfortably held by the tumbling Schmeichel. 81 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Patrick. \u201cAway goals, etc: does any knockout competition anywhere use time ahead to separate teams? I mean, where Team A\u2019s 70 minutes in the lead (their 10th-minute goal against Team B\u2019s on 80 mins) in a 1-1 draw gets them the result?\u201d Not that I know of. Imaginative though it is, I\u2019m not sure about that idea; I can see a lot of parked buses. 80 min: Double chance for Leicester! Vardy\u2019s low cross was miskicked by Iheanacho at the near post, and Maddison put the loose ball over the bar from 15 yards. I suspect Villa would take penalties now. As with Romania and England at France 98, only one team is going to score here. 78 min Maddison\u2019s deflected cross is kicked behind by Mings. Leicester are going for the kill. 77 min Another Villa change: Trezeguet on, El Ghazi off. 76 min Soyuncu, who might have been booked earlier, gets a yellow card for a high tackle on Grealish. 75 min Demarai Gray was about to come on for Harvey Barnes when Leicester equalised. Now he is back on the bench, sporting a mildly affronted coupon. As things stand, the tie is going to penalties. Leicester moved the ball nicely from left to right and then back across again. Barnes swerved away from Guilbert on the edge of the area and hammered a speculative low cross into ths six-yard box. It cleared everyone in front of goal but reached Iheanacho beyond the far post, and he finished gleefully from close range. It was a harder chance than it looked, actually, because of the pace on the ball. Iheanacho adjusted his feet quickly on the run and slammed it in with his left foot. Kelechi Iheanacho scores against Aston Villa again! 69 min Maddison\u2019s snapshot from the right side of the area goes high and wide of the near post. Jamie Vardy hasn\u2019t touched the ball since coming on 14 minutes ago. 69 min Targett\u2019s very deep corner from the right is headed over by Konsa. He just couldn\u2019t over the ball; had he done so it would have been a fairly simple header because Schmeichel was nowhere. 67 min A Villa substitution. The debutant Ally Samatta, who worked extremely hard but looked short of a gallop, is replaced by Keinan Davis. 66 min Jack Grealish is having a stormer. 64 min: Samatta misses a great chance! Grealish, lurking 40 yards from goal in the inside-right channel, curled a stunning pass between the defenders and goalkeeper that zipped past the unmarked Samatta at the far post. It did bounce a little awkwardly, but he should still have scored. He was four yards from goal and missed the ball completely. It was such a good pass from Grealish, the sort you\u2019d expect from Trent Alexander-Arnold or Kevin De Bruyne. 63 min Grealish\u2019s superb left-footed cross is about to reach Guilbert at the far post when Chilwell flies towards his own goal and heads behind for a corner. Great defending. 62 min Grealish blasts high and wide from the left corner of the box after a one-two with his partner-in-crime Targett. Those two have combined brilliantly all night. 61 min Villa look relatively comfortable at the moment. Relatively. Leicester are showing the first signs of impatience. 60 min Now Douglas Luiz is booked for kicking the ball away. 59 min Barnes wriggles away from two Villa defenders on the edge of the area. He overruns the ball but it comes to Iheanacho, who turns and places a shot too close to Nyland. That was his most comfortable save of the night. 58 min Leicester have switched to a 4-D-2 formation since Vardy came on, with Iheanacho alongside him up front. Mings, who was struggling a few minutes ago, seems okay for now. 57 min Konsa is booked for throwing the ball away, which means he\u2019ll miss the final if Villa get there. 56 min Jamie Vardy is on for Leicester, a bit earlier than expected. The anonymous Ayoze Perez comes off. 55 min Soyuncu flattens Grealish and is a bit lucky not to be booked. The two go head to head after Soyuncu accuses Grealish of diving, but they soon shake hands and make up. 54 min Targett finds Grealish just inside the box on the left. He escapes a Soyuncu-Maddison sandwich but then drags his shot well wide of the near post. Moments later, Targett cracks a shot wide of the far post from 20 yards. Grealish\u2019s was the better chance. 53 min Mings is struggling. It looks like he pulled a muscle when he was stretched to make that interception a couple of minutes ago. 53 min There have been a few zesty challenges since half-time, and it feels like the game could boil over. 52 min Ndidi curls a dangerous through pass towards Iheanacho that is crucially intercepted by the stretching Mings. 49 min Tielemans flashes a dangerous ball right across the six-yard box. Leicester have made a fast start to the second half, as they did the first. 48 min ... and nothing comes of it. 47 min Barnes wins a corner for Leicester, which will be taken by Maddison... 46 min Peep peep! Leicester begin the second half. No changes on either side. \u201cOkay, time to add another VAR disaster to the list,\u201d says J.R in Illinois. \u201cUpon replay that was a blatant handball by Nakamba. Who\u2019s the VAR for this game? Are they afraid to tell Mike Dean he missed something? Oh man it\u2019s so maddening.\u201d Peep peep! Aston Villa lead through Matt Targett\u2019s early goal. It was a superb half of football, with Villa looking dangerous on the break and Leicester forcing three seriously good saves from Orjan Nyland. See you soon for the second half. 44 min Villa break four on four, with El Ghazi\u2019s cross headed over his own bar by Soyuncu. They\u2019ve been a threat on the counter-attack all night. 43 min \u201cAs Nyland dominates through his fingertip brilliance,\u201d begins Michael Hughes, \u201cit\u2019s hard not to acknowledge Schmeichel\u2019s weary trudge towards his only honour this season: The Annual Roy Keane Memorial, Most Overrated Player of his Generation Award. Sad.\u201d 41 min Leicester have upped their game in the last five minutes or so, with Villa struggling to get out of their half. 40 min \u201cRob, why do you think the away goals rule is antiquated?\u201d says Paul-Derek Flint. \u201cExcitement never goes out of fashion.\u201d Well, the away goal doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on excitement - this game has been pretty good, for example. As for why, I suppose the argument is that teams are less likely to play for a 0-0 away from home, as they did during the golden age of catenaccio. I think it\u2019s quite hard to justify the away-goals rule, logically and philosophically, although as I said I do really like it. The tension in the second leg, when the draw is no longer possible, is delicious. But you could also argue that it\u2019s contrived. 38 min This is a brilliant game. Grealish and Targett combine superbly on the left again before Targett cuts the ball back towards Samatta at the near post. He can\u2019t sort his feet out in time and miskicks his attempted first-time shot. That was a decent chance, although it was a sharp cutback from Targett. 36 min I\u2019ve seen a replay now, and under the new laws I\u2019m not sure why it wasn\u2019t a penalty. Maddison\u2019s shot hit Nakamba\u2019s outstretched arm just inside the area. It wasn\u2019t deliberate - Nakamba wasn\u2019t even looking the ball - but his hand was surely in an unnatural position. 34 min: Tielemans hits the bar! It was another great save from Nyland. Tielemans played a one-two on the left, cut inside and hit a cracking rising drive from 20 yards that was pawed onto the bar by Nyland. Maddison then appealed for a penalty when his follow-up shot was blocked. VAR decided there was no handball, although I haven\u2019t seen a replay. 31 min There has been nothing in the game since Targett\u2019s goal. You could argue that, for all Leicester\u2019s possession, Villa have been the more dangerous side in the last 20 minutes. 29 min Maddison loses Nakamba beautifully on the edge of the centre circle, advances to within 25 yards of goal and then slashes a shot well wide. 28 min \u201cI\u2019m really glad that Brendan isn\u2019t leaving anything in the bag, instead sending out his best,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cIf the last couple of days taught us anything, a couple of days that have advanced the dismembering of the Spurs \u2018nearly team\u2019 and the death of basketball\u2019s Kobe Bryant at age 41 it is this: you get so very few chances in sport to complete what you started as a child kicking or shooting a tiny ball at a plastic net, when you have a real chance to touch the silverware, to really know what winning feels like, don\u2019t let the moment pass. Because life, especially the sporting life, guarantees you no second chances, tomorrow may not come.\u201d 26 min: Disallowed goal for Villa. Ndidi gets a last warning for a foul on Grealish, who has been immense so far. As I type that, Grealish plays a lovely angled through pass to release Guilbert - but he makes his run too early and is rightly flagged offside before he crosses for Samatta to score. 24 min A few minutes of calm amid the storm. That goal has certainly had an impact on Leicester, who started the game like a team in a serious hurry. Now they need to be a bit more careful because another Villa goal would put them in serious trouble. 21 min The first quarter of the game has flown by, which is usually a good sign. A Leicester corner is headed away to Ricardo, who slashes the bouncing ball just wide from 25 yards. Nyland had it covered. 20 min El Ghazi\u2019s deep cross from the right is cushioned neatly by Targett, back towards Grealish on the edge of the area. Ndidi gets out well to block Grealish\u2019s first-time shot. 19 min The debutant Samatta pleases the crowd by harassing Tielemans into a mistake near the halfway line. He hasn\u2019t seen much of the ball yet, with Villa playing largely on the break. 18 min Goals change games, and Leicester have yet to regain their strut since going behind. 16 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cWhat are your thoughts on the away goals rule not applying here? I understand that the reasoning behind the rule is probably antiquated, but I think it rewards attacking play and overall makes a two-legged affair more exciting.\u201d Most people I know hate the rule. I\u2019ve always loved it, particularly in Europe, because of the exquisite tension. But like you, I appreciate it\u2019s probably antiquated. 15 min Maddison shoves Grealish over 25 yards from goal, a silly and needless foul. El Ghazi curls it just over the bar. I think Schmeichel would have it covered as he scrambled to his left, but it was a fine effort. The goal came from a good Villa counter-attack. It was made by Grealish, who held off Ricardo just inside the Leicester area while he waited for support. Eventually he bounced a short reverse pass to the overlapping Targett, who smashed a first-time shot that whistled past the left leg of Schmeichel. He couldn\u2019t decide whether to try to save it with his hands or feet; in the end, he did neither. Villa take the lead against the run of play! 9 min Maddison completes a hat-trick of near misses. Already. It was another lovely fingertip save from Nyland, who was probably unsighted when Maddison cracked a left-footed shot from 20 yards. It was going in the corner until Nyland dived a long way to his left to push it round the post. 8 min Tacticswatch: Leicester are playing a 4-2-3-1, with Maddison further forward and Tielemans alongside Ndidi. Thus far it has worked; M addison could have scored twice. 7 min Another chance for Maddison, who slams a left-footed snapshot just wide from the edge of the box. Leicester have made a seriously fast start with and without the ball. 5 min: Brilliant save from Nyland! This has been a great start to the game. Leicester broke dangerously through Iheanacho, who found Maddison on the edge of the area. He beat Mings beautifully through sleight of hip and sidefooted a low shot towards the far corner. Nyland plunged to his left, strained every sinew in his left arm and just got enough on the ball to push it behind for a corner. 4 min A lovely attack from Villa. Grealish plays a fine angled pass to the underlapping Targett, whose driven first-time cross is kicked away at the near post by the stretching Schmeichel with Samatta waiting behind him. 2 min An early chance for Iheanacho! He has such a good record against Villa and almost scored inside two minutes. He was too strong for Mings as the pair wrestled for a bouncing ball on the left side of the area. His shirt was being pulled by Mings but he stayed on his feet and smashed a shot from a very tight angle that was blocked by Nyland. 2 min There aren\u2019t many empty seats now, and there\u2019s a cracking noise as Villa attack for the first time. Chilwell lumps the ball clear. 1 min Peep peep! Villa kick off from right to left. They are in claret and blue; Leicester are in their dark grey away kit. There are a surprising number of empty seats at Villa Park, though that\u2019s probably because thousands of supporters are in the bowels of the stadium quaffing something other than Carabao. This is sheer delightful football writing Brendanwatch \u201cI think tonight could potentially reveal a little bit about Rodgers\u2019 evolution as a coach,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cWill he play his strongest team in their natural positions or will he try and be the smartest guy in the room with innumerable false nines, inverted pyramids and perhaps a rush goalie?\u201d It looks like the strongest team. I think Rodgers has a slightly unfair reputationt. He did and said a few ludicrous things when he was younger, but didn\u2019t we all. In tactical terms, I\u2019ve never really seen him as someone who tries to make the game about him. Pre-match reading Ally Samatta, Villa\u2019s new Tanzanian striker, goes straight into the starting XI. Jamie Vardy is only fit enough for the Leicester bench; but Wilfred Ndidi, who was badly missed in the first leg, returns to the starting line-up. Aston Villa (3-4-2-1) Nyland; Konsa, Hause, Mings; Guilbert, Nakamba, Luiz, Targett; El Ghazi, Grealish; Samatta. Substitutes: Sarkic, Elmohamady, Chester, Hourihane, Lansbury, Trezeguet, Davies. Leicester City (4-1-4-1) Schmeichel; Ricardo, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell; Ndidi, Perez, Tielemans, Maddison, Barnes; Iheanacho. Substitutes: Ward, Justin, Gray, Vardy, Albrighton, Benkovic, Praet. Referee Mike Dean. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg between Aston Villa and Leicester City. Tonight\u2019s match is a cynicism-free zone. There will be no entitlement, no ennui at the prospect of another trip to Wembley; just two teams and sets of supporters who are desperate to reach a cup final. Leicester have not done so since beating Tranmere in the final of this competition 20 years ago. It was known as the Worthington Cup back then, so sponsorship has progressed from booze to energy drinks. By the year 2040, they\u2019ll be competing for the Matcha Latte Cup. The last final Villa reached was the painful FA Cup hammering by Arsenal in 2015. The last time they won a trophy \u2013 not counting the mezzanine Intertoto Cup \u2013 was when they hammered Leeds 3-0 in the final of this competition in 1996. Villa, in particular, will be big underdogs should they reach the final, as they are likely to face the same Manchester City side that plugged them 6-1 the other week. But they\u2019d happily take their chances, because no side in history has won a trophy without first risking their dignity. Besides, beating one of the best teams in Leicester\u2019s history would in itself be a memorable triumph. Leicester start the match as favourites, despite being held to a 1-1 draw in the home leg. You probably know the revised regulations by now: no away-goals rule, no extra-time. If the teams are level after 90 minutes, it goes straight to penalties. May the best team win, and may their fans celebrate until all hours. Kick-off is at 7.45pm GMT.",

Before McConnell told his caucus that he was short on votes, Republicans had threatened to respond to witnesses called by Democrats with a call for witnesses whom Democrats say are irrelevant to the case but whom Trump has been very much focused on: former vice-president Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, the whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment inquiry and potentially others. Hearing from numerous witnesses could extend the impeachment trial, which began last week and so far has had a brief run by historical standards, into next month and potentially beyond. But if Sekulow\u2019s argument sounded like a call for Bolton to testify, that was an aberration from the strong posture of the defense team against witnesses and in favor of ending the trial as quickly as possible. The White House was reportedly spreading the word to senators on Tuesday that calling Bolton or other witnesses would result in a court battle that would prolong the trial indefinitely. Republican senators were to meet on Tuesday afternoon to discuss strategy for the next phase of the trial, a two-day question period in which queries submitted by senators in writing will be read aloud by the chief justice, John Roberts, who is presiding. It is still far from certain that witnesses including Bolton will testify, but since Sunday night, when Bolton\u2019s manuscript was first reported, some more moderate Republican senators have voiced openness to the prospect, a sticking point for congressional Democrats in the impeachment trial. \u201cCertainly a few days ago [the chance of witnesses being called] was zero and now it\u2019s something,\u201d Republican strategist Rob Jesmer told the Guardian. \u201cI think that will massively prolong the trial.\u201d In a Quinnipiac poll released on Tuesday, 75% of registered voters responding said that witnesses should be allowed to testify in the impeachment trial, versus 20% who did not want witnesses. Support for witness testimony included 49% of Republicans. Congress was still digesting the news, reported by the New York Times on Sunday, that Bolton says Trump told him he wanted to keep withholding nearly $400m of security aid to Ukraine until officials there agreed to help investigate political rivals including former vice-president Joe Biden and his family. On Monday night, the New York Times returned to the well, reporting that in the forthcoming book The Room Where It Happened, Bolton writes that he told the attorney general, William Barr, he was concerned Trump was doing personal favors for autocratic foreign leaders. News of Bolton\u2019s book has spurred some more moderate Republican senators \u2013 Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine \u2013 to signal openness to supporting the calling of witnesses. On Tuesday, the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said the \u201cdrip, drip, drip\u201d of information from Bolton\u2019s manuscript was \u201creminiscent of Watergate\u201d, the scandal that led to the resignation of Richard Nixon. Sekulow found another construction to describe the impeachment proceedings in his closing statement on Tuesday: \u201cDanger, danger, danger.\u201d He said: \u201cTo lower the bar of impeachment based on these articles of impeachment would impact the functioning of our constitutional republic and the framework of that constitution for generations. \u201cTo have a removal of a president based on a policy dispute? That\u2019s not what the framers intended.\u201d While Trump\u2019s lawyers have painted Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to force the Ukrainian president to announce an investigation into Biden as a \u201cpolicy\u201d, Democrats have argued it amounted to election tampering, with the goal of providing Trump with a means to smear his potential 2020 rival. Trump\u2019s defense team could be pressed during the next question period of the trial to explain why not hearing from Bolton personally is preferable to calling Bolton, who has pre-emptively agreed to testify, as a witness.",

      "body": "<p>The Last Thing He Wanted, a package that must have seemed seductive on paper, with a red-hot writer-director, a stacked cast of Oscar winners and nominees and some juicy source material, has somehow mutated into a rather damp disappointment on screen, that initial, heady promise evaporating from every frame. It\u2019s not quite the charmless catastrophe that others here at Sundance are claiming it is (and I\u2019ve seen enough catastrophes here to know the difference) but it is an inarguable misfire, wrong or at least ill-advised decisions made at almost every turn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/28/sylvies-love-review-sundance-tessa-thompson-nnamdi-asomugha\">Sylvie's Love review \u2013 heartfelt period romance is a thrilling throwback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s something strangely incomplete about it, as if, as in <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/the-snowman-director-explains-movie-terrible-tomas-alfredson-1201888133/\">the case of The Snowman</a>, the makers ran out of budget and couldn\u2019t afford to film the entire script. The more likely explanation is that the writer-director, Dee Rees, and her editor spent a great deal of time locked in a suite, banging their heads in frustration, slowly realising the impossibility of the task at hand. There\u2019s indistinct dialogue, abrupt character shifts and, most frustratingly, a plot that\u2019s close to impossible to follow. There\u2019s a difference between densely plotted and incoherent and too often her film falls into the latter category, overstuffing and overwriting when some more streamlined and sophisticated storytelling is needed instead.</p> <p>Based on Joan Didion\u2019s 1996 novel, the plot focuses on Elena (Anne Hathaway), a journalist with a \u201cmoral compass\u201d who wants to spend her time and resources exposing political corruption and the cost it has on the little people. But her editor wants her covering the 1984 presidential election and so she finds herself on the road, frustrated, but also using her proximity to those in power to further understand the shadowy link between the US government and an increase in violent conflict in Central America. When her estranged father (Willem Dafoe) is rushed to hospital she takes leave but soon finds herself in even darker territory, helping him complete a dangerous deal.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmrU6gMc1Lc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KmrU6gMc1Lc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As it begins, Rees, who broke out at Sundance with Mudbound three years prior, does something she continues to do throughout her biggest project to date: she follows a strong idea with a weak one, gaining our goodwill before immediately losing it. The film starts with Hathaway\u2019s tireless journalist making notes and Rees chooses to visualise them, fractured and confusing, giving us hints at a plot without spelling it out or cleaning it up.

      "bodyText": "The Last Thing He Wanted, a package that must have seemed seductive on paper, with a red-hot writer-director, a stacked cast of Oscar winners and nominees and some juicy source material, has somehow mutated into a rather damp disappointment on screen, that initial, heady promise evaporating from every frame. It\u2019s not quite the charmless catastrophe that others here at Sundance are claiming it is (and I\u2019ve seen enough catastrophes here to know the difference) but it is an inarguable misfire, wrong or at least ill-advised decisions made at almost every turn. There\u2019s something strangely incomplete about it, as if, as in the case of The Snowman, the makers ran out of budget and couldn\u2019t afford to film the entire script. The more likely explanation is that the writer-director, Dee Rees, and her editor spent a great deal of time locked in a suite, banging their heads in frustration, slowly realising the impossibility of the task at hand. There\u2019s indistinct dialogue, abrupt character shifts and, most frustratingly, a plot that\u2019s close to impossible to follow. There\u2019s a difference between densely plotted and incoherent and too often her film falls into the latter category, overstuffing and overwriting when some more streamlined and sophisticated storytelling is needed instead. Based on Joan Didion\u2019s 1996 novel, the plot focuses on Elena (Anne Hathaway), a journalist with a \u201cmoral compass\u201d who wants to spend her time and resources exposing political corruption and the cost it has on the little people. But her editor wants her covering the 1984 presidential election and so she finds herself on the road, frustrated, but also using her proximity to those in power to further understand the shadowy link between the US government and an increase in violent conflict in Central America. When her estranged father (Willem Dafoe) is rushed to hospital she takes leave but soon finds herself in even darker territory, helping him complete a dangerous deal. As it begins, Rees, who broke out at Sundance with Mudbound three years prior, does something she continues to do throughout her biggest project to date: she follows a strong idea with a weak one, gaining our goodwill before immediately losing it. The film starts with Hathaway\u2019s tireless journalist making notes and Rees chooses to visualise them, fractured and confusing, giving us hints at a plot without spelling it out or cleaning it up. But not long after, we\u2019re drowning in dry, wordy voiceover that might have worked on the page but sinks on screen. Rees is trying to tell us a tightly paced political thriller. At times, briefly, we can see what might have been but there\u2019s too much here to unpack and explain. Her ambition to do it all is ultimately her undoing. It\u2019s quite a maddening watch as Rees darts around carelessly from scene to scene, basic questions left unanswered, plot unfolding into an ungainly mess, and it\u2019s made even more maddening because of the things she gets right: the period re-creation, some stylish directorial choices and her adept, if wasted, cast.

As the president glided through its highlights, the White House audience of American and Israeli officials could barely contain their delight until they rose as one in a standing ovation when Trump announced that the Jewish state will retain control over an undivided Jerusalem. That put paid to the longstanding acceptance that at least part of the east of the city would be a Palestinian capital.</p> \n<p>And so it went on, with Israel to get sovereignty over the Jordan Valley \u2013 the intended breadbasket of a future Palestinian state \u2013 and the principal Jewish settlements, widely considered illegal under international law. In compensation for loss of West Bank territory, the Palestinians would get a large chunk of desert linked to Gaza near the Egyptian border.</p> \n<p>What would remain under the plan, spearheaded by the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a series of cantons linked by bridges and tunnels but entirely surrounded by Israeli sovereign territory \u2013 with the exception of a small strip of Gaza.

Perhaps what will have pleased the Israeli leader most is Trump\u2019s assertion that creation of a Palestinian state is \u201cconditional\u201d on a series of highly subjective tests including whether its leadership is doing enough to combat terrorism and end \u201cincitement\u201d against Israel, which Netanyahu appears to regard as any criticism of his policies.</p> \n<p>Trump praised the Israeli leader for \u201chaving the courage to take this bold step forward\u201d in embracing the plan. It would have been surprising if Netanyahu did anything else and his enthusiasm spilled out as he called it a \u201cgreat plan for peace\u201d that will change history, and described Trump as \u201cthe greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d.</p> \n<p>Few in the room were likely to dispute that, given the backslapping and cheers greeting the announcement as Trump effectively blamed the Palestinians for being occupied.</p> \n<p>But the absence of any actual Palestinians in the room spoke volumes, and criticism of the plan was swift and damning from many quarters.</p> \n<p>Khaled Elgindy, a former peace negotiator and adviser to the Palestinian leadership in the 2000s, said the intent was not to end conflict but to legitimise Israel\u2019s occupation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a plan that has nothing to do with peace. It\u2019s not about two states,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about completely changing the terms of an Israeli-Palestinian settlement to move away from ending the occupation, to move away from two sovereign states. It\u2019s consecrating the status quo. It\u2019s really about normalising Israeli occupation on a permanent basis.\u201d</p> \n<p>Elgindy compared the Palestinian state envisaged in the plan to the nominally independent black homelands of apartheid South Africa, known as bantustans, but said it has been years in the making.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s too easy to say Trump killed the peace process and the two-state solution. It was pretty much dead when he got here. He\u2019s just now trying to bury it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/where-once-there-was-fury-palestinian-issue-now-stirs-up-apathy-in-region\">Where once there was fury, Palestinian issue now stirs up apathy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There was also plenty of criticism from American politicians, too.</p> \n<p>Senator Chris Murphy called the plan an abandonment of longstanding principles and criticised Kushner for a proposal that was \u201cnegotiated with no one but the Israelis\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s also no coincidence this plan supports recognising illegal settlements and unilateral Israeli annexation, while discarding any notion of a two-state solution,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Elgindy said there was little doubt about the Trump administration\u2019s intent because it has long signalled through its actions in endorsing Israeli settlements in the West Bank, moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and cutting off aid to Palestinian refugees.</p> \n<p>\u201cLand for peace is gone.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump pronounced his newly unveiled peace plan \u201coverly good\u201d to the Palestinians but it was the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was at his side, grinning broadly. The unusually detailed 80-page proposal to resolve decades of conflict fulfilled a wishlist of Israeli demands made over the years. As the president glided through its highlights, the White House audience of American and Israeli officials could barely contain their delight until they rose as one in a standing ovation when Trump announced that the Jewish state will retain control over an undivided Jerusalem. That put paid to the longstanding acceptance that at least part of the east of the city would be a Palestinian capital. And so it went on, with Israel to get sovereignty over the Jordan Valley \u2013 the intended breadbasket of a future Palestinian state \u2013 and the principal Jewish settlements, widely considered illegal under international law. In compensation for loss of West Bank territory, the Palestinians would get a large chunk of desert linked to Gaza near the Egyptian border. What would remain under the plan, spearheaded by the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a series of cantons linked by bridges and tunnels but entirely surrounded by Israeli sovereign territory \u2013 with the exception of a small strip of Gaza. Israel is also to retain \u201csecurity control\u201d over the entire area west of the West Bank border with Jordan which appeared to suggest it would have a military presence inside whatever is left of a future Palestine. As Trump spoke, Netanyahu could barely contain his excitement at what looked very much like the rump of a Palestinian state at best, and more than once he grasped the president\u2019s hand in a show of approval. Perhaps what will have pleased the Israeli leader most is Trump\u2019s assertion that creation of a Palestinian state is \u201cconditional\u201d on a series of highly subjective tests including whether its leadership is doing enough to combat terrorism and end \u201cincitement\u201d against Israel, which Netanyahu appears to regard as any criticism of his policies. Trump praised the Israeli leader for \u201chaving the courage to take this bold step forward\u201d in embracing the plan. It would have been surprising if Netanyahu did anything else and his enthusiasm spilled out as he called it a \u201cgreat plan for peace\u201d that will change history, and described Trump as \u201cthe greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d. Few in the room were likely to dispute that, given the backslapping and cheers greeting the announcement as Trump effectively blamed the Palestinians for being occupied. But the absence of any actual Palestinians in the room spoke volumes, and criticism of the plan was swift and damning from many quarters. Khaled Elgindy, a former peace negotiator and adviser to the Palestinian leadership in the 2000s, said the intent was not to end conflict but to legitimise Israel\u2019s occupation. \u201cIt\u2019s a plan that has nothing to do with peace. It\u2019s not about two states,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about completely changing the terms of an Israeli-Palestinian settlement to move away from ending the occupation, to move away from two sovereign states. It\u2019s consecrating the status quo. It\u2019s really about normalising Israeli occupation on a permanent basis.\u201d Elgindy compared the Palestinian state envisaged in the plan to the nominally independent black homelands of apartheid South Africa, known as bantustans, but said it has been years in the making. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to say Trump killed the peace process and the two-state solution. It was pretty much dead when he got here. He\u2019s just now trying to bury it,\u201d he said. There was also plenty of criticism from American politicians, too. Senator Chris Murphy called the plan an abandonment of longstanding principles and criticised Kushner for a proposal that was \u201cnegotiated with no one but the Israelis\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s also no coincidence this plan supports recognising illegal settlements and unilateral Israeli annexation, while discarding any notion of a two-state solution,\u201d he said. Elgindy said there was little doubt about the Trump administration\u2019s intent because it has long signalled through its actions in endorsing Israeli settlements in the West Bank, moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and cutting off aid to Palestinian refugees. \u201cLand for peace is gone. Settlements are fine. Annexation is perfectly acceptable. It\u2019s just a matter of how much and when. That\u2019s a radical transformation of the terms of how we talk about this issue,\u201d said Elgindy, author of the recently published Blind Spot: America and the Palestinians, from Balfour to Trump. Aaron David Miller, a peace negotiator for several US administrations, was equally damning of the proposals. \u201cI worked in administrations from Carter through Bush 43. However misguided some of our efforts have been they were always linked to the objective of trying to make the Israeli-Palestinian conflict more tractable,\u201d he said. \u201cThis plan is completely untethered from any desire to create an environment for negotiation, narrow the gaps between the parties, condition each party to accept certain realities that might, in fact, produce a negotiation.\u201d Miller described the proposals as a political document intended to win support for Netanyahu as he goes into an election in March, under indictment for corruption. Elgindy said that the question now is not whether the plan will be implemented, because \u201cthe Israelis are implementing it on the ground through slow de facto annexation\u201d, but whether other governments end up tacitly legitimising the proposals. The Americans have been working hard to win the support of other governments in the region, particularly Egypt and Jordan, which already have peace treaties with Israel, and Saudi Arabia along with other Gulf states, to buy into the process and pressure the Palestinians to do likewise. \u201cAre we going to see people saying clearly this falls short of the most minimal requirements for a peaceful settlement?\u201d said Elgindy. \u201cAre we going to hear it from the Arab states, from the Europeans, from the rest of the international community in clear terms? Or are we going to hear sort of the diplomatic gobbledygook about seeing if there are elements we can work with?\u201d Tony Blair, the former British prime minister and one-time Middle East peace envoy, gave an early answer, in calling for the Palestinians and Arab governments to negotiate. \u201cThe Palestinians do not need to signal acceptance of the plan, but to engage with the American government and demand the improvements to it they wish to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk of non-engagement with the American administration is that the possibility of realising the two state solution becomes ever more distant.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has unveiled his vision for Middle East peace in a White House launch that gifted Israel a wishlist of its long-held demands while promising Palestinians a potential \u201cstate\u201d, but with severe restrictions. Standing next to the smiling Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump announced details of the 181-page plan to cheers and applause. Palestinian leaders were absent from the launch, having pre-emptively rejected his proposal, citing flagrant bias. \u201cToday, Israel takes a big step towards peace,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cI was not elected to do small things or shy away from big problems.\u201d A copy of the plan, released by the White House, said the proposal intended to: Establish Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s \u201cundivided\u201d capital, with a potential Palestinian capital to the east and north of the city. Recognise the vast majority of Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territory as part of the country. A Palestinian state would receive territory, mostly desert, near Gaza to compensate for the loss of about 30% of the West Bank. Gaza and the West Bank would be linked by high speed rail. Recognise the Jordan valley, which makes up about a third of the occupied West Bank, as part of Israel. Offer a path to some form of Palestinian statehood but with no army, and overarching Israeli security control in some areas, including over the sea. The plan also sets a series of conditions the Palestinians have to meet before receiving independence including the \u201ccomplete dismantling of Hamas\u201d, which governs Gaza. The possibility of stripping Israeli citizenship from tens of thousands of Arab Israelis who live in 10 border towns, with those towns and their residents being included into any future state of Palestine. Recognise sections of the desert bordering Egypt as part of any future Palestinian state. Refuse Palestinian refugees the \u201cright of return\u201d to homes lost to Israel in previous conflicts. Trump said the economic portions of the plan, would lead to 1m new jobs for Palestinians over the next 10 years, invest $50bn in the new state and triple its GDP. Netanyahu lauded the proposal as \u201ca great plan for Israel, it\u2019s a great plan for peace\u201d. Critically, he said the \u201cstatus quo\u201d of Israeli control over the Palestinian territories would remain in place until a deal was reached, which he anticipated would take years. He added to Trump: \u201cYou have been the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.\u201d Speaking to reporters after the joint press conference, Netanyahu said he would seek to take steps to annex the Jordan valley as soon as next week. He said Israel only intended to agree to \u201cconditional, limited sovereignty\u201d for the Palestinians. The Guardian understands that Washington does not intend to press the Palestinians too hard to accept the plan. However, the publication of a set of ideas seen as strikingly favourable to Israeli ultranationalists is likely to embolden the country\u2019s rightwing government to take steps long seen as taboo. After the announcement, Netanyahu\u2019s hawkish allies called for the immediate annexation of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, criticised the deal as a \u201cconspiracy\u201d that \u201cwill not pass\u201d, while in Gaza, the Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhr described the document as worthless. \u201cPalestine will prevail, and Trump and the deal will go to the dustbin of history,\u201d he said.

A Downing Street spokesperson said Johnson told Trump the plan \u201ccould prove a positive step forwards\u201d. The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, later referred to Trump\u2019s deal as a \u201cserious proposal\u201d that should be considered. A statement from the French foreign ministry on Wednesday morning said France welcomed Trump\u2019s latest efforts and that Paris would have to study the proposals closely. The plan\u2019s chief architect, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has delayed the official rollout many times since he first began developing it in 2017. Releasing it now has been interpreted as a way to distract from Trump\u2019s impeachment trial and to help his ally, Netanyahu. The 70-year-old Israeli leader faces three criminal corruption indictments and an uncertain election campaign in just over a month. On Tuesday, he begrudgingly dropped a request for parliamentary immunity after it appeared certain he would fail to garner enough votes. The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said the plan had more to do with Trump and Netanyahu\u2019s legal woes than peace. \u201cThis is a plan to protect Trump from impeachment and protect Netanyahu from prison.

Late on Tuesday afternoon, residents of Tharwa, a village of about 80 people, were told it was too late to leave. The fire was downgraded overnight but Canberra is expected to endure temperatures in the high-30s for the rest of the week and over 40C on the weekend.

Top stories Fifty-one percent of voters believe Scott Morrison should have sacked the Bridget McKenzie over her handling of the $100m sports rorts affair, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The latest survey of 1,080 respondents, taken in the wake of revelations that McKenzie used a sports grants program to favour groups in Coalition-held or targeted seats, also shows voter support galvanising for an independent federal anti-corruption body, with 80% backing the proposal. McKenzie\u2019s controversial sports grants program awarded $248,000 to a country club that has a state National party MP as a life member and former chairman, weeks after the pair visited the venue together. Sport Australia reportedly raised concerns about the controversial $100m sports grant program, warning that the Morrison government\u2019s administration was compromising its independence. An 8,000-hectare blaze burning in the Namadgi national park, south of Canberra. The blaze was started by an Australian Defence Force helicopter carrying a landing light, the heat from which sparked the blaze in hot and dry conditions. Late on Tuesday afternoon, residents of Tharwa, a village of about 80 people, were told it was too late to leave. The fire was downgraded overnight but Canberra is expected to endure temperatures in the high-30s for the rest of the week and over 40C on the weekend. Meanwhile, Australian Research Council laureates have signed a letter saying Australia\u2019s current position as \u201cground zero\u201d for both the impacts of climate change and policy uncertainty presents an opportunity for the country to emerge as a leader in responding to the climate crisis. The Productivity Commission\u2019s review of government services shows Australia has suffered a 10% decline in the number of volunteer firefighters over the past decade. Donald Trump has launched his \u201cultimate deal\u201d for Middle East peace, saying his detailed 80-page plan would be a \u201crealistic two-state solution\u201d that had already been agreed to by Israel, where the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has just been formally indicted in court on corruption charges after he withdrew his request for parliamentary immunity from prosecution. \u201cToday Israel takes a big step towards peace,\u201d Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu at the White House. \u201cI was not elected to do small things or shy away from big problems.\u201d He said Netanyahu had already agreed to a map of how the region would look, with Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s \u201cundivided capital\u201d that gives Israel extra territory. Australia A rare fluorescent pink slug has survived the bushfires that burnt through much of its alpine habitat. The Mount Kaputar slug is found only on a single mountaintop in northern New South Wales. Projects aimed at stimulating drought-affected communities are taking almost 18 months to complete, says a review of the Coalition\u2019s drought communities program, raising doubts about the $300m scheme\u2019s effectiveness. The Aboriginal businesswoman Josephine Cashman has been sacked from her government advisory role, after allegations that she provided a faked letter from a senior Aboriginal leader as part of a campaign to discredit the author Bruce Pascoe. The NSW government has advised school students recently returned from China to stay home for two weeks due to the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. The world French riot police clashed with uniformed firefighters at protests in Paris on Tuesday, in extraordinary scenes where police used batons and shields against crowds of fire officers in helmets. The first human transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus in Europe has been reported in Germany, where a man was infected by a colleague who had been in China, fuelling anxieties about the potential ease of international spread. Bashar al-Assad has recaptured a significant town in Syria\u2019s last rebel-held territory, in an offensive that has driven tens of thousands of people towards the border with Turkey. A disabled man with a long history of mental illness starved to death in Britain just months after welfare officials stopped his out-of-work and housing benefits, it has emerged.

Maybe if you know the sport better than I do it makes more sense that a great player could get it so wrong so often. They asked Bryant how he felt about the record right after he broke it, when he missed a jump shot from 14 feet in the fourth quarter of a loss against the Memphis Grizzlies in 2014. He smiled, and shrugged, and told them: \u201cWell, I\u2019m a shooting guard that\u2019s played for 19 years.\u201d</p> \n<p>Maybe all those misses were just a natural consequence of playing so long.

It was Bryant\u2019s rookie season. In the final seconds of regulation time he tried a mid-range jump shot to win the game, but got it so wrong he missed the rim entirely; in overtime, he tried a three-pointer from out on the left, but it fell short too. With 40 seconds left he tried another from the top of the arc, and it fell short again.

Years later, when they were writing up his legend, this would become one of the more important beats in the story. The Lakers\u2019 former general manager Jerry West called it his defining moment.

      "body": "<p>The government has ordered an urgent inquiry into the local hospital of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, after the Guardian revealed its unprecedented \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d for a whistleblower.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has told NHS England to commission a \u201crapid review\u201d of the actions of bosses at West Suffolk hospital.</p> <p>They are under fire for demanding that staff give fingerprints and samples of their handwriting to help identify who wrote to a family alerting them to failings in care that contributed to a patient\u2019s death.</p> <p>Unusually, the investigation has been instigated by Edward Argar, a junior minister at the DHSC, because Hancock and another health minister, Jo Churchill, are both local MPs who have close ties to the hospital.</p> <p>Argar has made clear to NHS England that the inquiry must be undertaken by independent experts, given those existing relationships.</p> <p>The review could raise difficult questions about what Hancock \u2013 a professed champion of NHS whistleblowers \u2013 knew about the trust\u2019s tactics and what he did about it. He is a staunch supporter of Steve Dunn, the hospital\u2019s chief executive, whom he hailed as \u201ca brilliant leader\u201d when he was made CBE for services to health and patient safety.</p> <p>Announcing the review, Argar made clear that he wanted hospital personnel to speak openly. \u201cI want all staff to feel that they can speak up and have the confidence that anything they raise will be taken seriously,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The move comes a day before the Care Quality Commission publishes an inspection report into West Suffolk that may lead to the hospital losing its outstanding rating.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed last month that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/11/matt-hancock-wont-talk-to-us-say-bullied-doctors-at-hospital-in-suffolk\">health secretary ignored concerns being raised</a> about the hospital, including by some of its doctors.</p> <p>The inquiry\u2019s terms of reference, and the identity of those undertaking it, will be confirmed within days.</p> <p>The Doctors\u2019 Association UK, which has voiced alarm about the \u201ctoxic culture\u201d at the trust, welcomed news of the review.</p> <p>\u201cWe support all initiatives to improve patient safety and therefore welcome this rapid review commissioned by the government, which we hope will shine a light on concerns raised about decisions taken by senior managers,\u201d said Dr Rinesh Parmar, the association\u2019s chair.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope that going forwards the dedicated staff at the trust are given all the support they need to reinstate an environment and culture of openness.

      "bodyText": "The government has ordered an urgent inquiry into the local hospital of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, after the Guardian revealed its unprecedented \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d for a whistleblower. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has told NHS England to commission a \u201crapid review\u201d of the actions of bosses at West Suffolk hospital. They are under fire for demanding that staff give fingerprints and samples of their handwriting to help identify who wrote to a family alerting them to failings in care that contributed to a patient\u2019s death. Unusually, the investigation has been instigated by Edward Argar, a junior minister at the DHSC, because Hancock and another health minister, Jo Churchill, are both local MPs who have close ties to the hospital. Argar has made clear to NHS England that the inquiry must be undertaken by independent experts, given those existing relationships. The review could raise difficult questions about what Hancock \u2013 a professed champion of NHS whistleblowers \u2013 knew about the trust\u2019s tactics and what he did about it. He is a staunch supporter of Steve Dunn, the hospital\u2019s chief executive, whom he hailed as \u201ca brilliant leader\u201d when he was made CBE for services to health and patient safety. Announcing the review, Argar made clear that he wanted hospital personnel to speak openly. \u201cI want all staff to feel that they can speak up and have the confidence that anything they raise will be taken seriously,\u201d he said. The move comes a day before the Care Quality Commission publishes an inspection report into West Suffolk that may lead to the hospital losing its outstanding rating. The Guardian revealed last month that the health secretary ignored concerns being raised about the hospital, including by some of its doctors. The inquiry\u2019s terms of reference, and the identity of those undertaking it, will be confirmed within days. The Doctors\u2019 Association UK, which has voiced alarm about the \u201ctoxic culture\u201d at the trust, welcomed news of the review. \u201cWe support all initiatives to improve patient safety and therefore welcome this rapid review commissioned by the government, which we hope will shine a light on concerns raised about decisions taken by senior managers,\u201d said Dr Rinesh Parmar, the association\u2019s chair. \u201cWe hope that going forwards the dedicated staff at the trust are given all the support they need to reinstate an environment and culture of openness. Not only will this improve staff morale, it will create a palpable change that commands the confidence of the patients of West Suffolk.\u201d The review follows a series of Guardian revelations that have highlighted serious patient safety concerns and the \u201cbullying\u201d of doctors who hospital bosses believed raised the alarm. We disclosed in December that the trust\u2019s management had demanded that doctors provide fingerprint and handwriting samples to track down a whistleblower. The extraordinary tactics sought to identify an anonymous letter writer who alerted Jon Warby, a widower, to surgical mistakes made before his wife, Susan, died in August 2018. An inquest into the 57-year-old\u2019s death was opened earlier this month at Suffolk coroner\u2019s court but has been adjourned. The trust\u2019s tactics, which were widely condemned as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d, cost it more than \u00a32,500, which it spent on handwriting and fingerprint experts. The trust\u2019s medical director, Dr Nick Jenkins, sought to justify them by claiming the letter writer had tried to \u201cweaponise a patient\u201d. In recent weeks the Guardian has reported how: Doctors said they were too scared to report lapses in patient safety in case they ended up facing disciplinary action. Medics later accused management of trying to mislead senior staff about the demand for fingerprints by claiming it was only voluntary when in their view it was \u201ccoercive\u201d. The trust failed to act on a potentially fatal failure to monitor vulnerable patients who were at risk of death. An IT glitch meant that patients at risk of a burst aneurysm were not followed up to see how soon they would need potentially lifesaving surgery. A senior doctor at the trust said the trust initially repeatedly refused to take any action. Last week we revealed that a second family also received a whistleblower tipoff about serious failings in the care of a loved one who later died. Relatives of Horace Nunn were not told of suspected mistakes in his care until two months after an injury in hospital that contributed to his death in July 2016. The hospital is in the Bury St Edmunds constituency of Jo Churchill, the DHSC parliamentary under secretary for prevention, public health and primary care. Churchill has refused to answer a series of questions posed by the Guardian covering what she knew about patient safety concerns and \u201cbullying\u201d, and what action, if any, she then took.",

The news, which was also reported by Hubbard in the New York Times, represents the latest revelation about how Saudi Arabia has allegedly used spyware owned by NSO Group, among other technologies, to target dissidents and journalists. The State Department said on Tuesday \u201cWe have seen the reports and are looking into them\u201d. The attempted hack \u2013 in late June 2018 \u2013 occurred about six weeks after a phone belonging to Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post, is alleged to have been targeted by Saudi Arabia after receiving a WhatsApp message from the account of Mohammed bin Salman.

      "body": "<p>In trying to painstakingly recreate the spirit of a specific genre from a specific moment in time, film-makers often fall into pastiche, focusing so hard on the nuts and bolts that they forget to include any heart. A loving homage can then feel like an exercise in technique, all style and no soul. With his second full-length narrative feature Sylvie\u2019s Love, writer-director Eugene Ashe is paying tribute to the glossy studio romances of the 50s and 60s with the keen eye of someone acutely aware of the subgenre he\u2019s targeting, from the plot machinations to the production design. But what makes his film so very special is his equally vested interest in matching the era\u2019s grand emotional stakes. It\u2019s a film that both looks and feels the part, a handsomely made love story that\u2019s easy to fall in love with.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/27/the-father-review-anthony-hopkins-olivia-colman\">The Father review \u2013 Anthony Hopkins drives devastating dementia drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s New York in the summer of 1957 and Sylvie (Tessa Thompson) is spending the warmest months inside, watching TV at her father\u2019s record store, dreaming of a career producing the shows she loves so much while her fiance serves in the Korean war. One day, on the hunt for the latest Thelonious Monk record, saxophonist Bobby (Nnamdi Asomugha) enters the store and is immediately smitten. He secures a job there and the two flirt over their favourite records, innocently at first but it soon turns into something more. Over the space of six years, they fall in and out of each other\u2019s lives, with circumstances preventing their happily ever after.</p> <p>Operating as both a throwback romance as well as an ode to the \u201cwomen\u2019s pictures\u201d that existed at the same time, Sylvie\u2019s Love is an unashamedly big movie filled with big moments and its deceptively unsophisticated brashness might not be to everyone\u2019s taste. Because it\u2019s not just romantic melodramas that have fallen out of favour, it\u2019s romantic comedies, too, and contemporary audiences aren\u2019t as accustomed to films that fall headfirst into such old-fashioned formulas, which has instead been reclassified as lazy cliche. But there\u2019s something so charming about how Ashe recycles familiar tropes and scenes that I found it impossible to protest.

      "bodyText": "In trying to painstakingly recreate the spirit of a specific genre from a specific moment in time, film-makers often fall into pastiche, focusing so hard on the nuts and bolts that they forget to include any heart. A loving homage can then feel like an exercise in technique, all style and no soul. With his second full-length narrative feature Sylvie\u2019s Love, writer-director Eugene Ashe is paying tribute to the glossy studio romances of the 50s and 60s with the keen eye of someone acutely aware of the subgenre he\u2019s targeting, from the plot machinations to the production design. But what makes his film so very special is his equally vested interest in matching the era\u2019s grand emotional stakes. It\u2019s a film that both looks and feels the part, a handsomely made love story that\u2019s easy to fall in love with. It\u2019s New York in the summer of 1957 and Sylvie (Tessa Thompson) is spending the warmest months inside, watching TV at her father\u2019s record store, dreaming of a career producing the shows she loves so much while her fiance serves in the Korean war. One day, on the hunt for the latest Thelonious Monk record, saxophonist Bobby (Nnamdi Asomugha) enters the store and is immediately smitten. He secures a job there and the two flirt over their favourite records, innocently at first but it soon turns into something more. Over the space of six years, they fall in and out of each other\u2019s lives, with circumstances preventing their happily ever after. Operating as both a throwback romance as well as an ode to the \u201cwomen\u2019s pictures\u201d that existed at the same time, Sylvie\u2019s Love is an unashamedly big movie filled with big moments and its deceptively unsophisticated brashness might not be to everyone\u2019s taste. Because it\u2019s not just romantic melodramas that have fallen out of favour, it\u2019s romantic comedies, too, and contemporary audiences aren\u2019t as accustomed to films that fall headfirst into such old-fashioned formulas, which has instead been reclassified as lazy cliche. But there\u2019s something so charming about how Ashe recycles familiar tropes and scenes that I found it impossible to protest. It\u2019s such a woozily romantic film, soaring and crashing with great force, taking us along with it. Ashe, a former musician, soundtracks his film with jazz, blues, pop and soul of the time filling almost every scene, and his precise eye leads to a number of hair-raising moments matching song to emotion with great skill. The films he\u2019s paying tribute to were almost exclusively led by white actors and there\u2019s something quietly radical about allowing actors of colour the opportunity to inhabit such a glossy, depoliticised space as this. In pre-publicity, former NFL player turned actor-producer Asomugha expressed his desire to see a period film that had black characters experience adversity through circumstance rather than because of their race given how many films, often understandably, show the hardships faced by people of colour during this particular time. The film isn\u2019t blind to the climate and there are microaggressions along the way but Ashe allows his black characters to love and work and exist without their race constantly becoming the defining force of their lives. There\u2019s a crackling chemistry between Thompson and Asmogha, a genuine pulse-quickening connection that\u2019s impossible to feign and rare to witness. Thompson, who has been slightly squandered of late on some bigger, duller movies such as Men in Black: International and Lady and the Tramp, is on fine form here, managing to replicate the charm and style of a 50s matinee lead without her performance ever feeling like an overstudied bit.

While personal terms are yet to be signed between United and the 25-year-old midfielder there is an expectation this will be a formality. Fernandes is set to sign a four-and-a-half year contract with the option of an extra year. United\u2019s stance of refusing to meet the Portuguese\u2019s valuation of \u20ac85m proved successful, Sporting having raised this from an initial \u20ac75m, it is understood. The first \u20ac15m of add-ons is for domestic and Champions League appearances, while the remaining \u20ac10m is for bonuses that will only be triggered if Fernandes achieves exceptional personal incentives. If the midfielder does sign it will represent a significant boost to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. The manager is particularly light in the position due to the long-term injury of Scot McTominay, and the departures over the past 12 months of Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera, neither of whom were replaced. Fernandes, a Portugal international who can also operate as a No 10, has scored 14 goals in 28 games at club and international level this season. He joined Novara in Italy from Boavista at the age of 17 without having played a first-team game in Portugal. The following season he signed for Udinese, staying for three years, ahead of 12 months at Sampdoria. Fernandes then moved back to Portugal, joining Sporting for \u20ac8.5m in 2017. At Sporting Fernandes has won the Ta\u00e7a de Liga in each of his two full seasons plus last term\u2019s Ta\u00e7a de Portugal. He has 19 caps and two goals for Portugal, having made his debut in November 2017 in a 3-0 friendly win over Saudi Arabia in Viseu and was in the XI that beat Holland in the final of last season\u2019s Uefa Nations League. Fernandes\u2019s pedigree and experience will be welcomed by Solskj\u00e6r whose team has been too reliant on younger players this season and which has also showed signs of fatigue recently. Despite an uneven campaign United are still only six points from Chelsea in the final Champions League berth, while they are in the FA Cup fifth round and the Europa League last-32. On Wednesday night they travel to Manchester City for the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg, hoping to overcome a 3-1 deficit from the first leg at Old Trafford three weeks ago.",

Choudhry Ikhalaq Hussain, 42, was extradited on Tuesday after being arrested in January last year in the province of Punjab, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said. He was one of 10 men sentenced in 2016 for committing sexual offences against a teenage girl in Rochdale, but he fled the UK while on bail. Hussain was given permission to leave his trial by the judge after claiming he wanted to go to a relative\u2019s funeral in the UK but instead left for Pakistan. He was sentenced in his absence to 19 years imprisonment in April 2016 after being found guilty of three counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of rape and one count of conspiracy to rape. Hussain was caught as part of Operation Doublet, a large scale police inquiry into historical child sexual exploitation between 2003 and 2013, predominantly in the Rochdale area of Greater Manchester. The case revolved around a girl who walked into a police station shortly after the widely covered 2012 convictions of nine Asian defendants for grooming white girls for sex in the town. The extremely vulnerable young woman told officers she had been raped by 10 men, and had been repeatedly sexually groomed by a large number of men from the age of 14. GMP \u2013 with assistance from national and international partners including the National Crime Agency, the Foreign Office, the British high commission in Pakistan and the Pakistani authorities \u2013 have been pursuing Hussain ever since he fled the UK.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine.

The country saw a similar wave of xenophobia during 2003 Sars outbreak, which also started in China.

      "body": "<p>For the arts \u201cto mean more, to more people\u201d, as Arts Council England (ACE) argues that they should, would be excellent. Music, drama, dance, visual arts, poetry and literature are among the most precious human achievements. To live in a country in which these are more widely shared and enjoyed would be proof that we are making progress. The point is not to entertain or educate people, or bring communities together (although all these things are important). Nor is it all about boosting jobs and investment (although this matters too). Imagination has intrinsic value, and research carried out by ACE in the course of preparing its <a href=\"https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/\" title=\"\">10-year strategy</a> showed that people from all walks of life value and derive pleasure from cultural activities even if they do not associate these with the \u201carts\u201d, a term regarded by some as shorthand for opera and ballet.</p> <p>Positioning itself as a development agency, ACE will now hope to win government backing for a change of direction that orients it away from the biggest and most prestigious national institutions and towards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/27/arts-council-england-culture-in-every-village-town-and-city-strategy-lets-create\" title=\"\">towns, villages and grassroots</a>. There, it envisions a role for itself \u201cbuilding the identity and prosperity of places\u201d, bringing professional artists together with voluntary groups, particular in areas that have previously not been well represented on the cultural map.</p> <p>ACE\u2019s chair, Sir Nicholas Serota, cites the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/01/wearehere-battle-somme-tribute-acted-out-across-britain\" title=\"\">first world war centenary project</a> devised by the artist, Jeremy Deller, and theatre director, Rufus Norris, as the epitome of what he wants his organisation to be about. By dressing volunteers as soldiers, and orchestrating their encounters with members of the public in settings across England, the artists succeeded in \u201cdissolving the barriers between artists and audiences\u201d. While the focus on villages and towns is timely, and chimes with preoccupations about England\u2019s growing divides, such thinking builds on longstanding efforts to spread opportunities more fairly and be more inclusive of minorities.</p> <p>The emphasis on participation \u2013 on culture as something that more people should actually do \u2013 is newer. This is the difference between being in a play or a band and buying tickets to watch them, and for ACE to play a more active role in promoting the former would be beneficial. This begins in childhood, and ACE clearly hopes that the government will think again about policies that have seen music, drama and other arts subjects <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/17/tate-and-steve-mcqueen-call-for-arts-rich-school-curriculum\" title=\"\">systematically downgraded</a> in favour of science, technology and maths.

      "bodyText": "For the arts \u201cto mean more, to more people\u201d, as Arts Council England (ACE) argues that they should, would be excellent. Music, drama, dance, visual arts, poetry and literature are among the most precious human achievements. To live in a country in which these are more widely shared and enjoyed would be proof that we are making progress. The point is not to entertain or educate people, or bring communities together (although all these things are important). Nor is it all about boosting jobs and investment (although this matters too). Imagination has intrinsic value, and research carried out by ACE in the course of preparing its 10-year strategy showed that people from all walks of life value and derive pleasure from cultural activities even if they do not associate these with the \u201carts\u201d, a term regarded by some as shorthand for opera and ballet. Positioning itself as a development agency, ACE will now hope to win government backing for a change of direction that orients it away from the biggest and most prestigious national institutions and towards the towns, villages and grassroots. There, it envisions a role for itself \u201cbuilding the identity and prosperity of places\u201d, bringing professional artists together with voluntary groups, particular in areas that have previously not been well represented on the cultural map. ACE\u2019s chair, Sir Nicholas Serota, cites the first world war centenary project devised by the artist, Jeremy Deller, and theatre director, Rufus Norris, as the epitome of what he wants his organisation to be about. By dressing volunteers as soldiers, and orchestrating their encounters with members of the public in settings across England, the artists succeeded in \u201cdissolving the barriers between artists and audiences\u201d. While the focus on villages and towns is timely, and chimes with preoccupations about England\u2019s growing divides, such thinking builds on longstanding efforts to spread opportunities more fairly and be more inclusive of minorities. The emphasis on participation \u2013 on culture as something that more people should actually do \u2013 is newer. This is the difference between being in a play or a band and buying tickets to watch them, and for ACE to play a more active role in promoting the former would be beneficial. This begins in childhood, and ACE clearly hopes that the government will think again about policies that have seen music, drama and other arts subjects systematically downgraded in favour of science, technology and maths. Libraries are another theme, and given the funding pressures that many are under it is a good idea for ACE to support partnerships, building capacity and widening the range of access points to cultural life. To what extent the vision is realised will depend in part on whether ACE\u2019s ambitions catch the government\u2019s interest sufficiently to influence the upcoming spending review, and provide a counterweight to the scorn poured on the humanities (particularly English degrees) by the prime minister\u2019s adviser, Dominic Cummings. Around \u00a3400m has been cut from local government arts budgets since 2010, and ACE cannot plug this gap. The closure of youth clubs and live music venues, and growing financial pressures linked to the property market, are among other reasons for the worrying narrowing of opportunities that have been widely noted in recent years. So far Boris Johnson has offered few signs that he has in mind a starring role for the arts in post-Brexit Britain, although 2022\u2019s Festival of Brexit is one. ACE\u2019s plan should boost all those, in government and outside, who are arguing for more.",

The higher number is a fairer guide to performance since it gives a total return, but it is still appalling for a fund that started life in June 2014 at 100p.</p> <p>And the performance will remain appalling when the administrator has flogged the fund\u2019s eclectic collection of stakes in unquoted companies and divvied up the proceeds (minus expenses, naturally). Those infamous holdings may add only 10p-15p, or thereabouts, to the per-share distribution.</p> <p>It adds up to dismal under-performance \u2013 and then some. The average equity income fund rose 34% during the life of Woodford\u2019s version, according to data-cruncher Morningstar\u2019s figures.

His mis-adventures in the world of unquoted bio-tech companies might have been more bearable if the bulk of the fund had held more of his old-style investments.</p> <p>Instead, he selected dogs such as the AA, Capita, Imperial Brands, Provident Financial and Stobart. There was \u201cno common theme that I can detect \u2026 other than the fact that they all subsequently fared badly\u201d, said Smith, cruelly but accurately.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business Today sign up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Woodford\u2019s cheerleader-in-chief, investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, may or may not explain in detail, with its full-year results this Friday, why it sustained its ra-ra rhetoric on the Equity Income Fund until the shutters came down last June. Its chief executive, Chris Hill, has been promising ever since to share his \u201clearnings\u201d from the episode and may finally be ready to opine.</p> <p>He could start by admitting that a supposedly neutral fund platform, if it insists on shoving \u201cbest buy\u201d recommendations towards its punters, has to be able to spot serious cases of style drift and shout about them.</p> <p>Hargreaves failed, so has its \u201cresearch\u201d department received a root-and-branch reform? And will the firm\u2019s Wealth 50 list of top tips be ditched in its present form? It ought to be. It\u2019s discredited.</p> <h2>FCA was right on overdrafts</h2> <p>Are you scandalised that the banks \u2013 or most of them \u2013 have decided that 40% is the right rate to charge for an overdraft?</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority does not officially have feelings on the matter. At this stage, it\u2019s merely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/28/uk-banks-overdraft-rates-fca\">asking lenders</a> for \u201cevidence of how they have arrived at their pricing decisions\u201d. There has been \u201csignificant comment\u201d on the near-identical rates \u201cover the past few days\u201d, notes the regulator.</p> <p>That dry remark hints at what\u2019s really going on. The FCA fears headlines about greedy banks will be followed by headlines about an incompetent regulator. After all, this situation has arisen because the FCA demanded that lenders abolish fees and sky-high rates on unauthorised overdrafts. From April, only a clean single rate can be applied to all overdrafts, arranged or otherwise.</p> <p>The FCA, though, should calm down. It did a good thing by stopping banks ripping off unauthorised borrowers \u2013 often those classed as vulnerable \u2013 with rates far higher than 40%. It injected much-needed transparency into a market it rightly used to describe as dysfunctional.</p> <p>But the process was bound to create losers since the banks were never likely to set a one-size-fits-all rate at the bottom of the old range. More credit-worthy borrowers are complaining, but would probably find cheaper credit elsewhere if they looked. On this occasion, the FCA shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed. It chose transparency and was right to do so.</p> <h2>John Lewis follows the herd</h2> <p>It was probably inevitable that employee-owned John Lewis would one day stop allowing the world to see its sales numbers on a weekly basis. From now on, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/28/john-lewis-to-replace-weekly-sales-updates-with-twice-yearly-ones\">it\u2019ll be twice-yearly</a>, just like a boring, normal company.</p> <p>The timing of the change, though, does not scream confidence. As the old gag goes, bad numbers take longer to add up, and the department stores are on a shocking run.</p>",

It is still shocking, though, to see how little Woodford loyalists will get. The first distribution will be 48p-58p, depending on whether investors held an income or accumulation class of share. The higher number is a fairer guide to performance since it gives a total return, but it is still appalling for a fund that started life in June 2014 at 100p. And the performance will remain appalling when the administrator has flogged the fund\u2019s eclectic collection of stakes in unquoted companies and divvied up the proceeds (minus expenses, naturally). Those infamous holdings may add only 10p-15p, or thereabouts, to the per-share distribution. It adds up to dismal under-performance \u2013 and then some. The average equity income fund rose 34% during the life of Woodford\u2019s version, according to data-cruncher Morningstar\u2019s figures. It\u2019s as if Woodford was playing a different sport. Actually, rival fund manager Terry Smith at Fundsmith expressed the point better the other day. Pledging to continue to invest in what he knows about, Smith said Woodford indulged in \u201cstyle drift\u201d, in the industry jargon. \u201cWould Juventus do as well if Cristiano Ronaldo played as goalkeeper?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is Usain Bolt\u2019s second career as a soccer player going?\u201d Well, quite. Woodford (while paying himself like Ronaldo, don\u2019t forget) strayed a long way from his old specialism in large companies paying big dividends. His mis-adventures in the world of unquoted bio-tech companies might have been more bearable if the bulk of the fund had held more of his old-style investments. Instead, he selected dogs such as the AA, Capita, Imperial Brands, Provident Financial and Stobart. There was \u201cno common theme that I can detect \u2026 other than the fact that they all subsequently fared badly\u201d, said Smith, cruelly but accurately. Woodford\u2019s cheerleader-in-chief, investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, may or may not explain in detail, with its full-year results this Friday, why it sustained its ra-ra rhetoric on the Equity Income Fund until the shutters came down last June. Its chief executive, Chris Hill, has been promising ever since to share his \u201clearnings\u201d from the episode and may finally be ready to opine. He could start by admitting that a supposedly neutral fund platform, if it insists on shoving \u201cbest buy\u201d recommendations towards its punters, has to be able to spot serious cases of style drift and shout about them. Hargreaves failed, so has its \u201cresearch\u201d department received a root-and-branch reform? And will the firm\u2019s Wealth 50 list of top tips be ditched in its present form? It ought to be. It\u2019s discredited. FCA was right on overdrafts Are you scandalised that the banks \u2013 or most of them \u2013 have decided that 40% is the right rate to charge for an overdraft? The Financial Conduct Authority does not officially have feelings on the matter. At this stage, it\u2019s merely asking lenders for \u201cevidence of how they have arrived at their pricing decisions\u201d. There has been \u201csignificant comment\u201d on the near-identical rates \u201cover the past few days\u201d, notes the regulator. That dry remark hints at what\u2019s really going on. The FCA fears headlines about greedy banks will be followed by headlines about an incompetent regulator. After all, this situation has arisen because the FCA demanded that lenders abolish fees and sky-high rates on unauthorised overdrafts. From April, only a clean single rate can be applied to all overdrafts, arranged or otherwise. The FCA, though, should calm down. It did a good thing by stopping banks ripping off unauthorised borrowers \u2013 often those classed as vulnerable \u2013 with rates far higher than 40%. It injected much-needed transparency into a market it rightly used to describe as dysfunctional. But the process was bound to create losers since the banks were never likely to set a one-size-fits-all rate at the bottom of the old range. More credit-worthy borrowers are complaining, but would probably find cheaper credit elsewhere if they looked. On this occasion, the FCA shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed. It chose transparency and was right to do so. John Lewis follows the herd It was probably inevitable that employee-owned John Lewis would one day stop allowing the world to see its sales numbers on a weekly basis. From now on, it\u2019ll be twice-yearly, just like a boring, normal company. The timing of the change, though, does not scream confidence. As the old gag goes, bad numbers take longer to add up, and the department stores are on a shocking run.",

The idea was floated by Robin Grossmith of the Federation of Racecourse Bookmakers as he gave evidence to a House of Lords select committee on gambling on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of our guys has put forward an idea, which could possibly work, that you have an exclusion zone in front of the bookmakers, perhaps a metre or something like that, that nobody under the age of 18 can cross that line,\u201d Grossmith said. \u201cThat could be a help but this is something we need to speak to the racecourses about, because it is their land.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/shell-shocked-bookmakers-face-big-fines-underage-betting-royal-ascot\">\u2018Shell-shocked\u2019 bookmakers face big fines for underage betting at Royal Ascot</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The hearing, at which evidence was also heard from Nick Rust, chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, had been planned for some time and was intended to cover the broad topic of racing\u2019s relationship with gambling. However, the witnesses were inevitably questioned about the news that bookmakers had been caught by a \u2018test purchaser\u2019 two years below the minimum legal age for betting of 18.</p> \n<p>Grossmith continued: \u201cWe can improve the situation by having better and clearer signage, working with the racecourses themselves to have announcements over the speakers about underage betting. On the big screens that all racecourses have, they can make a better effort to put up notices to that effect.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll bookmakers carry leaflets in their bags for problem gamblers, issued through us. So if somebody wants to self-exclude, they talk to us and we can give them the literature, with details of who they can contact for help. We do everything we can but we are a very small community and operate on very limited funds.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rust was asked if racecourses should give a different entry badge to underage spectators, so they could be more readily identified by bookmakers, and welcomed that as \u201ca good idea\u201d. He went on: \u201cAs the governing body for the sport, though we don\u2019t directly regulate this aspect, we\u2019re very disappointed by this. We can\u2019t comment on the specific case.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen these [enforcement] visits first started happening in betting shops ... betting shops didn\u2019t do well, early on.

      "bodyText": "A child-free exclusion zone around racecourse bookmakers is one of the ideas being considered in the wake of news, revealed by the Guardian on Monday, that seven bookmakers are facing hefty fines for taking a bet from a 16-year-old at Royal Ascot last summer. The idea was floated by Robin Grossmith of the Federation of Racecourse Bookmakers as he gave evidence to a House of Lords select committee on gambling on Tuesday. \u201cOne of our guys has put forward an idea, which could possibly work, that you have an exclusion zone in front of the bookmakers, perhaps a metre or something like that, that nobody under the age of 18 can cross that line,\u201d Grossmith said. \u201cThat could be a help but this is something we need to speak to the racecourses about, because it is their land.\u201d The hearing, at which evidence was also heard from Nick Rust, chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, had been planned for some time and was intended to cover the broad topic of racing\u2019s relationship with gambling. However, the witnesses were inevitably questioned about the news that bookmakers had been caught by a \u2018test purchaser\u2019 two years below the minimum legal age for betting of 18. Grossmith continued: \u201cWe can improve the situation by having better and clearer signage, working with the racecourses themselves to have announcements over the speakers about underage betting. On the big screens that all racecourses have, they can make a better effort to put up notices to that effect. \u201cAll bookmakers carry leaflets in their bags for problem gamblers, issued through us. So if somebody wants to self-exclude, they talk to us and we can give them the literature, with details of who they can contact for help. We do everything we can but we are a very small community and operate on very limited funds.\u201d Rust was asked if racecourses should give a different entry badge to underage spectators, so they could be more readily identified by bookmakers, and welcomed that as \u201ca good idea\u201d. He went on: \u201cAs the governing body for the sport, though we don\u2019t directly regulate this aspect, we\u2019re very disappointed by this. We can\u2019t comment on the specific case. \u201cWhen these [enforcement] visits first started happening in betting shops ... betting shops didn\u2019t do well, early on. And they soon learned. I think this is something where Robin and his team need to work even harder. \u201cRacecourses and racing can do more. Historically, this is low risk, because of the environment, but a young individual has come along and been able to do this. We need to get hold of it and make sure that it\u2019s dealt with, across our courses.\u201d Meanwhile, a spokesman for Ascot said the racecourse would approach the seven bookmakers, when they are eventually identified after completion of an appeal process, to stress that they must do more to avoid accepting bets from those under 18. Weather-watch Somehow the weather is contriving to be a problem for horse racing around Britain and Ireland, in differing ways at each trouble-spot. The most immediate casualties have beenTuesday\u2019s card at Lingfield, abandoned when the course was found to be waterlogged, and now Hereford on Wednesday, due to standing water on the track. The place where they could really have done with rain in recent weeks is Leopardstown, where the Dublin Racing Festival will take place this weekend, with a whole load of top-class races, including the Irish Champion Hurdle and the Irish Gold Cup. Incredibly, they\u2019ve been watering the course over the past week, desperate to avoid a repeat of what happened last year, when unseasonably quick going led to 22 non-runners and a field of four for the Gold Cup.",

      "bodyText": "Miriam Haley, one of the two main accusers of Harvey Weinstein at his sex crimes trial in New York, described to her roommate soon after the alleged attack how she was sexually assaulted by the movie producer in his Soho loft, the jury heard on Tuesday. The roommate, Elizabeth Entin, described a conversation she had with Haley in the Manhattan apartment they shared in summer 2006. She was lying on her bed reading, she said, when Haley appeared in the doorway. Entin said Haley \u201cwas very nervous, she was pacing and seemed anxious. She told me she had gone to the apartment of Harvey Weinstein, she had assumed it was work-related but he started rubbing her shoulders and kissing her as she said \u2018No, no.\u2019\u201d Entin, who was then an assistant fashion stylist, recalled what Haley told her. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m on my period.\u2019 He said, \u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 at which point he threw her down while she was still saying \u2018No.\u2019\u201d The witness said she remembered Haley telling her Weinstein ripped out her tampon \u201cand went down on her while she was still saying \u2018No.\u2019 I said, \u2018Miriam, that sounds like rape.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you call a lawyer?\u2019\u201d Entin is the main supporting witness called by the prosecution to bolster the accusations of Haley, a former production assistant who worked for Weinstein on the TV show Project Runway and who testified on Monday. Haley\u2019s allegations form one of the two pillars of the case. Weinstein is charged with five counts, one of which is that he committed a criminal sex act \u2013 forcible oral sex \u2013 on Haley. He also faces two counts of rape relating to another woman who has yet to testify. Facing life in prison, he denies all charges and claims of sexual misconduct. Four other women will be called as supporting witnesses in an attempt to prove a predatory pattern of sexual assault. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers have aggressively pursued prosecution witnesses in an attempt to discredit their accounts as fabricated or motivated by a desire to extract money from the Hollywood titan. Such tactics were displayed towards Entin. In exchanges with lead defense attorney Donna Rotunno, Entin reacted sharply to suggestions she advised Haley to call an attorney, rather than the police, because she thought there was money in it. Entin objected, saying: \u201cI was thinking if anyone was a victim of sexual assault they should stand up for themselves in a criminal prosecution as they are entitled to.\u201d Rotunno asked why Entin never advised her roommate to avoid Weinstein. \u201cI did not think that was my place, and I thought an older man could certainly contain himself,\u201d the witness replied. Following heated disagreements between lawyers out of the earshot of the jury, judge James Burke allowed prosecutors to show jurors a series of photographs of Weinstein at different stages in his career. One had him smiling beside former president Bill Clinton. Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, the lead prosecutor, told the court the photos were designed to underline the power wielded by Weinstein. \u201cThe witnesses say the power differential between them and Harvey Weinstein was tremendous \u2013 you have a woman brought up in a dairy farm \u2026 he was everything and she was nothing.\u201d The judge permitted the Clinton photograph to be introduced as evidence. But Burke declined to allow the prosecution to show the jury photos of the defendant in the company of Hillary Clinton, former vice-president Al Gore and the Queen.

      "bodyText": "Students in California may soon have the option of taking a mental health day. Senate bill 849, written by the California state senator Anthony Portantino, would allow students time out of school to treat or attend to mental health needs without risk of being considered truant, an infraction that could lead to penalties for students and fines for parents. Portantino, whose brother committed suicide, said in a press release that a rising number of school-age children in California are struggling with depression, anxiety or thoughts of self-harm and that he hopes the bill would make it easier for students to ask for help. \u201cThe whole focus of this effort is to reduce the stigma around seeking help and make this issue commonplace in conversations,\u201d Portantino told the Guardian. Other states, including Oregon, Florida and Utah, have taken similar steps to allow students time off for mental wellness. Under California law, students are already excused from school for falling ill, going to medical or dental appointments, or attending funerals. The new bill would not increase the number of total days a student could miss, but it would add to the list of justified absences, excusing students \u201cfor the benefit of the mental or behavioral health of the pupil\u201d. Music Watson, spokeswoman for the San Diego office of education, which oversees and supports more than 40 school districts in southern California, said that her office is still waiting for specifics to emerge on the bill, but that it seems in line with a larger push to boost mental health support for students \u2013 an effort that the office of education has gotten behind. \u201cWe want to make sure students get the help that they need, and have an obvious interest in helping reduce stigma and addressing the mental health issues youth are facing,\u201d Watson said. But she said one concern for education officials is whether the bill would create an incentive to miss school more often, which could have an impact on learning and even a school\u2019s budget. Because California schools receive funding based on student attendance, any absence, excused or not, means less money for schools. Dr Mark Reinecke, a clinical director and psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, is broadly supportive of the bill, which he said reduces stigma and encourages young people to seek help, something that could offer long-term benefits. For about three-quarters of adults who struggle with anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder, symptoms first appeared in childhood, he said. Seeking treatment earlier could be a way to head off future problems. Yet, Reinecke cautions against what he said could be \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the legislation, which could increase absenteeism or even worsen symptoms for students dealing with phobias and anxiety around school. In 2016, about 8 million students in the US missed three or more weeks of school, absences that put students at risk of lower test scores and higher dropout rates. In California, a student who misses 10% of the school year \u2013 about 18 days \u2013 is considered chronically absent. Missing school for any reason counts as lost instructional time, which tends to have particularly negative impact on young children, Reinecke said. In short, the benefits of the bill would depend on how schools are implementing it. \u201cFor most teens, missing school to seek treatment would be greatly beneficial, and I think that\u2019s the way this bill is intended,\u201d Reinecke said. \u201cBut for children with school phobia or anxiety, missing school would be the last thing you want. It would magnify the problem.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Portantino has taken the legislative lead on issues affecting children and families. Last year, in an effort to give teenagers more sleep time, the lawmaker authored a bill to push back start times for high schools to 8.30am and middle schools to 8am or later. The bill was later signed into law. Portantino acknowledges a need to iron out specifics on the mental health bill, but said the conversation itself underscores the need for clarity in the education code. \u201cIf you sprain your ankle, we don\u2019t ask how bad it is, or whether it justifies missing work or school. We trust the person to get evaluated and the doctor to come to an informed decision. We\u2019re not talking about giving students an excuse to stay home \u2013 we\u2019re talking about treating this illness as we would any other illness,\u201d he said. The bill is set to wind its way through the legislative process. If it survives, it could head to the governor\u2019s desk in the fall and become law no sooner than January 2021.",

      "bodyText": "Ivanka Trump has waded into a row over a CNN segment in which host Don Lemon laughed as two guests ridiculed supporters of her father. The president\u2019s daughter said: \u201cThe arrogance, mocking accents and smug ridicule of this nation\u2019s \u2018real elites\u2019 is disgusting.\u201d Amid backlash to the CNN clip and Ivanka\u2019s Tuesday morning tweet, one of the CNN guests, Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant turned Trump critic and author, responded with characteristic force. Wilson said in a message to the Guardian: \u201cHer hypocrisy is breathtaking. She went to Chapin and never worked for anyone not called Daddy.\u201d Chapin is an exclusive all-girls school in Manhattan, which the first daughter attended before boarding at Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut. She joined the Trump Organization from college, appeared with her billionaire father on TV in The Apprentice and is now a senior White House adviser. The CNN footage was broadcast on Saturday night but came to attention on Monday when an excerpt was tweeted by the media analyst Steve Krakauer. In the footage, Wilson and the New York Times columnist Wajahat Ali joined Lemon to discuss secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u2019s public clash with NPR over a reporter\u2019s questions about Ukraine. Pompeo, Wilson said, \u201cknows deep in his heart that Donald Trump couldn\u2019t find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it. He knows that this is an administration defined by actual ignorance of the world.\u201d Lemon burst into laughter, lowering his head to his desk and mopping his eyes with a handkerchief. Pompeo, Wilson continued, was \u201cplaying to [the Republican] base. You know, the credulous boomer rube demo that backs Donald Trump that thinks Donald Trump\u2019s the smart one and\u201d \u2013 he adopted an exaggerated accent \u2013 \u201cY\u2019all elitists are dumb.\u201d Amid laughter, Ali interjected: \u201cYou elitists, with your geography and your maps and your spelling.\u201d After more remarks and more laughter, Ali said: \u201cSorry, I apologise. It was Rick\u2019s fault. I blame Rick.\u201d Collecting himself, Lemon said: \u201cThat was a good one. I needed that.\u201d In his tweet, Krakauer wrote: \u201cThe arrogance, the dismissiveness, the smug cackling, the accents. If Donald Trump wins re-election this year, I\u2019ll remember this brief CNN segment late one Saturday night in January as the perfect encapsulation for why it happened.\u201d On Monday, a story on the footage was duly published by the conservative news site the Daily Caller, which said in an accompanying tweet: \u201cAmerica, this is what CNN thinks of you.\u201d Donald Trump, a president who has by one count made more than 16,000 false or misleading claims since entering office, has excoriated CNN as a bastion of supposed \u201cFake News\u201d media. On Monday night he retweeted the clip and criticized Lemon in familiar fashion, calling him \u201cthe dumbest man on television (with terrible ratings!)\u201d. Amid predictable furore, Wilson and Ali responded in kind. \u201cI believe we have \u2018triggered\u2019 the \u2018snowflakes\u2019 just by doing a short segment on TV with some levity,\u201d Ali wrote. \u201cDid I use the terminology correctly?\u201d Things took a more serious turn in Ali\u2019s penultimate tweet of the night, however, when he wrote: \u201cTrump tweeted our CNN clip from [two] days ago. Friends are now concerned about my safety. I refuse to be intimidated [and] bullied by bad faith actors who cry fake victimhood, whining about a harmless, silly 30-second clip while endorsing Trump, a cruel vulgarian who debases everyone.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For months the phrase \u201cAustralian points-based immigration system\u201d has been used as political shorthand for a more controlled immigration system, but beneath the headline there has been little understanding of what this might mean in the UK.</p> <p>The home secretary asked the government\u2019s official migration policy advisers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/28/migration-committee-advises-against-full-points-based-system-for-uk\">review the Australian immigration system</a> to \u201cadvise on what best practice can be used to strengthen the UK labour market and attract the best and brightest from around the world\u201d.</p> <p>But in its 271-page report, the migration advisory committee (Mac) does not back an Australian-points based system. Rather, it recommends a mixed system, which would rely on a minimum salary threshold for those people coming to the UK with a job offer and a points-based system for skilled workers coming to the UK without an arranged job.</p> <h2>What is the Australian points-based immigration system?</h2> <p>Australia has what is known as a general skilled migration programme, where immigrants applying for a visa are typically selected based on \u201ceconomically relevant characteristics\u201d such as education, language skills and work experience. This does not apply for refugees and asylum seekers and there are other visas available with different requirements, such as travel or holiday visas.</p> <p>The exact way points are allocated changes depending on policy and the labour market but typically an applicant picks a \u201cskilled occupation\u201d from a list and needs to score a minimum number of points. The visa application is submitted online after a series of checks and requires personal, financial and contact details, identity documents, and education, employment, health and travel history.</p> <h2>What has the Mac recommended?</h2> <p>If the government wants a points-based system it should only introduce it for skilled workers without a job offer, the committee concludes. Currently the main way in to the UK for non-EU migrants requires them to have a job.</p> <h2>What else has it recommended?</h2> <p>The Mac recommends cutting the salary threshold for skilled migrants from \u00a330,000 to \u00a325,600 for those coming to the UK with a job offer.</p> <p>This could make it easier for teachers, NHS employees and people at the start of their careers to qualify.

      "bodyText": "For months the phrase \u201cAustralian points-based immigration system\u201d has been used as political shorthand for a more controlled immigration system, but beneath the headline there has been little understanding of what this might mean in the UK. The home secretary asked the government\u2019s official migration policy advisers to review the Australian immigration system to \u201cadvise on what best practice can be used to strengthen the UK labour market and attract the best and brightest from around the world\u201d. But in its 271-page report, the migration advisory committee (Mac) does not back an Australian-points based system. Rather, it recommends a mixed system, which would rely on a minimum salary threshold for those people coming to the UK with a job offer and a points-based system for skilled workers coming to the UK without an arranged job. What is the Australian points-based immigration system? Australia has what is known as a general skilled migration programme, where immigrants applying for a visa are typically selected based on \u201ceconomically relevant characteristics\u201d such as education, language skills and work experience. This does not apply for refugees and asylum seekers and there are other visas available with different requirements, such as travel or holiday visas. The exact way points are allocated changes depending on policy and the labour market but typically an applicant picks a \u201cskilled occupation\u201d from a list and needs to score a minimum number of points. The visa application is submitted online after a series of checks and requires personal, financial and contact details, identity documents, and education, employment, health and travel history. What has the Mac recommended? If the government wants a points-based system it should only introduce it for skilled workers without a job offer, the committee concludes. Currently the main way in to the UK for non-EU migrants requires them to have a job. What else has it recommended? The Mac recommends cutting the salary threshold for skilled migrants from \u00a330,000 to \u00a325,600 for those coming to the UK with a job offer. This could make it easier for teachers, NHS employees and people at the start of their careers to qualify. The committee recommends higher thresholds for more highly paid occupations. What are the pros and cons? The committee\u2019s recommendations would reduce levels of immigration, the size of the UK population and total GDP, and increase pressure on social care, the Mac said. But they would probably reduce pressures on the NHS, schools and on social housing. Will the report make any difference? Probably not. After its publication, the home secretary, Priti Patel, dismissed the committee as \u201cadvisory\u201d, setting the stage for the government to plough ahead with whatever plans it deems most effective. Commenting on the report, a Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe will deliver on the people\u2019s priorities by introducing a points-based immigration system from 2021 to attract the brightest and best talent from around the world, while reducing low-skilled migration and bringing overall numbers down.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s nearly time for the first US interest rate decision of 2020 - but don\u2019t expect many fireworks. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its benchmark Fed Funds rate unchanged, at 1.5% to 1.75%. Following three cuts in the second half of 2019, the Fed is effectively on hold - waiting to see how the economic data plays out. Although trade tensions have eased, the coronavirus crisis is a new threat to global growth - so central bankers will remain cautious. Finally, the FTSE 100 index has closed 68 points higher at 7480, up almost 1% today. That still means it has lost 100 points over the last two sessions, amid coronavirus worries. David Madden of CMC Markets says traders have been snapping up potential bargains after Monday\u2019s rout, and hoping Beijing gets a grip on the crisis: Stock markets in Europe have pulled back some of the ground that was lost yesterday. In relation to the coronavirus, the situation has deteriorated in the past 24 hours as the number of confirmed infections has risen, and so has the number of fatalities. The positive move in equities is probably down to short covering plus bargain hunting as the health crisis has deepened. The longer the news story hangs around, traders might build up a tolerance to it. The Chinese central bank has made it clear it is willing to use monetary tools in a bid to lift economic sentiment, should they feel it is required. The message from Beijing reassured traders somewhat, but the acid test will be whether the rebound lasts or not. Here\u2019s an interesting thread on the implications of the coronavirus, from Canada\u2019s Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD). Stock markets are now moving higher, lifted by hopes that the coronavirus outbreak could be controlled following Zhong Nanshan\u2019s optimistic comments today. The pick-up in American consumer confidence is also lifting equities, as it bodes well for US economic growth this year. But... the main indices have still only recovered a third of Monday\u2019s losses. FTSE 100: up 61 points or 0.9% at 7,475 German DAX: up 87 points or 0.66% at 13,292 French CAC: up 48 points or 0.8% at 5,911 Wall Street has also opened higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 129 points or 0.45% (it lost 450 points on Monday). Chris Towner, Director at risk advisor JCRA, says investors are trying to get to grips with the Wuhan virus. \u201cWith the death toll rising above 100, financial markets are still trying to gauge the potential reach of this deadly virus. By comparison, the SARS virus impacted 8098 people with 774 fatalities. The question now is how quickly can this virus be contained and, in the meantime, how many countries and economies will be impacted? In times of risk aversion money normally floods into the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. Due to the proximity of Japan to China the risk of the virus penetrating Japan is high, with one confirmed case so far. Therefore, the Swiss franc is currently seen as the ultimate safe haven and has strengthened by over 3% against the Euro from its pre-Christmas level of 1.10 CHF to the Euro in the 1.06\u2019s, the strongest level since April 2017. Markets will now be focusing on the pace of the spread of the virus and whether there are signs of acceleration or deceleration.\u201d Just in: US consumer confidence has rallied this month, by more than expected. The Confidence Board\u2019s survey of consumer morale has spiked to 131.6, up from 128.2 last month. Americans interviewed for the survey said their current financial situation had improved, adding that they were more optimistic about their future prospects. A top Chinese respiratory scientist has predicted that the Wuhan coronavirus has predicted that the outbreak could peak in one week or around 10 days. Zhong Nanshan made the comments in an interview with Xinhua, the state news media site. They say: \u201cIt is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be no large-scale increases,\u201d Zhong said. Zhong is the head of a national team of experts set up for the control and prevention of the novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Zhong really knows his stuff -- he was deeply involved in fighting the SARS outbreak back in 2003 (telling reporters that the situation wasn\u2019t under control). So this could be an encouraging signal, if Zhong is right.... But with more cases detected in Thailand today, and a second patient in Germany, the situation is still moving fast. Despite the slump in demand for aircraft, overall US durable goods rose by 2.4% in December. But if you strip out defence kit, demand was slightly lower. That\u2019s a disappointing sign, says Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers: Ouch. We have fresh evidence today that Boeing\u2019s 737 Max crisis is causing economic harm. First up, US aircraft orders plunged by almost 75% in December, according to the latest durable goods orders report just released. That\u2019s the biggest slump in non-defence aircraft orders since 2009, as airline hold off buying 7373 Max jets until the problems that caused two fatal crashes are fixed. This delay is hurting Boeing (which sacked its CEO last month), and also harming its customers. It currently hopes to get the plane flying by this July. Ryanair has warned pilots that it could be forced to close some bases, resulting in job cuts, because of the persistent delays. In a memo, the budget airline told staff it won\u2019t receive its first 737 Max jets until September or October at the earliest, as Ryanair does not take deliveries during its peak summer months of June, July and August. It had originally hoped to take delivery last April, boosting capacity on its routes. Back in the UK, some of the investors caught up in Neil Woodford savings scandal have learned how much of their money has been lost. And, as feared, it\u2019s a very heavy blow. Link Fund Solutions, which has been winding up the Equity Income fund, says investors will receive an initial payment of 46.3p and 58.9p for each share they owned in the fund, compared to 100p when it was launched. They should receive a second payment, once the less-liquid assets held by the fund are sold off (although that will be a trickier task). More here: Several companies have instructed some staff not to come into the office Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs has told staff who have visited mainland China to work from home for the next fortnight, Reuters reports. Chinese video games giant Tencent and online retail giant Alibaba are also trying to keep staff out of the office, CNBC flags up: The oil price would probably be even lower, but for ongoing supply disruption in Libya. Libya\u2019s crude output has tumbled in recent days, as the Libyan National Army (based in Benghazi) have blockaded ports as part of their campaign against the Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord. This has pulled Libya\u2019s oil production down from 1.2m barrels a day to 260,000 barrels and it could soon all-but run out. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, predicts that Opec (the oil cartel) could soon step in and cut supplies, to prop prices up. \u201cThe University of Hong Kong estimates that at least 25,630 people in Wuhan have symptoms of the virus with 44,000 infected with no symptoms yet. This should imply that the sell-off in Brent crude is still not yet over, as the crisis is still intensifying.... On the supply side however, we see that Libya\u2019s oil production will likely be down to zero (from 1.1 m bl/day) within days. OPEC is also following the coronavirus situation closely. It will most likely step in and reduce supply for a month or two in order to prevent an inventory build-up which the market would have to struggle with for an extended period. The oil price is also suffering today, with Brent crude down 1% at $58.88 per barrel. At one stage it touched $58.88, the joint-lowest since October. Analysts at SP Angel Oil and Gas blame the \u2018panic\u2019 around the escalating coronavirus, telling clients: The number of casualties in China continues to climb, as do cases of the virus elsewhere in the world The Chinese government has tried to quarantine Wuhan and other cities, affecting tens of millions of people. Multinational businesses in China are also implementing lockdown procedures. Oil demand growth is the biggest factor weighing on prices, China\u2019s oil demand has been growing at an annual rate of 5.5%, while comparatively, US oil demand has been growing by 0.5% Most of the demand loss will come from jet fuel as the risk of disease discourages travellers Back in the UK, retail sales remain flat this month despite the so-called Boris Bounce. Retailers are evenly split between those enjoying stronger sales this month, and those suffering weaker demand. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s monthly \u2018distributive trades\u2019 survey, which has come in at zero for January, the same as December. That\u2019s better than November\u2019s -3, and a sharp improvement on the -49 suffered last August (when most shops reported declining volumes). Retailers also reported that sales were poor for the time of year, undermining the theory that December\u2019s general election has brought much cheer. Anna Leach, CBI Deputy Chief Economist, says: \u201cBoth official data and business surveys are painting a picture of subdued activity for retailers. A challenging Christmas has extended into the New Year, with little expectation of any improvement soon. \u201c2020 looks set to be another tough year for the sector as growth in households\u2019 disposable income is set to remain modest and retailers continue to battle longer-term issues such as digital disruption and the cumulative burden of policy costs. The upcoming Budget provides an opportunity for the Chancellor to support retailers, primarily by fixing the broken business rates system.\u201d Copper prices are also being hurt by the prospect of China\u2019s economy slowing as its government grapples with the coronavirus shutdown. The futures price of Copper is down 0.5% today, and is on track for its 10th daily fall in a row. Copper is seen as a bellweather of the health of the global economy (known as \u2018Doctor Copper\u2019 in the City). Fashion chain Burberry is suffering badly from the virus crisis. It\u2019s the biggest faller on the Footsie this morning, down 3.5% at \u00a319.30. Burberry\u2019s shares have now lost 17% of their value since 17th January, just before experts warned that the virus could be much more serious than first thought. Asia is a massively important market for Burberry. Last week, it reported that sales in mainland China had grown by \u201cmid-teen\u201d levels. It has been hoping for a bumper Lunar New Year -- creating a \u201cRatberry\u201d campaign to piggy-back off the Year Of The Rat. It also planned to take its Autumn/Winter 2020 runway show to Shanghai in April and open our first social retail store in Shenzhen, in partnership with Tencent. Those plans could all be hurt by the Wuhan coronavirus. Neil Mackinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, has also been looking at previous viruses such as SARS, for indications of how the Wuhan coronavirus may play out. The lesson, he says, is that markets may tumble in the face of an epidemic-- but they then typically bounce back. \u201cOf course, making any accurate quantitative estimate of what the coronavirus means for global and Chinese GDP growth estimates or what it might mean for financial markets is fraught with difficulties. However, that is the nature of the beast. Equity markets seem to want to believe \u201cgood news\u201d. In other words, investors, in the absence of anything else to work on, refer to previous viruses, such as SARS in 2003 or MERS in 2012, as a template for price action in the markets or in terms of economic developments. The investment message from those episodes is that equity markets can drop 10% or so over a 1-3 month period before strongly bouncing back. Negative effects on economic growth are equally short-lived. For example, developing Asia recovered at an 11% pace after the summer of 2003.\u201d The Coronavirus crisis could drive China\u2019s economy into reverse, fears Freya Beamish. chief Asia Economist at Pantheon Economics. In a new research note, Beamish predicts that China\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d real GDP could be flat, or even fall in January-March, due to the efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, factory shutdowns, and fearful consumers. She points out that the SARS virus caused a serious slowdown back in 2003, damaging service sector activity and manufacturing output. We reckon the brunt of the damage was done in Q2 2003, when real GDP growth dropped to 1.8% quarter-on-quarter, from an average of 2.8% in the previous three quarters. Growth then rebounded sharply in Q3, to 3.4%, coming off the favourable base of Q2, but again was weak in Q3. Although coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS, it may be more contagious -- and Beijing may impose more stringent measures to tackle the virus. Beamish predicts: The bottom line here is that China could even see a contraction in quarterly real GDP growth in Q1, in reality, depending on the timing of factory closures and how long it takes to contain the virus. We are assuming that missed spending will be recouped in Q2, leading to a bumper quarter, though it\u2019s very possible that some of the expenditure on services around the holiday simply will be lost. This means the overall economy may not bounce back in the same way as in 2003. In short, you can make up for factory shutdowns by increasing overtime, but making up spending for a lost holiday is more complicated. And the containment measures could go on for longer than in our baseline assumption. A person in Japan who has not visited Wuhan has contracted the coronavirus, local media are reporting. Reuters explains: Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said a person in Japan who had not visited Wuhan has contracted the new coronavirus, Japanese media reported on Tuesday. The infected person is a tour bus driver in his 60s in the city of Nara, Kyodo said. Health Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. The European market rally is now fading, as Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam outlines new measures to curb transport between her city and mainland China. Hong Kong is suspending its high-speed rail link with China, and also cutting the number of flights in an attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus. Sensible measures, but they also highlight how the epidemic will hurt economic activity in the region. After their worst day in four months yesterday, European stock markets have opened higher this morning. But it\u2019s only a small recovery, given they lost over 2% on Monday. FTSE 100: up 27 points or 0.38% at 7439 German DAX: up 38 points or 0.3% at 13,239 French CAC: up 27 points or 0.5% at 5,891 Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says traders should await coronavirus developments.... It makes sense to compare and draw some inference between now and the performance of markets during SARS. European equities saw a 20-25% drawdown during SARS. The FTSE 100 is down just under 4% from its recent peak and the DAX has lost under 2.5% so there is plenty of downside risk. Is that size correction likely? The lower mortality rate of the Wuhan virus is a reason for optimism it won\u2019t. But extra caution is needed because China is now much more important to the global economy than it was in 2003. We think it is better to wait for the rise in the number of cases to slow before getting positive about the markets again. We know there is an incubation period of 14 days and the virus can be passed on when the subject is not showing symptoms. Putting that together, we could be on the cusp of a plateau or a massive escalation in the number of cases. MSCI\u2019s index of emerging markets shares has dropped by 0.5% today, amid worries that the coronavirus will hurt global growth. John Velis of BNY Mellon Markets says: With Chinese authorities working hard to contain the spread of the virus, and firms and provinces extending the week-long lunar new year to prevent massive travel volumes at the height of an epidemic, we\u2019re seeing anecdotal evidence of large factories going idle until well after the new year, and foreign companies evacuating non-Chinese citizens. Japan\u2019s stock market has fallen to a three-week low today. The Nikkei shed 0.55%, hurt by coronavirus worries and a rally in the yen (as investors race for save havens). Companies exposed to the Chinese economy did badly, but shares in pharmaceuticals firms jumped. Reuters has the details: Shares of South Korean mask producer Monalisa surged 29%, while South Korean pharmaceuticals Kukje Pharma and Woojung Bio added 29% and 21% respectively on Tuesday. Japan\u2019s Kawamoto Corp, which supplies medical products including masks, saw its share prices tripled, while Japanese protective clothing maker Azearth rose 53% in the past week. Malaysia\u2019s Top Glove Corp has seen its shares surge by a quarter in a week. Several economists fear that the coronavirus will hurt China\u2019s economy -- although there\u2019s uncertainty over quite how bad it will be. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: Economists agreed that the outbreak will have a negative impact in China but the lack of understanding about how the virus spreads and how bad it might be was adding to uncertainty to the mix and compounding investor concerns. Citigroup said on Tuesday: \u201cThe wildcard is not the fatality rate, but how infectious the Wuhan virus is. The economic impact will depend on how successfully this outbreak is contained.\u201d The consultancy Capital Economics said the impact could be similar to the Sars outbreak in 2003 which knocked three percentage points off growth \u201cThe outbreak is developing too rapidly to predict with any confidence the final extent of the economic damage,\u201d said Capital\u2019s chief Asia economist Mark Williams. \u201cBut it is now certain that the outbreak will have a significant impact on China\u2019s GDP this quarter.\u201d And although China recovered quickly from Sars, Williams said the local economy was much stronger back in 2003 and was not facing the cyclical and structural headwinds posed by slowing population growth and industrialisation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the globe are focused on one question today -- how serious is the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, and what impact will it have on the global economy? Global equities suffered sharp losses on Monday, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 plunged over 2% - its worst day since October. Wall Street followed, losing 1.5% as traders fretted that the virus could become a SARS-like epidemic proportions. Overnight, the death toll from the virus hit 106, with more than 4,515 cases of the illness now been recorded across China. The first death has been reported in Beijing, highlighting how the virus has spread beyond the city of Wuhan. This has prompted losses in some Asia-Pacific market today, particularly in markets which were closed on Monday. South Korea\u2019s KOSPI 200 index has been badly buffeted, losing 3% during Tuesday\u2019s session, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 1.35% , with tourism, consumer and mining stocks leading the charge downwards. Australia\u2019s economy is tightly linked to China, providing the coal and iron ore needed to sustain the Chinese economy. But it\u2019s hard to assess quite how much economic damage coronavirus could cause. My colleague Ben Butler reports: \u201cWe haven\u2019t got enough information,\u201d the economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin said. McKibbin has previously estimated that a \u201cmild\u201d pandemic in Asia, such as the 1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak which killed about 1m people, would carve 0.8% from Australia\u2019s gross domestic product, with most of the damage felt in the services sector. And in a 2004 paper co-authored with the World Health Organisation, he estimated the 2003 Sars outbreak, which killed about 800 people, cut Australian GDP by 0.07%. China\u2019s stock markets remain closed for the Lunar New Year - preventing traders in Shanghai, Shenzhen or Beijing from selling stocks. Europe\u2019s stock markets may recover today - the FTSE 100 just opened 38 points higher (having lost 173 on Monday). But any signs that the virus is spreading faster or claiming more lives could send stocks down again. Part of the problem, bluntly, is that pneumonia pandemics aren\u2019t well understood in the City. Investors have been swotting up fast about incubation times, mortality rates and infectious control -- but it\u2019s still hard to plug this public health crisis into a classic trading mode. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com puts it: The problem is investors have very limited visibility of the current situation in China, have virtually zero knowledge of epidemiology and virology, and have no clue how bad it will get or lasting the impact will be. Risk models are not geared for this situation. Here\u2019s a pithier take: Also coming up today A new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s retail sector is expected to show a pick-up in spending this month, as confidence rises following December\u2019s general election. New economic surveys from the US could show a rise in durable goods orders, and consumer confidence. However, such data could soon be overtaken by concerns over the coronavirus. The agenda 11am GMT: CBI index of UK retail sales for January. Forecast to rise to +4. from 0 1.30pm GMT: US durable goods orders for December. Forecast to rise by 0.9%, from -2.1% 3pm GMT: US consumer confidence index for January. Forecast to rise to 128.0, from 126.5",

      "body": "<h2>YOU KNOWS WE LOVES HIM</h2> \n<p>Come on then, what\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho up to? What\u2019s his angle? He has spent most of his career buying ready-made players, and The Fiver fully expected him to celebrate his first transfer window at Spurs by signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Samuel Eto\u2019o and Ricardo Carvalho\u2019s dad. Instead, he\u2019s brought in three players whose combined age is only just older than Ibrahimovic. Gedson Fernandes, 21, joined on loan from Benfica with a view to a permanent move; goalscoring winger Steven Bergwijn, 22, is on the way from PSV; and Welsh comedy hip-hop group Goldie Lookin\u2019 Chain, 23, have made their loan from Betis permanent. Eh? What do you mean GLC stands for Giovani Lo Celso?</p> \n<p>Doesn\u2019t matter. Point is that Mourinho has grudgingly conceded that, at the age of 41, Didier Drogba\u2019s trophy-lifting days are over. Either that or \u2013 and this is The Fiver\u2019s preferred theory \u2013 he knows he\u2019ll be back in the studio with Graeme and Roy before the end of the season and is stealthily plotting to take credit for his successor\u2019s success by buying so many young players that at least one of them plays a significant part in Spurs\u2019 future.

Villa, who drew the away leg 1-1, are aiming to reach their first Worthington Cup final since 2010, when they had no answer to a match-winning performance from referee Phil Dowd. Leicester last won it in 2000, when Matt Elliott\u2019s two goals took care of Tranmere. Elliott is 51 now, which in previous years might have made him a prime target for Mourinho. Not anymore. This is a new phase. The Special One is dead; the Happy One can no longer be bothered to pretend he doesn\u2019t hate almost everything about the modern world; but he still has enough <em>joie de vivre</em> to teach the life-changing magic of the low block to a group of willing students.

Another January signing, Mbwana Samatta, is expected to make his Aston Villa debut in their Milk Cup semi-final second leg against Leicester later. Villa, who drew the away leg 1-1, are aiming to reach their first Worthington Cup final since 2010, when they had no answer to a match-winning performance from referee Phil Dowd. Leicester last won it in 2000, when Matt Elliott\u2019s two goals took care of Tranmere. Elliott is 51 now, which in previous years might have made him a prime target for Mourinho. Not anymore. This is a new phase. The Special One is dead; the Happy One can no longer be bothered to pretend he doesn\u2019t hate almost everything about the modern world; but he still has enough joie de vivre to teach the life-changing magic of the low block to a group of willing students. Long live the Mouharishi! LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Rob Smyth from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Aston Villa 1-2 Leicester City (agg: 2-3) in the Milk Cup. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIs [Diego] Simeone the best manager in the world now? For me, personally, yes. When people actually play for him they realise how good he is. Obviously you\u2019ve got some good managers: [J\u00fcrgen] Klopp, [Pep] Guardiola, Sean Dyche. You\u2019ve got quality managers out there but he\u2019s certainly up there\u201d \u2013 Kieran Trippier elevates Burnley\u2019s boss into the rarified air of modern greats. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRegarding Anne Francke (yesterday\u2019s Quote of the Day), does The Fiver know how long it takes VAR chat to turn into talk of bedroom conquests? Just that a couple of lads who sit near me at work have been talking about VAR for the last two years and I\u2019d like to know when they will change the subject\u201d \u2013 Gareth McCann. \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s last line about the ubiquity of Right Here, Right Now as pre-match hype music. I\u2019ve been at many different sporting venues over the years where the soundtrack has been restricted to a low-budget dad rock compilation or worse, Queen\u2019s greatest hits. Be careful what you wish for\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor. \u201cRochdale have been coming on to Stone Roses\u2019 This is the One for a long time now \u2013 although I suspect this is because the PA system can\u2019t handle new-fangled tunes like Fatboy Slim\u201d \u2013 Nick Livesey. \u201cFurther to the ongoing red-hot squirrel pronunciation chat (Fiver letters passim), it is not just those abroad that have issues. Often in my beloved Dublin, it is a word that gets pronounced with an extraneous \u2018d\u2019, sounding like \u2018squirdel\u2019 or even \u2018squiddle\u2019\u201d \u2013 Derek McGee. \u201cRe: Robi Polgar (yesterday\u2019s letters). Consider this your first purchase. I felt it necessary to reward such bravery for writing a football-themed murder mystery and therefore putting yourself up against that literary (and perhaps literally) behemoth of Bernard Cribbins\u201d \u2013 Nick Dent. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Gareth McCann, who wins a copy of the Blizzard\u2019s: The Best of the First Five Years, signed by editor and Fiver colleague Jonathan Wilson.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Espanyol will ban 12 supporters for racially abusing Athletic Bilbao\u2019s I\u00f1aki Williams after an analysis of video footage led to their identification. No amount of verbal pelters will make J\u00fcrgen Klopp field a team of grown-ups for Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup replay with Shrewsbury. \u201cI have to make decisions that aren\u2019t popular,\u201d he blathered. \u201cNo one wants to take money away from smaller clubs but replays are not solutions.\u201d Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, is still digging. West Ham\u2019s accounts describe Premier League survival as a financial \u201cnecessity\u201d. No pressure then, Moyesy! Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r reckons Manchester United have to be \u201cperfect\u201d to overturn a 3-1 deficit against Manchester City in the Rumbelows Cup semi-final. \u201cWe have got to go into the memory bank and think about PSG, and the game in December gives us hope [too],\u201d cheered Solskj\u00e6r, quickly emptying said bank. The FA Cup fifth-round tombola has given crass betting gimmick Wayne Rooney the chance to face Manchester United if Derby can get past Northampton. And after six months of doing absolutely nothing, Hatem Ben Arfa has got bored and signed up for six months of fun and games at Real Ronaldo-owned Valladolid. STILL WANT MORE? From a Danish dinner to Inter move: how Spurs lost control in the Eriksen saga. By David Hytner. The racist abuse directed at I\u00f1aki Williams suggests racism still isn\u2019t being treated seriously enough in Spanish football, reports Sid Lowe. Gary Lineker talks Brexit, VAR, the boys of 1990 and much more as he gets his chat on with Donald McRae. Talking of Brexit, or its opposite, Scott Murray tells a cracking tale of Wembley\u2019s Common Market match, to mark the UK\u2019s EEC entry in 1973. More fun than anything Mark Francois has up his sleeve, even if it\u2019s a low bar. Oh, and if it\u2019s your thing \u2026 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace. And INSTACHAT, TOO!

      "bodyText": "In 1965, American primetime TV went all colour; the UK did the same in 1969. But Australia couldn\u2019t afford a war in Vietnam and new technology at the same time \u2013 so despite leading the world in TV firsts like nudity and sexual taboos, none of it happened in colour until the mid-1970s. When colour came to Australian TVs, it came in a uniquely Australian way: ushered in by an outrageous comedy legend named Aunty Jack, whose catchphrase to \u201clittle kiddies\u201d everywhere was: \u201cIf you don\u2019t behave, I\u2019ll jump through your set and rip yer bloody arms off!\u201d It\u2019s no surprise that the show \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s first and most surreal sketch comedies \u2013 caused howls of protest when it first hit the airwaves in 1972. Aunty Jack (Grahame Bond) looked like a cuddly pantomime dame \u2013 until you noticed her moustache, boxing glove and baritone. Older viewers were horrified, but their kids loved her from night one. It was their enthusiasm that kept the show on air, when many executives would have loved to have yanked it off as soon as possible. But The Aunty Jack Show became a phenomenon; a spin-off single, a re-record of its closing theme Farewell Aunty Jack, stayed on top of the Australian music charts for several straight weeks. \u201cBack then, we had to be wildly innovative to have a point of difference to British and American shows,\u201d the producer Maurice Murphy says. Australia finally allowed its networks to start colour tests from late 1974 \u2013 but it was limited to four hours per week per network. \u201cC-Day\u201d, when all networks would go into colour full-time, was earmarked for Saturday 1 March 1975. It was a time for celebration. While back then TV stations would sign off overnight, this Friday, every network would broadcast all night long: a heady mix including classic movies (Von Ryan\u2019s Express), two-year-old sports events (tennis) and racy specials (Playboy Bunny of the Year).

Aunty Jack was filmed in advance at Gore Hill; vision mixer Bruce Wilson struggled with the technical details: for the special episode, they wanted to show colour \u201cleaking\u201d into Aunty Jack\u2019s house, from the window. \u201cIt took a lot of mucking around, switching between the black and white feed and the colour one \u2013 but in the end, it was quite the hoot.\u201d The colour, of course, was crucial to this process \u2013 \u201cThe key to it was the flesh tones of the actors, and then everything else would fall into place,\u201d Wilson says \u2013 but nothing could be done about people at home fiddling with the dials on their expensive new sets. \u201cEveryone had their colour set to maximum,\u201d TV fan Greg Swan says. \u201cIt was like, we paid for colour, we want colour! Faces were bright red and skies were saturated blue \u2026 it was crazy!\u201d Also testing the limits were Bond and Murphy \u2013 who decided to have some fun at the ABC\u2019s expense, which also happened to be a bit illegal. The notorious \u201cnaughty boys\u201d informed the programming department that Aunty Jack\u2019s \u201cchangeover to colour\u201d would begin at the three-minute mark \u2013 but it actually happened two minutes and 30 seconds in. \u201cThe ABC went to colour half a minute before midnight,\u201d Bond says, \u201cbeating all the other channels who played by the rules.\u201d Murphy says they \u201ctook a gamble that the transistors would be switched on early \u2013 and luckily for us, they were\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Fifty-one per cent of voters believe the prime minister, Scott Morrison, should have sacked the Nationals minister Bridget McKenzie over her handling of the $100m sports rorts affair, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The latest survey of 1,080 respondents, taken in the wake of revelations that McKenzie used a sports grants program to favour groups in Coalition-held or targeted seats, also shows voter support galvanising for an independent federal anti-corruption body, with 80% backing the proposal. When asked about the conduct of McKenzie in allocating grant funding to marginal seats to favour the Coalition in the election, 51% said they believed the prime minister should have stood McKenzie down from cabinet over the issue, while just 15% endorsed Morrison\u2019s decision to support his colleague. About a third (34%) of participants said they had not been following the issue. Coalition voters were the least likely to say that Morrison should have stood the minister down, with 41% of voters saying she should go, 27% supporting the prime minister and the remainder unsure. The result comes after an explosive ABC report on Tuesday revealed that Sport Australia raised concerns that the Morrison government\u2019s administration was compromising its independence in the weeks leading up to the election, and as the merit assessment scores of more than 2,000 projects were made public. The fresh revelations will heap further pressure on Morrison to move against the agriculture minister, whose conduct is being examined by the head of the prime minister\u2019s department, Phil Gaetjens. The Essential survey, taken from 20 to 27 January, shows that support for McKenzie\u2019s removal is higher than voter support in December last year for the removal of Angus Taylor from cabinet. At that time 35% of voters supported Taylor\u2019s removal after police initiated an investigation into the doctored documents scandal. Voters were also asked in the same poll if they supported the establishment of an independent federal corruption body to monitor the behaviour of our politicians and public servants, with 75% supporting the idea. This has since grown to 80%. The number of respondents \u201cstrongly supporting\u201d a new federal anti-corruption body has also risen, going from 42% in December to 49%, with support highest among Labor voters at 86%. Across all voting groups, only 7% opposed the idea, while 13% reported they were unsure. The survey also tested voter sentiment about the government\u2019s climate change policies, asking about a range of hypothetical policy responses that could underpin the government\u2019s pledge to \u201cevolve\u201d its response to the climate crisis. The most popular response was for the accelerated development of new industries and jobs powered by renewable energy, with 81% of respondents supporting the measure, including 75% of Liberal and National voters. Almost three-quarters (71%) of those surveyed supported a zero-carbon pollution target to be set for 2050, but support was high among Labor and Green voters (81% and 89% respectively) and low among Coalition voters at just 56%. When asked if they supported the prevention of new coalmines opening in Australia, the view of respondents split dramatically, with 48% of Coalition voters opposed to the idea, and 84% of Greens voters and 70% of Labor voters supportive. Across all potential policies, support was higher among Labor and Greens voters, and lower among Coalition supporters. The survey on climate policies comes as Morrison faces mounting pressure to explain how he intends to \u201cevolve\u201d the government\u2019s climate change policies after he indicated the government would do more in the wake of the bushfire crisis. The prime minister has conceded the severity of the fire season is partly caused by climate change, but has sought to shift the focus to \u201cadaptation and resilience\u201d and a \u201cpractical\u201d response, rather than on emissions reduction measures. In a speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday, Morrison will focus on the government\u2019s \u201cpractical\u201d response to the bushfire crisis, flagging a change to how the federal government can respond in times of national emergency. Morrison will say that while it is appropriate for states to take a leading role, \u201cwhere, when and how the resources and capabilities of the federal government should be engaged is less clear\u201d. \u201cTo date, the role of the commonwealth in responding to natural disasters has been limited to responding to requests for assistance from state governments. They judge the time and form of support needed,\u201d draft excerpts of Morrison\u2019s speech say. \u201cThe scale of the bushfires this season \u2013 not least their simultaneous reach across state borders \u2013 has unequivocally demonstrated the limits of those arrangements.\u201d He will flag a review of the constitutional and legal framework to allow the commonwealth to declare a national state of emergency, the legal interface with the states and territories on responding to national emergencies, and an enhanced national accountability regime for natural disaster risk management, resilience and preparedness. The Essential poll, released on Wednesday, also canvassed support for a new national day to recognise Indigenous Australians either to replace or to sit alongside Australia Day. The survey found that compared to last year, support has decreased 2 percentage points with an overall 50% of respondents supporting the concept. Of those surveyed, 32% supported including a separate national day with a further 18% supporting a replacement of Australia Day. Support for a separate day was highest among Greens (73%) and Labor (58%) voters, and among those aged 18-34 (65%). Young people in this cohort were also far less likely to celebrate Australia Day compared to last year, down from 45% in 2019 to 32%. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3%.",

      "bodyText": "Australia has suffered a 10% decline in the number of volunteer firefighters over the last decade, according to the Productivity Commission\u2019s review of government services. The latest instalment of the review, released on Tuesday, found that the number of volunteer firefighters nationwide has dropped from 169,766 to 152,798 in the decade from 2009-10 to 2018-19. In the same time, the total proportion of volunteers, including firefighters and support staff, has dropped from 1,015 per 100,000 people to 824, almost a 20% reduction. The new figures come after an unprecedented season of bushfires and fierce political debate about Australia\u2019s preparedness both in terms of emergency services resourcing and the need to do more to combat global heating. In December, the prime minister Scott Morrison first rejected calls to compensate volunteers before bowing to mounting pressure from Labor and some within his own ministry, creating a supplement to pay volunteers. Under the scheme, eligible volunteers will receive $300 a day up to a total of $6,000 if called out for more than 10 days this fire season. The review of government services found the long-term trend of decline continued in the last year, with the number of volunteers engaged in firefighting falling from 156,319 in 2017-18 to 152,798 in 2018-19. Most states and territories contributed to the decline, with 1,745 fewer volunteers engaged in firefighting in New South Wales, 794 fewer in Queensland, 442 fewer in Victoria and 403 fewer in the Northern Territory. Only the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania bucked the trend, adding just 28 and 20 volunteer firefighters respectively. While the volunteer workforce has shrunk, the number of professionals has grown \u2013 suggesting the trends are driven in part by the urbanisation of the population, with more Australians living in cities and towns served by professional firefighters. The number of professional firefighters and support staff has grown from 17,278 in 2009-10 to 20,692 in 2018-19, although the proportion of the population engaged in professional firefighting rose only slightly from 61 per 100,000 people to 63. Jurisdictions with the highest rate of attrition of professional firefighters in the last year were Queensland, with 7% quitting the service, followed by the ACT (4.3%) and Western Australia (3.7%). In December Morrison said the volunteer effort \u201cis a big part of our natural disaster response and it is a big part of how Australia has always dealt with these issues\u201d, and promised to search for options to encourage volunteers. Labor called for volunteer firefighters to be paid or offered tax breaks. On Christmas Eve, Morrison directed all commonwealth public service departments and agencies to permanently offer at least 20 working days\u2019 paid leave for volunteer firefighting. The veterans\u2019 affairs minister, Darren Chester, proposed a levy to pay volunteers in \u201cone-off\u201d events, warning it it was likely unsustainable to pay some from the federal public service to fight fires and not other volunteers. Morrison then announced a package of payments up to $6,000, primarily directed at employees of small and medium businesses and self-employed volunteers.

Even so, the shocking levels of smoke haze blanketing Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne have meant that city-dwellers cannot avert their gaze from the impact of these massive fire fronts, so devastatingly charged by the impact of climate change on our arid land mass.</p> <p>So is it too much to hope that when the fires are, at least temporarily, quelled and the smoke subsides, this sense of national unity might extend beyond the immediate crisis? Because to address the urgent threat of climate change and ensure the wellbeing of all Australians, we must stop dividing people along the faultlines of class and culture and rediscover the solidarity that has driven every major social change in our history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/jan/26/if-you-love-australia-climate-change-should-scare-the-hell-out-of-you\">If you love Australia, climate change should scare the hell out of you | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately, recent comments from those within our political class point to a failure to grasp the nature of this challenge.

      "bodyText": "One of the few silver linings of the horrendous bushfires across the country has been the sight of people setting aside their differences to help one another during this time of crisis. \u201cNatural\u201d disasters don\u2019t discriminate based on class, ethnicity, religion or culture: everyone in the line of these fires is equally at risk, and directly affected by the devastating outcome. The only real divide is between people living in dangerously exposed regional and rural areas, and those residing in the relative safety of our cities. Even so, the shocking levels of smoke haze blanketing Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne have meant that city-dwellers cannot avert their gaze from the impact of these massive fire fronts, so devastatingly charged by the impact of climate change on our arid land mass. So is it too much to hope that when the fires are, at least temporarily, quelled and the smoke subsides, this sense of national unity might extend beyond the immediate crisis? Because to address the urgent threat of climate change and ensure the wellbeing of all Australians, we must stop dividing people along the faultlines of class and culture and rediscover the solidarity that has driven every major social change in our history. Unfortunately, recent comments from those within our political class point to a failure to grasp the nature of this challenge. Since the federal election in May, we have heard repeated calls for the ALP to abandon its \u201cblue collar\u201d base, forget about regional Australia, and throw in its lot with urban small-l liberals of the post-materialist, cosmopolitan class. This way, suggest too many commentators on the fringes of the Labor party, lies an election-winning coalition to return the ALP to federal power. To what end is unclear. First, surely a Labor party that no longer represents working people is no longer worthy of the name. For the ALP to win an election by casting off its obligation to improve the material conditions of the working class and reduce inequality would be the ultimate exercise of seeking power without purpose. More fundamentally, these analyses reveal shallow thinking about the nature of power, and a fundamental misunderstanding of both working class culture and the history of progressive political change. Real progress, both social and economic, is impossible without the working class. Incremental social progress, on issues such as marriage equality and refugee rights, may be championed by educated people of wealth and means, but meaningful action to redistribute power and ensure a fair share of our common wealth for all citizens is never realised through the benevolent deeds of those in positions of social and economic privilege. Throughout history, working people have been at the forefront of progressive change. From the chartists agitating for political reform in the UK in the mid-19th century, to the cotton mill workers in Lancashire refusing to touch slave-grown cotton from the US during Lincoln\u2019s presidency; from Australian unionists fighting for the eight-hour day, to the blockades by the labour movement that were so instrumental in fighting apartheid; from the role of workers in the US civil rights movement in the 1960s to the active involvement of the Australian union movement in the campaign for marriage equality: real social and political change has been driven by the solidarity and mobilisation of working people. Yet today, both here and internationally, the working class communities that powered so many of these achievements are abandoning leftwing political parties and throwing in their lot with rightwing populists and demagogues. And so we hear in response that the left should accept their rejection by the people they are meant to represent, and capitulate to the divisive politics that is effectively undoing two centuries\u2019 of social progress towards a more equal society. Working people, some seem to have decided, are too socially conservative, too selfish and too ignorant to be saved. This is breathtakingly snobbish, woefully ignorant, alarmingly defeatist, shamefully irresponsible \u2013 and politically myopic. The left\u2019s pursuit of progressive social policies isn\u2019t the cause of the alienation of working class communities from social democratic politics; rather, it is a loss of trust that the political left still has the will or the capacity to defend the interests of working people against the forces of extreme market capitalism that have fractured their communities and destroyed their livelihoods. The ravages of trickle-down economics have left people scared and insecure. Yet even when the economic project built on deregulation, small government and the relentless pursuit of private profit hit the wall during the GFC, the left was woefully unprepared to step in with an alternative vision to rebuild our common wealth and ensure secure livelihoods for all. A decade later, in the face of repeated defeats, it seems too many people who call themselves social democrats are still seeking short-term political fixes to win government without disrupting the power and privilege of the capital class to which so many of them now belong. The answer to building a progressive coalition to support meaningful action on climate change, address economic inequality and build a better society isn\u2019t to talk down to people and try to outdo the far right in the culture wars by pandering to fear and division; it\u2019s to link social progress to economic progress, and fight for a better society for all Australians.

      "bodyText": "Bridget McKenzie\u2019s controversial sports grants program awarded $248,000 to a country club that has a state National party MP as a life member and former chairman, weeks after the pair visited the venue together. The revelation establishes yet another link between money awarded under the community sport infrastructure program and sport clubs associated with Liberal and National MPs. On Tuesday the ABC reported that Sport Australia had expressed concern to the minister\u2019s office about political interference in the grant program. The Katanning Country Club, three-and-a-half hours south-east of Perth, received a $248,000 grant to upgrade its tennis courts just before the 2019 federal election. Several weeks before the money was announced, McKenzie visited the club with her party colleague, the state Nationals MLA Peter Rundle. Rundle is the Western Australia Nationals\u2019 spokesman for sport and recreation. He is also a life member of the club, served as its chairman twice in the 2000s, and has played sport there since its inception in 1977. One day before the federal election, Rundle posted on Facebook about his visit to the club with McKenzie. He said the $248,000 grant was awarded several weeks after McKenzie\u2019s visit. \u201cIt was great to be joined recently at the Katanning Tennis Club by Federal Nationals Deputy Leader and Minister for Sport Senator Bridget McKenzie along with John Hassell Nationals WA Candidate for O\u2019Connor and Big Nick Fardell \u2013 Senate Candidate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe members were ecstatic when several weeks later a Federal Sports grant of $248,000 was announced for fencing, lighting, and clubhouse upgrades.\u201d Rundle denied any suggestion that his life membership of the club and role as a former chairman had anything to do with the minister\u2019s visit or the grant. He said the funding would go a long way towards funding much-needed upgrades of community tennis facilities. \u201cIt is my role as an MP to support organisations in my electorate that have applied for funding \u2013 be it through local, state or federal programs,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cMy life membership and former role as chairman of my local club \u2013 almost 20 years ago \u2013 is unrelated to the minister\u2019s visit or awarding of any federal grant.\u201d The grant to the country club appears to have been announced twice. In April the Liberal MP for the federal seat of O\u2019Connor, Rick Wilson, posted on Facebook that he had visited the club to tell members they had received $248,000 for their club rooms. \u201cI was joined by the member for Roe, Peter Rundle, who is a life member of the club,\u201d Wilson wrote. The club is located in a safe Liberal federal seat. There is no suggestion that the club was not eligible to receive the grant. But it is the latest in a series of examples of grants that have flowed to organisations linked to Liberal or Nationals members. McKenzie herself was a member of the Wangaratta clay target club, which received a $36,000 grant through the program. Guardian Australia also revealed another 10 grants went to clubs that boasted Coalition MPs as members or patrons, including one to a tennis club with the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, as an honorary member, three that listed the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, as a patron, and another two linked to the Liberal senator Sarah Henderson. A rugby club that has the Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman as a patron was awarded a $500,000 grant, and $70,000 went to a surf lifesaving club of which Tony Abbott was a member. Scott Morrison said on Tuesday he was still waiting for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet\u2019s advice on whether ministerial standards were breached. Asked whether he still supported McKenzie being in cabinet, the prime minister said: \u201cWell, we have a process which I\u2019m following and she remains in the cabinet.

In a letter signed by 80 ARC laureate fellows, some of Australia\u2019s top researchers said claims strong action to cut emissions would be economically destructive have no basis and are not \u201cconsistent with Australia\u2019s traditional optimism and ingenuity, nor with historical experience\u201d. \u201cReducing emissions is a global challenge that requires collective action,\u201d the letter said. \u201cBut Australia\u2019s current visibility as ground zero for both climate impacts and climate policy uncertainty presents a unique opportunity for us to emerge as a leader on this challenge.\u201d The ARC laureate fellows are a small group of researchers selected by the ARC as the top researchers across all fields in Australia. The letter, whose signatories include decorated academics in mathematics, science, economics, and language and culture, said the government\u2019s focus on adapting to changed fire patterns \u201cis not enough\u201d. It was written as the country\u2019s unprecedented bushfire season continues, with emergency warnings in place on Tuesday for a fire burning in the Namadgi national park near Canberra. \u201cWe welcome government actions to help current victims and improve adaptation to future fires, as well as its acceptance of a role for climate change in the catastrophe,\u201d the letter said. \u201cBut this is not enough, because the greenhouse gas amounts driving warming are still rising: the world is only at the beginning of the climate change phenomenon.\u201d The bushfire emergency has brought the Coalition government\u2019s climate policies into sharp focus. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, was criticised for his handling of the crisis through Christmas and early January, and for his failure to meet with former emergency chiefs who warned of the coming catastrophe last year. Morrison said this month that the government\u2019s response to the increasingly visible effects of the climate crisis would be to address \u201cadaptation and resilience\u201d rather than strengthening policies to reduce emissions. But the letter warns that without stronger action to curb emissions, the impacts of further temperature rises could be such that adaptation is not achievable. \u201cThis dire outlook demands stronger mitigation of carbon emissions,\u201d it said. \u201cMany argue that actions to achieve this would be economically destructive.

Soil health is the foundation of healthy life on this planet. This regeneration starts with new ways of seeing and thinking, which lead to new ways of managing and farming. Regenerative agriculture seeks to work with nature, to provide food and fibre while building soil, resilience, diversity, and community. It challenges farmers to go from reductionist to holistic thinking and find ways to work <em>with</em> nature by mimicking natural systems and generating fertility on the farm as much as possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/23/farmer-wants-a-revolution-how-is-this-not-genocide\">Farmer wants a revolution: 'How is this not genocide?'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though many Australians have never heard of it, regenerative agriculture has already begun to transform farms and landscapes across Australia.

Vince has been thinking differently about agriculture for decades and had just finished the ecological agriculture degree I had enrolled in, so we had lots to talk about. He produces award-winning lamb on his farm near Dalton.</p> <p>Like thousands of farmers, he has been hit hard by the drought. Times are very tough. Vince has been managing his land holistically for years now. He manages his animals to build soil health and ground cover. He and his former wife Janet planted 60,000 trees and shrubs in vegetation corridors for wildlife over the past two decades. He says: \u201cEvery farm that was once grassy woodland could easily manage 20,000 to 60,000 native trees and shrubs, without any loss in productivity.\u201d This would vastly increase biodiversity and habitat and help with shelter from the cold winter winds that slow plant growth, make animals eat more, and cause higher infant mortality in newborn lambs. The trees help protect soil, sequester carbon, provide sheep feed (acacia leaves and seed) and work well with holistic grazing, Heffernan says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Transitioning to regenerative agriculture isn\u2019t some sort of pie-in-the-sky hoping for a utopia</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the start of the drought (and again as it has continued) Vince sold off stock to match his grazing ecology.

      "bodyText": "How should we stare down the challenges of a new decade? Where will we find hope and solutions? This is the first piece in a new series in which we ask prominent Australians to write about one thing they think could improve the nation in the 2020s We need a revolution in Australia. Many can sense that. We\u2019re richer than ever, but when it comes to our environment and the climate we\u2019re in a big hole \u2013 and we need to stop digging. We must find new ways of living on this incredible continent we have brought to the brink of climatic and ecological catastrophe. If that sounds bleak, it is. But what if the revolution we need is already taking place; in the space between our ears and the ground beneath our feet? Regenerative agriculture is \u201can underground insurgency\u201d that is regenerating soil health. Soil health is the foundation of healthy life on this planet. This regeneration starts with new ways of seeing and thinking, which lead to new ways of managing and farming. Regenerative agriculture seeks to work with nature, to provide food and fibre while building soil, resilience, diversity, and community. It challenges farmers to go from reductionist to holistic thinking and find ways to work with nature by mimicking natural systems and generating fertility on the farm as much as possible. Though many Australians have never heard of it, regenerative agriculture has already begun to transform farms and landscapes across Australia. As we move into this new decade, embracing and adopting regenerative agriculture can provide a beacon of hope and a way to begin to deal with some of the wicked problems we face. I first met Vince Heffernan after I moved to Canberra in 2012. Vince has been thinking differently about agriculture for decades and had just finished the ecological agriculture degree I had enrolled in, so we had lots to talk about. He produces award-winning lamb on his farm near Dalton. Like thousands of farmers, he has been hit hard by the drought. Times are very tough. Vince has been managing his land holistically for years now. He manages his animals to build soil health and ground cover. He and his former wife Janet planted 60,000 trees and shrubs in vegetation corridors for wildlife over the past two decades. He says: \u201cEvery farm that was once grassy woodland could easily manage 20,000 to 60,000 native trees and shrubs, without any loss in productivity.\u201d This would vastly increase biodiversity and habitat and help with shelter from the cold winter winds that slow plant growth, make animals eat more, and cause higher infant mortality in newborn lambs. The trees help protect soil, sequester carbon, provide sheep feed (acacia leaves and seed) and work well with holistic grazing, Heffernan says. At the start of the drought (and again as it has continued) Vince sold off stock to match his grazing ecology. These are tough decisions, but by making these decisions he aims to ensure he still has ground cover. Rain that falls gets slowed down and seeps into the land, rather than simply running over bare ground into creeks and, if it\u2019s heavy rain, taking his topsoil with it. In this land of \u201cdrought and flooding rains\u201d, ensuring as much rain as possible gets into the soil is critical. I grew up on a farm a long way from Dalton, in the middle of Zimbabwe. Allan Savory, one of the earliest and most vocal people in what has become the regenerative agriculture movement, was a contentious figure in the country\u2019s history and divided opinion among farmers, then and now. Through his experiences as an ecologist he came to develop holistic management \u2013 a way of planning and managing that goes beyond reductionist thinking and sees the farm as a complex system that needs to be managed as such, with constant monitoring of decisions to correct them if they are wrong. Drive through the Australian landscape and it is hard to miss the bare ground and gullies that have been carrying our topsoil away since not long after European land management came to the continent. Modern Australian agriculture is founded on dispossession and genocide, and has shown very little regard for the unique history of the landscape and the ecological complexity of this dry land. Changing this requires us to confront our past, and to learn from the people with ancient knowledge and culture who have been custodians of this land for millennia.

That matched the Kent batsman\u2019s career average but after starting the South Africa series with a half-century in the opening Test at Centurion, he failed to pass 38 after that. Despite Denly\u2019s likely omission for the series in Sri Lanka in March, England will resist calls to bring back Jennings, who averages 25.19 across 17 Tests but who is seen as a spin-specialist top-order batsman having hit centuries against India in Mumbai on his debut in 2016 and Sri Lanka at Galle the last time Joe Root\u2019s team toured there in late 2018. Instead, England will keep faith with young openers Dominic Sibley and Zak Crawley, who both had encouraging series in South Africa, and are set to hand Jonny Bairstow a chance at No 3 in place of Denly. Bairstow was asked to \u201creset\u201d by the national selector Ed Smith and come back as a specialist batsman when he lost his position as England\u2019s wicketkeeper to Jos Buttler at the end of last summer\u2019s Ashes series against Australia. The 30-year-old scored a century from No 3 when he played in the final Test against Sri Lanka at Galle in November 2018 and now has a chance to make the position his own before a summer when England play two three-Test series against West Indies and Pakistan. Ben Foakes, the wicketkeeper named man of the series on England\u2019s last tour of Sri Lanka, is also likely to be recalled, with Jos Buttler\u2019s place under threat following a winter where he has averaged only 17.55 with the bat. Faf du Plessis, meanwhile, has escaped sanction from the International Cricket Council for his on-field collision with Buttler on the final day of the fourth Test \u2013 but Stuart Broad has been punished for swearing at the South Africa captain during the same incident. Du Plessis and Buttler clashed at the end of the 57th over of a day that saw England seal a 191-run victory at the Wanderers. It happened after a throw from Sam Curran at mid-off hit Du Plessis, who then became involved in a heated exchange with Broad. As the players came together Du Plessis came into contact with Buttler as he continued his argument with Broad, who is believed to have called Du Plessis a \u201cfucking idiot\u201d. Joe Root, the England captain, described the clash between Du Plessis and Buttler as \u201chandbags\u201d after the match and the South African protested that there was no \u201cmalicious intent\u201d when he collided with the England wicketkeeper. Du Plessis could have been given four demerit points and a ban from either one Test or two white-ball matches if it had been deemed he had made deliberate contact with Buttler \u2013 a level two offence. However, no action was taken after Joel Wilson and Rod Tucker, the on-field umpires, deemed the contact to be accidental. Instead, Broad has been charged with using an \u201caudible obscenity\u201d and been given one demerit point and a fine of 15% of his match fee, around \u00a32,250. He now has two demerit points on his record having also been punished for giving Rishabh Pant a send-off during the third Test against India at Trent Bridge in August 2018. Picking up four demerit points in a two-year period triggers a ban. Broad is the third England player to be punished by the ICC for swearing during this series in South Africa after Buttler during the second Test in Cape Town and Ben Stokes, who called an abusive fan a \u201cfucking four-eyed cunt\u201d on the opening day of the final Test at the Wanderers.",

      "bodyText": "Ecosystems will continue to collapse around the world unless humanity listens to the expertise of indigenous communities on how to live alongside nature, a prominent Amazon leader has warned. Tuntiak Katan of the Ecuadorian Shuar people, who is vice-president of the pan-Amazon organisation representing communities in the river basin, said governments were spending millions of dollars on environmental consultants while largely ignoring the land management skills of the planet\u2019s indigenous people that could help combat the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. Speaking to the Guardian from the Ecuadorian Amazon, Katan, who became the first indigenous representative at a UN climate action summit last year, said environmental \u201ccatastrophes\u201d such as the fires that devastated the world\u2019s largest rainforest in 2019 would continue unless the contributions and human rights of indigenous people were respected. Indigenous communities support around 80% of the planet\u2019s biodiversity despite accounting for less than one twentieth of the human population, according to the World Bank. Katan\u2019s warning came as a new study revealed that parts of the Amazon rainforest under the stewardship of indigenous peoples sequester carbon better than areas with little protection, leading to less deforestation and degradation. \u201cWe are the defenders of nature, of the life of the forests, of our territories,\u201d said Katan, vice-president of Coordinator of the Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (Coica). \u201cThe world is investing lots of money to implement public policy to combat climate change, help conservation and restoration. But these policies are made in offices by technical experts with little or no knowledge of the Earth.\u201d Biodiversity loss was named as the third biggest risk to the world in terms of likelihood and severity this year by the World Economic Forum, ahead of terror attacks, infectious diseases and interstate conflict. Despite the concerns expressed by the global elite in Davos, there was no indigenous representation at last week\u2019s forum in the Swiss ski resort, according to Katan. He said he would welcome the opportunity to attend next year\u2019s forum to outline an indigenous economic model based on maintaining the health of the world\u2019s soils, rivers and the forest. \u201cIf the proposals, knowledge and management practices of indigenous people are not listened to, there will be more big catastrophes. The issue of fires in the Amazon will continue, the degradation of forests and water will continue, deforestation will continue,\u201d Katan added. This month, the UN unveiled the draft of a Paris-style agreement on nature calling for a commitment to protect at least 30% of the planet, dramatically reduce pollution and promote the participation and practices of indigenous people. Katan said: \u201cWe are well-coordinated with our brothers and sisters from Indonesia, the Congo, communities in the Arctic and from the Pacific. We\u2019ve been discussing issues with our brothers and sisters from all parts of the world. \u201cIn Indonesia, for example, they also have a lot of knowledge about how to manage tropical forests. But the same story is being repeated here as in other parts of the world: the lack of recognition of their knowledge and the lack of respect for the human rights of indigenous populations.\u201d Anti-indigenous sentiment is increasing in some parts of the planet. This month activists said they would sue Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro for his latest racist comments in which he questioned the humanity of indigenous communities. In one of his weekly Facebook broadcasts, Bolsonaro declared: \u201cIndians are undoubtedly changing \u2026 They are increasingly becoming human beings just like us.\u201d The new study from the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts, found that between 2003 and 2016, 90% of net emissions came from outside protected lands in the Amazon. Scientist and lead author Wayne Walker said: \u201cOur work shows that forests under the stewardship of indigenous peoples and local communities continue to have better carbon outcomes than lands lacking protection, meaning that their role is critical and must be strengthened if Amazon basin countries are to succeed in maintaining this globally important resource, while also achieving their commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement.\u201d The findings add weight to the recommendations of a report on land use and the climate crisis by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which found that areas held or managed by indigenous peoples had much less human impact on the environment. The report also highlighted the lack of consideration of indigenous views and knowledge in understanding large regions and ecosystems.

      "body": "<p>When four years ago I interviewed Paul Merton about his work as a panellist on Just a Minute, he told me the reason he\u2019d remained on the Radio 4 show for 28 years was because host Nicholas Parsons \u2013 who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/28/nicholas-parsons-host-of-just-a-minute-dies-aged-96\">died at the age of 96</a> \u2013 was such a \u201cgenerous, sweet man\u201d.</p> <p>At the time, Merton was poised to become the show\u2019s longest-serving panellist, overtaking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kenneth-williams\">Kenneth Williams</a>. But he would never overtake Parsons, who served as host since the show\u2019s inception in 1967, deviating only once from his manifest destiny by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44363674\">missing an episode</a> in 2018 through illness.</p> <p>Generosity and sweetness. These virtues sound like curiosities in 2020. What Parsons had in abundance now sound like liabilities in Brexit-broken Britain. <br><br>Yet Parsons was, throughout much of his career, a man out of time \u2013 and not just because he often favoured a cravat.

      "bodyText": "When four years ago I interviewed Paul Merton about his work as a panellist on Just a Minute, he told me the reason he\u2019d remained on the Radio 4 show for 28 years was because host Nicholas Parsons \u2013 who has died at the age of 96 \u2013 was such a \u201cgenerous, sweet man\u201d. At the time, Merton was poised to become the show\u2019s longest-serving panellist, overtaking Kenneth Williams. But he would never overtake Parsons, who served as host since the show\u2019s inception in 1967, deviating only once from his manifest destiny by missing an episode in 2018 through illness. Generosity and sweetness. These virtues sound like curiosities in 2020. What Parsons had in abundance now sound like liabilities in Brexit-broken Britain. Yet Parsons was, throughout much of his career, a man out of time \u2013 and not just because he often favoured a cravat. (Is it possible that, just as Gareth Southgate caused a sales bump for waistcoats after he wore them on the World Cup touchlines, so the death of Nicholas Parsons might provoke a spike in neckwear sales?

      "bodyText": "Anyone who films a partner during sex without their consent is committing the criminal offence of voyeurism, the court of appeal has ruled in a case that may affect the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s apparent reluctance to bring charges. The ruling by three judges came at the end of an unsuccessful appeal by a man convicted of filming himself having sex with prostitutes. His lawyers argued that the voyeurism law allowed him to do so since even a bedroom is not a private place if he was there legitimately. In a highly unusual development in a criminal case, the court allowed someone not directly involved in events to intervene in the hearing to develop arguments that consent should be the primary issue when considering cases under the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. The CPS said afterwards it was urgently reviewing the decision and would assess whether to continue resisting a judicial review claim brought by Emily Hunt, the woman who intervened in the hearing and who has criticised prosecutors for refusing to bring charges after she was filmed naked in a hotel bedroom by a man without her consent. The unanimous decision by Lord Justice Fulford, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb and Mrs Justice Foster came at the end of an application by Tony Richards, 39, of Cardiff, to have two voyeurism charges under section 67 of the Sexual Offences Act dismissed on the grounds that he had committed no crime.

The editor who had the ear of powerful men in government, and often proofed her pages from a makeshift office in the cellar as bombs fell overhead, had thrived on the idea of doing something meaningful. \u201cWhen she was putting Vogue to bed, she was in her element,\u201d says Summers. \u201cShe was being bombed, but she was doing this, and at that moment she realised that Vogue had a purpose beyond promulgating fashion. It was really about influencing women\u2019s lives.\u201d Not for nothing did the head of the board of trade once call her \u201cthe most powerful woman in London\u201d.</p> <p>Summers first became fascinated by her while researching a book on wartime fashion for the Imperial War Museum, only to discover a more personal connection. \u201cI was having lunch with an uncle and I told him how enthused I was about this woman, and he just leant back in his chair and went: \u2018Darling, didn\u2019t you know she was Grandpa\u2019s cousin?\u2019 And I didn\u2019t know.\u201d It was, she explains, a big family but she hadn\u2019t heard the story before: Withers was not one to blow her own trumpet.</p> <p>Withers was born in 1905, into an unusually free-thinking family. Her mother, Mary, had been university-educated, while Summers describes her father, Percy, a doctor who had stopped work through ill health, as a \u201cvery liberal father\u201d who fostered self-reliance in his daughters. The young Audrey read English at Oxford, worked in a bookshop and then got a job in publishing before being made redundant, on the grounds (then perfectly legal) that the company wanted a man instead. She was devastated, but that led her to answer a newspaper ad for a subeditor at Vogue, where she flourished. She was only 35 when, with her American boss stranded overseas by the war, she stepped into the editor\u2019s chair.</p> <p>The practical challenges of publishing in wartime were daunting. Paper was rationed and, by 1941, so were clothes, an existential problem for an industry built on craving the new and pretty. (Were she alive today, Withers would surely recognise the pressure on glossy magazines to stop pushing fast fashion because of its impact on the planet; Summers thinks she would have been \u201call over current thinking with remodelling and reusing clothes: for environmental reasons\u201d). Staff were bombed out of their homes and the magazine\u2019s Old Bond Street headquarters was hit at least once. The idea of writing about hemlines amid such death and destruction may seem incongruous, but maintaining some semblance of normality on the home front was seen as an important act of defiance against the Nazis. Besides, it soon emerged that Vogue had a role in the war effort.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1766b02aec6325c7bc257e030641b715a7b7efc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1766b02aec6325c7bc257e030641b715a7b7efc7/0_288_6349_4512/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Working for the war effort: staff working in the bomb cellar of One New Bond Street during second world war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff working in the Bond Street bomb cellar during the second world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georgina Slocombe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Withers met regularly with the Treasury and the Ministry of Information, who saw magazines as a better channel than newspapers for communicating with women about the sacrifices that would be needed. And Vogue was seen as particularly important, because its readers were influential women who could set trends. Initially, the message was they should keep shopping for the benefit of the economy, but all that changed in 1941; clothing factories were making military uniforms, rationing came in, and women were urged to make do and mend old clothes. (Even Withers rewore the same few outfits endlessly; Summers says her wardrobe consisted of little more than three suits and some blouses for work, one wool dress for evenings, and slacks and a jumper at weekends).</p> <p>Vogue commissioned designers to show what could be done with utility clothing, a government-approved range available to buy with ration coupons. It ran features on growing your own vegetables and even promoted short haircuts, amid fears about female factory workers getting their hair tangled in machinery.</p> <p>But Withers wasn\u2019t content merely to churn out propaganda. \u201cShe wanted her readers to really get the war,\u201d says Summers. Which is where Lee Miller, the model turned war photographer and reporter, came in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9cc19e519bbcc537e4adf73d012b159819d92e35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc19e519bbcc537e4adf73d012b159819d92e35/0_294_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"War photographer Lee Miller standing with soldiers during the liberation of Rennes, France, in 1944.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">War photographer Lee Miller standing with soldiers during the liberation of Rennes, France, in 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David E Scherman/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miller was American, enabling her to get accreditation via the American military (British troops wouldn\u2019t accommodate a female photographer). But she needed a press sponsor and Withers stepped in. One of Miller\u2019s first dispatches for Vogue was from St Malo on the Brittany coast, where she had expected to be covering a surrender to the Americans but instead found herself in the thick of battle, capturing pictures of what would turn out to be napalm attacks: the war censor refused to let Vogue use them.</p> <p>Miller also had an eye for things a man might have missed. Arriving in newly liberated Paris, she sent back pictures of a hair salon where small boys powered the dryers by pedalling furiously on bicycles hooked up to a furnace. In Munich, she got into Hitler\u2019s private apartment after he had fled and had herself photographed in his bathtub, her dirty army-issue boots placed on his primrose-yellow bathmat.</p> <p>But she wrote for Vogue, too, about the massacres of women and children in occupied France and sent back harrowing images of skeletal bodies from the liberation of the Buchenwald concentration camp. Withers agonised over whether her war-weary readers could cope with this, but eventually included one picture, berating herself later for not running as many as the newspapers did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dc6bd07eff34ee55a2a08022c6daaa504061601\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dc6bd07eff34ee55a2a08022c6daaa504061601/119_2753_7601_4978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Withers in 1948.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Withers in 1948.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clifford Coffin/ Vogue/\u00a9The Conde\u0301 Nast Publications Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unsurprisingly, both women found adjusting to peacetime difficult. After the atrocities she had witnessed, Summer says, Miller suffered from PTSD but she also struggled to find substitutes for the intense adrenaline highs of war reporting. Withers, meanwhile, was battling against her American publishers\u2019 expectations that she would meekly return to producing a conventional \u201cfashion paper\u201d.</p> <p>In 1946, she wrote a long memo to her American editor-in-chief Edna Chase, arguing passionately that Vogue\u2019s future was to cover \u201cevery subject in which the intelligent sophisticated woman is currently interested\u201d, and that its politics \u201cmust be progressive\u201d. Politics could not be ignored, Withers argued, when it shaped everything in women\u2019s lives from education and health to prices in shops. Moreover, to avoid political arguments was political in itself, because it meant consenting to the status quo and that was innately conservative: \u201cOne is being every whit as political, for instance, in giving one\u2019s tacit approval to things as they are in pressing for change. It is an old rightwing trick to sit tight and say nothing (because that\u2019s the best way of keeping things as they are) and to accuse the left wing of \u2018being political\u2019 because it is forced to be vocal in advocating anything new.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74582191e6d99eeccb19074dc8e20d0c2e8247b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74582191e6d99eeccb19074dc8e20d0c2e8247b7/0_0_9506_6496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A feature on American aid for Britain, Vogue January 1941.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A feature on American aid for Britain, Vogue January 1941.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vogue/\u00a9The Conde\u0301 Nast Publications Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is striking how contemporary that argument sounds, now that British Vogue urges its readers to become \u201cforces for change\u201d while American Teen Vogue takes on Donald Trump. But it was too much for Chase, who said that Vogue should \u201cdevelop the taste and manners of its readers and let them set the pattern of their political thinking themselves\u201d.</p> <p>She had lost that argument, but Withers kept pushing the boundaries throughout the 50s. She hired a female motoring correspondent, at a time when very few women drove themselves, and argued that women should feature in Vogue in their own right rather than as famous men\u2019s wives. (Tellingly, the woman in that \u201cfashion is indestructible\u201d picture wasn\u2019t a professional model, but the BBC\u2019s first female TV announcer). She prided herself on hiring as beauty editor Evelyn Forbes, a mother of four who was the breadwinner in her marriage, at a time when middle-class women were still expected to stop work after getting married.</p> <p>Withers herself did not have children, which Summers suspects may have been by choice. She and her salesman husband, Jock, were a famously glamorous, social couple, but Jock was repeatedly unfaithful and they eventually divorced.</p> <p>Yet painful as his pursuit of other women must have been, in some ways their rather distant relationship was professionally liberating. \u201cI think Jock\u2019s interest in other women almost gave Audrey the licence to run her own life as she wanted,\u201d says Summers, who points out that she wouldn\u2019t have been free to work such long hours had she had a husband waiting impatiently at home. \u201cI think they drifted apart, but she never hated Jock.\u201d</p> <p>After the divorce, she married a man called Victor Kennett, who had propositioned her years earlier, while she was still with Jock (she briefly considered leaving her husband at the time, but feared a scandal). Kennett was more possessive of her time, and when Withers retired from Vogue in 1959 she largely retreated from public life \u2013 one reason, Summers thinks, she did not remain as well known as other pioneering women of the era. But now, perhaps, her moment has come.</p> <p><em>Dressed for War: the Story of Audrey Withers, Vogue Editor Extraordinaire from the Blitz to the Swinging Sixties, by Julie Summers, is published by <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/Dressed-For-War/Julie-Summers/9781471181573\">Simon &amp; Schuster</a> on 6 February (RRP \u00a320).

The young Audrey read English at Oxford, worked in a bookshop and then got a job in publishing before being made redundant, on the grounds (then perfectly legal) that the company wanted a man instead. She was devastated, but that led her to answer a newspaper ad for a subeditor at Vogue, where she flourished. She was only 35 when, with her American boss stranded overseas by the war, she stepped into the editor\u2019s chair. The practical challenges of publishing in wartime were daunting. Paper was rationed and, by 1941, so were clothes, an existential problem for an industry built on craving the new and pretty. (Were she alive today, Withers would surely recognise the pressure on glossy magazines to stop pushing fast fashion because of its impact on the planet; Summers thinks she would have been \u201call over current thinking with remodelling and reusing clothes: for environmental reasons\u201d). Staff were bombed out of their homes and the magazine\u2019s Old Bond Street headquarters was hit at least once. The idea of writing about hemlines amid such death and destruction may seem incongruous, but maintaining some semblance of normality on the home front was seen as an important act of defiance against the Nazis. Besides, it soon emerged that Vogue had a role in the war effort. Withers met regularly with the Treasury and the Ministry of Information, who saw magazines as a better channel than newspapers for communicating with women about the sacrifices that would be needed. And Vogue was seen as particularly important, because its readers were influential women who could set trends. Initially, the message was they should keep shopping for the benefit of the economy, but all that changed in 1941; clothing factories were making military uniforms, rationing came in, and women were urged to make do and mend old clothes. (Even Withers rewore the same few outfits endlessly; Summers says her wardrobe consisted of little more than three suits and some blouses for work, one wool dress for evenings, and slacks and a jumper at weekends). Vogue commissioned designers to show what could be done with utility clothing, a government-approved range available to buy with ration coupons. It ran features on growing your own vegetables and even promoted short haircuts, amid fears about female factory workers getting their hair tangled in machinery. But Withers wasn\u2019t content merely to churn out propaganda. \u201cShe wanted her readers to really get the war,\u201d says Summers. Which is where Lee Miller, the model turned war photographer and reporter, came in. Miller was American, enabling her to get accreditation via the American military (British troops wouldn\u2019t accommodate a female photographer). But she needed a press sponsor and Withers stepped in. One of Miller\u2019s first dispatches for Vogue was from St Malo on the Brittany coast, where she had expected to be covering a surrender to the Americans but instead found herself in the thick of battle, capturing pictures of what would turn out to be napalm attacks: the war censor refused to let Vogue use them. Miller also had an eye for things a man might have missed. Arriving in newly liberated Paris, she sent back pictures of a hair salon where small boys powered the dryers by pedalling furiously on bicycles hooked up to a furnace. In Munich, she got into Hitler\u2019s private apartment after he had fled and had herself photographed in his bathtub, her dirty army-issue boots placed on his primrose-yellow bathmat. But she wrote for Vogue, too, about the massacres of women and children in occupied France and sent back harrowing images of skeletal bodies from the liberation of the Buchenwald concentration camp. Withers agonised over whether her war-weary readers could cope with this, but eventually included one picture, berating herself later for not running as many as the newspapers did. Unsurprisingly, both women found adjusting to peacetime difficult. After the atrocities she had witnessed, Summer says, Miller suffered from PTSD but she also struggled to find substitutes for the intense adrenaline highs of war reporting. Withers, meanwhile, was battling against her American publishers\u2019 expectations that she would meekly return to producing a conventional \u201cfashion paper\u201d. In 1946, she wrote a long memo to her American editor-in-chief Edna Chase, arguing passionately that Vogue\u2019s future was to cover \u201cevery subject in which the intelligent sophisticated woman is currently interested\u201d, and that its politics \u201cmust be progressive\u201d. Politics could not be ignored, Withers argued, when it shaped everything in women\u2019s lives from education and health to prices in shops. Moreover, to avoid political arguments was political in itself, because it meant consenting to the status quo and that was innately conservative: \u201cOne is being every whit as political, for instance, in giving one\u2019s tacit approval to things as they are in pressing for change. It is an old rightwing trick to sit tight and say nothing (because that\u2019s the best way of keeping things as they are) and to accuse the left wing of \u2018being political\u2019 because it is forced to be vocal in advocating anything new.\u201d It is striking how contemporary that argument sounds, now that British Vogue urges its readers to become \u201cforces for change\u201d while American Teen Vogue takes on Donald Trump. But it was too much for Chase, who said that Vogue should \u201cdevelop the taste and manners of its readers and let them set the pattern of their political thinking themselves\u201d. She had lost that argument, but Withers kept pushing the boundaries throughout the 50s. She hired a female motoring correspondent, at a time when very few women drove themselves, and argued that women should feature in Vogue in their own right rather than as famous men\u2019s wives. (Tellingly, the woman in that \u201cfashion is indestructible\u201d picture wasn\u2019t a professional model, but the BBC\u2019s first female TV announcer). She prided herself on hiring as beauty editor Evelyn Forbes, a mother of four who was the breadwinner in her marriage, at a time when middle-class women were still expected to stop work after getting married. Withers herself did not have children, which Summers suspects may have been by choice. She and her salesman husband, Jock, were a famously glamorous, social couple, but Jock was repeatedly unfaithful and they eventually divorced. Yet painful as his pursuit of other women must have been, in some ways their rather distant relationship was professionally liberating. \u201cI think Jock\u2019s interest in other women almost gave Audrey the licence to run her own life as she wanted,\u201d says Summers, who points out that she wouldn\u2019t have been free to work such long hours had she had a husband waiting impatiently at home. \u201cI think they drifted apart, but she never hated Jock.\u201d After the divorce, she married a man called Victor Kennett, who had propositioned her years earlier, while she was still with Jock (she briefly considered leaving her husband at the time, but feared a scandal). Kennett was more possessive of her time, and when Withers retired from Vogue in 1959 she largely retreated from public life \u2013 one reason, Summers thinks, she did not remain as well known as other pioneering women of the era. But now, perhaps, her moment has come.

One reason is, while French unions still negotiate contracts that cover nearly the entire workforce, membership is skewed toward the public sector and what\u2019s left of the country\u2019s old industrial base.

Pochettino is acutely aware that players have to look after themselves because, once they are unwanted, their clubs will not think twice before cutting them loose.</p> \n<p>Did Eriksen want to leave Spurs at that point? It is unclear. But what was plain to Pochettino was that the Dane was considering his next move and that involved putting into place a possible exit strategy, something over which he had control. It meant not signing a new contract. From that evening at Bistro Boheme, if it was not already, the clock began to tick loudly on Eriksen\u2019s Spurs future and what we saw on Tuesday \u2013 his completion of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/28/christian-eriksen-completes-move-from-tottenham-to-internazionale-transfer-window\" title=\"\">\u20ac20m (\u00a316.9m) transfer to Internazionale</a> \u2013 was the result of him having played the longest of games.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a1347ced-6bc5-4c6f-81f5-71c59b0e47b2\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Eriksen joined Spurs from Ajax in what came to be known as the Bale summer of 2013 \u2013 the one in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/01/gareth-bale-real-madrid-tottenham\" title=\"\">Gareth Bale departed for Real Madrid</a> and the club spent the \u00a386m proceeds on seven new faces. As such, Eriksen has been around for long enough to read Spurs from the inside, to consider how they treated players and agents, and what the future held. His conclusions were not unreasonable. He knew the only way he would be able to drive a move away on his terms was to allow his contract to enter its final year.</p> \n<p>One of the issues that came to frustrate Pochettino before he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/mauricio-pochettino-sacked-tottenham-manager\" title=\"\">parted ways with the club</a> last November was the inability of the chairman, Daniel Levy, to sell players and provide room for the squad to evolve. Prior to Eriksen, only two frontline members of the squad were sold in the past two years: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/17/mousa-dembele-guangzhou-china-tottenham-hotspur-transfer\" title=\"\">Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/17/kieran-trippier-atletico-madrid-sign-tottenham\" title=\"\">Kieran Trippier</a>. The former had six months to go on his contract when he moved to Guangzhou R&amp;F for \u00a311m; the latter had three years remaining when he went to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for \u00a320m, making him something of an outlier.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0ad2777a159eabb82d53327ea38ab8299c97102\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0ad2777a159eabb82d53327ea38ab8299c97102/0_208_3114_1868/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Eriksen scores from a free-kick at Norwich.

They have been stuck. Even Eriksen struggled to attract offers until Inter got the numbers to work, helped enormously by his contract having just six months remaining. Last summer, only Atl\u00e9tico made a firm move for him. What did not help Eriksen back then was the \u00a3130m price tag Levy put on him and, although it was understood to apply only to domestic suitors, it provided a high starting point for those in mainland Europe.</p> \n<p>Spurs have now lost one of their most gifted players of recent years for a relative pittance but, if the end was a little sour, Eriksen leaves a wealth of good memories. Pochettino called him \u201cGolazo\u201d, a Spanish term that essentially translates as \u201cscreamer\u201d \u2013 as in, screaming goal \u2013 and there were plenty of those. Since Eriksen\u2019s arrival in the Premier League, no player has scored more goals from outside the box than his 23 or more from direct free-kicks than his eight. No player has made more assists than his 62 or has created more chances (571).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Those in the media became accustomed to Eriksen blanking them in the post-match mixed zone \u2013 saying nothing was part of the plan \u2013 and to pull that off takes a certain steeliness, which he has in abundance.

Pochettino is acutely aware that players have to look after themselves because, once they are unwanted, their clubs will not think twice before cutting them loose. Did Eriksen want to leave Spurs at that point? It is unclear. But what was plain to Pochettino was that the Dane was considering his next move and that involved putting into place a possible exit strategy, something over which he had control. It meant not signing a new contract. From that evening at Bistro Boheme, if it was not already, the clock began to tick loudly on Eriksen\u2019s Spurs future and what we saw on Tuesday \u2013 his completion of a \u20ac20m (\u00a316.9m) transfer to Internazionale \u2013 was the result of him having played the longest of games. Eriksen joined Spurs from Ajax in what came to be known as the Bale summer of 2013 \u2013 the one in which Gareth Bale departed for Real Madrid and the club spent the \u00a386m proceeds on seven new faces. As such, Eriksen has been around for long enough to read Spurs from the inside, to consider how they treated players and agents, and what the future held. His conclusions were not unreasonable. He knew the only way he would be able to drive a move away on his terms was to allow his contract to enter its final year. One of the issues that came to frustrate Pochettino before he parted ways with the club last November was the inability of the chairman, Daniel Levy, to sell players and provide room for the squad to evolve. Prior to Eriksen, only two frontline members of the squad were sold in the past two years: Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Kieran Trippier. The former had six months to go on his contract when he moved to Guangzhou R&amp;F for \u00a311m; the latter had three years remaining when he went to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for \u00a320m, making him something of an outlier. The market has changed and, for many Spurs players on good money, there have not been any buying clubs that can give them similar or better deals and pay a large fee on top. They have been stuck. Even Eriksen struggled to attract offers until Inter got the numbers to work, helped enormously by his contract having just six months remaining. Last summer, only Atl\u00e9tico made a firm move for him. What did not help Eriksen back then was the \u00a3130m price tag Levy put on him and, although it was understood to apply only to domestic suitors, it provided a high starting point for those in mainland Europe. Spurs have now lost one of their most gifted players of recent years for a relative pittance but, if the end was a little sour, Eriksen leaves a wealth of good memories. Pochettino called him \u201cGolazo\u201d, a Spanish term that essentially translates as \u201cscreamer\u201d \u2013 as in, screaming goal \u2013 and there were plenty of those. Since Eriksen\u2019s arrival in the Premier League, no player has scored more goals from outside the box than his 23 or more from direct free-kicks than his eight. No player has made more assists than his 62 or has created more chances (571). Those in the media became accustomed to Eriksen blanking them in the post-match mixed zone \u2013 saying nothing was part of the plan \u2013 and to pull that off takes a certain steeliness, which he has in abundance. Inside the club, meanwhile, he was known for his professionalism and consistency, with teammates respecting his tactical versatility, ability on each foot and stamina. No Spurs player would run further than him. Eriksen is the one that has got away.",

Does Ann Francke think women in the office only talk of shopping, or soaps or other \u2018female\u2019 topics (please note the sarcasm)? Are men ostracised in the workplace when women talk of these things? <strong>Terry, female, retired bank employee, Edinburgh</strong></p> <h2>\u2018One girl asked if we could talk about ponies and ballerinas instead\u2019</h2> <p>When I started teaching business to sixth form students students 20 or so years ago I regularly used football examples until one of the few girls in a class asked if we could talk about ponies and ballerinas instead! It\u2019s always stuck with me as a reminder. In reality however, everyone in a workplace is going to discuss what they are interested in so this is a meaningless discussion. <strong>Eddy, 51, sixth form teacher, Sussex</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Quite a lot of men also hate the assumption they must be interested in sport\u2019</h2> <p>I am a woman and a lifelong sports fan. I would start by calling the use of that vile word \u2018banter\u2019 pejorative and exclusive. If you call something \u2018banter\u2019 inherently there\u2019s a problem. I am senior and autonomous enough to stop excess discussion of sports simply because: \u201cOK, great, as not everyone is interested in sport, let\u2019s talk about something else now\u201d</p> <p>I would note it is not just women who get excluded. Quite a lot of men also hate the assumption they must be interested in sport, and that seems to be a lifelong thing that raises old issues. When I entered the workplace, it was golf and rugby union. These days it would be triathlon, or the corporate half-marathon, or other things that require a lot of training time and out-of-hours participation. It is really very easy to see those as a modern way of limiting women\u2019s progress. Ideally, it should be dealt with routinely just by it being shut down. <strong>Victoria, Germany</strong></p> <h2>\u2018The intent of banter is not to exclude, rather to play and be lighthearted\u2019</h2> <p>It all depends from place to place and personalities involved. If it crosses the line of banter to the personal, or in any way bigoted, then yes by all means crack down on the individuals. But to crack down on the whole event of bantering among colleagues is ridiculous in my view. Where will it stop? What next will be viewed as unacceptable? There are a lot of women out there who enjoy football and other sports. Not all conversations carried out in a working environment will be inclusive and the intent of banter is not to exclude, rather to play and be lighthearted. Granted some people do take it too far but those individuals should suffer the consequences rather than the entire office. Surely as adults one can choose to participate or ignore the whole episode? Cracking down and stopping something that sometimes happens organically can have adverse impacts on moral and interpersonal relationships between colleagues. <strong>Revival Nkomo, 41, works in antigen manufacturing, Milton Keynes</strong></p> <h2>\u2018If people can have lengthy talks about football three times a day, can I sit at my desk and read?\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s not only women who feel ostracised by football talk. I have never, nor will I ever have any interest in football. I hear the same conversation about the same previous night\u2019s game at least four times in a day. My problem with football discussions at work are the same as I have about smoking breaks \u2013 why should those that do not smoke not benefit from several 10 minute breaks a day? I feel the same for football fans; if they can have lengthy talks about football three times a day, can I sit at my desk and start reading? <strong>N</strong><strong>, Manchester</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Sports is not a gender specific topic\u2019</h2> <p>Sports is not a gender specific topic. I have just taught my class of eight-year-olds all about how gender doesn\u2019t play a role in what you can achieve. We talked about elite female athletes like Serena Williams and Julie Ertz. We looked at the historical treatment of women in sports \u2013 the FA disbanding the women\u2019s game, the first female to run a marathon etc. We have girls on the \u2018boys\u2019 football team. We are trying to raise these children to see through trivial things like gender. What a shame that my class of eight- and nine-year-olds have a more sophisticated view on women and sports than the head of the Chartered Management Institute. <strong>Tom, primary school teacher, Knutsford</strong></p>",

Terry, female, retired bank employee, Edinburgh \u2018One girl asked if we could talk about ponies and ballerinas instead\u2019 When I started teaching business to sixth form students students 20 or so years ago I regularly used football examples until one of the few girls in a class asked if we could talk about ponies and ballerinas instead! It\u2019s always stuck with me as a reminder. In reality however, everyone in a workplace is going to discuss what they are interested in so this is a meaningless discussion. Eddy, 51, sixth form teacher, Sussex \u2018Quite a lot of men also hate the assumption they must be interested in sport\u2019 I am a woman and a lifelong sports fan. I would start by calling the use of that vile word \u2018banter\u2019 pejorative and exclusive. If you call something \u2018banter\u2019 inherently there\u2019s a problem. I am senior and autonomous enough to stop excess discussion of sports simply because: \u201cOK, great, as not everyone is interested in sport, let\u2019s talk about something else now\u201d I would note it is not just women who get excluded. Quite a lot of men also hate the assumption they must be interested in sport, and that seems to be a lifelong thing that raises old issues. When I entered the workplace, it was golf and rugby union. These days it would be triathlon, or the corporate half-marathon, or other things that require a lot of training time and out-of-hours participation. It is really very easy to see those as a modern way of limiting women\u2019s progress. Ideally, it should be dealt with routinely just by it being shut down. Victoria, Germany \u2018The intent of banter is not to exclude, rather to play and be lighthearted\u2019 It all depends from place to place and personalities involved. If it crosses the line of banter to the personal, or in any way bigoted, then yes by all means crack down on the individuals. But to crack down on the whole event of bantering among colleagues is ridiculous in my view. Where will it stop? What next will be viewed as unacceptable? There are a lot of women out there who enjoy football and other sports. Not all conversations carried out in a working environment will be inclusive and the intent of banter is not to exclude, rather to play and be lighthearted. Granted some people do take it too far but those individuals should suffer the consequences rather than the entire office. Surely as adults one can choose to participate or ignore the whole episode? Cracking down and stopping something that sometimes happens organically can have adverse impacts on moral and interpersonal relationships between colleagues. Revival Nkomo, 41, works in antigen manufacturing, Milton Keynes \u2018If people can have lengthy talks about football three times a day, can I sit at my desk and read?\u2019 It\u2019s not only women who feel ostracised by football talk. I have never, nor will I ever have any interest in football. I hear the same conversation about the same previous night\u2019s game at least four times in a day. My problem with football discussions at work are the same as I have about smoking breaks \u2013 why should those that do not smoke not benefit from several 10 minute breaks a day? I feel the same for football fans; if they can have lengthy talks about football three times a day, can I sit at my desk and start reading? N, Manchester \u2018Sports is not a gender specific topic\u2019 Sports is not a gender specific topic. I have just taught my class of eight-year-olds all about how gender doesn\u2019t play a role in what you can achieve. We talked about elite female athletes like Serena Williams and Julie Ertz. We looked at the historical treatment of women in sports \u2013 the FA disbanding the women\u2019s game, the first female to run a marathon etc. We have girls on the \u2018boys\u2019 football team. We are trying to raise these children to see through trivial things like gender. What a shame that my class of eight- and nine-year-olds have a more sophisticated view on women and sports than the head of the Chartered Management Institute.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump will unveil his much-delayed Middle East \u201cpeace plan\u201d alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Tuesday amid Palestinian protest and a rising global chorus of doubt about its timing and substance. The US president said on Monday that he would announce the plan at noon Washington time (1700 GMT). \u201cAnd it\u2019s a very big plan,\u201d Trump said after private meetings with Netanyahu and his election opponent, Benny Gantz, in the White House. The choreography between the US and Israel has been interpreted as a convenient distraction for both Trump, who faces an impeachment trial, and Netanyahu, who faces three criminal corruption indictments and an uncertain election campaign. Unconfirmed leaks have reported that the measures would be extremely favourable to the country, allowing it to annex much of the Palestinian territories, including Jewish settlements, and all of contested Jerusalem. The Palestinians may be granted some form of self-rule, but under tight restrictions. Israeli settler leaders who accompanied Netanyahu on his trip appeared to confirm some of those details, complaining that Palestinians should not be allowed any type country, even if it was territorially broken up and without an army or an airport. \u201c[Netanyahu] tried to sell us on the idea that it wouldn\u2019t really be a Palestinian state,\u201d said David Elhayani, a prominent settler figurehead, according the the Times of Israel newspaper. He added the plan include large economic incentives to the Palestinians. The Palestinian prime minister called on Monday for world powers to boycott the initiative. \u201cThis is a plan to protect Trump from impeachment and protect Netanyahu from prison. It is not a Middle East peace plan,\u201d Mohammad Shtayyeh told a cabinet meeting. The crisis appeared to bring a rare display of unity from rival Palestinian factions, Hamas in Gaza and Fatah in the occupied West Bank. The two parties, long-time enemies who fought a short civil war in 2007 for control of Gaza, agreed to hold an emergency meeting in Ramallah to discuss a joint response. Protests were planned in the Palestinian territories for Tuesday and Wednesday, raising the chance of clashes with Israeli troops. The Israeli military said it had reinforced security in Jordan Valley, a large section of the West Bank that the Israel government intends to annex. Near an Israeli army checkpoint at the northern edge of Ramallah, dozens of teenage boys with scarves wrapped around their faces pulled tyres covered in petrol into the road. \u201cDo you have a lighter?\u201d one asked. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because they are going to steal our land,\u201d said another. Two ambulances were parked by the side of the road. Hundreds of Palestinians waited in their cars behind the small protest to get through the checkpoint to their homes in other parts of the West Bank during the school rush. Ihab Marwan, a 35-year-old teacher who was passing by on his bike, said the demonstration would have no effect. \u201cThis will last two or three days. After that, they will be gone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt breaks my heart.\u201d During a tour of the valley on Monday, Israel\u2019s interior minister, Aryeh Deri, said he was gearing up for the move, which Netanyahu already promised in an election pledge in September. \u201cWe\u2019ve started to prepare for an annexation \u2013 we are getting the paperwork ready,\u201d Deri said. Tuesday\u2019s attention-grabbing announcement is sure to overshadow Netanyahu\u2019s indictment woes back home. Earlier in the day, Netanyahu withdrew a request for parliamentary immunity from the charges. He made the move just hours before Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, looked likely to form a committee that was expected to rule against it. Washington also invited Gantz to make sure whoever becomes Israel\u2019s next leader after the 2 March election will be on board in advance. Gantz later said he would work to implement the plan. Few political aspects of the proposal have been disclosed, apart from an economic conference last summer that sought to raise money from Gulf countries to fund it. The plan was drafted by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, with input from the US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, a vocal supporter of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. The Guardian understands that, unlike previous attempts that have focused on getting Israeli and Palestinians leaders to find common ground, Washington\u2019s new plan is dozens of pages long and has been drafted as a set of detailed suggestions. Sensitive issues that have tripped up past efforts, such as the rights of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, will be addressed. Trump\u2019s administration has promoted itself \u2013 especially to a large section of US evangelical voters who ardently back the Jewish state \u2013 as the most pro-Israel in the country\u2019s history. Washington has already implemented a number of historic changes in the region. It reversed decades of its policy by refraining from endorsing the internationally backed two-state solution. It has also recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, cut millions of dollars in aid to Palestinians, and announced that it no longer views Israeli settlements in occupied territory as \u201cinconsistent with international law\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>The opposition was never formidable but England\u2019s predicament was. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/29/england-south-africa-day-four-first-test-report-new-ball\" title=\"\">the defeat at Centurion</a> in the first Test the wheels were coming off. A flu epidemic had been rampaging through the squad; Ben Stokes, the heartbeat of the side, was having to deal with his father\u2019s very serious health concerns. Then on the eve of the second Test there was a more conventional setback because of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/01/jofra-archer-injury-doubt-second-cricket-test-south-africa\" title=\"\">problem with Jofra Archer\u2019s elbow</a> followed by the more exasperating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/02/england-rory-burns-ankle-injury-before-second-test-south-africa\" title=\"\">football injury to Rory Burns</a>, which seemed like a microcosm of an expedition out of control.</p> <p>Yet England won the next three Tests emphatically. In part this highlights the fragility of their opponents. South Africa had too many debutants, albeit old ones, too many senior players struggling for form, too many issues beyond the boundary. But it also reflects the calmness of England\u2019s management team, with the soft-spoken Yorkshiremen Chris Silverwood and Joe Root at the helm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/skys-the-limit-for-england-joe-root-series-victory\">\u2018The sky\u2019s the limit for this team,\u2019 says Joe Root after series victory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We will never know exactly how they managed to keep the squad together, but they did. Silverwood told the Test Match Special podcast after the win in Johannesburg: \u201cI could see the determination on their faces in the dressing room after the defeat at Centurion. The standard of training after that was superb.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWe stayed tight as a unit,\u201d added Root, who praised not only the youngsters but also the older lags for giving the novices the freedom to express themselves. Except in the literal sense there was a very healthy atmosphere within this squad even when it was all going wrong.</p> <p>Root and the far more invisible Silverwood deserve much credit. The outcome of the series was very important for both of them. At the start of the tour there was a lot of noise about whether Root should be the captain and, from the outside, there were doubts about Silverwood\u2019s appointment: Chris who? For some it is reassuring to have a household name in charge as if being a great international cricketer automatically transfers into being a great coach; and when it all goes wrong it is much more fun for the sages to agonise over the worth of an immediately identifiable national figure. Now this victory must give Silverwood more confidence in his role, though he will, just like his predecessor, Trevor Bayliss, point out that in cricket it is the players that win games or series, not coaches.</p> <p>Of course it was impossible to ignore Stokes throughout the past five weeks. Talking to Jonathan Agnew after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/england-south-africa-fourth-test-day-four-match-report\" title=\"\">the win at the Wanderers</a> he gave a little insight into his trials and the support he has received along the way. \u201cBefore the first Test I told my dad I was going to play and he looked at me with the most stupid of faces and said: \u2018Obviously, you are.\u2019 Now Dad looks like he\u2019s going to be travelling home [to New Zealand] and that\u2019s more pleasing than winning the series.\u201d</p> <p>But no one doubts Stokes\u2019s absolute commitment to the team. \u201cThere was always someone available to talk to,\u201d he said, \u201cand not just among the players. In a situation like that [his father\u2019s illness] it\u2019s something that hits you and you are in a place you\u2019re not used to. The modern way is that people are not so afraid to talk, to let off steam and let someone know how you\u2019re feeling. Before the Test I spoke to a few people in the backroom staff about how I was feeling emotionally and I felt so much better for doing that. Two or three years ago I would have kept it internal and who knows what would have happened?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b32dd4a89339092e2863f48d86d12889be09b189\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b32dd4a89339092e2863f48d86d12889be09b189/0_158_2828_1697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Stokes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes in action at the Wanderers. England\u2019s man of the series praised the open approach fostered by Chris Silverwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Themba Hadebe/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here is another sign of good management all round. It is still early days but Silverwood gives the impression of being a sympathetic coach yet sufficiently strong to impose his vision of how the team should play. \u201cIt was great to see the lads pull together and see the blueprint come alive,\u201d he said. His instincts involve more carrots than sticks.</p> <p>The next Test series is in Sri Lanka in March, which represents a very different challenge.

      "bodyText": "The opposition was never formidable but England\u2019s predicament was. After the defeat at Centurion in the first Test the wheels were coming off. A flu epidemic had been rampaging through the squad; Ben Stokes, the heartbeat of the side, was having to deal with his father\u2019s very serious health concerns. Then on the eve of the second Test there was a more conventional setback because of a problem with Jofra Archer\u2019s elbow followed by the more exasperating football injury to Rory Burns, which seemed like a microcosm of an expedition out of control. Yet England won the next three Tests emphatically. In part this highlights the fragility of their opponents. South Africa had too many debutants, albeit old ones, too many senior players struggling for form, too many issues beyond the boundary. But it also reflects the calmness of England\u2019s management team, with the soft-spoken Yorkshiremen Chris Silverwood and Joe Root at the helm. We will never know exactly how they managed to keep the squad together, but they did. Silverwood told the Test Match Special podcast after the win in Johannesburg: \u201cI could see the determination on their faces in the dressing room after the defeat at Centurion. The standard of training after that was superb.\u201d \u201cWe stayed tight as a unit,\u201d added Root, who praised not only the youngsters but also the older lags for giving the novices the freedom to express themselves. Except in the literal sense there was a very healthy atmosphere within this squad even when it was all going wrong. Root and the far more invisible Silverwood deserve much credit. The outcome of the series was very important for both of them. At the start of the tour there was a lot of noise about whether Root should be the captain and, from the outside, there were doubts about Silverwood\u2019s appointment: Chris who? For some it is reassuring to have a household name in charge as if being a great international cricketer automatically transfers into being a great coach; and when it all goes wrong it is much more fun for the sages to agonise over the worth of an immediately identifiable national figure. Now this victory must give Silverwood more confidence in his role, though he will, just like his predecessor, Trevor Bayliss, point out that in cricket it is the players that win games or series, not coaches. Of course it was impossible to ignore Stokes throughout the past five weeks. Talking to Jonathan Agnew after the win at the Wanderers he gave a little insight into his trials and the support he has received along the way. \u201cBefore the first Test I told my dad I was going to play and he looked at me with the most stupid of faces and said: \u2018Obviously, you are.\u2019 Now Dad looks like he\u2019s going to be travelling home [to New Zealand] and that\u2019s more pleasing than winning the series.\u201d But no one doubts Stokes\u2019s absolute commitment to the team. \u201cThere was always someone available to talk to,\u201d he said, \u201cand not just among the players. In a situation like that [his father\u2019s illness] it\u2019s something that hits you and you are in a place you\u2019re not used to. The modern way is that people are not so afraid to talk, to let off steam and let someone know how you\u2019re feeling. Before the Test I spoke to a few people in the backroom staff about how I was feeling emotionally and I felt so much better for doing that. Two or three years ago I would have kept it internal and who knows what would have happened?\u201d Here is another sign of good management all round. It is still early days but Silverwood gives the impression of being a sympathetic coach yet sufficiently strong to impose his vision of how the team should play. \u201cIt was great to see the lads pull together and see the blueprint come alive,\u201d he said. His instincts involve more carrots than sticks. The next Test series is in Sri Lanka in March, which represents a very different challenge. The spinners rather than the pacemen will be bowling most of the overs. At least three will be required in the squad \u2013 in addition to Root. The best combination would probably see the Somerset pair of Dom Bess and Jack Leach joining forces with Moeen Ali. Again the Silverwood approach is more cooperative rather than confrontational. Moeen is in the squads for the white-ball matches in South Africa and Silverwood will be chatting to him soon. \u201cMo has got to let us know how he feels and whatever he decides I\u2019ll give him my full backing. I love having Mo around and so does the team. But he\u2019s got to be ready.\u201d Finding the best combination of spinners is one of several key decisions to be made. The perennial questions will also resurface. Who bats at No 3? Who keeps wicket? And then there is the puzzle of which pacemen to take to a country that can test the good humour of the most equable of seam bowlers. At least in this department Silverwood and his fellow selectors are now picking from strength. There is no longer the imperative to depend upon the senior citizens, who may well be given a break. In all these decisions the voice of Silverwood, even though it will not be raised, may now carry a little more weight.",

In memory of her ship captain father, a girl raises flags visible from the harbour, unwittingly attracting the attention of her classmate.</p> <h2><strong>18. Arrietty (2010)</strong></h2> <p>A homage to The Borrowers, this is Studio Ghibli\u2019s version of the celebrated story of tiny people who \u201cborrow\u201d things. Its animators delight in minuscule detail: a cup brimming with a single drop of tea, wallpaper made of leaves. Featuring the voice of Saoirse Ronan, this is as heart-warming as Mary Norton\u2019s original.</p> <h2><strong>17. Pom Poko (1994)</strong></h2> <p>A tragicomedy on sweeping urban expansion, blind to the lives of other species and spirits. Riled by humans destroying their forest, a group of <em>tanuki</em> (racoon dogs) revolt. They relearn the ancient Buddhist art of shapeshifting in attempts to sabotage construction work.

When Marnie Was There (2014)</strong></h2> <p>Studio Ghibli\u2019s most recent film to date, this follows a troubled teenager sent to stay with her foster mother\u2019s relatives. Bewitched by a local salt-marsh mansion, she pays nightly visits to the ghost of the girl who lived there. An eerie film with an ending neatly wrapped up.</p> <h2><strong>15. Ocean Waves (1993)</strong></h2> <p>A quietly revelatory narrative of a student realising his feelings for his ex-classmate as he glimpses her on a train platform. Produced by younger staff, this film is a deviation from the full-blown fantasy Studio Ghibli is known for. Instead, this is a subtle and honest film about self-recognition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a7ffbbb51832fa183d517002d0c6ff82949bae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a7ffbbb51832fa183d517002d0c6ff82949bae3/360_0_2699_1619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Understated elegance \u2026 The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Studio Ghibli/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>14. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (2013)</strong></h2> <p>With its origin in one of Japan\u2019s oldest manuscripts, the mythical life of Princess Kaguya (voiced by Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz for its English language dub) is illustrated in elegant, understated strokes of watercolour. Haunting artistically and musically, the princess\u2019s feelings of relegation and harassment in a man\u2019s world feel raw and, at moments, untethered in Isao Takahata\u2019s final film.</p> <h2><strong>13. The Wind Rises (2013)</strong></h2> <p>The second of Studio Ghibli\u2019s aviation-themed films, this is the animation house at peak visual prowess. \u201cGhibli\u201d was the nickname of a second world war Italian aircraft; its moustachioed designer Caproni appears in the dreams of engineer Jiro Horikoshi in this poignant animation, which captures the preciousness of life.</p> <h2><strong>12. The Cat Returns (2002)</strong></h2> <p>One of Studio Ghibli\u2019s most bizarre premises for a film (and that\u2019s from the creators of Porco Rosso). Schoolgirl Haru is abducted by a herd of cats and coerced into marriage with a royal feline. A sequel of sorts to Whisper of the Heart, this is a cat owner\u2019s fever dream.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"59d08133366080514b2c2db4165964527b0bb924\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59d08133366080514b2c2db4165964527b0bb924/0_68_2331_1113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Psychedelic sci-fi \u2026 Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"477\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Psychedelic sci-fi \u2026 Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar/Optimum Releasing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>11. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984)</strong></h2> <p>Set in a spore-infested future swarming with immense insects, this is the story of a young princess destined to return the world to its habitable state. A psychedelic sci-fi slash fantasy-adventure influenced by Isaac Asimov and Tolkien, while also reminiscent of Star Wars. Produced before Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985, Miyazaki here sets down environmental concerns that become a staple of his later work. This earned the film a recommendation from WWF.</p> <h2><strong>10. Whisper of the Heart (1995)</strong></h2> <p>John Denver\u2019s saccharine Country Roads is this film\u2019s opening number, the sentimentality of which is steered into an uplifting and startling romance. A lesson that we should always follow cats on the train, Shizuku (voiced by Brittany Snow) finds a reverie-inducing world of antiques, violin-makers and cat figurines to contrast her humdrum (but sensitively depicted) Tokyo home life. As love is kindled between Shizuku and the antique seller\u2019s son, she becomes determined to work on her talents and ambitions.</p> <h2><strong>9. Ponyo (2008)</strong></h2> <p>Vaguely based on The Little Mermaid: when a reckless fish spirit dashes away from home she is saved from the sea by a young boy. Ensuing feelings make her yearn to be human, hurling the natural balance of the world off-kilter. Although its child protagonists are far too young to promise to love each other, this whimsical marine animation, featuring Cate Blanchett as the radiant and ginormous Goddess of Mercy, is one of Studio Ghibli\u2019s best.</p> <h2><strong>8. Tales from Earthsea (2006)</strong></h2> <p>Gor\u014d Miyazaki\u2019s directorial debut. He bore the huge burden of following up his father\u2019s legacy while simultaneously being the first to adapt Ursula K Le Guin\u2019s Earthsea series, an adaptation that she later disowned due to its departure from her books. While the film may lack the complexity of Le Guin\u2019s narratives, this is a chilling representation of lurking corruption, plaguing the society of a fantastical world as a young prince flees the swelling shadow in his soul.</p> <h2><strong>7. Grave of the Fireflies (1988)</strong></h2> <p>This Studio Ghibli production will not be available to stream on Netflix, sadly. But the devastating and superbly animated story of a brother and sister\u2019s fraught journey through their hometown during the second world war is well worth watching. A shattering insight into the now hypermodern Kobe\u2019s original architecture; Michio Mamiya\u2019s sparse film score aids to the crushingly bleak atmosphere in this portrayal of a child\u2019s experience of war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4fb4e2f53a74a153227dfadf65b7b1898a957f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4fb4e2f53a74a153227dfadf65b7b1898a957f5/0_550_1063_637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spirited Away.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Studio Ghibli\u2019s greatest triumphs ... Spirited Away.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BFI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>6. Spirited Away (2001)</strong></h2> <p>The stuff of childhood nightmares. After her parents turn into pigs, Chihiro is trapped in the spirit world. Forced to work in warty Yubaba\u2019s bathhouse until she can free her parents, the young girl navigates the spirit world, a place both tranquil and terrifying. The result of Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s mission to create a feisty heroine for young female viewers, this is one of Studio Ghibli\u2019s greatest triumphs.</p> <h2><strong>5. Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986)</strong></h2> <p>In Studio Ghibli\u2019s first official film, conflicting forces tussle over the treasures of a floating island. The legendary root of western and eastern civilisation, Laputa\u2019s evil heir Muska (Mark Hamill) returns to seize power. His plans are foiled by a young girl and a robot that, while at first appearing sinister, tends to the island\u2019s flora and fauna. Miyazaki confessed that the village in this film channelled the Welsh mining towns with which he became familiar on his travels.</p> <h2><strong>4. My Neighbour Totoro (1988)</strong></h2> <p>Emblematic of the Ghibli franchise, the snoozing woodland spirit Totoro has permeated global culture. In this simple story, two young girls are left to fend for themselves while their father is working and their mother is in hospital. The cuddly Totoro is on hand during emergencies, rescuing the children from the rain and summoning a smirking cat-shaped bus.</p> <h2><strong>3. Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service (1989)</strong></h2> <p>Based on Eiko Kadono\u2019s acclaimed novel about a teenage witch, this is the story of 13-year-old Kiki (voiced by Kirsten Dunst), who clambers on to her broom and goes in search of a new town in which to settle. Kiki struggles to find her footing in the developing world but ingeniously fashions her own delivery service for a bakery. An exuberant film about an enterprising young woman; a shame that the tragic loss of her sassy cat\u2019s voice is underplayed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18e0b02b77238d312812c835c23144cc63baa86a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18e0b02b77238d312812c835c23144cc63baa86a/102_0_833_500/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fantastical feuds \u2026 Howl\u2019s Moving Castle.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fantastical feuds \u2026 Howl\u2019s Moving Castle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buena Vista/Everett/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>2. Howl\u2019s Moving Castle (2004)</strong></h2> <p>Poor Sophie (voice acted by Emily Mortimer and Jean Simmons) bears the brunt of several magical feuds in this fantastical animation, cursed to appear as an old woman. She finds employment as housekeeper for a narcissistic wizard and becomes embroiled in his resistance of a war stirring between kingdoms. (This, apprently, was Miyazaki\u2019s filmic response to the Iraq conflict). A potent, affecting story of inner identity and beauty, loosely adapted from the novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones.</p> <h2><strong>1. Princess Mononoke (1997)</strong></h2> <p>Speaking strongly to our present climate crisis, this monumental animation centres around a stand-off between iron manufacturers and ancient forest spirits. Further afield from the conflict, Prince Ashitaka is cursed by a raging boar spirit and forced to voyage to Irontown, there encountering ferocious Princess Mononoke. Miyazaki manages to create nuanced characters on both sides of the battle; the resounding message, as in many of his films, is to cultivate a caring and symbiotic relationship between humanity and nature.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 January 2020, after the entry for Grave of the Fireflies was left out due to an editing error.</p>",

Haunting artistically and musically, the princess\u2019s feelings of relegation and harassment in a man\u2019s world feel raw and, at moments, untethered in Isao Takahata\u2019s final film. 13. The Wind Rises (2013) The second of Studio Ghibli\u2019s aviation-themed films, this is the animation house at peak visual prowess. \u201cGhibli\u201d was the nickname of a second world war Italian aircraft; its moustachioed designer Caproni appears in the dreams of engineer Jiro Horikoshi in this poignant animation, which captures the preciousness of life. 12. The Cat Returns (2002) One of Studio Ghibli\u2019s most bizarre premises for a film (and that\u2019s from the creators of Porco Rosso). Schoolgirl Haru is abducted by a herd of cats and coerced into marriage with a royal feline. A sequel of sorts to Whisper of the Heart, this is a cat owner\u2019s fever dream. 11. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984) Set in a spore-infested future swarming with immense insects, this is the story of a young princess destined to return the world to its habitable state. A psychedelic sci-fi slash fantasy-adventure influenced by Isaac Asimov and Tolkien, while also reminiscent of Star Wars. Produced before Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985, Miyazaki here sets down environmental concerns that become a staple of his later work. This earned the film a recommendation from WWF. 10. Whisper of the Heart (1995) John Denver\u2019s saccharine Country Roads is this film\u2019s opening number, the sentimentality of which is steered into an uplifting and startling romance. A lesson that we should always follow cats on the train, Shizuku (voiced by Brittany Snow) finds a reverie-inducing world of antiques, violin-makers and cat figurines to contrast her humdrum (but sensitively depicted) Tokyo home life. As love is kindled between Shizuku and the antique seller\u2019s son, she becomes determined to work on her talents and ambitions. 9. Ponyo (2008) Vaguely based on The Little Mermaid: when a reckless fish spirit dashes away from home she is saved from the sea by a young boy. Ensuing feelings make her yearn to be human, hurling the natural balance of the world off-kilter. Although its child protagonists are far too young to promise to love each other, this whimsical marine animation, featuring Cate Blanchett as the radiant and ginormous Goddess of Mercy, is one of Studio Ghibli\u2019s best. 8. Tales from Earthsea (2006) Gor\u014d Miyazaki\u2019s directorial debut. He bore the huge burden of following up his father\u2019s legacy while simultaneously being the first to adapt Ursula K Le Guin\u2019s Earthsea series, an adaptation that she later disowned due to its departure from her books. While the film may lack the complexity of Le Guin\u2019s narratives, this is a chilling representation of lurking corruption, plaguing the society of a fantastical world as a young prince flees the swelling shadow in his soul. 7. Grave of the Fireflies (1988) This Studio Ghibli production will not be available to stream on Netflix, sadly. But the devastating and superbly animated story of a brother and sister\u2019s fraught journey through their hometown during the second world war is well worth watching. A shattering insight into the now hypermodern Kobe\u2019s original architecture; Michio Mamiya\u2019s sparse film score aids to the crushingly bleak atmosphere in this portrayal of a child\u2019s experience of war. 6. Spirited Away (2001) The stuff of childhood nightmares. After her parents turn into pigs, Chihiro is trapped in the spirit world. Forced to work in warty Yubaba\u2019s bathhouse until she can free her parents, the young girl navigates the spirit world, a place both tranquil and terrifying. The result of Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s mission to create a feisty heroine for young female viewers, this is one of Studio Ghibli\u2019s greatest triumphs. 5. Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986) In Studio Ghibli\u2019s first official film, conflicting forces tussle over the treasures of a floating island. The legendary root of western and eastern civilisation, Laputa\u2019s evil heir Muska (Mark Hamill) returns to seize power. His plans are foiled by a young girl and a robot that, while at first appearing sinister, tends to the island\u2019s flora and fauna. Miyazaki confessed that the village in this film channelled the Welsh mining towns with which he became familiar on his travels. 4. My Neighbour Totoro (1988) Emblematic of the Ghibli franchise, the snoozing woodland spirit Totoro has permeated global culture. In this simple story, two young girls are left to fend for themselves while their father is working and their mother is in hospital. The cuddly Totoro is on hand during emergencies, rescuing the children from the rain and summoning a smirking cat-shaped bus. 3. Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service (1989) Based on Eiko Kadono\u2019s acclaimed novel about a teenage witch, this is the story of 13-year-old Kiki (voiced by Kirsten Dunst), who clambers on to her broom and goes in search of a new town in which to settle. Kiki struggles to find her footing in the developing world but ingeniously fashions her own delivery service for a bakery. An exuberant film about an enterprising young woman; a shame that the tragic loss of her sassy cat\u2019s voice is underplayed. 2. Howl\u2019s Moving Castle (2004) Poor Sophie (voice acted by Emily Mortimer and Jean Simmons) bears the brunt of several magical feuds in this fantastical animation, cursed to appear as an old woman. She finds employment as housekeeper for a narcissistic wizard and becomes embroiled in his resistance of a war stirring between kingdoms. (This, apprently, was Miyazaki\u2019s filmic response to the Iraq conflict). A potent, affecting story of inner identity and beauty, loosely adapted from the novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones. 1. Princess Mononoke (1997) Speaking strongly to our present climate crisis, this monumental animation centres around a stand-off between iron manufacturers and ancient forest spirits. Further afield from the conflict, Prince Ashitaka is cursed by a raging boar spirit and forced to voyage to Irontown, there encountering ferocious Princess Mononoke. Miyazaki manages to create nuanced characters on both sides of the battle; the resounding message, as in many of his films, is to cultivate a caring and symbiotic relationship between humanity and nature. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 January 2020, after the entry for Grave of the Fireflies was left out due to an editing error.",

Only quality. It seems to me that to do otherwise would be wrong.\u201d King is able to nominate films in three Oscars categories \u2013 best picture, adapted screenplay and original screenplay \u2013 and had been commenting on the lack of recognition for women and artists of colour in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/13/congratulations-to-those-men-issa-raes-quip-sums-up-oscar-frustration\">this year\u2019s Oscars nominations</a>.</p> <p>\u201cDamn, Stephen.

Writer Roxane Gay agreed. \u201cAs a fan, this is painful to read from you,\u201d she told King. \u201cIt implies that diversity and quality cannot be synonymous. They are not separate things. Quality is everywhere but most industries only believe in quality from one demographic. And now, here you are.\u201d</p> <p>King later clarified his comments on Twitter, adding: \u201cThe most important thing we can do as artists and creative people is make sure everyone has the same fair shot, regardless of sex, color, or orientation. Right now such people are badly underrepresented, and not only in the arts. You can\u2019t win awards if you\u2019re shut out of the game.\u201d</p> <p>The bestselling horror novelist has now <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/stephen-king-oped-the-oscars-are-rigged-for-white-people/2020/01/27/ad29c4e8-407c-11ea-aa6a-083d01b3ed18_story.html\">written an essay for the Washington Post</a> in which he said that, following his comments, he had found himself \u201cin the social media version of the stocks and subject to a barrage of electronic turnips and cabbages\u201d.</p> <p>King said he had mistakenly believed his statement about diversity in matters of art was \u201cnoncontroversial\u201d, writing: \u201cI also said, in essence, that those judging creative excellence should be blind to questions of race, gender or sexual orientation. I did <em>not </em>say that was the case today, because nothing could be further from the truth. Nor did I say that films, novels, plays and music focusing on diversity and/or inequality cannot be works of creative genius. They can be, and often are.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed in particular to Ava DuVernay\u2019s 2019 Netflix miniseries <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/when-they-see-us-is-a-powerful-overdue-telling-of-the-injustices-endured-by-the-central-park-five/2019/05/30/33075146-822a-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_6\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">When They See Us</a>. DuVernay had been a critic of King\u2019s original comments, tweeting: \u201cWhen you wake up, meditate, stretch, reach for your phone to check on the world and see a tweet from someone you admire that is so backward and ignorant, you want to go back to bed.\u201d</p> <p>King wrote for the Washington Post: \u201cAs with justice, judgments of creative excellence should be blind. But that would be the case in a perfect world, one where the game isn\u2019t rigged in favor of the white folks,\u201d pointing to the demographic makeup of the Academy Awards voters: 32% women and 16% minority voters.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cJudging anyone\u2019s work by any other standard is insulting and \u2013 worse \u2013 it undermines those hard-won moments when excellence from a diverse source is rewarded (against, it seems, all the odds) by leaving such recognition vulnerable to being dismissed as politically correct \u2026 We don\u2019t live in that perfect world, and this year\u2019s less-than-diverse Academy Awards nominations once more prove it. Maybe someday we will. I can dream, can\u2019t I? After all, I make stuff up for a living.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stephen King has rowed back on his controversial comments about diversity in the Oscars, acknowledging in a lengthy essay that the awards are still \u201crigged in favor of the white folks\u201d. King provoked anger among authors and fans after tweeting earlier this month that he \u201cwould never consider diversity in matters of art. Only quality. It seems to me that to do otherwise would be wrong.\u201d King is able to nominate films in three Oscars categories \u2013 best picture, adapted screenplay and original screenplay \u2013 and had been commenting on the lack of recognition for women and artists of colour in this year\u2019s Oscars nominations. \u201cDamn, Stephen. Damn. I thought you were better than this,\u201d said the award-winning American science fiction writer NK Jemisin. \u201cIt should be obvious that diversity and quality aren\u2019t separate qualities, or in opposition to each other \u2013 except in the minds of bigots\u201d. Writer Roxane Gay agreed. \u201cAs a fan, this is painful to read from you,\u201d she told King. \u201cIt implies that diversity and quality cannot be synonymous. They are not separate things. Quality is everywhere but most industries only believe in quality from one demographic. And now, here you are.\u201d King later clarified his comments on Twitter, adding: \u201cThe most important thing we can do as artists and creative people is make sure everyone has the same fair shot, regardless of sex, color, or orientation. Right now such people are badly underrepresented, and not only in the arts. You can\u2019t win awards if you\u2019re shut out of the game.\u201d The bestselling horror novelist has now written an essay for the Washington Post in which he said that, following his comments, he had found himself \u201cin the social media version of the stocks and subject to a barrage of electronic turnips and cabbages\u201d. King said he had mistakenly believed his statement about diversity in matters of art was \u201cnoncontroversial\u201d, writing: \u201cI also said, in essence, that those judging creative excellence should be blind to questions of race, gender or sexual orientation. I did not say that was the case today, because nothing could be further from the truth. Nor did I say that films, novels, plays and music focusing on diversity and/or inequality cannot be works of creative genius. They can be, and often are.\u201d He pointed in particular to Ava DuVernay\u2019s 2019 Netflix miniseries When They See Us. DuVernay had been a critic of King\u2019s original comments, tweeting: \u201cWhen you wake up, meditate, stretch, reach for your phone to check on the world and see a tweet from someone you admire that is so backward and ignorant, you want to go back to bed.\u201d King wrote for the Washington Post: \u201cAs with justice, judgments of creative excellence should be blind. But that would be the case in a perfect world, one where the game isn\u2019t rigged in favor of the white folks,\u201d pointing to the demographic makeup of the Academy Awards voters: 32% women and 16% minority voters. He continued: \u201cJudging anyone\u2019s work by any other standard is insulting and \u2013 worse \u2013 it undermines those hard-won moments when excellence from a diverse source is rewarded (against, it seems, all the odds) by leaving such recognition vulnerable to being dismissed as politically correct \u2026 We don\u2019t live in that perfect world, and this year\u2019s less-than-diverse Academy Awards nominations once more prove it. Maybe someday we will. I can dream, can\u2019t I? After all, I make stuff up for a living.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s biggest tech companies fuelled a record surge in the amount of renewable energy sold directly to global corporations last year, according to new figures. The amount of clean energy from renewable energy developers bought by companies has tripled in the past two years, driven by a growing corporate appetite for sustainable energy. Tech giants including Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have emerged as the biggest buyers of renewable energy to help power their data centres. BloombergNEF found that global corporations have purchased enough clean energy in the past 12 years to eclipse the entire energy capacity of countries such as Vietnam or Poland. Tech firms bought almost a quarter of the renewable energy sold to global companies last year, according to the report. The largest buyer is Google, which last year revealed plans for the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said the clean energy deal would include 18 separate agreements to supply Google with electricity from wind and solar projects across the world. The search engine\u2019s green energy portfolio will grow by 40%, giving the company access to an extra 1.6 gigawatts of clean electricity \u2013 the equivalent capacity of a million solar rooftops, the company said. BloombergNEF found that 100 companies in 23 countries struck deals to buy 19.5GW of renewable energy last year, up 40% from the record set the year before. The so-called power purchase agreements (PPAs) are likely to have cost between $20bn and $30bn (\u00a315bn to \u00a323bn), making up about 10% of the world\u2019s total renewable energy investments in 2019. The market for PPAs has grown rapidly in North America, where most such purchases are made, but a growing number of deals were struck in Europe and Latin America. Kyle Harrison, the lead author of the report, said: \u201cThe clean energy portfolios of some of the largest corporate buyers rival those of the world\u2019s biggest utilities. These companies are facing mounting pressure from investors to decarbonise.\u201d In 2019 alone, nearly 400 companies committed to set evidence-based climate targets, more than doubling the total number of firms with these goals. Sixty-three companies vowed to buy enough clean energy to meet 100% of their energy demand. These sustainability commitments are expected to fuel clean energy investments of almost $100bn over the next decade to build 105GW of new solar and wind power plants globally, said BNEF. Harrison said these sustainability commitments would \u201censure that clean energy procurement from corporations continues to thrive\u201d but that support from policymakers and investors would be key to meeting their growing appetite for clean energy. \u201cThe ball is in the court of utilities, policymakers and investors.

As a British minister attended an EU meeting in Brussels for the final time after 47 years of membership of the bloc, sources disclosed that officials led by Michel Barnier and Boris Johnson\u2019s Europe adviser, David Frost, would embark on the vital talks in the first week of March with a challenging 10-month deadline. The UK is due to leave the EU on Friday at midnight central European time \u2013 nearly four years since the referendum. The prime minister has said he will not extend the transition period past 31 December 2020. Until then, the UK will stay in the single market and customs union.

The former European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker had said the negotiations on the future relationship would start on day one after the UK\u2019s exit but preparations on both sides of the Channel were delayed by the general election. Chris Pincher, the UK\u2019s minister for Europe and the Americas, said after his general affairs council meeting with peers among the 27 other member states \u2013 the last by a British minister in an EU setting \u2013 that it was a \u201chistoric week\u201d when the \u201cgovernment will deliver on its promise\u201d. Pincher said the UK was leaving the bloc\u2019s institutions as a \u201csovereign equal\u201d but that it would not be leaving Europe with which the country had a shared \u201chistory, civilisation and values\u201d. Once the talks on the future relationship start in earnest on 3 March, it will be access to fishing waters and the EU\u2019s demand for a \u201clevel playing field\u201d that are likely to pose the biggest obstacles to success.

The fact that she is already handling everything that comes with being the world number one at home is sublime. Although she first reached the #1 ranking in May, a reminder of her inexperience: Barty had never beaten a top 20 player at a slam until her win over Alison Riske in the fourth round.</p> <p>Barty has a good shot at reaching the final when she faces Sonia Kenin on Thursday, but she will be the last person to underestimate the 14th seed. Kenin is a resourceful player with great movement, insanely competitive instincts and a gem of a backhand. She was a breakout player last year and one of the most consistent players around. Even in her first ever slam semi-final, it is hard to imagine her not showing up just because of how she demands herself to always be present. She will offer very few errors and prod any gaps that Barty leaves. Barty will be able to dictate a lot more, but that comes with its own pressures. So far, she has handled every ounce of pressure in her stride. We\u2019ll see how she\u2019ll handle another step into the unknown.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3026958f0811db2faecb0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T12:26:26.785Z\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>As usual, Roger Federer vs Novak Djokovic will be a monumental occasion but it is difficult to remember the last time they faced each other with such contrasting form.</strong> Federer\u2019s recovery from seven match points down today while struggling with a groin injury was beyond belief. By the beginning of the fourth set, he was barely moving and many wanted him to retire. The fact that he has dragged himself into the final after two desperate five sets reflects the aspect of his game that is constantly overshadowed by talk about how elegant his game is: his fight and his grit.</p> <p>However, Federer is not playing good tennis in Melbourne. He is not serving well enough and he has struggled badly with his groundstrokes, particularly his forehand, throughout this tournament. The issues in his game are compounded by these slow conditions and balls that supposedly fluff up and slow down very quickly, allowing his opponents a lot more time to neutralise his aggression. Across the net, Djokovic is simply in better form than anyone else and he is rightfully the tournament favourite by a fair distance.</p> <p>Federer is always realistic enough to recognise when he isn\u2019t in his best form. However, if his body is healed enough by the semi-final, he will be hoping that being the underdog will allow him to play with less pressure and more freedom than in prior matches. He did so just a few weeks ago at the ATP Finals in London, after all. Today was a reminder to never count Federer out, but Djokovic will be incredibly difficult for anyone to beat this week.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T12:29:46.621Z\">at 12.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3021748f0811db2faecab3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T12:02:21.261Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Finally, Djokovic was asked about his upcoming match with Roger Federer.

That was obviously encouraging playing against Milos. </p> <p>I knew that the two key elements in the game would be the return, how many balls I can get back in play, trying to get in the rally and get him moving around the court. And the second one was how efficiently could I hit my spots with my serve? I think I did a good job in the first two sets. I was fortunate to get out of trouble in the third, but I played a perfect tiebreak so it was a great performance.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e301ee68f086a28115a0d35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T11:49:48.185Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Djokovic was in tears after being asked about Kobe Bryant, who he forged a close bond with and considered a mentor. </strong>The Serb had spoken about their relationship just a day before his passing:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZaD0xWfHK0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TZaD0xWfHK0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cefe8c5c70c1bdfa24f905ffd8068f2704bd2123\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cefe8c5c70c1bdfa24f905ffd8068f2704bd2123/0_0_3500_2391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Novak Djokovic honours Kobe Bryant during his post match interview.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novak Djokovic honours Kobe Bryant during his post match interview.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T11:57:30.824Z\">at 11.57am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e301d7d8f08e1332473852c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T11:44:57.364Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Milos Raonic didn\u2019t really stand a chance.</strong> The contrast between the two is stark: Raonic\u2019s core strengths are limited to his serve and forehand, while Djokovic seems to be expanding his game with every match. </p> <p>He returned fantastically well against one of the best returners in the world, but he also held serve with ease and faced only two break points.

He has not lost his serve so far in Melbourne. He will look to take care of his service games as well as he can with his huge serve, taking control of points with his forehand and moving into the net whenever possible.

It will take one of the matches of Raonic\u2019s career for him to win.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:42:56.530Z\">at 8.42am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2fedb58f0811db2faec87b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:17:45.110Z\">8.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the earlier reports from Kevin Mitchell on quarterfinal day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/28/roger-federer-performs-great-escape-in-five-set-thriller-against-tennys-sandgren\">Roger Federer performs great escape in five-set thriller against Tennys Sandgren</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/28/glare-of-spotlight-intensifies-but-semi-finalist-ashleigh-barty-remains-grounded\">Spotlight intensifies but semi-finalist Ashleigh Barty remains grounded</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:18:18.242Z\">at 8.18am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2fe7e48f086a28115a0b1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:09:20.784Z\">8.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Federer after his incredible win.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AustralianOpen/status/1222067877911592960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u26f7or \ud83c\udfbe?<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rogerfederer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@rogerfederer</a> might need to rethink his priorities \ud83d\ude02<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AO2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AO2020</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AusOpen?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AusOpen</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MnKdiI4eH0\">pic.twitter.com/MnKdiI4eH0</a></p>&mdash; #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AustralianOpen/status/1222067877911592960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:12:11.532Z\">at 8.12am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2eeb2e8f08a6950eb49cf6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T17:55:24.111Z\">5.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello! Welcome to night nine of our coverage from the Australian Open. A few moments ago, an injured Roger Federer\u2019s completed sn absurd win from 7 match points down in the fourth set to beat Tennys Sandgren in 5 sets.</p> <p>There is just one match on the night match schedule today as Novak Djokovic steps up to face a rejuvenated Milos Raonic. Judging by the head to head, this will likely not be quite as dramatic. Djokovic will be going for a 10th win against Raonic. He has never lost to the Canadian and Raonic has managed to win only two sets in those 9 prior meetings. Even against an opponent as great as Novak Djokovic, that is a terrible result.</p> <p>Raonic does have some reason to feel hopeful. This has been a tough few months and even years for the Canadian as his attempts to compete at the top of the game have been constantly halted by injuries, but in Melbourne he has been healthy and he has produced some of the best tennis in the tournament. He is yet to drop a set, taking out 6th seed Tsitsipas in the third round and former US Open champion Marin Cilic in the fourth round. Against Djokovic, their most recent encounter, a tight three-setter in Cincinnati 2018, was his best showing to date and he will be trying to convince himself that he can build from that.</p> <p>Across the net, Djokovic has been the in-form player so far this year after guiding his Serbia to victory in the inaugural ATP Cup. He has been efficient here, losing only one set so far. But the most notable part of his start to the season has been his serve. Djokovic has been an excellent server for some time but it seems to have elevated to another level this week. He has added pace to both his first and second serves, and against two of the best returners in the world, Yoshihito Nishioka and Diego Schwartzman, his serve was untouchable. Now he faces one of the best servers in the game, we will see if it is the same.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:10:37.642Z\">at 8.10am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s it for today. Thanks for your emails. I\u2019ll leave you with Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from Melbourne on today\u2019s men\u2019s quarter-finals. What we learnt from the women\u2019s event earlier today was something we have been learning constantly for over a year: Ashley Barty is tough as hell. The quarterfinal between Barty and Petra Kvitova was easily the pick of the match-ups and for a set Barty was completely up against it as the sheer weight of Kvitova\u2019s strokes took the racquet from her hands. In any venue in the world, the way Barty weathered the storm in the first set and then marched to the victory was impressive. The fact that she is already handling everything that comes with being the world number one at home is sublime. Although she first reached the #1 ranking in May, a reminder of her inexperience: Barty had never beaten a top 20 player at a slam until her win over Alison Riske in the fourth round. Barty has a good shot at reaching the final when she faces Sonia Kenin on Thursday, but she will be the last person to underestimate the 14th seed. Kenin is a resourceful player with great movement, insanely competitive instincts and a gem of a backhand. She was a breakout player last year and one of the most consistent players around. Even in her first ever slam semi-final, it is hard to imagine her not showing up just because of how she demands herself to always be present. She will offer very few errors and prod any gaps that Barty leaves. Barty will be able to dictate a lot more, but that comes with its own pressures. So far, she has handled every ounce of pressure in her stride. We\u2019ll see how she\u2019ll handle another step into the unknown. As usual, Roger Federer vs Novak Djokovic will be a monumental occasion but it is difficult to remember the last time they faced each other with such contrasting form. Federer\u2019s recovery from seven match points down today while struggling with a groin injury was beyond belief. By the beginning of the fourth set, he was barely moving and many wanted him to retire. The fact that he has dragged himself into the final after two desperate five sets reflects the aspect of his game that is constantly overshadowed by talk about how elegant his game is: his fight and his grit. However, Federer is not playing good tennis in Melbourne. He is not serving well enough and he has struggled badly with his groundstrokes, particularly his forehand, throughout this tournament. The issues in his game are compounded by these slow conditions and balls that supposedly fluff up and slow down very quickly, allowing his opponents a lot more time to neutralise his aggression. Across the net, Djokovic is simply in better form than anyone else and he is rightfully the tournament favourite by a fair distance. Federer is always realistic enough to recognise when he isn\u2019t in his best form. However, if his body is healed enough by the semi-final, he will be hoping that being the underdog will allow him to play with less pressure and more freedom than in prior matches. He did so just a few weeks ago at the ATP Finals in London, after all. Today was a reminder to never count Federer out, but Djokovic will be incredibly difficult for anyone to beat this week. Finally, Djokovic was asked about his upcoming match with Roger Federer. It will be their 50th match, with Djokovic leading the series 26-23: Obviously tremendous respect for Roger, everything he has achieved in this sport and he\u2019s been one of the all-time greats and definitely one of my two biggest rivals. I\u2019ve been saying this many times and I\u2019ll repeat again: The match-ups against Roger and Rafa have made me the player I am today so I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019ve had so many great matches against those guys. And I hope I get to at least one match point [smiling]. It\u2019s quite amazing what he has done this on the court today and it\u2019s not the first time he has done that in his career. That\u2019s why he is who he is. Let the better player win. Sounds good to me. Djokovic on his performance and his medical timeout to replace his contact lenses: I wanna apologise to Milos because it\u2019s not something you see often... It was not intentional or tactical. It was just something I had to do. [During] those games I couldn\u2019t see much. I felt great on the court. I thought I was very focused. First couple of sets went exactly the way I wanted to go. One break was enough each set and I was quite comfortable serving. That was obviously encouraging playing against Milos. I knew that the two key elements in the game would be the return, how many balls I can get back in play, trying to get in the rally and get him moving around the court. And the second one was how efficiently could I hit my spots with my serve? I think I did a good job in the first two sets. I was fortunate to get out of trouble in the third, but I played a perfect tiebreak so it was a great performance. Djokovic was in tears after being asked about Kobe Bryant, who he forged a close bond with and considered a mentor. The Serb had spoken about their relationship just a day before his passing: Milos Raonic didn\u2019t really stand a chance. The contrast between the two is stark: Raonic\u2019s core strengths are limited to his serve and forehand, while Djokovic seems to be expanding his game with every match. He returned fantastically well against one of the best returners in the world, but he also held serve with ease and faced only two break points. He defended and moved as well as ever, but he also snatched the decisive 3-1 point in the tiebreak with a confident foray to the net. Djokovic is clearly playing the best tennis of the remaining players in his home court and it is going to take something mind-blowing to defeat him. A fantastic performance from the defending champion to reach the semis. He faces Roger Federer next. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 6-6 (*5-1) Milos Raonic: Not the greatest start from Raonic, who dumped a forehand in the net to hand over the first mini-break immediately. After flitting to a 3-0* lead behind his two serves, Djokovic switched things up at 3-1 by chasing down the net and burying a great pair of volleys. With a big unreturned serve, he is two points away. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 6-6 Milos Raonic: The third set will be decided by a tiebreak. After that desperate, brilliant hold from Raonic, Djokovic stepped to the baseline and delivered a swift love hold with some excellent serving. That was a statement. Djokovic leads Raonic 6-1 in tiebreaks. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 *5-6 Milos Raonic: With his back to the wall, Raonic just pulled out a sublime hold to keep himself in the match. Djokovic finally made his move, tightening up his return and offering no errors, bringing up four separate break points in an endless deuce game. Raonic saved the first three with three huge service winners, then he connected with a brilliant forehand drive volley winner on the fourth. With some more big serving, he finally escaped. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 5-5* Milos Raonic: Djokovic doesn\u2019t seem entirely focused here. He is still squinting between points and trying to focus his eyes. But at 30-30, two points away from being forced to a fourth set, he slipped in a perfect sliding ace. Djokovic was pushed back to deuce, but he snapped back into gear immediately, bringing himself to game point with a good serve. He held by winning a long point with a beautiful angled forehand passing shot after an equally lovely drop shot. It would be nice to do anything in life that well while not entirely focused. Reminder: Roger Federer is old (for a tennis player) Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 *4-5 Milos Raonic: Raonic seals a rare love hold with a couple of big serves and then a couple of aces. Djokovic didn\u2019t even move during those final two aces and he is still shaking his head towards his team. He is now using some eye drops provided by the trainer. Still, a great effort for Raonic to maintain his concentration after the break. As Djokovic goes off to change his contact lenses, the break is now officially a medical timeout. But he is back. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 4-4* Milos Raonic: Novak Djokovic holds to level and now he has invented a new rule on the spot - a contact lens break. He has gone off-court to change them. \u201cI can\u2019t see,\u201d says Djokovic. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 *3-4 Milos Raonic: Raonic is moving to the net a lot more now. He has had some success, but the problem is that these conditions are extremely slow. Not only are the courts slower and the Melbourne nights quite cooler right now, many players have said that the balls fluff up too much after a few games and then slow down At 15-15, Djokovic demonstrated this by deflecting a great forehand approach shot from Raonic before threading in an easy crosscourt passing shot. From 15-30 down, Raonic found a couple of big serves and then held with an overhead after sublime point of his own. Here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s updated piece on Federer\u2019s sublime win. As Djokovic marches through another hold for a 6-4 6-3 3-3* lead, here is that mind-blowing defensive lob. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 *2-3 Milos Raonic: Raonic flits through his first love hold of the match to inch ahead once more. He is actually holding more efficiently in this set, throwing in a couple of serve and volleys and hitting his spots better than ever. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 2-2* Milos Raonic: Djokovic holds through a deuce game. We haven\u2019t seen much of Djokovic\u2019s defence through all of this serving and returning, but the crowd finally saw a moment of glory: Raonic chased down a decent Djokovic drop shot and responded with a firm crosscourt forehand into the corner. That would have been Raonic\u2019s point against most players, but instead Djokovic tracked it down and came up with a sublime defensive lob at full stretch. The point ended with Djokovic drawing Raonic into the net and slipping a backhand passing shot. It took a couple of game points, but Djokovic found a big serve and moved on. The doubles players are currently shaking in terror at thought of having to face a Djokovic in this form. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 *1-2 Milos Raonic: Raonic opens the third set with a second uneventful hold, sealed with an unreturned body serve. This has not happened much today and he should cherish the feeling. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 1-1* Milos Raonic: Raonic hasn\u2019t always helped himself on the big points today. This time, he pushed Djokovic to 30-30 and then a forehand error from the Serb offered him a rare break point. Djokovic found a first serve but didn\u2019t place it nearly as well as he wanted to. No matter, Raonic missed the return. At deuce, Raonic then missed a forehand error from a neutral position. Djokovic was never going to let those gifts go to waste and and so the Serb completed his hold with a big service winner. Third set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3 *0-1 Milos Raonic: A solid hold from Raonic to open the third set. Two aces in the game, sealed with a sweeping move to the net and a simple volley winner. The one certainty is that he is not going to give up. Yep, this has been an exemplary performance for Djokovic. After two sets he has only hit 6 unforced errors and this is probably a rare instance where the scoreline seems tighter than it is. With another dominant service game, Djokovic flits to a two set lead. Despite not quite matching the exemplary serving stats of the first set, he breezed through his service games without conceding a break point and broke serve early. No trouble whatsoever. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *5-3 Milos Raonic: After plenty of enormous serving, Raonic was en-route to his first love game of the match. But Novak Djokovic is petty and so, with the score at 40-0, he connected with just one beautiful return to force a point out of Raonic. He will now serve for a two set lead. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 5-2* Milos Raonic: Djokovic edges back ahead to move within a game of taking set two. The defending champ hasn\u2019t allowed himself many moments of flair today, but he produce a glorious dropshot early on to move to 40-0 and things seemed to be flowing. Instead, Raonic dragged him back to deuce by utilising his slice far more frequently, forcing errors with a series of backhand slices. But Djokovic remained calm at deuce, even when a couple of supporters loudly applauded a missed first serve and forced a double fault, eventually closing out the game on his third game point. One more to go. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *4-2 Milos Raonic: A much better service game from Raonic there, sealed with an ace out wide. Djokovic didn\u2019t seem too fussed though. He now has the break and the priority is taking care of his own service games. It\u2019s not just me saying that 2-1 service game was dire. When your one strength is serving, I\u2019m afraid you really can\u2019t afford to miss them. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 4-1* Milos Raonic: In the blink of an eye, Djokovic consolidates the hold for 15 with a stream of big serves. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *3-1 Milos Raonic: Djokovic breaks! Raonic opened his service game with some rancid serving - he only managed one first serve in his opening five points and that just isn\u2019t compatible with competing well against Novak Djokovic. At 30-30, Djokovic took advantage of another second serve and strolled into the net, picking off an easy backhand volley for break point. Raonic saved the break point courageously, engaging Djokovic in a rare rally, moving him from side to side and then drilling a forehand winner down the line. He managed to save another break point with a slick serve-forehand 1-2 punch. But on the third, Djokovic came up with a moment of pure magic, slipping a lovely angled backhand passing shot and then sweeping up the point to break. It\u2019s difficult to see a way back for Raonic at the moment. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 2-1* Milos Raonic: For once, Raonic managed to play a series of points in Djokovic\u2019s service game on his term, but the results were mixed: Raonic produced two excellent forehand winners in succession to bring him to 30-30, then he committed two routine forehand errors to hand Djokovic the game. Still, a more positive start to this second set for the Canadian. Djokovic isn\u2019t quite as sharp and ruthless as he was for much of the first set. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 *1-1 Milos Raonic: The first simple hold for Milos Raonic in what feels like years. Enormous serving throughout, sealed with Raonic\u2019s second ace of the game. He sure would like many more holds like that. Second set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 1-0* Milos Raonic: Novak Djokovic opens with a solid hold to 30. At 30-30, after a couple of sloppy errors, Djokovic found an easy unreturned serve. He sealed the hold by drawing Raonic into a long rally and drawing out a forehand error. First set stats: Novak Djokovic: 7 winners, 3 unforced errors. Milos Raonic: 12 winners, 18 unforced errors. Djokovic lost 6 points on his serve. Raonic lost 20 First set: Novak Djokovic 6-4 Milos Raonic: It took multiple break points across four of Raonic\u2019s five service games and one almighty fight from the Canadian at the death, but Djokovic finally nabs the first set. Raonic saved the first set point with an unreturned serve, he saved the second set point with a bold, impressive inside out forehand winner and he saved the third set point with a 135 mph. On the fourth set point, Raonic missed a first serve and Djokovic ground him down with deep, early strokes, until a Raonic forehand finally flew wide. Phew. First set: Novak Djokovic 5-4* Milos Raonic: After another tough Raonic service game, Djokovic breezes through another quick hold on his own serve. Nine games later, these rallies are unsurprisingly short and staccato. Big serving, serve-forehand combos and little else. Can Raonic hold on until the tiebreak? First set: Novak Djokovic *4-4 Milos Raonic: Raonic comes through yet another service game by saving break point. From 30-30, Djokovic brought up break pound well to a lucky net cord from the Canadian, sweeping forward to the net and forcing an error. Raonic responded with two big unreturned serves to bring up game point. Djokovic scuppered the first with a great return and then Raonic sprayed a forehand wide on the second. However, Raonic eventually connected with two consecutive serve-forehand 1-2 punches in succession to hold. This is extremely tough but it\u2019s still on serve. First set: Novak Djokovic 4-3* Milos Raonic: It took Raonic 14 points to win his first point on Djokovic\u2019s serve, but when he did, he made it count by quickly generating his first break point at 30-40. Djokovic helped out with a couple of sloppy errors, including a weak forehand into the net at 30-30. How did he react? Three unreturned serves to hold. First set: Novak Djokovic *3-3 Milos Raonic: Another break point, but another resilient hold from Raonic to level. Djokovic moved up 0-30 after a long exchange ended with a brilliant inside-in forehand winner. Raonic pegged Djokovic back to 30-30 with some big serving, but then Djokovic slipped an angled backhand passing shot after Raonic failed to put away a forehand drive volley. From break point down, Djokovic put a foot wrong for the first time, dumping a routine slice into the net. Raonic received the gift with open arms, slamming down two big serves to seal the hold. First set: Novak Djokovic 3-2* Milos Raonic: Moments after Raonic\u2019s struggle of a service game, Djokovic stepped up to the net and breezed through his third love game in a row to start the match. There was a nice forehand down the line winner from behind the baseline at 15-0 and a smart move to the net at 40-0, forcing an error. Most importantly, there was just great serving. First set: Novak Djokovic *2-2 Milos Raonic: We are just a few games in, but Raonic has already been forced to grind through a tough hold, this time saving three break points. From 30-15, Raonic missed a first serve and was immediately punished with two devastating returns that landed low at his feet. In the tug of war that followed, Raonic saved two more break points, each time landing huge first serves. Finally, he was able to hold serve for 2-2 with a vicious service winner. First set: Novak Djokovic 2-1* Milos Raonic: Another problem for Raonic is that it is even tougher to break Djokovic\u2019s serve now. He has opened the match with 8 points in a row, the second game sealed with an unreturned serve followed by an easy serve-forehand combo. Back to Milos. First set: Novak Djokovic *1-1 Milos Raonic: That was a good hold from Raonic to open. He missed four first serves yet won three points behind them. He crushed a nice point-ending forehand down-the-line from behind the baseline at 15-15, then he smashed a serve-forehand 1-2 at 30-15. He held with a big unreturned body serve. Remember all the worries and discussions about air quality? First set: Novak Djokovic 1-0* Milos Raonic: A big question before the match was about whether Djokovic would continue to slam down his second serves as hard as he has done in Australia this year. He answered that question swiftly with a 181kmh second serve. A quick love hold for the Serb to begin, sealed by a slice backhand into the net from Raonic. The players are on-court. Djokovic, who was a friend of Kobe Bryant, has a tribute written on his tracksuit. Raonic on recovering his form after so many injuries last season: Yeah, I do. I didn\u2019t play much tennis last year, so I think for me the toughest part in this offseason was I knew I did six good weeks of training and I knew it would sort of come together. I was hoping I would play well in the first week of the year, but that didn\u2019t happen. I knew I had to be sort of patient for it to come together. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s paying off pretty early. And, you know, now I have to find a way to continue playing well in this tournament and after that find a way for continuity and try to create some momentum so I can do this week in and week out without having to take long breaks in between and sort of regressing my training and then having to pick up my training again. It would be nice to be able to consistently train, and then that way I don\u2019t have to really train as hard, because my level isn\u2019t falling off because I haven\u2019t been bedridden or sitting on a couch for weeks at a time. Here is Raonic last week on what he does well when he has been able to trouble Djokovic: I get myself in a lot of, at least putting in a lot of returns. He sort of feels like he has to work on those games. You know, I have gotta serve well. I don\u2019t know if it was the last time we played, but Cincinnati I had more of my opportunities than most times. I think I was up a break in each set. So I have got to be sharp in those moments if I can create them and if they arise. So, what do does this match-up have in store? As most already know, Milos Raonic is one of the biggest servers in the world and possibly of all time. He has not lost his serve so far in Melbourne. He will look to take care of his service games as well as he can with his huge serve, taking control of points with his forehand and moving into the net whenever possible. Clearly, he has been very effective doing so in Melbourne and it is always pleasing to see him performing so well at the net, a part of the court that is not natural for him but that he has converted into a strength through hard work. The problem is that, across the net, he is facing arguably the best returner of all the time, who also possesses some of the best defence and passing shots in the game. Their results and the fact that Djokovic has been able to break serve in the vast majority of their sets (only 6 of Djokovic\u2019s 21 sets won against Raonic have gone to tiebreaks) suggests that Djokovic knows Raonic\u2019s patterns and can unsettle the Canadian\u2019s serve. It will take one of the matches of Raonic\u2019s career for him to win. Here are the earlier reports from Kevin Mitchell on quarterfinal day. Federer after his incredible win. Hello! Welcome to night nine of our coverage from the Australian Open. A few moments ago, an injured Roger Federer\u2019s completed sn absurd win from 7 match points down in the fourth set to beat Tennys Sandgren in 5 sets. There is just one match on the night match schedule today as Novak Djokovic steps up to face a rejuvenated Milos Raonic. Judging by the head to head, this will likely not be quite as dramatic. Djokovic will be going for a 10th win against Raonic. He has never lost to the Canadian and Raonic has managed to win only two sets in those 9 prior meetings. Even against an opponent as great as Novak Djokovic, that is a terrible result. Raonic does have some reason to feel hopeful. This has been a tough few months and even years for the Canadian as his attempts to compete at the top of the game have been constantly halted by injuries, but in Melbourne he has been healthy and he has produced some of the best tennis in the tournament. He is yet to drop a set, taking out 6th seed Tsitsipas in the third round and former US Open champion Marin Cilic in the fourth round. Against Djokovic, their most recent encounter, a tight three-setter in Cincinnati 2018, was his best showing to date and he will be trying to convince himself that he can build from that. Across the net, Djokovic has been the in-form player so far this year after guiding his Serbia to victory in the inaugural ATP Cup. He has been efficient here, losing only one set so far. But the most notable part of his start to the season has been his serve. Djokovic has been an excellent server for some time but it seems to have elevated to another level this week. He has added pace to both his first and second serves, and against two of the best returners in the world, Yoshihito Nishioka and Diego Schwartzman, his serve was untouchable. Now he faces one of the best servers in the game, we will see if it is the same.",

      "bodyText": "Human rights groups have criticised authorities in the Gambia after police arrested 137 people, injured dozens and detained prominent journalists amid protests calling for the president to honour a pledge to step down after three years in office. Adama Barrow came to power after the election in 2016, ending 22 years of brutal dictatorship by Yahya Jammeh and inspiring widespread hopes for reform. But the 54-year-old, a former businessman who once worked as a security guard in the UK, has reneged on a campaign promise to step down by this month, saying the constitution requires him to serve out a full five-year term. In response, a movement called Three Years Jotna, which means \u201cenough\u201d in the local Wolof language, began protesting last month to demand his departure. On Sunday, police intervened when protesters deviated from the planned route on the outskirts of the capital Banjul in order to march toward the city centre, the government said. In a statement late on Sunday, government spokesman Ebrima Sankareh said the protesters had \u201cbecame riotous and violent by obstructing roads and burning tyres and logs on the highway as well as setting up fires in nearby bushes and on government wetland\u201d. Images of the protests showed police firing teargas at protesters before charging them with batons. Witnesses said they heard chants inciting an uprising. Eighteen police officers and seven civilians were injured in the clashes and some of the 137 arrested were executive members of Three Years Jotna,Sankareh said. The government has also decided to ban Three Years Jotna, Sankareh said, calling it \u201ca subversive, violent and illegal movement\u201d, and suspended two radio stations it accused of inciting violence during demonstrations. Opposition leaders could not be reached for comment. Amnesty International said the crackdown on protesters had alarming echoes of the Gambia\u2019s brutal past and would fuel tensions. \u201cThere have been some significant improvements in the country\u2019s human rights record since President Adama Barrow came to power, but the use of excessive force by security forces to disperse protesters risks fuelling tensions and steering the Gambia back to dark days of repression,\u201d the campaign group said. Sunday\u2019s march follows earlier protests by hundreds of Gambians calling for justice over human rights violations and abuses, including forced disappearances, rape, and murder, which occurred during Jammeh\u2019s 22-year rule. There have also been previous demonstrations by Jammeh\u2019s supporters in favour of the former dictator\u2019s return from exile in Equatorial Guinea. Jammeh fled in January 2017 under military pressure from West African countries to respect his election loss to Barrow. The government has said Jammeh will be arrested for killings, torture and other abuses allegedly committed by his security forces if he returns to the Gambia. Jammeh denies those allegations. Ismaila Ceesay, a senior lecturer in political science at the University of the Gambia wrote on Twitter that the \u201cdisproportionate use of force by police against protesters, the shutting down of media houses &amp; the arrest of journalists marks the dawn of a retreat from our democratic progress\u201d. Senior officials have previously said the agreement to stand down after three years of the five-year term was a result of Barrow being misled. \u201cHe was misguided and misled into this [agreeing to serve for only three years]. There is no transitional president, he\u2019s not a transitional president. He\u2019s an elected president and executive president,\u201d Barrow\u2019s close adviser Seedy Njie told the Guardian last year. \u201cWhen they made this agreement, there were a lot of politicians around him who were misguiding him. When he assumed office \u2026 he looked at the laws and he realised that he was elected to serve a period of five years.\u201d After winning plaudits at the beginning of his tenure for committing to respect rights and establish a truth commission to investigate abuses under Jammeh, Barrow is facing multiple challenges. Critics say that not enough has been done to purge those involved in human rights abuses under the former dictator from the military, police and intelligence service, nor to reduce the size of the security establishment. In July, dozens of protesters calling for better services in the city of Brikama were tear-gassed and hospitalised. The rapper Killa Ace, arrested with 36 others in August after protests against alleged police brutality, was held for weeks before being released on bail. Barrow also faces a weak economy, hobbled by massive debts incurred by Jammeh\u2019s government and soaring unemployment.",

      "bodyText": "Roger Federer has had many improbable victories in his career, and a smattering of unusual defeats, but his passage into the semi-finals of the 2020 Australian Open after three-and-half hours of undiluted drama against Tennys Sandgren was in another dimension. He won 6-3, 2-6, 2-6, 7-6 (8), 6-3 to put the world No 100 away on a warm, sticky afternoon on Rod Laver Arena and set up a semi-final against Novak Djokovic, who later saw off Milos Raonic \u2013 but those are the bare bones of the story. On his way to his second great escape of the week, the six-times winner of this title and owner of a record 20 majors had to save seven match points, received a rare code violation for swearing, snarled at one of the game\u2019s best chair umpires, Marijana Veljovic, then made the most of his luck when Sandgren was within sight of victory and injured his right knee in a collision with a ball girl. \u201cGot to get lucky some times, I tell you that,\u201d Federer said courtside. \u201cThose seven match points I wasn\u2019t under control. I was hoping he was not going to smash the winner. He played his match. I got incredibly lucky. As the match went on, I started to play again. I don\u2019t deserve this one, but I\u2019m standing here and I\u2019m very, very happy.\u201d Commenting on his medical timeout, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve played a lot of tennis. Sometimes you feel a bit funny. I started to feel my groin, my leg was tightening up. I don\u2019t like to get the trainer, show weakness and all that. It wasn\u2019t bad enough it was going to get worse, stiff tight. I don\u2019t even know what time it is. Draws are not getting easier. But you never know. You play without expectations because you know you should probably already be skiing in Switzerland.\u201d Yet he is in his 46th grand slam semi-final, more than anyone in modern times. They see-sawed on level terms for the first three frames but the conclusion to the fourth set was excruciating, drawn out like a German opera, one chorus drowning another. On Friday, Federer came from 4-8 down in the super tie-break to win six points in a row and break John Millman\u2019s heart in the fifth set. Here he was one point from leaving town after two-and-a-half hours. Somehow, he worked his way into a tie-break. At the changeover on three-all, a ball girl ran into Sandgren and he suffered a bizarre knee twist. Strapped up, he resumed and toughed out a 6-3 lead for three more match points, with Federer serving. Surely he would not be denied again. He found the net with a backhand for 6-4; two chances left. Federer served and saved for 5-6. Sandgren\u2019s destiny was in his hands once more. Federer fashioned parity with a controlled volley. Sandgren got another match point with a big serve down the T. Federer, back on serve, stretched out a long rally, and Sandgren cracked again. Federer smashed a winner, a point from safety. Sandgren aced for the 24th time and 8-all, then shoved a forehand into the tramlines. Federer served for the set again. Sandgren hit long. Job done. The fifth was an anti-climax. At break point in the third game of the third set, Federer was heard to mutter to himself: \u201cFucking \u2026\u201d The line judge reported it to the chair umpire, and Veljovic gave Federer a code violation for an \u201caudible obscenity\u201d. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d Federer inquired on the changeover. \u201cI can\u2019t repeat that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I heard it kind of.

Afterwards, they are manhandled willy-nilly into an unflattering multi-tiered crescent next to curtains of nondescript colour so someone can take their picture from afar. Think of it as a wedding picture for people better than you.</p> <p>But this year things changed. The Oscar nominees luncheon photo for 2020 has taken place in an empty white vortex. It\u2019s still an incredibly unflattering photograph, but it has the additional benefit of making the attendees look like they\u2019ve just died and emerged blinking into the afterlife.

Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are married, and nominated for the songs they wrote together for Frozen II. They\u2019ve been married since 2003, which is a lifetime in Hollywood terms. And yet apparently they do not know how to hold hands. How does this even work? They both look like they were doing individual bicep curls, and awkwardly attempted to join them together at the top.

Others found clever ways to subvert it, maybe by forgoing a tie. But Quentin Tarantino cares so little about rules that he rocked up in something that made him look like he came fifth in a semi-professional 10-pin bowling league in 1958.

Buckley gives off the look of someone who went to the event in a baseball cap as a surly \u201cscrew you\u201d to the comfortable formality of the Academy, only to bottle it in front of his heroes by turning it around and pushing it all the way up to the top of his head where nobody could see it.

(Main picture: second row, centre) Most in need of an immediate buddy road movie: Kathy Bates and Sandy Powell Be honest. This was where your eye was drawn first. Among all the conservative respect-clothing of the other diners, Bates and Powell stand out like a sore thumb. They\u2019re having a great time. They look like they\u2019re about four margaritas in already. We need to see a film where Kathy Bates and Sandy Powell get trashed in Vegas, and it needs to be good enough for them both to be invited back next year. (Main picture: third row, 12th from right) Weirdest display of companionship: Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez This is very sweet. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are married, and nominated for the songs they wrote together for Frozen II. They\u2019ve been married since 2003, which is a lifetime in Hollywood terms. And yet apparently they do not know how to hold hands. How does this even work? They both look like they were doing individual bicep curls, and awkwardly attempted to join them together at the top. It\u2019s weird. I\u2019m frightened. (Main picture: fifth row, centre) Most eager to fill your car with petrol: Quentin Tarantino Most people at the luncheon understood the dress code and stuck to it no matter what. Others found clever ways to subvert it, maybe by forgoing a tie. But Quentin Tarantino cares so little about rules that he rocked up in something that made him look like he came fifth in a semi-professional 10-pin bowling league in 1958. No wonder Robert De Niro can\u2019t make eye contact with him. (Main picture: fourth row, seventh from left) Sneakiest baseball cap: Bryan Buckley The most ostentatious luncheon attendees are always the ones who opt for unconventional hats. Buckley gives off the look of someone who went to the event in a baseball cap as a surly \u201cscrew you\u201d to the comfortable formality of the Academy, only to bottle it in front of his heroes by turning it around and pushing it all the way up to the top of his head where nobody could see it. But we can see it. Oh, we can see it. (Main picture: fifth row, second from left) Most aggressive septuagenarian: Randy Newman Randy Newman has been nominated for more Oscars than you could even count. He\u2019s done this before, countless times. This might be why he appears to be asking the photographer to step outside for a fight. (Main picture: fourth row, third from left)",

The Lakers have postponed Tuesday night\u2019s game against their cross-city rivals, the Clippers, following Bryant\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>Bryant was also remembered as the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs gathered for this Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl in Miami. His close friend, Richard Sherman, is one of the 49ers\u2019 key players, and said he hopes he can pay tribute to Bryant by winning the title.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was really sad yesterday and sad this morning. I was really down,\u201d Sherman said on Monday night. \u201cI was in the dumps, and then I thought about what he would tell me. He would tell me to stop being a baby and to man up and play and do it in his honor and win this game for him. And that is what we are trying to do. We\u2019re gonna go out there and try to play some dominating ball, just like he wanted.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kansas City\u2019s Frank Clark grew up in Los Angeles and said he used the Lakers star as an inspiration while growing up without his father.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere [in South Central Los Angeles] you don\u2019t got a lot to lean on. You don\u2019t got a lot to look forward to,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThere\u2019s gangs and drugs, and that\u2019s really it. And the one person, if anything, I looked to for inspiration and all my strength growing up when I was going through the things I was going through was Kobe Bryant. He was a successful guy, and that\u2019s the one thing you look to. You look at the gangs, and you look at the drug dealers, and then you look at the guys who are successful.\u201d</p>",

He said he would attempt to emulate Bryant\u2019s success in LA, where he had won five championships before his death. \u201cI promise you I\u2019ll continue your legacy man,\u201d wrote James. \u201cYou mean so much to us all here especially #LakerNation and it\u2019s my responsibility to put this shit on my back and keep it going!! Please give me the strength from the heavens above and watch over me!\u201d James included a collection of photos of the two together in the Instagram post. The Lakers have postponed Tuesday night\u2019s game against their cross-city rivals, the Clippers, following Bryant\u2019s death. Bryant was also remembered as the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs gathered for this Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl in Miami. His close friend, Richard Sherman, is one of the 49ers\u2019 key players, and said he hopes he can pay tribute to Bryant by winning the title. \u201cI was really sad yesterday and sad this morning. I was really down,\u201d Sherman said on Monday night. \u201cI was in the dumps, and then I thought about what he would tell me. He would tell me to stop being a baby and to man up and play and do it in his honor and win this game for him. And that is what we are trying to do. We\u2019re gonna go out there and try to play some dominating ball, just like he wanted.\u201d Kansas City\u2019s Frank Clark grew up in Los Angeles and said he used the Lakers star as an inspiration while growing up without his father. \u201cThere [in South Central Los Angeles] you don\u2019t got a lot to lean on. You don\u2019t got a lot to look forward to,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThere\u2019s gangs and drugs, and that\u2019s really it. And the one person, if anything, I looked to for inspiration and all my strength growing up when I was going through the things I was going through was Kobe Bryant. He was a successful guy, and that\u2019s the one thing you look to. You look at the gangs, and you look at the drug dealers, and then you look at the guys who are successful.\u201d",

Fanfare \u201973 was a wide-ranging celebration of a new cultural and economic union with our friends on the continent: Fonteyn and Nureyev in Swan Lake at Covent Garden; Albert Finney performing the work of Samuel Beckett; a symposium on visual language by Jacques Tati. There were exhibitions of French impressionism and Italian futurism, a display of contemporary Scandi design, and a grand market of the latest European art. (The market had so many fancy pieces on sale, the taxpayer was forced to foot a \u00a360,000 insurance bill. An eye-watering premium, until you remember it was only six and a half years since the World Cup, at which England\u2019s top security professionals and the Metropolitan Police had to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/08/world-cup-stunning-moments-pickles-the-dog-is-a-very-good-boy-in-1966\">bailed out by Pickles and his inquisitive wet nose</a>.

Britain\u2019s third television channel also transmitted \u2013 bear with us, we\u2019re getting very close to the bit about the football \u2013 a special edition of popular talent show Opportunity Knocks! featuring acts from some nations of the newly enlarged EEC.</p> <p>Some, you\u2019ll have noticed, but not all.

They also didn\u2019t care for Green\u2019s oleaginous delivery ... and they meant that most sincerely. Their loss, though. No less a superstar than Johan Cruyff (!!!) was coerced into appearing on the programme. In a brief interview, Cruyff reassured viewers whiling away the minutes until Coronation Street that British football would not be adversely affected by the UK\u2019s membership of the EEC. A performance of his 1969 hit single Oei Oei Oei, Dat Was Me Weer Een Loei, a woozy carouse o\u2019clock bierkeller stomp that wouldn\u2019t have sounded out of place on the first side of Scott 2, was presumably considered too outre for 6.45pm Monday on Thames.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"24102e5b055a6202b7a321884b13483ba0eccec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24102e5b055a6202b7a321884b13483ba0eccec8/0_0_400_582/344.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of the programme from the Common Market Match.\" width=\"344\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of the programme from the Common Market Match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruyff wasn\u2019t the only continental soccer star shipped over the briny to join in the celebrations.

Should it be on Brexit 50p coin?\u201d, hoping to loop in the lucrative \u201cjabs very blunt search terms into Google while squinting at their large-font iPad\u201d crowd who make up so much of the bustling, ever-moving internet.</p> <p>The weird thing about Pullmangate is that it both divides and amplifies all the voices of Brexit at once, in a way that is both completely fascinating and utterly irrelevant, and most of all, absolutely, undeniably, embarrassingly British.</p> <p>So on one side you have People Who Have Been Waiting For An Oxford Comma Debate All Their Life. You know these people, you walk among them: they walk up to harried waiting staff and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s an \u2018avacado\u2019, then?\u201d as if spotting a typo gets them a gold award; they can get five answers in a row on University Challenge but end up bankrupting themselves in court because they\u2019ve decided to challenge an archaic piece of legislation that somehow affected their house move eight years ago.</p> <p>To give you an example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/campbellclaret/status/1221427932943585281\" title=\"\">Alastair Campbell tweeted</a>, \u201cI for one shall be asking shopkeepers for \u2018two 20p pieces and a 10\u2019 if they offer me a 50p coin pretending that Brexit is about \u2018peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\u2019,\u201d and you can imagine the former Blair attack dog directing a tired newsagent, who\u2019s stoically watching a queue form behind him, to open a fresh bag of 20 pences and empty them into the till because Big Ali Campbell doesn\u2019t like Brexit. These are the people who lost.</p> <p>The people who won, meanwhile, are happy the 50p is even happening in the first place, because it\u2019s the only physical token of Brexit that actually exists. For over three years Brexit has been a concept in the air, a 55-comment Facebook status, a surefire pub argument, but it hasn\u2019t actually been anything because it hasn\u2019t happened. Is a clear and intelligible relationship with Europe sorted? No. Are we any closer to the Island of Utopia Brexit promises? Not really. But in getting sucked into a culture war over a coin, both Remainiacs and Brexiteers create the illusion of Brexit being \u201cdone\u201d in a single moment on Friday, when, really, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s almost like a test administered by some experimental arm of the government: after three years, here\u2019s a low circulation coin. Your emotional reaction to it reveals your true feelings about Europe.</p> <p>For my money, the Oxford comma is an outmoded piece of prescriptivism that doesn\u2019t particularly affect meaning and is aesthetically prim, and is therefore bad. But an argument about an Oxford comma embossed on a coin that has already once had to be scrapped and melted down at large cost to the taxpayer because the government got the date wrong of its own exit from Europe?

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the maddest you\u2019ve ever been at a coin? At school, once, there was a scuffle for a lost 20p, five or six large pubescent boys all jostling for it, each claiming they had spied it first; and in the midst of that, I \u2013 the first and only boy, truly, to spot the 20p \u2013 bent down to grasp it and, at that exact moment, got body-bounced from behind and ended up scraping my fingers along the exposed brickwork of the quad, a cheese-grater sensation I can still, when I want to, wince about today. In the intervening years, having grown up, I\u2019ve found it hard to get similarly worked up about a coin. And then Philip Pullman came along. \u201cThe \u2018Brexit\u2019 50p coin is missing an Oxford comma,\u201d the acclaimed author tweeted on Sunday, \u201cand should be boycotted by all literate people.\u201d To give a flavour of the quality of the country\u2019s discourse, the tweet became, when ground through the hard mincer gears of journalism, not simply a throwaway joke Pullman made in the face of some early-morning writer\u2019s block, but the closest thing we\u2019ve had post-Y2K to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. \u201cAuthor Philip Pullman has declared war on the new Brexit 50p - but it\u2019s nothing to do with politics,\u201d the BBC wrote, ticking the Doomsday Clock ever closer to midnight. \u201cAuthor Philip Pullman moans new Brexit 50p coin is missing Oxford comma,\u201d the Daily Mail went, before detailing how the remainer was thoroughly schooled on Twitter for his error. Ever thoughtful and classy, the Express went with: \u201cBrexit 50p coin: What is an Oxford comma? Should it be on Brexit 50p coin?\u201d, hoping to loop in the lucrative \u201cjabs very blunt search terms into Google while squinting at their large-font iPad\u201d crowd who make up so much of the bustling, ever-moving internet. The weird thing about Pullmangate is that it both divides and amplifies all the voices of Brexit at once, in a way that is both completely fascinating and utterly irrelevant, and most of all, absolutely, undeniably, embarrassingly British. So on one side you have People Who Have Been Waiting For An Oxford Comma Debate All Their Life. You know these people, you walk among them: they walk up to harried waiting staff and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s an \u2018avacado\u2019, then?\u201d as if spotting a typo gets them a gold award; they can get five answers in a row on University Challenge but end up bankrupting themselves in court because they\u2019ve decided to challenge an archaic piece of legislation that somehow affected their house move eight years ago. To give you an example, Alastair Campbell tweeted, \u201cI for one shall be asking shopkeepers for \u2018two 20p pieces and a 10\u2019 if they offer me a 50p coin pretending that Brexit is about \u2018peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\u2019,\u201d and you can imagine the former Blair attack dog directing a tired newsagent, who\u2019s stoically watching a queue form behind him, to open a fresh bag of 20 pences and empty them into the till because Big Ali Campbell doesn\u2019t like Brexit. These are the people who lost. The people who won, meanwhile, are happy the 50p is even happening in the first place, because it\u2019s the only physical token of Brexit that actually exists. For over three years Brexit has been a concept in the air, a 55-comment Facebook status, a surefire pub argument, but it hasn\u2019t actually been anything because it hasn\u2019t happened. Is a clear and intelligible relationship with Europe sorted? No. Are we any closer to the Island of Utopia Brexit promises? Not really. But in getting sucked into a culture war over a coin, both Remainiacs and Brexiteers create the illusion of Brexit being \u201cdone\u201d in a single moment on Friday, when, really, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s almost like a test administered by some experimental arm of the government: after three years, here\u2019s a low circulation coin. Your emotional reaction to it reveals your true feelings about Europe. For my money, the Oxford comma is an outmoded piece of prescriptivism that doesn\u2019t particularly affect meaning and is aesthetically prim, and is therefore bad. But an argument about an Oxford comma embossed on a coin that has already once had to be scrapped and melted down at large cost to the taxpayer because the government got the date wrong of its own exit from Europe? That\u2019s actually really good. It\u2019s also the Brexit debate in a microcosm: here we are, in the historic week where it all actually happens (kind of), when we all assemble around a silent Big Ben as it mutely bongs us out of Europe, and it all feels \u2026 a bit flat, doesn\u2019t it? Like, yes: the EU anthem Ode to Joy has re-entered the charts as some sort of Lib Dem thumb in the face of God, like everyone who ever got Rage Against the Machine to Christmas #1 once grew up, got a Bupa policy but still thought \u201cbuying music\u201d was a viable form of protest. And, yes, Romford\u2019s Tory MP Andrew Rosindell told the Sunday Express that he\u2019ll be holding possibly the most vibeless party in European history, with \u201ca great British buffet with food from around the UK and English sparkling wine - nothing French or German but everything British and Commonwealth\u201d. But who cares? This is what we deserve, what we all deserve. After three years of Farage on a flotilla and \u201cenough!\u201d and elections and more elections and another election then two more elections, this is what Brexit boils down to: a grey week in January where we\u2019re all waiting for an endless payday and getting furiously mad about a 50p.

He became a class clown to deflect from his hesitant progress in lessons, and because of his reading problem he developed a prodigious memory. All through his television career he never used an autocue because he could not read it. He simply remembered everything.</p> <p>Although he wanted to be an actor from an early age, his parents were extremely unenthusiastic, his mother commenting: \u201cSomeone like you, Nicholas, will just end up as an alcoholic or some kind of pervert.\u201d So when he left school he got a job as <a href=\"https://www.clydebankpost.co.uk/news/13942933.tv-star-nicholas-parsons-recounts-wartime-in-clydebank-shipyards/\" title=\"\">an engineering apprentice</a> at a factory making marine pumps on Clydebank near Glasgow.</p> <p>In the five years he was there he spent two six-month periods studying engineering at the University of Glasgow and also developed a variety act, impersonating film stars, which was successful and came to the attention of the impresario Carroll Levis, who used him on his radio show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6130135524a32f2cdb1a3ef86c72cab6d8dcfb73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6130135524a32f2cdb1a3ef86c72cab6d8dcfb73/0_143_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicholas Parsons, left, with Paul Merton on the 50th anniversary of Just a Minute in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicholas Parsons, left, with Paul Merton on the 50th anniversary of Just a Minute in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Charlie Clift</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1944 Parsons applied to join the merchant navy but within a few days of being accepted was taken seriously ill with pleurisy and spent five months in hospital. At one point the family was told his chances of survival were 50-50. After his recovery he returned to work and qualified as a mechanical engineer, performing as an entertainer in the evenings, and when the second world war ended he became a full-time professional actor with the grudging support of his parents.</p> <p>He made his West End stage debut in The Hasty Heart at the Aldwych in 1945, then played the lead in a tour of Arsenic and Old Lace. He was in rep in various towns for two years and also played supporting roles in many British films. He continued to perfect his comedy act for variety and cabaret, and in 1952 became resident comedian at the Windmill theatre.</p> <p>Parsons was ubiquitous on radio and television in the 50s, and there was a breakthrough, in terms of public recognition, when he became straight man for the character comedian Arthur Haynes for 10 years in several ITV series written mostly by <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12259004.johnny-speight-the-writer-who-created-alf-garnett-dies-of-cancer-aged-78/\" title=\"\">Johnny Speight</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/23/letters-nicholas-parsons-obituary\">Letters: Nicholas Parsons as the host of World in Action's &quot;Spongers&quot;</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Haynes usually played a wily and contemptuous tramp, and Parsons \u201cMr Nicholarse\u201d, the authority figure dealing with him.

He became a class clown to deflect from his hesitant progress in lessons, and because of his reading problem he developed a prodigious memory. All through his television career he never used an autocue because he could not read it. He simply remembered everything. Although he wanted to be an actor from an early age, his parents were extremely unenthusiastic, his mother commenting: \u201cSomeone like you, Nicholas, will just end up as an alcoholic or some kind of pervert.\u201d So when he left school he got a job as an engineering apprentice at a factory making marine pumps on Clydebank near Glasgow. In the five years he was there he spent two six-month periods studying engineering at the University of Glasgow and also developed a variety act, impersonating film stars, which was successful and came to the attention of the impresario Carroll Levis, who used him on his radio show. In 1944 Parsons applied to join the merchant navy but within a few days of being accepted was taken seriously ill with pleurisy and spent five months in hospital. At one point the family was told his chances of survival were 50-50. After his recovery he returned to work and qualified as a mechanical engineer, performing as an entertainer in the evenings, and when the second world war ended he became a full-time professional actor with the grudging support of his parents. He made his West End stage debut in The Hasty Heart at the Aldwych in 1945, then played the lead in a tour of Arsenic and Old Lace. He was in rep in various towns for two years and also played supporting roles in many British films. He continued to perfect his comedy act for variety and cabaret, and in 1952 became resident comedian at the Windmill theatre. Parsons was ubiquitous on radio and television in the 50s, and there was a breakthrough, in terms of public recognition, when he became straight man for the character comedian Arthur Haynes for 10 years in several ITV series written mostly by Johnny Speight. Haynes usually played a wily and contemptuous tramp, and Parsons \u201cMr Nicholarse\u201d, the authority figure dealing with him. The partnership broke up in 1966 and Parsons returned to the stage before working as foil for Benny Hill in more ITV shows from 1968 to 1971. He became a popular personality in his own right as quizmaster of Anglia Television\u2019s Sale of the Century (1971-83) \u2013 \u201cand now, from Norwich, it\u2019s the quiz of the week\u201d. Parsons had been chairman of Just a Minute, devised by Ian Messiter, since the first broadcast in 1967. In 2017, as the show\u2019s 50th anniversary approached, he concluded that: \u201cIt\u2019s the fun that keeps it going.\u201d Parsons was appointed OBE in 2004 and CBE 10 years later. He served as rector at the University of St Andrews from 1988 to 1991, wrote two volumes of autobiography and performed his one-man show at the Edinburgh festival and around Britain for many years. He is survived by his wife, Annie Reynolds, whom he married in 1995, and by two children, Suzy and Justin, from his first marriage, to the actor Denise Bryer, which ended in divorce. \u2022 Christopher Nicholas Parsons, actor, comedian and quizmaster, born 10 October 1923; died 28 January 2020",

      "bodyText": "After 56 years on our screens, Doctor Who made history on the weekend by casting the first BAME actor in the lead role, with Fugitive of the Judoon introducing Jo Martin as the Doctor. Martin is a regular on Holby City, where she plays Max McGerry, consultant neurosurgeon and acting CEO of the hospital. She has also appeared in Fleabag, Batman Begins and first came to prominence in the early 2000s playing Natalie Crouch in the BBC One sitcom The Crouches. She posted a picture of herself in costume as the Doctor on social media after the show aired on Sunday night \u2013 having kept her new role secret for months. Reaction to her arrival was spontaneous and joyous \u2013 the production team had managed to keep the surprise entirely under wraps. And after just one appearance, Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Time Lord has already begun to inspire fan art. The casting, though, isn\u2019t as straightforward as announcing her as the new Doctor to succeed current Doctor Jodie Whittaker. Her character was revealed to be a previously unknown version of the Doctor hiding on Earth disguised as a human tour guide called Ruth Clayton. Pursued by the Judoon as a fugitive, Clayton and Whittaker\u2019s Doctor travelled to a remote lighthouse to discover Martin\u2019s Tardis buried underground as her memory was restored. Fans have since posited several theories of how Jo Martin\u2019s Doctor could fit into the show\u2019s established history: Parallel universe Doctor In a Tardis scene where the two Doctors sparred with each other over their costumes, neither Whittaker nor Martin claimed to recognise the other \u2013 raising the possibility that Martin\u2019s Doctor comes from an alternative dimension. This season\u2019s opening story Spyfall set up the idea that there were possibly multiple versions of Earth being invaded by an alien species called the Kasavin, and at one point Whittaker\u2019s Doctor appeared to be transported to their dimension. Perhaps she didn\u2019t make it back to the right universe? Past Doctor: between Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee There\u2019s a gap in on-screen continuity between the Second and Third Doctors.

Past Doctor: pre-William Hartnell There are rumours that there may be a whole host of Doctors we\u2019ve never encountered before, who lived before the William Hartnell Doctor. The theory goes that some cataclysmic development had wiped his memory, leading him to forget his earlier selves, and to live believing he had never regenerated before. The clues are there.

      "body": "<p>Growing up in Philadelphia, I can remember exactly where I was the first time I heard Kobe Bryant\u2019s name. It was the last day of a summer basketball camp and the director invited a handful of the local high school stars to play a scrimmage in the afternoon as we watched, hoping to pick up some pointers. Most of them were headed to college in the next few years on their way to the NBA and were basically living our dreams.</p> \n<p>But it was the skinny 15-year-old from Lower Merion High School that had all the older kids buzzing in the cafeteria. <em>He\u2019s not even going to college</em>, they said. <em>He\u2019s going straight to the league.</em> Even back then, I knew enough to know it all sounded a bit far-fetched.</p> \n<p>Then Kobe took the floor. And immediately we realized we were watching something special. As the next few years went by, it became obvious he was bound for great things. We stole away on a school night to <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/1996/02/column_at_the_palestra_bryant_puts_on_a_show\">watch him face future NBA champion Richard Hamilton in the state playoffs</a> and gossiped enviously when he <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/sports/kobe-bryant-lower-merion-brandy-prodigy-20200127.html\">took pop star Brandy to the prom</a>. Over the next two decades, we watched as the basketball prodigy with the impossibly polished game from our corner of the map became, almost inevitably, a larger-than-life figure in world sport.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/kobe-bryant-death-legacy-nba-basketball-sexual-assault-allegations\">Mourn Kobe Bryant or don't: but mourn the whole, flawed man</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bryant, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/26/kobe-bryant-helicopter-crash-death-nba-los-angeles-lakers\">died in a helicopter crash on Sunday</a> aged 41, was ruthless on the court, which likely only magnified his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/kobe-bryant-death-legacy-nba-basketball-sexual-assault-allegations\">personal faults</a>. But once we confront the fallacy that athletes are role models and not something that marketing departments created to sell more sneakers, we can soberly assess just where Bryant stands in the pantheon of great American athletes.</p> \n<p>The short answer is at the very top, in the rare mononymic air of Tiger, Serena, LeBron.</p> \n<p>Bryant played the entirety of his 20-year professional career in Los Angeles for one of the NBA\u2019s blue-ribbon franchises. Some of the biggest names in the history of basketball have suited up for the Lakers down the years, including Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and LeBron James. But only Bryant, of those names, spent his whole professional career in the purple and gold, winning five NBA championships and retiring as the team\u2019s all-time leader in at least a dozen statistical categories.</p> \n<p>Tim Duncan, who also won five rings in a career that almost entirely overlapped Bryant\u2019s, was the better player, but a self-effacing introvert with a workmanlike game toiling in a small-market San Antonio could not approach the star wattage of Kobe, a slashing wing player with made-for-Hollywood charisma who came to embody the link between Michael Jordan and LeBron in the NBA\u2019s lineage of incandescent alphas.</p> \n<p>Bryant\u2019s detractors knocked him as phony and image-obsessed.

      "bodyText": "Growing up in Philadelphia, I can remember exactly where I was the first time I heard Kobe Bryant\u2019s name. It was the last day of a summer basketball camp and the director invited a handful of the local high school stars to play a scrimmage in the afternoon as we watched, hoping to pick up some pointers. Most of them were headed to college in the next few years on their way to the NBA and were basically living our dreams. But it was the skinny 15-year-old from Lower Merion High School that had all the older kids buzzing in the cafeteria. He\u2019s not even going to college, they said. He\u2019s going straight to the league. Even back then, I knew enough to know it all sounded a bit far-fetched. Then Kobe took the floor. And immediately we realized we were watching something special. As the next few years went by, it became obvious he was bound for great things. We stole away on a school night to watch him face future NBA champion Richard Hamilton in the state playoffs and gossiped enviously when he took pop star Brandy to the prom. Over the next two decades, we watched as the basketball prodigy with the impossibly polished game from our corner of the map became, almost inevitably, a larger-than-life figure in world sport. Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash on Sunday aged 41, was ruthless on the court, which likely only magnified his personal faults. But once we confront the fallacy that athletes are role models and not something that marketing departments created to sell more sneakers, we can soberly assess just where Bryant stands in the pantheon of great American athletes. The short answer is at the very top, in the rare mononymic air of Tiger, Serena, LeBron. Bryant played the entirety of his 20-year professional career in Los Angeles for one of the NBA\u2019s blue-ribbon franchises. Some of the biggest names in the history of basketball have suited up for the Lakers down the years, including Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and LeBron James. But only Bryant, of those names, spent his whole professional career in the purple and gold, winning five NBA championships and retiring as the team\u2019s all-time leader in at least a dozen statistical categories. Tim Duncan, who also won five rings in a career that almost entirely overlapped Bryant\u2019s, was the better player, but a self-effacing introvert with a workmanlike game toiling in a small-market San Antonio could not approach the star wattage of Kobe, a slashing wing player with made-for-Hollywood charisma who came to embody the link between Michael Jordan and LeBron in the NBA\u2019s lineage of incandescent alphas. Bryant\u2019s detractors knocked him as phony and image-obsessed. His on-court presentation seemed to be a deliberate carbon copy of Jordan\u2019s (easier said than done!), from the performative mean-mugging to the switching of uniform numbers. There was his weird penchant for self-coined nicknames: like Black Mamba (which stuck) and Vino (which went the way of fetch). To critics, he came off as a bit of a tryhard, which made him a perfect fit for how most of America sees LA. But there was nothing inauthentic about Bryant\u2019s intensity. He was probably the hardest worker in sports. Often it is supporting players who are praised for getting the very most out of their talent, but Bryant was an example of a supremely gifted athlete hell-bent on squeezing every last drop from his natural gifts, propelled by a maniacal competitive streak that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place on Wall Street in the 80s and often led to flare-ups with cooler-tempered teammates, most infamously with Shaq. He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated no fewer than 20 times (when such appearances still mattered) and became one of the rare sporting figures to genuinely transcend the sports pages in the US and become a household name. His international popularity may have even exceeded his standing at home as he became an crucial figure in elevating the sport\u2019s global profile. Michael Phelps may have won a record eight gold medals at the Beijing Olympics, but Kobe was the star of those Games on the ground. The last time I saw Kobe was at last year\u2019s US Open when he came to watch Naomi Osaka, whom he had taken on as a mentor. It was the first time I realized he was going to have a major impact on women\u2019s sports and was making an attempt to evolve as a person beyond the basketball ability that had been undeniable from day one.

The Labour party\u2019s values of internationalism and solidarity are why we should always be a pro-UK and a pro-Europe party. The best way of standing up for Labour values is to be clear about what we stand for. Never again can we face both ways on the biggest issues of our time. If we can\u2019t stand up for the future of the UK and play a central part in Europe, then we stand for nothing. I can\u2019t stand by and watch the party I love lose another election after losing four in the past 10 years. We need to change. I have a detailed plan ready to go. I just need help from members to implement it. The choice at this election is clear \u2013 changing to be a credible alternative government or staying the same and becoming a diminishing party of perpetual opposition. We owe it to every person in this country to provide the alternative party of government that Britain needs. \u2022 Ian Murray is the Labour MP for Edinburgh South",

But the administrators have already warned investors that these assets are proving<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/13/locked-in-woodford-investors-have-lost-a-fifth-of-their-money\"> more difficult to sell than expected</a>.</p> <p>Letters detailing each investor\u2019s payout from the fund wind-up have been sent to investors.

We had long identified the problems which were brewing at Woodford but we kept our own counsel on the matter.</p> <p>\u201cThe most obvious problem at Woodford was the lethal combination of a daily-dealing open-ended fund with significant holdings in unquoted companies and large percentage stakes in small quoted companies which had very limited liquidity.\u201d</p> <p>Other funds such as M&amp;G\u2019s \u00a32.5bn property fund are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/dec/04/m-and-g-suspends-property-portfolio-fund-retail-downturn-brexit\">suspended</a> because they are unable to easily sell their illiquid holdings, which include a number of retail parks and shopping centres. M&amp;G said in a note to investors on Tuesday that the suspension of the fund, which began on 4 December, will continue.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised the Financial Conduct Authority for its failure to adequately supervise the Woodford fund.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMany small investors who were simply seeking a secure investment for their pension have been hurt by the failure of Woodford,\u201d McDonnell said.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about the failure of Woodford.

      "bodyText": "The administrators of the failed Woodford funds have told the 300,000 investors locked in since last June that they will receive an initial payout of just 48p to 58p per share \u2013 compared with the 100p price at launch five years ago. The payout is the first distribution of investments liquidated by the administrators, Link Asset Solutions, since the suspension in June, with about \u00a32.1bn being handed back to investors. The money comes largely from sales of the \u201cliquid\u201d, easier-to-sell, part of the Woodford Equity Income fund, which was mostly shares in stock market quoted companies. A second distribution of cash will follow after the sale of the \u201cunquoted\u201d investments in the fund \u2013 stakes in companies that Woodford invested in but were not listed on the stock market. But the administrators have already warned investors that these assets are proving more difficult to sell than expected. Letters detailing each investor\u2019s payout from the fund wind-up have been sent to investors. But many will be losing even more than the 40% losses implied by the distribution per share, as they may have bought after the 100p launch in June 2014, when the share price initially rose. The implied 40% fall in the value of Woodford shares is in sharp contrast to the typical 31% gain in the average fund in the equity income sector over the past five years, and underline the calamitous failure in Woodford\u2019s stock-picking. The fund was once worth more than \u00a310bn but suffered from a raft of poorly performing investments, including with estate agent Purplebricks, finance firm Burford and doorstep lender Provident Financial. A rival fund superstar, Terry Smith, who has attracted billions into his Fundsmith Equity fund from small investors, last week made a stinging assessment of Woodford\u2019s performance. In a letter to his investors, he said: \u201cThe demise of Woodford Investment Management following the \u2018gating\u2019 of its main Woodford Equity Income fund was undoubtedly the main news in the industry last year. \u201cWe have no desire to engage in a general commentary on this matter or to engage in an unseemly exercise in schadenfreude. We had long identified the problems which were brewing at Woodford but we kept our own counsel on the matter. \u201cThe most obvious problem at Woodford was the lethal combination of a daily-dealing open-ended fund with significant holdings in unquoted companies and large percentage stakes in small quoted companies which had very limited liquidity.\u201d Other funds such as M&amp;G\u2019s \u00a32.5bn property fund are also suspended because they are unable to easily sell their illiquid holdings, which include a number of retail parks and shopping centres. M&amp;G said in a note to investors on Tuesday that the suspension of the fund, which began on 4 December, will continue. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised the Financial Conduct Authority for its failure to adequately supervise the Woodford fund. \u201cMany small investors who were simply seeking a secure investment for their pension have been hurt by the failure of Woodford,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about the failure of Woodford. More importantly it\u2019s about the failure of the regulatory system and in particular the FCA. \u201cI repeat my call for a fully independent inquiry into this debacle including the role of the FCA. Until we have the results of such an inquiry I have recommended to the chancellor that it is only proper that he delays the installation of Mr [Andrew] Bailey as the governor of the Bank of England.\u201d",

It can be something we wear in the 21st century \u2013 something that\u2019s embedded in a tradition, but also looking forward.

But offering craft skills at postgraduate level has a wider value too, says Nicky Dewar, learning and skills director at the Crafts Council. \u201cThese courses are an important opportunity to spend dedicated time exploring, thinking and challenging,\u201d she says. \u201cThey bring skills, but also an opportunity for conversation and innovation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/07/subject-guide-design-and-crafts\">University subject profile: design and crafts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And they are also finding ways to keep local traditions alive. Nottingham Trent University\u2019s fabric and fashion design call upon the area\u2019s rich heritage in those areas. The city\u2019s most famous export lives on in the Lace Market, and the university\u2019s Lace Archive contains around 75,000 samples. Principal lecturer Sean Prince says interest has been on the rise in the last few years among both international and UK students.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an increase of mature students in particular, and many of those students are really connecting with that deeper level of research,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of our students go on to do PhDs \u2013 for example, one of our students is studying knitting and how it links to wellbeing.\u201d<br><br>The research-driven course aims to get students challenging received wisdom and considering the future as part of their design responsibility, using all the different resources available, such as knitting machines and laser engraving. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them to go beyond a normal fashion textile brief, and to be very clear about aims and objectives that link to specific research questions,\u201d says Prince.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/nov/26/forever-in-fashion-a-tour-of-naples-finest-arts-and-crafts-makers\">Forever in fashion: a tour of Naples\u2019 finest arts and crafts makers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Traditional crafts are also being woven into new ways of thinking at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/may/10/universityguide-uni-wales-institute-cardiff\">Cardiff Metropolitan University</a>, which has long been a centre for ceramics. The new MA ceramics and master makers course forges the university\u2019s tradition of ceramics with a broader range of skills and materials such as wood, metal, enamel and glass. \u201cWe are problem finders and problem solvers,\u201d says programme director Natasha Mayo. \u201cIt\u2019s not all concept-driven. Our students come on the course because they understand that ideas are connected through skills.

      "bodyText": "Jayne Childs wants to change the way we think about lace. \u201cI\u2019m challenging the perception of lace as just something we use for curtains,\u201d she says. \u201cLace doesn\u2019t have to be fusty and dusty. It can be something we wear in the 21st century \u2013 something that\u2019s embedded in a tradition, but also looking forward. Even if people don\u2019t really necessarily understand what that tradition it is, they like to tap into that story.\u201d The craft economy generates almost \u00a33.4bn every year in the UK, much of it from craftspeople like Childs, who runs her own business creating wearable lace jewellery and gifts alongside studying part-time on the MA textile design innovation course at Nottingham Trent University. But offering craft skills at postgraduate level has a wider value too, says Nicky Dewar, learning and skills director at the Crafts Council. \u201cThese courses are an important opportunity to spend dedicated time exploring, thinking and challenging,\u201d she says. \u201cThey bring skills, but also an opportunity for conversation and innovation.\u201d And they are also finding ways to keep local traditions alive. Nottingham Trent University\u2019s fabric and fashion design call upon the area\u2019s rich heritage in those areas. The city\u2019s most famous export lives on in the Lace Market, and the university\u2019s Lace Archive contains around 75,000 samples. Principal lecturer Sean Prince says interest has been on the rise in the last few years among both international and UK students. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an increase of mature students in particular, and many of those students are really connecting with that deeper level of research,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of our students go on to do PhDs \u2013 for example, one of our students is studying knitting and how it links to wellbeing.\u201d The research-driven course aims to get students challenging received wisdom and considering the future as part of their design responsibility, using all the different resources available, such as knitting machines and laser engraving. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them to go beyond a normal fashion textile brief, and to be very clear about aims and objectives that link to specific research questions,\u201d says Prince. Traditional crafts are also being woven into new ways of thinking at Cardiff Metropolitan University, which has long been a centre for ceramics. The new MA ceramics and master makers course forges the university\u2019s tradition of ceramics with a broader range of skills and materials such as wood, metal, enamel and glass. \u201cWe are problem finders and problem solvers,\u201d says programme director Natasha Mayo. \u201cIt\u2019s not all concept-driven. Our students come on the course because they understand that ideas are connected through skills. Skills are a catalyst for ideas, rather than the other way around.\u201d The course attracts students from all over the world: this first cohort has makers from Japan, American, Korea, India and Canada. \u201cTheir skills have strong cultural resonance,\u201d says Mayo. \u201cAnd this means that the vocabulary becomes even more layered and rich.\u201d It also looks beyond the local to the wider makers network, with frequent talks and demonstrations by successful practitioners, and visits to Wales\u2019 many studios and factories. But it\u2019s vital, says Dewar, that postgraduate courses don\u2019t become the only pathway into crafts. \u201cWe have got world class courses and a booming creative industry, and the social benefits of crafts are only just starting to be recognised \u2013 yet they are pretty much disappearing from our schools.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve never seen this level of engagement\u201d, is a statement many of us would like to hear much more often when it comes to social justice. Rebecca Cokley, director of the disability justice initiative at the Center for American Progress and former White House staffer in the Obama administration, is referring to the unprecedented level of discussion of disability issues by presidential contenders in the Democratic primaries. Eight candidates released and promoted disability plans as part of their pitch to win the Democratic nomination, including Elizabeth Warren\u2019s which was widely praised for being particularly comprehensive. When Warren tweeted during a Twitter \u201ctown hall\u201d that \u201call policy issues are disability policy issues\u201d, it struck a chord. Along with disabled people\u2019s direct involvement in drawing up many of the candidates\u2019 proposals, it has become a priority election topic. Ordinarily, it doesn\u2019t tend to feature in primary or presidential campaigns, never mind so prominently, despite one in four adults in America \u2013 61 million people \u2013 living with a disability. The current focus is all the more significant because 2020 is the 30th anniversary of the introduction of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a landmark piece of anti-discrimination legislation. Among the most welcome proposals are greater inclusion in education and a focus on removing the sub-minimum wage, where some disabled people are paid a fraction of the federal minimum wage, currently just $7.25 (\u00a35.53). For decades, campaigners in America have grafted, as in the UK, to push disability issues \u2013 from health and social care to employment and accessible transport \u2013 up the political agenda. Disabled people must, as Cokley has put it, \u201chave a seat at the table\u201d. But policies that could tackle persistent barriers to inclusion often aren\u2019t even on the table, while there are many that actively go against disabled people\u2019s interests. The fallout of punitive policies is all too apparent in both America and Britain. Look no further than the catastrophic impact of a decade of austerity in the UK and welfare \u201creforms\u201d that came with it, which have seen thousands of people denied benefits payments and put through degrading and stress-inducing \u201cfit-for-work\u201d tests. Figures published this month confirming that more than 5,000 disabled and chronically ill people in the UK died before they could be reimbursed for benefits not paid due to government errors, and which left them seriously out of pocket, is just the latest in a long litany of mistreatment. In the US, a plethora of attacks on the social safety net, including reducing access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (known as Snap and formerly, food stamps) has disproportionately affected disabled and chronically ill people. So too do attempts to undermine social security. The latest adverse proposal from the Trump administration would introduce additional assessments of social security benefits applicants in order to qualify. The move constitutes what some disability advocates are calling a \u201cback-door\u201d attack on vital assistance along similar lines to the fit-for-work tests in the UK.

It was 2,581 hectares at 12.30pm. <br></li> <li>the fire was <strong>ignited</strong> yesterday by a <strong>military helicopter conducting surveillance</strong>, which was using landing lights to safely land in the smoky conditions in the Orroral Valley, in Namadgi. The landing light created enough heat to start a grass fire, which quickly spread out of control. </li> <li>spot fires <strong>are starting well ahead of the main fire front</strong>. At one point, they were igniting 5kms ahead of the front. The fire was behaving erratically and had created its own weather system.</li> <li>Flames atop the mountains were <strong>clearly visible to residents across the city</strong>, prompting widespread concern, particularly for those who lived through the 2003 disaster. Authorities said the fires that could be seen were spot fires, rather than the main fire front. </li> <li>Properties were <strong>under threat in Tharwa</strong>, 10 minutes south of Canberra\u2019s southernmost suburb, where fire crews were attempting to put out spot fires. Residents there were told to evacuate about 4pm. They were told it was too late to leave about 4.30pm. The advice remains that <strong>residents in Tharwa shelter and do not attempt to drive</strong>. Firefighters are on scene. </li> <li>Firefighters were also <strong>deployed into Canberra\u2019s southernmost suburb of</strong> <strong>Banks</strong> as a precaution. <strong>Containment lines</strong> were being constructed to protect the southern suburbs and <strong>doorknocking was taking place</strong> to communicate reliable information to residents in <strong>Banks, Conder, and Gordon</strong>. </li> <li>At 10pm, there was <strong>no immediate threat to homes in Canberra</strong>. But the advice warned residents in <strong>Banks, Conder, and Gordon to activate their bushfire survival plans</strong>, pack up essentials, and closely monitor conditions. Residents in <strong>Calwell and Theodore</strong> were told <strong>to monitor conditions</strong>. </li> <li>An <strong>easterly change brought stronger wind gusts </strong>to the fireground a short time ago. The change caused <strong>wind gusts of up to 45km/h</strong>. Those winds were expected to remain for an hour or two, before subsiding and <strong>bringing cooler temperatures and increased humidity</strong>, which will <strong>aid the firefighting effort</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Military surveillance aircraft continue</strong> to monitor the fire and provide intelligence to emergency services about the movement of the fire and any threat to homes.</li> <li>Authorities <strong>do not expect the fire to be put out by Friday</strong>, when hot temperatures and winds will return. </li> <li>Evacuation centres have been set up at <strong>Erindale College in Wanniassa</strong> and <strong>Dickson College</strong> in the inner-north. <strong>Exhibition Park</strong> is also open and can be used to store horses. </li> <li><strong>Heavy smoke</strong> is expected tonight. It will linger until tomorrow and possibly longer. ACT Health issued an alert and urged people not to engage in unnecessary physical activity. </li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"post\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Factemergencyservicesagency%2Fposts%2F2795023130580468%3A0&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"448\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T11:25:13.369Z\">at 11.25am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3012378f086a28115a0c9d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T10:55:22.245Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>easterly change we mentioned earlier is currently hitting the fireground</strong>.

Temperatures are expected to drop to the early 20s, and they are expected to drop further into the night, into the teens. </p> </blockquote> <p>We mentioned a little earlier that this fire will <strong>not be put out before Friday</strong>.

The helicopter was in the area assisting with surveillance and land clearing operations. Defence says it has stopped using the lights and is investigating the incident.</li> <li>The bushfire has now burned through nearly 8000 hectares. It is threatening rural areas in the south of the territory, including the village of Tharwa, which sits in the foothills. Tharwa residents are being told it is too late to leave and to take shelter.</li> <li>The fire is erratic and out-of-control. It is spotting 5km ahead of the fire front. The fire has created its own weather pattern and is burning to the north-east and east. At one point, the fire was growing 400 hectares every hour.

Temperatures were above 37C and humidity was low.</p> <p>To give you an idea how quickly the fire tore into the suburbs, the then chief minister Jon Stanhope declared a state of emergency at 2.45pm. Just 15 minutes later, the bushfire hit the suburb of Duffy.</p> <p>The fire quickly spread through the suburbs of Chapman, Kambah, Rivett, Higgins, Hawker and Cook.</p> <p>Almost 500 homes were lost. Four people died and 435 were injured.</p> <p>The speed of the fire was so great that it baffled bushfire researchers. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a pretty big shock, \u2019cause I mean, there\u2019s nothing really in the literature which suggests the fire should spread that fast, or could spread that fast,\u201d Jason Sharples, an expert who studied the fire, told the ABC in 2013.</p> <p>Research would later show the fire had created its own weather system, which had developed a fire tornado, leading to extreme wind speeds and huge unpredictability in behaviour. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:30:26.459Z\">at 8.30am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2fee948f08e1332473834e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:21:13.540Z\">8.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Extraordinary shot from Canberra Times photographer Sitthixay Ditthavong:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/wakeupsitt/status/1222068649785081856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People gather outside Tharwa as the Namadgi National Park bushfire threatened Mt Tennent and forced the village&#39;s evacuation on Tuesday afternoon. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bushfire?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bushfire</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/canberrafires?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#canberrafires</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/canberra?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#canberra</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/namadgi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#namadgi</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AustraliaBurns?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AustraliaBurns</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/punczEICX6\">pic.twitter.com/punczEICX6</a></p>&mdash; wakeupsitt (@wakeupsitt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wakeupsitt/status/1222068649785081856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:30:09.007Z\">at 8.30am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2fee198f0811db2faec87e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:18:57.605Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Canberra Deep Space Network at Tidbinbilla is not currently under direct threat from the fire, but will be closed for the next few days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CanberraDSN/status/1222050931887362052\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">With ongoing fire situation to our south and the expected weather over the next few days, we have decided to take the precaution of temporarily closing our visitor centre and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeepSpaceCafe1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DeepSpaceCafe1</a>.<br><br>Please note that there is currently no direct threat to the station. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/orroralvalleyfire?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#orroralvalleyfire</a></p>&mdash; CanberraDSN (@CanberraDSN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CanberraDSN/status/1222050931887362052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2feb408f08e1332473833e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T08:06:32.601Z\">8.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The latest update says the fire is now more than 6,000 hectares, and is running north-east and east.

The helicopter was in the area assisting with surveillance and land clearing operations. Defence says it has stopped using the lights and is investigating the incident.</li> <li>The bushfire has now burned through more than 4,600 hectares. It is threatening rural areas in the south of the territory, including the village of Tharwa, which sits in the foothills. Tharwa residents are being told it is too late to leave and to take shelter.</li> <li>The fire is erratic and out-of-control. It is spotting 5km ahead of the fire front. The fire has created its own weather pattern and is burning to the north-east and east. At one point, the fire was growing 400 hectares every hour. A total fire ban is in place and there is low humidity and moderate winds.</li> <li>Authorities expect the fire to begin starting spot fires within 1km of the ACT\u2019s southernmost suburb, Banks, this evening. Residents in Banks are not yet being told to leave. They are being told to monitor conditions closely and activate their bushfire survival plans, as are residents of neighbouring Calwell, Gordon, and Conder.</li> <li>Conditions will deteriorate into the evening. Winds are expected to strengthen, reaching gusts of up to 40km/h.</li> <li>The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, has described the conditions as the worst since 2003, when a bushfire that began in the mountains swept through the city, destroying 470 houses and killing four.</li> <li>Across the city, thick plumes of smoke can be seen rising from the mountains.</li> <li>Evacuation centres have been opened at Dickson college, in the inner-north of the city, and Erindale College in Wanniassa to the south. Exhibition Park is also open for those with horses. Further evacuation centres are being prepared this evening. </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T07:47:34.292Z\">at 7.47am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2fe49f8f086a28115a0b0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T07:38:37.557Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>These posts offer a sense of the size of the Orroral Valley fire as it threatens Canberra.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bikma31/status/1222021003569577984\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/orroralvalleyfire?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#orroralvalleyfire</a> shot from car driving back to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Canberra?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Canberra</a> from coast~ brave water bombers like tiny birds circling <a href=\"https://t.co/xPISwtWwUn\">pic.twitter.com/xPISwtWwUn</a></p>&mdash; Bikma3 (@Bikma31) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bikma31/status/1222021003569577984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/passing_gas/status/1222052951717400579\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Flames from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/orroralvalleyfire?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#orroralvalleyfire</a> have crested the mountains.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we will leave our coverage for tonight. Thanks for sticking with us. The last update we received from ESA was that there was no change from the advice it issued at 10pm, namely that there is no immediate threat to properties in Canberra, but there are spot fires threatening Tharwa. For those in affected areas, please follow updates from the ACT Emergency Services Agency on Twitter and Facebook. Further updates are available from ACT Policing. For road closures, follow ACT Policing\u2019s traffic team. The local emergency broadcaster is ABC Canberra radio. You can listen online or via radio. They will be transmitting emergency advice relayed from the ESA. We\u2019ve just moved past 10.20pm, so let\u2019s take recap on the events of the evening: an out-of-control bushfire burning in the mountainous Namadgi National Park, south of Canberra, has almost quadrupled in size in a single day, threatening the small village of Tharwa, and prompting warnings to residents of the city\u2019s southernmost suburbs. at 10pm, the fire was about 8,106 hectares in size. It was 2,581 hectares at 12.30pm. the fire was ignited yesterday by a military helicopter conducting surveillance, which was using landing lights to safely land in the smoky conditions in the Orroral Valley, in Namadgi. The landing light created enough heat to start a grass fire, which quickly spread out of control. spot fires are starting well ahead of the main fire front. At one point, they were igniting 5kms ahead of the front. The fire was behaving erratically and had created its own weather system. Flames atop the mountains were clearly visible to residents across the city, prompting widespread concern, particularly for those who lived through the 2003 disaster. Authorities said the fires that could be seen were spot fires, rather than the main fire front. Properties were under threat in Tharwa, 10 minutes south of Canberra\u2019s southernmost suburb, where fire crews were attempting to put out spot fires. Residents there were told to evacuate about 4pm. They were told it was too late to leave about 4.30pm. The advice remains that residents in Tharwa shelter and do not attempt to drive. Firefighters are on scene. Firefighters were also deployed into Canberra\u2019s southernmost suburb of Banks as a precaution. Containment lines were being constructed to protect the southern suburbs and doorknocking was taking place to communicate reliable information to residents in Banks, Conder, and Gordon. At 10pm, there was no immediate threat to homes in Canberra. But the advice warned residents in Banks, Conder, and Gordon to activate their bushfire survival plans, pack up essentials, and closely monitor conditions. Residents in Calwell and Theodore were told to monitor conditions. An easterly change brought stronger wind gusts to the fireground a short time ago. The change caused wind gusts of up to 45km/h. Those winds were expected to remain for an hour or two, before subsiding and bringing cooler temperatures and increased humidity, which will aid the firefighting effort. Military surveillance aircraft continue to monitor the fire and provide intelligence to emergency services about the movement of the fire and any threat to homes. Authorities do not expect the fire to be put out by Friday, when hot temperatures and winds will return. Evacuation centres have been set up at Erindale College in Wanniassa and Dickson College in the inner-north. Exhibition Park is also open and can be used to store horses. Heavy smoke is expected tonight. It will linger until tomorrow and possibly longer. ACT Health issued an alert and urged people not to engage in unnecessary physical activity. The easterly change we mentioned earlier is currently hitting the fireground. It is bringing with it wind gusts of 45km/h. This will be the strongest winds we will see for the rest of the evening. The Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s Rebecca Tamitakahara is speaking to the ABC right now. We are still seeing those gusty winds for an hour or so following the change, but we are then expecting to see those conditions ease back. Temperatures are expected to drop to the early 20s, and they are expected to drop further into the night, into the teens. We mentioned a little earlier that this fire will not be put out before Friday. Tamitakahara gives us a taste of the worsening conditions in the latter half of this week and on the weekend. Winds will also pick back up. We do have another cold front approaching NSW and the ACT later this week and this weekend. What that means is we will see those warm temperatures persist and get even hotter, particularly on Friday and Saturday. Professional photographer Martin Ollman has just posted a timelapse of the Orroral Valley fire to Twitter, showing its behaviour from afternoon to evening. It\u2019s quite incredible. These shots show Canberra\u2019s southern town centre of Tuggeranong, dwarfed by flames and smoke. This town centre is about 20 minutes drive from the village of Tharwa. The latest emergency advice says there is a spot fire burning near Tharwa, north of Spring Station Creek. Firefighters are on scene supported by a dozer. The total fire size is now 8,106 hectares. The ACT Emergency Services Agency commissioner, Georgeina Whelan, is speaking now. She says the fires visible to Canberrans are not the main fire front. They are spot fires, which are well ahead of the main front. She assures residents that aviation assets remain airborne and are keeping a close eye on the front. For our residents in Banks, Conder and Gordon, you may have already received a doorknock from SES, ACT Policing, or a defence member. That is not to trigger an evacuation. The doorknock is to remain engaged with our community, provide you with advice, and respond to any questions you may have. This shot from a little earlier, as the sun went down, paints a scary picture. The ridgeline is ablaze. A reminder, though, that there is a fair bit of country between the mountains and Canberra\u2019s southern fringes. The ESA says there is no current threat to properties in Canberra, only in Tharwa, the village in the foothills, where spotting is occurring. Just a reminder that the southern suburbs of Canberra are not yet being evacuated. Authorities are doorknocking there, but they are not evacuating people. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has urged Canberrans to stay safe, while noting Australian defence force personnel are helping local firefighters. An interesting aside, Morrison is speaking at the National Press Club tomorrow. An auspicious time for him to be speaking. I do hope he fields some pointed questions about the fire that will be still raging about 40 minutes to the south of the NPC, and the many others that have marked this unprecedented fire season. Joe Murphy, the ACT\u2019s rural fire service chief, said the gusty conditions brought by the easterly change this evening will enliven the far western side of the fire, which is in the rugged terrain near Orroral Valley. But he warns: It is very dry out there. This is a heavily timbered area. This is a very dangerous fire for our firefighters and we will not be compromising their safety to fight this fire. Murphy said the greatest concern remains with the village of Tharwa. But he said a firefighting strike team is at the village, as is a dozer, and a military aircraft is helping to provide surveillance. He said the fire will still be going on Thursday and Friday, when elevated fire dangers will hit the ACT with high temperatures and stronger winds. That is not good news. The forecast for Thursday is 37C and Friday is 40C. Murphy said the fire is too big to put out before then. The latest emergency warning from the ACT Emergency Services Agency says the fire is starting to spot near Tharwa village. It is now 7,912 hectares in size. That means it\u2019s more than doubled in size today. The situation remains the same for those in the southern suburbs of Canberra (Banks, Conder and Gordon). You should activate your bushfire plans and monitor conditions closely. As the light fades, we\u2019re getting a new perspective on the fire burning in the mountains. The flames are lighting up the night sky and illuminating the ridgeline. A reminder that the emergency services agency is saying there is currently no threat to property in Canberra suburbs. Residents in Tharwa, a small village 10 minutes south of the southernmost Canberra suburb, have been urged to shelter in the face of the emergency-level fire. The latest information suggests spot fires are igniting near Tharwa. Residents in Banks and Gordon are being told to activate their bushfire survival plans and closely monitor information from emergency services. We\u2019ve just had a brief update from the Bureau of Meteorology. Canberra will experience a wind change in the next hour or two. An easterly is going to come through. That will make things difficult on the fire ground. The change is expected to bring wind gusts up to 35km/h to 40km/h. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t quite reached the fire ground yet ... but it is expected to move through in the next hour,\u201d meteorologist Rebecca Kamitakahara told the ABC. \u201cAs we go later into the evening we will see those winds slow back, and the humidity increase.\u201d There is some good news. The change will bring lower temperatures. \u201cFollowing that we will see an easing trend in the winds through the night and they will become quite light into the morning,\u201d Kamitakahara said. Tomorrow, temperatures will hit about 36C. But the wind will not be quite as severe, so the fire conditions should ease. For those in affected areas, please follow updates from the ACT Emergency Services Agency on Twitter and Facebook. Also ACT Police, and for road closures go here. What we know about the fire so far: The bushfire began in Namadgi national park, a rugged mountainous area in the ACT\u2019s south. The fire was ignited by heat from a military helicopter\u2019s landing light. The helicopter was in the area assisting with surveillance and land clearing operations. Defence says it has stopped using the lights and is investigating the incident. The bushfire has now burned through nearly 8000 hectares. It is threatening rural areas in the south of the territory, including the village of Tharwa, which sits in the foothills. Tharwa residents are being told it is too late to leave and to take shelter. The fire is erratic and out-of-control. It is spotting 5km ahead of the fire front. The fire has created its own weather pattern and is burning to the north-east and east. At one point, the fire was growing 400 hectares every hour. A total fire ban is in place and there is low humidity and moderate winds. For a story on the bushfire threat, and the heatwave set to hit NSW and Victoria, see: The sunset over Canberra this evening is beautiful, in a haunting, depressing kind of way. We\u2019re expecting heavy smoke throughout Canberra this evening and tomorrow. The smoke is expected to come into the city from 8.30pm and linger until midday. ACT Health has issued a health alert. It says: The ACT Health Directorate has upgraded health advice to the community due to the deterioration of air quality across Canberra from the heavy smoke. The smog, which is impacting the ACT from fires across the border, is extremely thick and expected to linger in the coming days. Conditions may also be intensified by the hot temperatures forecast. A request has been made for assistance from New South Wales Rural Fire Service. Murphy said the size of the active fire has made that necessary. They\u2019re providing some support to the ACT tomorrow, I don\u2019t know how big it is at this stage. Murphy urges Canberrans to be \u201calert, not alarmed\u201d. Rural Fire Service chief officer Joe Murphy says wind conditions have eased slightly this evening. He told the ABC: We\u2019ve seen a small drop in wind speeds, which will calm the fire down a little bit. Emergency services are hitting it with everything. They are continuing to water bomb. Containment lines have been built. Firefighters have been pre-positioned in the south of Canberra. Murphy said: We\u2019re playing it safe, we\u2019re playing it very, very safe. Murphy says the smoke plume will still be visible to Canberra tomorrow morning. Now is the time to be listening to what we are saying and considering you actions, it really is, but there is no evacuation order for Banks and Gordon at this time. We\u2019ve just got a new emergency alert from the ACT\u2019s emergency services agency. The fire is now 7,912 hectares in size, so it\u2019s still spreading. There is no evacuation order yet for Banks and Gordon, the southernmost suburbs. Flames have now come over the crest of the mountains and are clearly visible to residents in the south of the city. One woman from Wanniassa, a southern suburb, has described the scene. She has been watching the fire all day from the vantage of the hills in Wanniassa. She tells ABC Canberra the plumes of smoke rising from the mountains resembled \u201catomic clouds\u201d earlier today. Now, she says: The sky\u2019s very dark, sort of purple and black with the orange behind it... I can see the flames along the ridge, Mt Tennant and along other mountains. It\u2019s Christopher Knaus here, taking over from Ben Doherty. I\u2019ll take you through the evening as the bushfire threat continues in Canberra\u2019s southernmost suburbs. Waterbombing is under way in the hills to Canberra\u2019s south. Many Canberrans, like me, will be remembering the horrific events of 2003 as they anxiously watch the bushfire currently burning in the mountains. The 2003 fires burnt for days in difficult terrain in the ACT\u2019s national parks \u2013 including Namadgi, the site of the current fire \u2013 before moving quickly into heavily populated suburbs on Canberra\u2019s south-western fringes. Dry lightning lit multiple fires in Kosciuszko and Namadgi national parks on 8 January 2003, but the behaviour had been predictable for days and of no major concern. But 10 days later, on 18 January 2003, the fires combined, broke containment lines and were fanned by 65km/h wind gusts towards the city. Temperatures were above 37C and humidity was low. To give you an idea how quickly the fire tore into the suburbs, the then chief minister Jon Stanhope declared a state of emergency at 2.45pm. Just 15 minutes later, the bushfire hit the suburb of Duffy. The fire quickly spread through the suburbs of Chapman, Kambah, Rivett, Higgins, Hawker and Cook. Almost 500 homes were lost. Four people died and 435 were injured. The speed of the fire was so great that it baffled bushfire researchers. \u201cIt was a pretty big shock, \u2019cause I mean, there\u2019s nothing really in the literature which suggests the fire should spread that fast, or could spread that fast,\u201d Jason Sharples, an expert who studied the fire, told the ABC in 2013. Research would later show the fire had created its own weather system, which had developed a fire tornado, leading to extreme wind speeds and huge unpredictability in behaviour. Extraordinary shot from Canberra Times photographer Sitthixay Ditthavong: The Canberra Deep Space Network at Tidbinbilla is not currently under direct threat from the fire, but will be closed for the next few days. The latest update says the fire is now more than 6,000 hectares, and is running north-east and east. It is out of control. The view looking south-west from Mt Ainslie. In the foreground you can see the Australian War Memorial, Anzac Parade, Lake Burley Griffin, and parliament house. A quick summary of what we know about the fire so far: The bushfire began in Namadgi national park, a rugged mountainous area in the ACT\u2019s south. The fire was ignited by heat from a military helicopter\u2019s landing light. The helicopter was in the area assisting with surveillance and land clearing operations. Defence says it has stopped using the lights and is investigating the incident. The bushfire has now burned through more than 4,600 hectares. It is threatening rural areas in the south of the territory, including the village of Tharwa, which sits in the foothills. Tharwa residents are being told it is too late to leave and to take shelter. The fire is erratic and out-of-control. It is spotting 5km ahead of the fire front. The fire has created its own weather pattern and is burning to the north-east and east. At one point, the fire was growing 400 hectares every hour. A total fire ban is in place and there is low humidity and moderate winds. Authorities expect the fire to begin starting spot fires within 1km of the ACT\u2019s southernmost suburb, Banks, this evening. Residents in Banks are not yet being told to leave. They are being told to monitor conditions closely and activate their bushfire survival plans, as are residents of neighbouring Calwell, Gordon, and Conder. Conditions will deteriorate into the evening. Winds are expected to strengthen, reaching gusts of up to 40km/h. The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, has described the conditions as the worst since 2003, when a bushfire that began in the mountains swept through the city, destroying 470 houses and killing four. Across the city, thick plumes of smoke can be seen rising from the mountains. Evacuation centres have been opened at Dickson college, in the inner-north of the city, and Erindale College in Wanniassa to the south. Exhibition Park is also open for those with horses. Further evacuation centres are being prepared this evening. These posts offer a sense of the size of the Orroral Valley fire as it threatens Canberra. Police say they\u2019ve been working for weeks on evacuation plans for a situation precisely like the one unfolding in Canberra. The chief police officer Ray Johnson said Banks and the other suburbs in Canberra\u2019s south, particularly Conder, Gordon, and Calwell, were not yet being evacuated, but should pay close attention to the bushfire and information provided by emergency services. \u201cIt isn\u2019t, at this point, an evacuation. It is a preparation and giving you advice about what you might choose to do,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf the need for an evacuation occurs, I\u2019d like to provide some comfort that considerable work has been done to prepare. We\u2019ve had a number of weeks working very closely with ESA on evacuation planning, thinking through various scenarios on how we would execute such plans. \u201cSo we are well placed to support the community should you choose to vacate and should you choose to evacuate.\u201d These are the current road closures for the bushfire threat, as advised by ACT police: Tharwa Road closed at Knoke and Pocket Avenues, Banks Angle Crossing Road at Monaro Highway (NB Monaro Highway is open (contrary to some reports)) Tidbinbilla Rd at Point Hutt Crossing Sunshine/Smith Roads Naas Road at the Namadgi Visitors Centre Boboyan Road at the ACT/NSW border Tidbinbilla/Point Hut The indefatigable Lyndal Curtis tells us a water bomber is in the air: We\u2019ve just learned that the Canberra bushfire ignited due to heat from a landing light on a military helicopter, a MRH-90 Taipan, which was conducting operations in Namadgi national park. The helicopter landed as part of reconnaissance work. Aircraft had been transporting people to clear land in Namadgi so that firefighting strike teams could be deployed to combat the fire. The crew of six on board were lucky to get out. The aircraft was damaged but they were able to flee. Lieutenant-general Greg Bilton said the ADF had stopped using the lights and was investigating the circumstances. \u201cWhen the helicopter landed yesterday afternoon, we believe that the landing light, which is lit on the aircraft as a safety precaution in difficult circumstances, such as a smoky environment, we believe that created enough heat to set the grass on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThat fire it was initiated and grew rapidly. The aircraft sustained some damage while it was on the ground. It was then able to recover and return to Fairbairn [the emergency services headquarters].\u201d The ACT emergency services agency issued an emergency warning to residents of Tharwa at 4.30pm saying it was too late to leave and to seek shelter immediately. \u201cThe fire may pose a threat to all lives directly in its path,\u201d the advice said. \u201cPeople in these suburbs are in danger and need to seek immediate shelter as the fire approaches.\u201d The fire is also threatening properties in rural areas on Boboyan, Apollo, and Top Naas roads. Residents in those areas are also being told it is too late to leave. Tharwa is about 10 minutes drive from Canberra\u2019s southernmost suburb, Banks. Residents in Banks and neighbouring suburbs Conder, Gordon, and Calwell were told to monitor the situation closely. At 5pm, they were told to activate their bushfire survival plans. This is the latest alert from the ACT ESA: Good evening, we are following developments with the bushfire currently threatening southern Canberra. The ACT government says this is the worst fire threat to Canberra since the 2003 fires devastated the city, claiming 470 houses and four lives. The fire is currently threatening Tharwa, a village of about 80 people to the immediate south of Canberra. Residents there have been warned it is too late to leave and that they should seek shelter.",

      "body": "<p>Last month, Penguin republished Maigret and Monsieur Charles, the last Maigret written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgessimenon\">Georges Simenon</a> in a new translation by Ros Schwartz. It marks the end of what author John Banville called \u201ca positively heroic publishing venture\u201d. Over the past six years, Penguin has brought out all 75 of the Maigret books that Simenon wrote, producing a new translation every six months, which is, as Banville says, a fitting monument to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.</p> <p>It feels like a good reason to investigate Simenon here on the Reading Group. We can discover why Andr\u00e9 Gide called him \u201cperhaps the greatest and the most truly a novelist in contemporary French letters\u201d. Why Camus said he learned from him. Why Muriel Spark and Henry Miller adored him. Why William Faulkner compared him to Chekhov. Why the famous Belgian remains one of the most widely read French-language writers of the 20th century.</p> <p>Simenon\u2019s genius is well recognised and his fans are legion \u2013 but he has always attracted a few doubters. He wrote more than 400 books, going at a ferocious rate. Naturally, he couldn\u2019t maintain standards in all of them \u2013 and it has been asked if he properly cared about any.</p> <p>There\u2019s a joke that Alfred Hitchcock once wanted to talk to the writer on the phone and was told that he was unavailable because he was working on a new book. \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d said Hitchcock, \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d Another joke in the satirical French newspaper Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9 was that \u201cM Simenon makes his living by killing someone every month and then discovering the murderer\u201d.</p> <p>In fact, Simenon could easily go faster than one murderer a month. At the peak of his productivity, it took him a week and a half to write a novel, at the rate of 80 pages a day. He would write these in the morning. Then he would vomit from the tension \u2013 and spend the afternoon relaxing.</p> <p>Simenon also recommended that his books should be consumed fast. \u201cYou can\u2019t see a tragedy in more than one sitting,\u201d he said \u2013 and that gives a big clue to the appeal of his work. It isn\u2019t mystery he cares for, nor the plot twists and surprises of contemporaries such as Agatha Christie. Simenon shows us pathos, pain and human frailty. In the Maigret novels I\u2019ve read, little happens that feels extraordinary. Usually you know who has committed the crime right from the start. There\u2019s satisfaction in watching Maigret at work, but there\u2019s no sense of triumph. Maigret doesn\u2019t win. The murderers and their victims always lose. Maybe the former, most of all. \u201cThe criminal is often less guilty than his victim,\u201d said Simenon.</p> <p>That makes for engrossing novels. So, too, does Simenon\u2019s blunt, pared-down style. In a 1955 interview, <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5020/georges-simenon-the-art-of-fiction-no-9-georges-simenon\">the Paris Review asked him</a> what he cut during the revision process. He replied: \u201cAdjectives, adverbs, and every word which is there just to make an effect. Every sentence which is there just for the sentence. You know, you have a beautiful sentence \u2013 cut it.\u201d</p> <p>This dislike of beauty is not to be mistaken for a paucity of ambition. He added: \u201cI tried to give to my words just the weight that a stroke of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s gave to an apple. That is why most of the time I use concrete words. I try to avoid abstract words, or poetical words, you know, like \u2018crepuscule\u2019, for example. It is very nice, but it gives nothing.\u201d</p> <p>That interview is also notable for his bleak summation of the novelist\u2019s craft: \u201cSome readers still would like to read very reassuring novels, novels which give them a comforting view of humanity. It can\u2019t be done.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds like just the kind of thing we need to counter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/16/up-lit-eleanor-oliphant-gone-girl-fiction-kindness\">the saccharine forces of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/16/up-lit-eleanor-oliphant-gone-girl-fiction-kindness\">up </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/16/up-lit-eleanor-oliphant-gone-girl-fiction-kindness\">lit</a>. Yet while it\u2019s clear that Simenon and Maigret will make a fascinating topic for the Reading Group, it\u2019s less obvious where to start.</p> <p>When the Paris Review asked Simenon which of his books he\u2019d most like to recommend for survival, he said, \u201cnot one\u201d. In contrast, when asked which of Simenon\u2019s books a beginner should read, his No 1 fan Gide replied: \u201cAll of them.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d tend to take Gide\u2019s side in that argument, but alas, we have only one month. You can read these books fast \u2013 but not that fast. My suggestion instead is that we try for just a couple of the novels. One we should decide by public vote, so please put your recommendations below the line. And while we\u2019re waiting for those nominations to come in, let\u2019s also start reading Pietr the Latvian. This was the first Maigret novel, and also the first book that Simenon thought good enough to have his name on the cover (after writing more than 100 pulp fiction titles under various pseudonyms). I\u2019ll post about that next week \u2013 and then on the winner of the vote the following week.</p> <p>We are about to encounter the work of a genius.

      "bodyText": "Last month, Penguin republished Maigret and Monsieur Charles, the last Maigret written by Georges Simenon in a new translation by Ros Schwartz. It marks the end of what author John Banville called \u201ca positively heroic publishing venture\u201d. Over the past six years, Penguin has brought out all 75 of the Maigret books that Simenon wrote, producing a new translation every six months, which is, as Banville says, a fitting monument to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. It feels like a good reason to investigate Simenon here on the Reading Group. We can discover why Andr\u00e9 Gide called him \u201cperhaps the greatest and the most truly a novelist in contemporary French letters\u201d. Why Camus said he learned from him. Why Muriel Spark and Henry Miller adored him. Why William Faulkner compared him to Chekhov. Why the famous Belgian remains one of the most widely read French-language writers of the 20th century. Simenon\u2019s genius is well recognised and his fans are legion \u2013 but he has always attracted a few doubters. He wrote more than 400 books, going at a ferocious rate. Naturally, he couldn\u2019t maintain standards in all of them \u2013 and it has been asked if he properly cared about any. There\u2019s a joke that Alfred Hitchcock once wanted to talk to the writer on the phone and was told that he was unavailable because he was working on a new book. \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d said Hitchcock, \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d Another joke in the satirical French newspaper Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9 was that \u201cM Simenon makes his living by killing someone every month and then discovering the murderer\u201d. In fact, Simenon could easily go faster than one murderer a month. At the peak of his productivity, it took him a week and a half to write a novel, at the rate of 80 pages a day. He would write these in the morning. Then he would vomit from the tension \u2013 and spend the afternoon relaxing. Simenon also recommended that his books should be consumed fast. \u201cYou can\u2019t see a tragedy in more than one sitting,\u201d he said \u2013 and that gives a big clue to the appeal of his work. It isn\u2019t mystery he cares for, nor the plot twists and surprises of contemporaries such as Agatha Christie. Simenon shows us pathos, pain and human frailty. In the Maigret novels I\u2019ve read, little happens that feels extraordinary. Usually you know who has committed the crime right from the start. There\u2019s satisfaction in watching Maigret at work, but there\u2019s no sense of triumph. Maigret doesn\u2019t win. The murderers and their victims always lose. Maybe the former, most of all. \u201cThe criminal is often less guilty than his victim,\u201d said Simenon. That makes for engrossing novels. So, too, does Simenon\u2019s blunt, pared-down style. In a 1955 interview, the Paris Review asked him what he cut during the revision process. He replied: \u201cAdjectives, adverbs, and every word which is there just to make an effect. Every sentence which is there just for the sentence. You know, you have a beautiful sentence \u2013 cut it.\u201d This dislike of beauty is not to be mistaken for a paucity of ambition. He added: \u201cI tried to give to my words just the weight that a stroke of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s gave to an apple. That is why most of the time I use concrete words. I try to avoid abstract words, or poetical words, you know, like \u2018crepuscule\u2019, for example. It is very nice, but it gives nothing.\u201d That interview is also notable for his bleak summation of the novelist\u2019s craft: \u201cSome readers still would like to read very reassuring novels, novels which give them a comforting view of humanity. It can\u2019t be done.\u201d It sounds like just the kind of thing we need to counter the saccharine forces of up lit. Yet while it\u2019s clear that Simenon and Maigret will make a fascinating topic for the Reading Group, it\u2019s less obvious where to start. When the Paris Review asked Simenon which of his books he\u2019d most like to recommend for survival, he said, \u201cnot one\u201d. In contrast, when asked which of Simenon\u2019s books a beginner should read, his No 1 fan Gide replied: \u201cAll of them.\u201d I\u2019d tend to take Gide\u2019s side in that argument, but alas, we have only one month. You can read these books fast \u2013 but not that fast. My suggestion instead is that we try for just a couple of the novels. One we should decide by public vote, so please put your recommendations below the line. And while we\u2019re waiting for those nominations to come in, let\u2019s also start reading Pietr the Latvian. This was the first Maigret novel, and also the first book that Simenon thought good enough to have his name on the cover (after writing more than 100 pulp fiction titles under various pseudonyms). I\u2019ll post about that next week \u2013 and then on the winner of the vote the following week. We are about to encounter the work of a genius. I hope you\u2019ll join me. As an added inducement, and thanks to publisher Penguin, we have five copies of Pietr the Latvian to give to the first five people from the UK to post \u201cI want a copy please\u201d, along with a nice, constructive thought in the comments section below.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine.

The high-voltage power cable began transmitting renewable electricity from Scottish windfarms to homes and businesses in England and Wales in late 2017, about six months behind schedule. Since then it has suffered multiple outages due to faults along the 260-mile-long twin cable, which runs from the west coast of Scotland to the north coast of Wales, and has spent most of this year offline. Ofgem said it will review whether the joint venture set up by National Grid and Scottish Power breached their licence conditions by delivering the cable late. It will also examine potential breaches relating to the cable\u2019s operation. The cable is a key part of the UK\u2019s plans to use more clean energy because it will help to channel Scotland\u2019s abundant renewable energy to areas in the south that have higher demand for electricity. When the cable is not operating there is a higher risk that windfarms may be paid to turn off, at a cost of millions of pounds to energy billpayers every week, to avoid overloading the local grids with more clean electricity than Scotland can use. The cable project also helps Scotland to import electricity from the rest of the country when wind speeds are low. In a joint statement the energy companies said they are confident that the project has delivered benefits to consumers since it began operating two years ago and will continue to \u201ctransport cleaner greener energy to our homes and businesses across Great Britain\u201d. The cable has been offline for two weeks following an outage caused by a fault on land near the southern end of the line. \u201cWe are working hard to repair the current cable fault and are certain we will overcome these difficulties and establish a link that will continue to benefit consumers for many years to come,\u201d the joint venture said.",

It is day four of the final Test between England and South Africa and, as chief groundsman, all he can do is watch as Rassie van der Dussen and Dean Elgar grind out the beginnings of a doomed rearguard action. Flint has been at the Wanderers since last spring, lured north after 10 and a half years at Newlands, where he won groundsman of the year during his last two seasons. He had had a lot to cope with. In January 2018 Cape Town officials announced that, after three years of insufficient rain, the city was three months away from Day Zero (running out of water). The visiting India team were told not to shower for more than 90 seconds, the India and South Africa sides gave a combined donation of 100,000 rand to the Gift of the Givers Foundation (disaster relief in Africa), fights broke out over water from the nearby Newlands borehole and club and schools cricket was cancelled halfway through the season. Three weeks before Day Zero, Australia and South Africa played a Test in Cape Town \u2013 subsequently overshadowed somewhat by the discovery of sandpaper down Cameron Bancroft\u2019s trousers. Newlands is well served by boreholes but Flint remembers it as a difficult time: \u201cWe were in the thick of it but it was an opportunity to show the rest of the world that we were doing our bit, almost like a badge of honour.\u201d He had to water the pitch; it has a very high clay content so otherwise would have cracked, but the outfield was something else. \u201cAt one point we were watering it maybe twice a week at most and it was very brown.

      "body": "<p>Nine people were on the helicopter that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/kobe-bryant-helicopter-crash-investigation-ntsb\">crashed outside the wealthy enclave of Calabasas, California</a>, on Sunday. The wreckage of the aircraft scattered across an area the size of a football field, and a day later the LA coroner\u2019s office was still gathering remains from the site. The helicopter had reportedly taken off in dense fog en route to a girls\u2019 basketball tournament in nearby Thousand Oaks, California, where some of the passengers were set to compete: among those on board was 13-year-old Gianna Bryant, an aspiring basketball player. The helicopter belonged to her father, the basketball superstar Kobe Bryant, who was also on board, and reportedly it was decked out like a limousine, with a cavernous interior and soft leather seats. There were no survivors.</p> <p>The death of Kobe Bryant has shocked sports fans and observers in part because he seemed like the sort of person who could never die. On the court, he moved with an uncommon skillfulness and grace, moving the ball from his opponents\u2019 reach with the alacrity and sleight of hand of a magician, leaping into the air with the elegant reach of a ballerina. Though he had a thin jaw and hollow cheeks, his face had something boyish about it. Maybe it was because he had rocketed to fame as a teenager, recruited to the NBA straight out of high school. Or maybe it was the dimple that appeared when he smiled, which he did often and easily. With his alarming physical skill and his aura of joyfulness and minor arrogance, he seemed to possess a permanent and transcendent youthfulness, as if he was always going to be a teenager. In reality, he was old for an athlete when he retired in 2016. He died at 41.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/kobe-bryant-obituary\">Kobe Bryant obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obituaries and hagiographies for Bryant rolled in the hours following the crash, and most of them focused on the parts of the story that were easiest to understand; tragedy of his sudden death, the beauty of his athletic skill, now lost forever. They carefully and conspicuously elided one of the most significant episodes of Bryant\u2019s public life: that in 2003, a woman said that he raped her in his room at the Colorado hotel where she worked as a concierge. She was strikingly young, too: at the time she says he raped her, the woman was just 19.</p> <p>The rape accusation defined Bryant\u2019s career during the mid-aughts. First, it was the subject of a criminal trial, in which it was revealed that Bryant had first denied having any contact with the accuser, then changed his story when confronted with evidence by the police \u2013 evidence such as the bruise on her neck, consistent with her claim that Bryant had choked her, as well as the tears and bruises on her genitals, his semen inside her, and her blood on his shirt. During the criminal proceedings, the media and Bryant\u2019s legal team used the accuser\u2019s real name repeatedly, and dragged out lurid details of her sexual and psychiatric history as evidence that she couldn\u2019t be trusted. She was hounded by the media, smeared as slutty and crazy in print, and threatened by fans. Eventually, she stopped cooperating with the investigation. This could be because she made the whole thing up, and realized that she made a mistake. That is possible. It is also possible, and more likely, that she stopped cooperating because she was 19, terrified, and facing the full force of media hostility and the legal resources of a very rich, globally popular man.</p> <p>The criminal case was dropped and the accuser filed a civil suit, which Bryant settled in 2005. The payout is confidential, but was rumored to be about $2.5m. Bryant\u2019s reputation recovered, the episode behind him, and he regained sponsorship deals with companies like Coca-Cola and Nike. He soon signed a seven-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, worth $136m. He bought his wife a comically gigantic diamond ring, <a href=\"https://people.com/style/a-look-back-at-vanessa-bryants-apology-ring/\">seemingly to apologize</a>.</p> <p>Now that Bryant is dead, it is likely that for his accuser, the traumas of the trial and media attention will be reproduced in miniature. She might be hounded online, or asked for comment by reporters. She might receive threats. At the very least, she will be reminded of what were probably the worst months of her life. For her, we can wish security and peacefulness and loving, supportive surroundings in what is likely a more complicated and distressing time for her than we can imagine. We can wish her safety, and privacy.</p> <p>But to those mourning for Bryant as they remembered him \u2013 as an athlete, or a philanthropist, or as an avatar of youthfulness, skill and success \u2013 these wishes can seem very inconvenient, even insulting to their grief. In the hours after Bryant\u2019s death, any mention of the rape accusation on social media was met with derision, contempt or calls not to speak ill of the dead. There is a sense that the alleged rape is minor compared with the rest of Bryant\u2019s legacy, that the pain of his young accuser is irrelevant, and should not be debited from Bryant\u2019s moral account. This chorus has put feminists in the position of making the assertion that rape is more morally significant than basketball.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The reality is that most of those who are grieving Bryant are simply not thinking about his accuser very much at all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, it is difficult not to sympathize with those who are grieving Bryant, those fans for whom he inspired envy and awe. To some of them, the rape accusation might be unbelievable, an anecdote that does not temper or complicate their grief but rather intensifies it: they may see him as a victim of a lie, a vengeful and possibly racist one. Others, more darkly, might believe the accusation but think that it reflects well on Bryant, seeing sexual violence not as a betrayal of the hope that he symbolized but as a sign of the youthfulness and masculine vitality that he displayed with such beauty on the court. There are people \u2013 men, mostly \u2013 who think of rape this way: not as a brutal violation of a woman but as a signal of a man\u2019s liveliness.</p> <p>But the reality is that most of those who are grieving Bryant are simply not thinking about his accuser very much at all. That something happened between them is all most of us will ever know about her, but it is just one of scores of things we know about him.</p> <p>For my part, I find myself thinking less about Bryant than about his young daughter, Gianna, who died with him in the crash. Those who wanted to believe in the better vision of Bryant noted that he was taking her to her own basketball tournament. This, they implied, was a sign that he could not be a misogynist, or a rapist, because he was choosing to spend time with his daughter, choosing to invest in her talent, her ambition. It is hard to accept that this Bryant, this version of him as a kindly father spending time with a young girl, could coexist within the same man who put his hands around the neck of a woman not much older than that daughter, and squeezed. That both of these people could potentially live inside one body \u2013 the attentive father, the allegedly violent rapist \u2013 is the great mystery and contradiction of Kobe Bryant\u2019s life.</p> <p>Gianna was 13 when she died, a year that is euphemistically referred to as a \u201ctender age\u201d. It\u2019s tender in part because 13 is around the age when girls become aware of the role that they are ageing into, aware of the injustices, indignities, violences and double standards that will be imposed on them when they are women, because they are women. By 13, you grow breasts and start getting catcalled; it becomes clear that some men will express their desire for you along with resentment and malice. For Gianna, a black girl growing into a black woman, the injustices and indignities she was facing down were even greater and crueler. Every woman navigates the perils of womanhood in her own way, and maybe Gianna would have been skillful, or lucky. Maybe she would have been insulated from sexism by her father\u2019s fame and money, or by the education that he could have bought her; maybe she would have developed a deep inner reservoir of dignity and resolve that some women draw on in the face of sexist injustice. Maybe she would have grown up to resent her father for the alleged attack, or maybe she would have forgiven him, made some kind of peace in adulthood with his darkness and inconsistencies. We simply do not know what kind of person she would have become. Now, we will never know.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Nine people were on the helicopter that crashed outside the wealthy enclave of Calabasas, California, on Sunday. The wreckage of the aircraft scattered across an area the size of a football field, and a day later the LA coroner\u2019s office was still gathering remains from the site. The helicopter had reportedly taken off in dense fog en route to a girls\u2019 basketball tournament in nearby Thousand Oaks, California, where some of the passengers were set to compete: among those on board was 13-year-old Gianna Bryant, an aspiring basketball player. The helicopter belonged to her father, the basketball superstar Kobe Bryant, who was also on board, and reportedly it was decked out like a limousine, with a cavernous interior and soft leather seats. There were no survivors. The death of Kobe Bryant has shocked sports fans and observers in part because he seemed like the sort of person who could never die. On the court, he moved with an uncommon skillfulness and grace, moving the ball from his opponents\u2019 reach with the alacrity and sleight of hand of a magician, leaping into the air with the elegant reach of a ballerina. Though he had a thin jaw and hollow cheeks, his face had something boyish about it. Maybe it was because he had rocketed to fame as a teenager, recruited to the NBA straight out of high school. Or maybe it was the dimple that appeared when he smiled, which he did often and easily. With his alarming physical skill and his aura of joyfulness and minor arrogance, he seemed to possess a permanent and transcendent youthfulness, as if he was always going to be a teenager. In reality, he was old for an athlete when he retired in 2016. He died at 41. Obituaries and hagiographies for Bryant rolled in the hours following the crash, and most of them focused on the parts of the story that were easiest to understand; tragedy of his sudden death, the beauty of his athletic skill, now lost forever. They carefully and conspicuously elided one of the most significant episodes of Bryant\u2019s public life: that in 2003, a woman said that he raped her in his room at the Colorado hotel where she worked as a concierge. She was strikingly young, too: at the time she says he raped her, the woman was just 19. The rape accusation defined Bryant\u2019s career during the mid-aughts. First, it was the subject of a criminal trial, in which it was revealed that Bryant had first denied having any contact with the accuser, then changed his story when confronted with evidence by the police \u2013 evidence such as the bruise on her neck, consistent with her claim that Bryant had choked her, as well as the tears and bruises on her genitals, his semen inside her, and her blood on his shirt. During the criminal proceedings, the media and Bryant\u2019s legal team used the accuser\u2019s real name repeatedly, and dragged out lurid details of her sexual and psychiatric history as evidence that she couldn\u2019t be trusted. She was hounded by the media, smeared as slutty and crazy in print, and threatened by fans. Eventually, she stopped cooperating with the investigation. This could be because she made the whole thing up, and realized that she made a mistake. That is possible. It is also possible, and more likely, that she stopped cooperating because she was 19, terrified, and facing the full force of media hostility and the legal resources of a very rich, globally popular man. The criminal case was dropped and the accuser filed a civil suit, which Bryant settled in 2005. The payout is confidential, but was rumored to be about $2.5m. Bryant\u2019s reputation recovered, the episode behind him, and he regained sponsorship deals with companies like Coca-Cola and Nike. He soon signed a seven-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, worth $136m. He bought his wife a comically gigantic diamond ring, seemingly to apologize. Now that Bryant is dead, it is likely that for his accuser, the traumas of the trial and media attention will be reproduced in miniature. She might be hounded online, or asked for comment by reporters. She might receive threats. At the very least, she will be reminded of what were probably the worst months of her life. For her, we can wish security and peacefulness and loving, supportive surroundings in what is likely a more complicated and distressing time for her than we can imagine. We can wish her safety, and privacy. But to those mourning for Bryant as they remembered him \u2013 as an athlete, or a philanthropist, or as an avatar of youthfulness, skill and success \u2013 these wishes can seem very inconvenient, even insulting to their grief. In the hours after Bryant\u2019s death, any mention of the rape accusation on social media was met with derision, contempt or calls not to speak ill of the dead. There is a sense that the alleged rape is minor compared with the rest of Bryant\u2019s legacy, that the pain of his young accuser is irrelevant, and should not be debited from Bryant\u2019s moral account. This chorus has put feminists in the position of making the assertion that rape is more morally significant than basketball. At the same time, it is difficult not to sympathize with those who are grieving Bryant, those fans for whom he inspired envy and awe. To some of them, the rape accusation might be unbelievable, an anecdote that does not temper or complicate their grief but rather intensifies it: they may see him as a victim of a lie, a vengeful and possibly racist one. Others, more darkly, might believe the accusation but think that it reflects well on Bryant, seeing sexual violence not as a betrayal of the hope that he symbolized but as a sign of the youthfulness and masculine vitality that he displayed with such beauty on the court. There are people \u2013 men, mostly \u2013 who think of rape this way: not as a brutal violation of a woman but as a signal of a man\u2019s liveliness. But the reality is that most of those who are grieving Bryant are simply not thinking about his accuser very much at all. That something happened between them is all most of us will ever know about her, but it is just one of scores of things we know about him. For my part, I find myself thinking less about Bryant than about his young daughter, Gianna, who died with him in the crash. Those who wanted to believe in the better vision of Bryant noted that he was taking her to her own basketball tournament. This, they implied, was a sign that he could not be a misogynist, or a rapist, because he was choosing to spend time with his daughter, choosing to invest in her talent, her ambition. It is hard to accept that this Bryant, this version of him as a kindly father spending time with a young girl, could coexist within the same man who put his hands around the neck of a woman not much older than that daughter, and squeezed. That both of these people could potentially live inside one body \u2013 the attentive father, the allegedly violent rapist \u2013 is the great mystery and contradiction of Kobe Bryant\u2019s life. Gianna was 13 when she died, a year that is euphemistically referred to as a \u201ctender age\u201d. It\u2019s tender in part because 13 is around the age when girls become aware of the role that they are ageing into, aware of the injustices, indignities, violences and double standards that will be imposed on them when they are women, because they are women. By 13, you grow breasts and start getting catcalled; it becomes clear that some men will express their desire for you along with resentment and malice. For Gianna, a black girl growing into a black woman, the injustices and indignities she was facing down were even greater and crueler. Every woman navigates the perils of womanhood in her own way, and maybe Gianna would have been skillful, or lucky. Maybe she would have been insulated from sexism by her father\u2019s fame and money, or by the education that he could have bought her; maybe she would have developed a deep inner reservoir of dignity and resolve that some women draw on in the face of sexist injustice. Maybe she would have grown up to resent her father for the alleged attack, or maybe she would have forgiven him, made some kind of peace in adulthood with his darkness and inconsistencies. We simply do not know what kind of person she would have become. Now, we will never know. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",

      "body": "<p>In a world where you can get a sexual partner faster than a pizza delivery, it has never been easier to play the field. Yet, despite all that swiping right, a surprising number of people are not having sex at all \u2013 not for religious reasons, or because they can\u2019t get a date, but because they find that celibacy makes them happier. </p> <p>Some have never had much interest in sex, while others are taking a break to address personal problems, recover from bad dating experiences or change the way they approach relationships.</p> <p>Catherine Gray, the author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Single, gave up sex for a year in 2014. \u201cBetween the ages of 16 and 34, I hadn\u2019t spent more than a few months single,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt incomplete without a plus-one and constantly hunted approval. I reached rock-bottom after being disproportionately crushed by the failure of a six-month relationship, so I decided to give up sex and dating for an entire year.\u201d</p> <p>Although deleting her dating apps felt like \u201cgiving up a drug\u201d, celibacy turned out to be a huge relief. \u201cInstead of doing what my boyfriend wanted to, I discovered what I liked, developing a love for yoga, photography and travelling. I dressed differently and no longer cared about attracting men. I started to see myself as a person \u2013 rather than a girlfriend or a sexual plaything.\u201d The period of celibacy changed how she approached dating; she is now in a healthy relationship. \u201cI realised that I had an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/05/the-attachment-secret-are-you-a-secure-avoidant-or-anxious-partner\" title=\"\">anxious attachment style</a> and that, if I started dating again, I would need to change who and how I date. If I feel insecure in the early stages of a relationship, I know it\u2019s because I\u2019m dating someone who is emotionally unavailable, so I back away, rather than persist.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb82040536282d99d00c679570bd25fbbc75b93b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb82040536282d99d00c679570bd25fbbc75b93b/0_0_3360_2240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eleanor Conway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Casual sex is really fun \u2013 if you\u2019re emotionally in the right place\u2019 ...

In 2014, she gave up the first two vices \u2013 \u201cand my alcoholic behaviour transferred to Tinder. It\u2019s so easy for a straight woman to date and find casual sex. It\u2019s really fun, if you\u2019re emotionally in the right place.\u201d (It\u2019s also great material if you are a comedian; <a href=\"http://www.eleanorconway.com/\" title=\"\">it inspired her show You May Recognise Me from Tinder</a>.) Over time, however, the \u201cadmin\u201d of looking for matches became too much. \u201cThe dates became a drag and any sex I had as a result was rubbish. The more sober I got, the more difficult it was to engage in casual dating. It was like my superpower stopped working.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, she tried celibacy for 10 months. \u201cSurprisingly, it was a massive relief. I stopped seeing men as sex objects and females as competition.\u201d Conway found her platonic relationships with men and women improved and she was able to focus on her career. She is open to a sexual relationship now, but she knows it will happen only if she has a true connection with a person.</p> <p>Self-imposed celibacy seems more common among women, but men, too, can be damaged by casual encounters. Tom gave up sex 18 months ago, after he came out of an abusive relationship and joined Alcoholics Anonymous to address addiction. \u201cI was promiscuous when I was drinking,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I chose to become celibate to support my recovery.\u201d He soon realised he had been using casual sex to cover up his loneliness. Going celibate has given him the opportunity to address these emotions and improve the other relationships in his life. \u201cI go mountain biking, I help out at AA and I spend time with friends. I\u2019ve got more time for my family and it\u2019s made those bonds stronger.\u201d Although he admits he sometimes misses sex, he believes it is not worth jeopardising his newfound happiness. \u201cI will only have sex again if I know the relationship is right for me.

Shirley Yanez gave up sex in 2005, after serious health problems led to a hysterectomy. She also experienced financial difficulties, which kicked off a period of self-reflection and a career change. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to have sex for a year after my operation. But I came to realise that I would rather focus my energy elsewhere in life,\u201d she says. \u201cThe best part of being celibate is there are no distractions. I can focus fully on my passion, my purpose and my work.\u201d In the past 15 years, she has set up a business to support British manufacturing; she also offers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/31/safety-blanket-why-more-teenagers-relying-life-coaches\" title=\"\">life-coaching services</a> for homeless and young people. \u201cI teach young people about the positive mental health benefits of celibacy,\u201d she says. \u201cI never tell them what to do, but I talk to them about the importance of making their own decisions rather than being influenced by media or peer pressure.\u201d</p> <p>Yanez believes that celibacy among young people is on the rise, especially among girls. \u201cI think young women feel more empowered than ever to reject the sexual roles they\u2019ve felt pushed into in the past. Self-esteem is improving and they seem to feel more able to use their voice.

      "bodyText": "In a world where you can get a sexual partner faster than a pizza delivery, it has never been easier to play the field. Yet, despite all that swiping right, a surprising number of people are not having sex at all \u2013 not for religious reasons, or because they can\u2019t get a date, but because they find that celibacy makes them happier. Some have never had much interest in sex, while others are taking a break to address personal problems, recover from bad dating experiences or change the way they approach relationships. Catherine Gray, the author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Single, gave up sex for a year in 2014. \u201cBetween the ages of 16 and 34, I hadn\u2019t spent more than a few months single,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt incomplete without a plus-one and constantly hunted approval. I reached rock-bottom after being disproportionately crushed by the failure of a six-month relationship, so I decided to give up sex and dating for an entire year.\u201d Although deleting her dating apps felt like \u201cgiving up a drug\u201d, celibacy turned out to be a huge relief. \u201cInstead of doing what my boyfriend wanted to, I discovered what I liked, developing a love for yoga, photography and travelling. I dressed differently and no longer cared about attracting men. I started to see myself as a person \u2013 rather than a girlfriend or a sexual plaything.\u201d The period of celibacy changed how she approached dating; she is now in a healthy relationship. \u201cI realised that I had an anxious attachment style and that, if I started dating again, I would need to change who and how I date. If I feel insecure in the early stages of a relationship, I know it\u2019s because I\u2019m dating someone who is emotionally unavailable, so I back away, rather than persist.\u201d The comedian Eleanor Conway used to tell people that her three vices were drink, drugs and men. \u201cI\u2019ve always had an addictive personality,\u201d she says. In 2014, she gave up the first two vices \u2013 \u201cand my alcoholic behaviour transferred to Tinder. It\u2019s so easy for a straight woman to date and find casual sex. It\u2019s really fun, if you\u2019re emotionally in the right place.\u201d (It\u2019s also great material if you are a comedian; it inspired her show You May Recognise Me from Tinder.) Over time, however, the \u201cadmin\u201d of looking for matches became too much. \u201cThe dates became a drag and any sex I had as a result was rubbish. The more sober I got, the more difficult it was to engage in casual dating. It was like my superpower stopped working.\u201d In 2018, she tried celibacy for 10 months. \u201cSurprisingly, it was a massive relief. I stopped seeing men as sex objects and females as competition.\u201d Conway found her platonic relationships with men and women improved and she was able to focus on her career. She is open to a sexual relationship now, but she knows it will happen only if she has a true connection with a person. Self-imposed celibacy seems more common among women, but men, too, can be damaged by casual encounters. Tom gave up sex 18 months ago, after he came out of an abusive relationship and joined Alcoholics Anonymous to address addiction. \u201cI was promiscuous when I was drinking,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I chose to become celibate to support my recovery.\u201d He soon realised he had been using casual sex to cover up his loneliness. Going celibate has given him the opportunity to address these emotions and improve the other relationships in his life. \u201cI go mountain biking, I help out at AA and I spend time with friends. I\u2019ve got more time for my family and it\u2019s made those bonds stronger.\u201d Although he admits he sometimes misses sex, he believes it is not worth jeopardising his newfound happiness. \u201cI will only have sex again if I know the relationship is right for me. I recently dated someone for several months and we never slept together. It was nice that we realised it wasn\u2019t right before complicating things with sex.\u201d Many people find that a short period of celibacy is enough, but others make it a way of life. Shirley Yanez gave up sex in 2005, after serious health problems led to a hysterectomy. She also experienced financial difficulties, which kicked off a period of self-reflection and a career change. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to have sex for a year after my operation. But I came to realise that I would rather focus my energy elsewhere in life,\u201d she says. \u201cThe best part of being celibate is there are no distractions. I can focus fully on my passion, my purpose and my work.\u201d In the past 15 years, she has set up a business to support British manufacturing; she also offers life-coaching services for homeless and young people. \u201cI teach young people about the positive mental health benefits of celibacy,\u201d she says. \u201cI never tell them what to do, but I talk to them about the importance of making their own decisions rather than being influenced by media or peer pressure.\u201d Yanez believes that celibacy among young people is on the rise, especially among girls. \u201cI think young women feel more empowered than ever to reject the sexual roles they\u2019ve felt pushed into in the past. Self-esteem is improving and they seem to feel more able to use their voice. They\u2019re fighting back at school, in the workplace and also on the dating scene.\u201d Yanez is not closed off to a sexual relationship in future, but it is not a priority. \u201cEven though I never seek sex or relationships, my lifestyle actually seems to make men more interested in me, as they see it as a challenge.\u201d She admits she is \u201clucky\u201d that she feels comfortable with her decision. Single people can feel like outsiders when they choose celibacy, but this feeling is often amplified for couples. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous pressure in our society to be sexually active and have great sex all the time, but not everyone has positive experiences or gets a lot out of it,\u201d says Ammanda Major, the head of clinical practice at the relationship charity Relate. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of \u2018shoulds\u2019 and \u2018oughts\u2019 when it comes to sex and people are quick to judge.\u201d Amy and her partner, Harry, haven\u2019t had sex for more than six of their seven years together. \u201cIt was never a big part of our relationship and after a few months he became stressed at work and didn\u2019t want it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was relieved, because I\u2019ve never enjoyed sex.\u201d Since then, the couple have been in an affectionate, celibate partnership. \u201cWe cuddle every night in front of the TV and in the mornings when we wake up.

Now, with Fitbit\u2019s data, a powerful tech company will also know our sleep cycles, exercise habits and heartbeats \u2013 in real time. For the billions of us who use Google products, the situation is getting unnerving.</p> <p>Technology\u2019s impact on our economic, political, even personal lives is so conspicuously outsized, so staggeringly unregulated, that even during the current political storm over Iran and impeachment it is clear: It is time for a digital bill of rights.</p> <p>How do we get there? We already have the hard part \u2013 the popular will. A <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/18/20870938/break-up-big-tech-google-facebook-amazon-poll\">recent poll</a> showed that two-thirds of Americans agree that big technology companies need to be regulated and, if necessary, broken up. Even policymakers agree: 47 out of 50 attorneys general in the United States are currently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/tech/facebook-antitrust-investigation/index.html\">investigating Facebook</a>, which harvests the data of at least 228 million Americans, for anti-trust violations.</p> <p>Big tech has been able to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/08/4-trillion-in-tech-spending-in-2019-heres-where-the-money-is-going.html\">extract a $4t</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/08/4-trillion-in-tech-spending-in-2019-heres-where-the-money-is-going.html\">n industry</a> from our personal data by designing systems that direct the flow of data and profit away from us and toward the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the history of the world. These companies may brand themselves as politically neutral, but most are in close relationships with the US government, whether via contracts with the military or Ice, in allowing government surveillance programs to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/technology/tech-companies-bristling-concede-to-government-surveillance-efforts.html?pagewanted=1&amp;hp\">access their users\u2019 data</a>, or in serving as one of the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/09/google-is-techs-top-spender-on-lobbying-but-facebook-amazon-also-up.html\">biggest lobbyist forces in Washington</a>.</p> <p>How did these companies become so powerful? By monitoring us, all the while leaving us in the dark about how or when this surveillance takes place, how invasive it really is, and how the data it gathers is used. Yes, Amazon, Google and Facebook have provided services that many of us find to be efficient, useful and enjoyable. But <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-is-still-tracking-you-after-you-deactivate-your-account/\">they are watching us</a> even after we choose to close our accounts and stop using their services <strong>\u2013 </strong>and sometimes even if we\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/facebook-tracking-you-even-if-you-dont-have-account-888699\">never created an account</a> with them at all.</p> <p>Apple, <a href=\"https://time.com/5433499/tim-cook-apple-data-privacy/\">despite branding itself as a pro-privacy company</a>, recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/apple-apologises-listen-siri-recordings\">admitted</a> that it systematically recorded and monitored Siri conversations, just like its competitors, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/11/tech/amazon-alexa-listening/index.html\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/google-is-absolutely-listening-to-your-conversations-it-just-confirms-why-people-dont-trust-big-tech.html\">Google</a>, do with their virtual assistants. The recordings included \u201caccidental\u201d activations of the software, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings\">captured conversations</a> between doctors and their patients, drug deals and sexual encounters. Apple also has the fingerprints and retina scans of millions, data amassed via the \u201cconveniences\u201d offered by iPhones. We\u2019d all like to believe that these biomarkers are used only to secure our phones but, currently, we don\u2019t have a right to know if it this is the whole story or not.</p> <p>While tech companies like to organize their stories about themselves around inventors, designers and \u201cideas men\u201d like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, we should remember that their platforms and services are built upon the data we contribute and a resource we all paid for: the internet itself. The internet was originally funded by US taxpayers. We made the internet possible, so why are we the ones bearing all the painful costs? Just as Big Pharma has monetized publicly-funded science research for its own private benefit, big tech rakes in billions of dollars by a tried and true model that we see with multinational corporations: privatize the profits while socializing the costs.</p> <p>Consider the elections of recent years. Using data brokers, tech companies buy and sell the data they have collected about us to businesses, governments and shady third parties \u2013 like Cambridge Analytica or the Russian government \u2013 who can then create tailor-made programs of manipulation based on AI-fueled psychological predictions of who you are and how you think. This manipulation can target your political behavior, your consumer behavior or any other kind of behavior \u2013 and you may never have a clue what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t the job of private companies to weigh the costs to our democracy of polarizing voters, or of trapping their attention in online labyrinths of misinformation and conspiracy. By definition, they only serve themselves. But this is precisely why the digital bill of rights must start by demanding that tech companies give us reasonable levers of control and oversight.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s telling that, at a time when disunity supposedly defines the American political landscape, there\u2019s at least one issue the vast majority of Americans agree on: the need to bring some balance back to our digital lives. Google, which recently acquired Fitbit, has created an $850bn business out of our likes, dislikes, photos, tastes, locations, purchases and midnight wonderings. Now, with Fitbit\u2019s data, a powerful tech company will also know our sleep cycles, exercise habits and heartbeats \u2013 in real time. For the billions of us who use Google products, the situation is getting unnerving. Technology\u2019s impact on our economic, political, even personal lives is so conspicuously outsized, so staggeringly unregulated, that even during the current political storm over Iran and impeachment it is clear: It is time for a digital bill of rights. How do we get there? We already have the hard part \u2013 the popular will. A recent poll showed that two-thirds of Americans agree that big technology companies need to be regulated and, if necessary, broken up. Even policymakers agree: 47 out of 50 attorneys general in the United States are currently investigating Facebook, which harvests the data of at least 228 million Americans, for anti-trust violations. Big tech has been able to extract a $4tn industry from our personal data by designing systems that direct the flow of data and profit away from us and toward the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the history of the world. These companies may brand themselves as politically neutral, but most are in close relationships with the US government, whether via contracts with the military or Ice, in allowing government surveillance programs to access their users\u2019 data, or in serving as one of the biggest lobbyist forces in Washington. How did these companies become so powerful? By monitoring us, all the while leaving us in the dark about how or when this surveillance takes place, how invasive it really is, and how the data it gathers is used. Yes, Amazon, Google and Facebook have provided services that many of us find to be efficient, useful and enjoyable. But they are watching us even after we choose to close our accounts and stop using their services \u2013 and sometimes even if we\u2019ve never created an account with them at all. Apple, despite branding itself as a pro-privacy company, recently admitted that it systematically recorded and monitored Siri conversations, just like its competitors, Amazon and Google, do with their virtual assistants. The recordings included \u201caccidental\u201d activations of the software, which captured conversations between doctors and their patients, drug deals and sexual encounters. Apple also has the fingerprints and retina scans of millions, data amassed via the \u201cconveniences\u201d offered by iPhones. We\u2019d all like to believe that these biomarkers are used only to secure our phones but, currently, we don\u2019t have a right to know if it this is the whole story or not. While tech companies like to organize their stories about themselves around inventors, designers and \u201cideas men\u201d like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, we should remember that their platforms and services are built upon the data we contribute and a resource we all paid for: the internet itself. The internet was originally funded by US taxpayers. We made the internet possible, so why are we the ones bearing all the painful costs? Just as Big Pharma has monetized publicly-funded science research for its own private benefit, big tech rakes in billions of dollars by a tried and true model that we see with multinational corporations: privatize the profits while socializing the costs. Consider the elections of recent years. Using data brokers, tech companies buy and sell the data they have collected about us to businesses, governments and shady third parties \u2013 like Cambridge Analytica or the Russian government \u2013 who can then create tailor-made programs of manipulation based on AI-fueled psychological predictions of who you are and how you think. This manipulation can target your political behavior, your consumer behavior or any other kind of behavior \u2013 and you may never have a clue what\u2019s happening. It isn\u2019t the job of private companies to weigh the costs to our democracy of polarizing voters, or of trapping their attention in online labyrinths of misinformation and conspiracy. By definition, they only serve themselves. But this is precisely why the digital bill of rights must start by demanding that tech companies give us reasonable levers of control and oversight. Journalists and public oversight committees need the power to help design these technologies, and the right to continuously audit them. Right now, we are the product being sold online; corporations fill their coffers based on their ability to monitor and manipulate us, all without paying us a cent. We can do way better with just a little imagination and resolve. Consider how innovations in tech can benefit us all if the Ubers or Airbnbs of tomorrow were at least partially owned by their workers and drivers, as 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has called for in his corporate accountability plans. Perhaps worst of all, if we don\u2019t intervene now the biases and profound inequalities of our world today will become invisibly \u201cbaked in\u201d to the technologies that define the future, skewing the technologization of our world to discriminate against people who are already racially, sexually, geographically and economically marginalized. For example, courtrooms across the nation already use a system called Compas, which is supposed to determine algorithmically how likely a person is to commit a crime in the future. In one memorable case, reported by ProPublica, the system concluded that an underage black girl who had ridden, and then abandoned, a scooter left on the street was more likely to commit a future crime than a white man convicted of felony armed robbery. This kind of algorithmic discrimination is unsurprising given the differences between those who build technology (white and Asian males) and those influenced by it (everyone). Imagine, though, if a digital bill of rights gave users, workers and local communities power over this process. What would the world look like if Black Lives Matter had a hand in designing and implementing the software used in policing or courtroom sentencing? The same applies to data collection. What if, as we navigated around the web, typing into the privately owned search boxes of Amazon and Google, we could opt out of being monitored? Or opt in, and be paid on the spot for the data our search provided? What if we were actually told what these corporations know about us, in full? \u201cGeniuses\u201d in Silicon Valley have technologized the relationships between us and our transportation, our loved ones, work, news and hobbies. But our data \u2013 squeezed out of everything about us that is human, creative and full of life \u2013 can\u2019t be created in a lab. It is ours. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time for a digital bill of rights - a \u2018new deal for data\u2019 that can restore balance to the tech world and ensure that our data work for us all, based on values we agree on.

      "bodyText": "Chinese companies are working overtime to produce protective face masks amid soaring demand caused by the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Five of the 12 main mask-producing companies based in Guangdong province have resumed production after pausing for the lunar new year holiday, the business publication First Financial reported on Tuesday. Guangdong has implemented a province-wide order for everyone to wear masks in public places or face unspecified fines. Videos have circulated of unmasked metro riders being ejected forcibly by security staff. Search stats on Baidu, China\u2019s main search engine, revealed there had been 2m queries for the term \u201cnot wearing masks can get you fined\u201d as of Tuesday morning. On Monday, footage emerged showing a scramble for masks at the gate of a factory in Jiujiang in Jiangxi province. Of more concern is the ability to get masks and other medical supplies to hospitals and medical staff in quarantined areas of Hubei, the province where the outbreak began. A report from People\u2019s Daily on Monday indicated that masks were in short supply at Wuhan\u2019s No 7 hospital. Patrick Brogan, a Briton who has been in Wuhan since 10 January and is now stuck, said there were shortages of masks there but that his girlfriend\u2019s father was able to pick up a box before supplies dwindled. \u201cWe are using scuba goggles if and when we have to go out again, it\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d the 30-year-old from Reading said. Meimei, from Shenzhen, who did not want her full name used, said she had been trying to order masks from the US through online shops such as Amazon to distribute to people across China, but supplies are running short there too. \u201cIt is difficult because California is having a very severe flu season,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard that many others are asking friends abroad to buy masks but it is very difficult.\u201d Meimei said she had heard supplies to Wuhan were improving but that other areas of Hubei were short. Shenzhen Airlines dispatched a flight to Wuhan with about 100 medical personnel and 10 tons of medical gear on Tuesday, according to Meimei, who is friends with one of the cabin crew on the flight. Demand for face masks and hand sanitising liquid has soared across the region. Stocks of masks ran out quickly at outlets of South Korea\u2019s biggest 24-hour convenience store, CU, at airports, bus terminals and other transportation hubs. In Taiwan, the government said there were enough masks and that daily production capacity of 1.88 face masks could be boosted to 2.44m to meet any spike in demand. Everyday use of surgical masks, once mainly confined to Japan and parts of China affected by major dust storms or smog, has expanded in recent years, mainly because of worsening air pollution. In the Philippines, which has reported no cases of the virus, the recent eruptions of the Taal volcano have prompted many to wear masks to protect against ash. The Australian government has told doctors and staff at GP surgeries to wear face masks when seeing patients who may be carrying the virus, and said it was prepared to use a national stockpile to make sure there are enough to go around. Jin Wei, a Chinese student studying in Melbourne, told the Guardian he and several of his friends had bought masks to send home to family in China. \u201cIt is still possible to buy the masks online, but many of the outlets in China are running out of stock,\u201d he said. Wing Kuang, a Melbourne University student from China, said many pharmacies in the city had run out of masks when she tried to purchase some last week. Despite all the concern about masks, Dr Maia Majumder, a faculty member at Harvard Medical School who has studied Sars and Mers outbreaks, has said mask use is not as important as many people are making it out to be, particularly for most healthy people. \u201cFor healthy folks who are around other healthy folks, the first line of defence remains hand-washing with soap, coughing into the crook of one\u2019s arm instead of your hands, and avoiding contact with mucus membranes [of the mouth, nose, or eyes],\u201d Majumder said. \u201cSurgical masks, however, are wise to wear for those who\u2019re exhibiting respiratory symptoms or those who live with people who do.\u201d Additional reporting by Else Kennedy in Melbourne",

For \u20ac2, it\u2019s a total steal, and can be found all over the island in the traditional pastizzerias \u2013 two of our favourites are Premier Pastizzeria in Mosta, and Sphinx Pastizzeria in \u017burrieq.\u201d It\u2019s possible to visit local producers here, too, such as beekeeper Arnold Grech, who\u2019s been keeping bees to produce honey for more than 65 years, or cheesemakers such as Ta\u2019Rikardu on Gozo. You can visit the eerily beautiful salt farms on the Gozitan coast, where dried salt piles up like snow drifts. Malta has a tradition of excellence in winemaking, little known outside the islands. Visit boutique wineries such as Ta\u2019Mena or the San Niklaw Estate, where you can taste the fruity, full-bodied local wines. The islands\u2019 biggest winemakers, Marsovin and Emmanuel Delicata, hold summer wine-tasting festivals in Valletta\u2019s Hastings Gardens and Upper Barrakka Gardens respectively, with astounding views of the Grand Harbour to drink in as you try the wines. Valletta has lots of chic restaurants in historic townhouses, such as the innovative, French-influenced Guze Bistro, as well as options with stupendous sea views, such as the Harbour Club. Ed Lansink, also of Malta Uncovered, says his favourite restaurant right now is Hammett\u2019s Ma\u010bina, across the harbour from Valletta, in Senglea. \u201cThey consistently serve excellent dishes with finesse, combining a blend of local and wider Mediterranean flavours with locally sourced, seasonal ingredients, and the setting is unique: an age-old building that dates back to the Knights of St John.\u201d Seaside towns St Julian\u2019s, Sliema and Mellieha are also great for eating out and drinking, with seafood specialists such as Barracuda, which occupies a grand 18th-century villa and has tables at the water\u2019s edge. Malta\u2019s smaller sister island, Gozo, is renowned for its restaurants, with some highlights including Ta\u2019Philip (St Anthony Street), with local produce and traditional Gozitan dishes, such as rabbit and suckling pig. Marsaxlokk is another key destination on the Maltese culinary map. Businessman and creative Aldo Gatt, who\u2019s better known as Gattaldo, from Valletta, enthuses: \u201cOn sunny summer days, I love nothing better than to head to the busy fishermen\u2019s market in Marsaxlokk with family and friends to eat a simple meal of freshly caught fish \u2013 some of the restaurateurs are fishermen by trade and offer great no-frills meals right by the bobbing fishing boats.\u201d With a diet rich in fresh seafood and fish, local herbs and vegetables, and the local delicacy of rabbit, Malta has long been the unsung cuisine of the Mediterranean kitchen. Book a trip now: you\u2019ll experience superb cooking in beautiful settings, and explore a culinary culture that resonates with centuries\u2019 worth of influences and the joy of food. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta offers more to explore",

      "bodyText": "Former ministers have sounded their final warnings to Boris Johnson about the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei ahead of his expected decision on whether it will play a part in the UK\u2019s 5G network. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the national security council (NSC) later on Tuesday before making a judgment on the firm\u2019s future in the country after months of concern around security, including from the US president, Donald Trump. A number of former senior government figures and MPs voiced concerns just hours before the meeting, urging that if Huawei is involved in rolling out the 5G infrastructure then it should be time-limited and the US and UK must come together to work out their own 5G technology. The former defence minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky News: \u201cIf we are going to introduce Huawei into 5G I would put a time bar on it. I would cap their involvement. I would scrutinise it very carefully.\u201d He pressed the need for the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence alliance, which is made up of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US, to develop their own infrastructure for faster connectivity so as not to rely on the currently more advanced and cheaper Chinese technology. \u201cLet\u2019s get together and create a 5G so that in a couple of years\u2019 time we can move to our own system,\u201d he said. The state ownership of Huawei raises serious questions about its links to other parts of the Chinese government, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the connections between Huawei and the Chinese army, we don\u2019t know the connections between Huawei and its own intelligence communities.

A 5G network would ensure better video streaming, download speeds and a faster service. However, Bob Seely MP, who is standing to be chair of the Commons\u2019 foreign affairs select committee, said the cost of introducing Huawei for 5G was too high for the government. The Conservative former army captain told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday: \u201cThe danger is that you allow China leverage into your system, into your critical national infrastructure if you allow Huawei in. \u201cChina is building a surveillance state, the kind of which the world has not seen, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve thought through what that means for the next century in terms of human freedom and data privacy.\u201d Jeremy Wright, a former culture secretary, also wants the government to put limits on Huawei, should it decide to use the company, by capping its market share to allow other suppliers into the network. On US warnings that any use of Huawei in 5G could jeopardise future intelligence sharing, Wright said it was a concern but said the assessment of British intelligence officials was highly respected globally. He told Talk Radio he did not believe the close cooperation between the two countries would unravel over one judgment. \u201cWe should take very seriously what our allies say \u2026 respective intelligence agencies, British and American, over decades. I don\u2019t believe that will fall apart over one decision,\u201d he said.

The 8,000-hectare blaze has been downgraded to \u201cwatch and act\u201d level following moderate weather conditions overnight, and no properties were under threat on Wednesday morning. But predicted Canberra temperatures in the high-30s for the rest of the week and over 40C on the weekend are set to worsen fire conditions. The blaze was started in the Namadgi national park, a rugged mountainous area to Canberra\u2019s south, by an Australian Defence Force helicopter carrying a landing light, the heat from which sparked the blaze in hot and dry conditions. Late on Tuesday afternoon, residents of Tharwa, a village of about 80 people to Canberra\u2019s south, were told it was too late to leave and they should seek shelter as the fire front approached. The fire was running out-of-control, burning north and north-east, with embers lighting spot fires up to five kilometres ahead of the main front. Fire authorities said it was erratic, and was large and intense enough to create its own weather pattern. The ACT emergency services agency said it expected spot fires to start with one kilometre of homes in Canberra\u2019s most southerly suburbs, Banks, Calwell, Gordon, and Conder. On Tuesday evening, flames were visible from southern Canberra backyards. Thick plumes of smoke were visible all over the city. The ACT\u2019s chief minister, Andrew Barr, warned the fires were the most serious fire threat to the ACT since the 2003 bushfires, which killed four people and destroyed 470 homes. Evacuation centres have been opened across Canberra for people displaced by the fires. Fire conditions worsen in NSW and Victoria More fires could flare again across New South Wales and Victoria with an extreme heatwave expected for parts of both states on Friday, while a slow-moving low pressure system is pushing torrential rain across Queensland. In NSW \u201cit looks like fire danger is ramping up as we head into the weekend and Saturday will be the peak day\u201d, according to the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s David Wilke. Friday would be the peak day in Victoria, bringing high humidity, hotter conditions and winds picking up, senior forecaster Richard Carlyon said. Temperatures were expected to increase from Wednesday in NSW, rising to the low 40s on the south coast on Saturday and 41C to 43C in the Australian Capital Territory. Western Sydney could experience temperatures of up to 45C. In Victoria, temperatures are expected to reach 44C to 45C across the north of the state on Friday. The fire risk in NSW is predicted to escalate from Friday, with the south coast, southeast regions and ACT likely the worst affected, and northern NSW also experiencing bushfire danger through to Sunday, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. The NSW Rural Fire Service says warm, dry and windy weather has led to a total fire ban being issued for the southern ranges on Tuesday. There\u2019s also very high fire danger in the central and southeast regions of NSW. NSW residents were encouraged to prepare for tough conditions this weekend. A cold front is expected to move through NSW on Monday or Tuesday next week, bringing the extreme temperatures back down. Storms are expected on Friday afternoon across western Victoria, bringing much needed rain to the region, but the rainfall is unlikely to be widespread in the east. Wind gusts and torrential rain sweeps north Queensland However, North Queensland communities are braced for more heavy rain after more than half a metre fell in some places in just over 24 hours since Monday. Water levels rose quickly in the town of Ayr, just south of Townsville, after an extraordinary deluge dumped 458mm, starting at 9am Monday. Burdekin mayor Lyn McLaughlin said the Bruce Highway was cut between Ayr and Home Hill, on the southern side of the Burdekin River. Roads in Ayr itself were also closed with only emergency vehicles allowed to pass. \u201cWe\u2019re not letting any trucks through \u2026 because the bow waves from moving traffic is pushing water towards businesses and houses,\u201d McLaughlin told the ABC. Rita Island, just south of Ayr, has had even more rain \u2013 615mm since 9am on Monday. The deluge is being driven by a slow moving tropical low sitting over the waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which is also bringing wild weather to that region. Winds gusting to 90km/h and more torrential rain is expected on Tuesday and into Wednesday, with flash flooding possible at Burketown, Normanton, Croydon, Kowanyama, Mount Isa, Cloncurry, Julia Creek, Georgetown, and Richmond. There\u2019s been significant rain at Winton, in the state\u2019s parched central west. Residents are hoping for follow up rain that will make a real difference to graziers. \u201cIf we can get some more in another month or so, that\u2019ll just really set people up for the next six months,\u201d the mayor of Winton, Gavin Baskett, said on Tuesday. In Townsville, State Emergency Service crews have been called in to prevent flood damage. The mayor of Townsville, Jenny Hill, said so far there were no concerns the low pressure system would cause a repeat of the devastating floods of February last year, which caused more than $1bn of damage. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s acting like a typical wet season where we see downpours with significant breaks in between,\u201d she told AAP. \u201cLast year we didn\u2019t have those breaks, it just kept raining and raining and raining. So far it\u2019s pretty much been business as usual.\u201d Flood warnings of various levels have been issued for rivers throughout the state\u2019s interior. Isolated heavy falls in catchments upstream have flooded the Paroo River in the state\u2019s southwest, with bridges cut at Eulo. The river is expected to reach a moderate flood level by mid-week. Paroo shire council deputy mayor Suzette Beresford said the rain was very welcome after six years of drought. \u201cIt\u2019s been patchy, with some properties receiving a bit more than others,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as it keeps coming.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As the first month of 2020 draws to a close, two things hang in the balance. One is the fate of the whole of humanity; the other is the fate of one rather damaged cartoon horse. On the surface, glossy sitcom The Good Place and acerbic animation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/24/how-bojack-horseman-became-a-surprise-heartbreaking-hit\">BoJack Horseman</a> do not have much in common. But with their final episodes dropping this week, the bracket of \u201ccerebral TV comedy\u201d is losing two shows that have uprooted expectations and shrewdly asked questions of what it means both to be good and to be happy.</p> <p>Neither show is an easy sell: one a high-concept comedy about moral philosophy set in the afterlife; the other an anthropomorphic satire of celebrity culture centred on a Hollywood has-been horse reckoning with his own unhappiness. But both became critical and word-of-mouth successes, providing escapism, wit and warmth, not to mention an unexpected penchant for puns, from The Good Place eateries such as Sushi and the Banshees to BoJack\u2019s endless riffs on celebrities, like Quentin Tarantulino and Cindy Crawfish.</p> <p>There were other similarities, too: both shows feature self-destructive protagonists \u2013 BoJack, voiced by Will Arnett, and Kristen Bell\u2019s self-obsessed \u201cArizona dirtbag\u201d Eleanor Shellstrop \u2013 who begin to recognise the error of their ways and attempt to forge meaningful relationships that, until then, had eluded them. Their momentum is towards betterment, overtly so in The Good Place and far more complicatedly in BoJack, and in direct opposition to most TV comedy they deal in consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1981ba4c1b480ace88d1fb7ca26a33407b9c86f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1981ba4c1b480ace88d1fb7ca26a33407b9c86f0/99_7_1763_1058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BoJack Horseman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Why the long face?... BoJack Horseman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As each examined what it means to be a good person, The Good Place wrote its ethical lessons on a blackboard while BoJack used animation as a lens through which to make its points, directly naming men implicated by real-world scandals, as the show tackled its own corresponding #MeToo storyline. BoJack has eased us into the end, splitting its final season in two, as we await the fate of the washed-up, egotistical figure at its heart. We care because the show has so painfully explored BoJack\u2019s heartbreaking inner monologue and depression, without letting his terrible behaviour off the hook. It has repeatedly been praised for showing tough subject matter unprecedented empathy, allowing entire episodes to plunge into the mind of BoJack\u2019s dementia-suffering mother, or giving him a 22-minute monologue at her funeral.</p> <p>The Good Place has similarly pushed boundaries. By definition, situation comedies are usually anchored by one solid premise, with the comedy generated by familiarity with the characters. The Good Place is not only set in a limitless afterlife but is primarily driven by its characters\u2019 growth. It promised cute but delivered conceptual, and can certainly be credited with reclaiming the plot twist from soapland. Although later seasons have somewhat failed to live up to the ingenuity of the first two (partly due to baggier storytelling, splitting up core characters and some unforgivable Australian accents), it has maintained its element of surprise, with a recent episode featuring D\u2019Arcy Carden playing multiple versions of her character, Janet, necessitating the kind of visual effects a half-hour comedy would not normally attempt.</p> <p>In the golden age of TV, each has given us standout episodes. For BoJack, it was Fish Out of Water, set underwater and without dialogue. An exquisite, blisteringly sad silent film of an episode, it epitomised the show\u2019s inventiveness. For The Good Place it was the first season finale, when the already lofty premise was ripped up and, with it, the blueprint for modern sitcoms.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMKCQJugf3A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CMKCQJugf3A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>These were two shows designed for the streaming age, with a level of visual detail made for pausing, screen-grabbing and sharing. And at a time when TV audiences were being emotionally battered by the bleak and the bloody \u2013 Black Mirror, Game of Thrones, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2013 they offered something different. BoJack was part of a raft of series, including Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, You\u2019re the Worst and Fleabag, that were broadly comedic but dealt unflinchingly with mental health. Once audiences saw past the Hollywood parodies, it went from kooky animation to a prestige sadcom that resonated deeply with viewers. Meanwhile, The Good Place widened the scope of comedic storytelling with its ambitious concept and approach to reinvention. You can feel its DNA in the likes of Forever and Russian Doll, shows that also probed the question of what happens when we die.</p> <p>With the finish line in sight, the world-building that underwrites BoJack and The Good Place has evolved, and they have set a new bar, both for what is possible in short-form comedy and for how many sight gags can be crammed into half an hour. These characters have shown us that they \u2013 and therefore we \u2013 are capable of change and even redemption. Whether or not they will make it, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.</p> <p><em>The Good Place and BoJack Horseman are on Netflix now</em></p>",

On the surface, glossy sitcom The Good Place and acerbic animation BoJack Horseman do not have much in common. But with their final episodes dropping this week, the bracket of \u201ccerebral TV comedy\u201d is losing two shows that have uprooted expectations and shrewdly asked questions of what it means both to be good and to be happy. Neither show is an easy sell: one a high-concept comedy about moral philosophy set in the afterlife; the other an anthropomorphic satire of celebrity culture centred on a Hollywood has-been horse reckoning with his own unhappiness. But both became critical and word-of-mouth successes, providing escapism, wit and warmth, not to mention an unexpected penchant for puns, from The Good Place eateries such as Sushi and the Banshees to BoJack\u2019s endless riffs on celebrities, like Quentin Tarantulino and Cindy Crawfish. There were other similarities, too: both shows feature self-destructive protagonists \u2013 BoJack, voiced by Will Arnett, and Kristen Bell\u2019s self-obsessed \u201cArizona dirtbag\u201d Eleanor Shellstrop \u2013 who begin to recognise the error of their ways and attempt to forge meaningful relationships that, until then, had eluded them. Their momentum is towards betterment, overtly so in The Good Place and far more complicatedly in BoJack, and in direct opposition to most TV comedy they deal in consequences. As each examined what it means to be a good person, The Good Place wrote its ethical lessons on a blackboard while BoJack used animation as a lens through which to make its points, directly naming men implicated by real-world scandals, as the show tackled its own corresponding #MeToo storyline. BoJack has eased us into the end, splitting its final season in two, as we await the fate of the washed-up, egotistical figure at its heart. We care because the show has so painfully explored BoJack\u2019s heartbreaking inner monologue and depression, without letting his terrible behaviour off the hook. It has repeatedly been praised for showing tough subject matter unprecedented empathy, allowing entire episodes to plunge into the mind of BoJack\u2019s dementia-suffering mother, or giving him a 22-minute monologue at her funeral. The Good Place has similarly pushed boundaries. By definition, situation comedies are usually anchored by one solid premise, with the comedy generated by familiarity with the characters. The Good Place is not only set in a limitless afterlife but is primarily driven by its characters\u2019 growth. It promised cute but delivered conceptual, and can certainly be credited with reclaiming the plot twist from soapland. Although later seasons have somewhat failed to live up to the ingenuity of the first two (partly due to baggier storytelling, splitting up core characters and some unforgivable Australian accents), it has maintained its element of surprise, with a recent episode featuring D\u2019Arcy Carden playing multiple versions of her character, Janet, necessitating the kind of visual effects a half-hour comedy would not normally attempt. In the golden age of TV, each has given us standout episodes. For BoJack, it was Fish Out of Water, set underwater and without dialogue. An exquisite, blisteringly sad silent film of an episode, it epitomised the show\u2019s inventiveness. For The Good Place it was the first season finale, when the already lofty premise was ripped up and, with it, the blueprint for modern sitcoms. These were two shows designed for the streaming age, with a level of visual detail made for pausing, screen-grabbing and sharing. And at a time when TV audiences were being emotionally battered by the bleak and the bloody \u2013 Black Mirror, Game of Thrones, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2013 they offered something different. BoJack was part of a raft of series, including Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, You\u2019re the Worst and Fleabag, that were broadly comedic but dealt unflinchingly with mental health. Once audiences saw past the Hollywood parodies, it went from kooky animation to a prestige sadcom that resonated deeply with viewers. Meanwhile, The Good Place widened the scope of comedic storytelling with its ambitious concept and approach to reinvention. You can feel its DNA in the likes of Forever and Russian Doll, shows that also probed the question of what happens when we die. With the finish line in sight, the world-building that underwrites BoJack and The Good Place has evolved, and they have set a new bar, both for what is possible in short-form comedy and for how many sight gags can be crammed into half an hour. These characters have shown us that they \u2013 and therefore we \u2013 are capable of change and even redemption. Whether or not they will make it, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. The Good Place and BoJack Horseman are on Netflix now",

      "body": "<p>Since she began posting rustic-chic videos of her life in rural Sichuan province in 2016, Li Ziqi, 29, has become one of China\u2019s biggest social media stars. She has 22 million followers on the microblogging site Weibo, 34 million on Douyin (China\u2019s version of TikTok) and another 8.3 million on YouTube (Li has been active on YouTube for the last two years, despite it being officially blocked in China).</p> <p>Li\u2019s videos \u2013 which she initially produced by herself and now makes with a small team \u2013 emphasize beautiful countryside and ancient tradition. In videos soundtracked by tranquil flute music, Li crafts her own furniture out of bamboo and dyes her clothing with fruit skins. If she wants soy sauce, she grows the soybeans themselves; a video about making an egg yolk dish starts with her hatching ducklings. The meals she creates are often elaborate demonstrations of how many delicious things can be done with a particular seasonal ingredient, like ginger or green plums.</p> <p>There is even a Li Ziqi online shop, where fans can purchase versions of the steel \u201cchopper\u201d knife she uses to dice the vegetables she plucks from her plentiful garden, or replicas of the old-fashioned shirts she wears while foraging for wild mushrooms and magnolia blossoms in the misty mountainside.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtzypSUY5Bc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TtzypSUY5Bc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While she occasionally reveals a behind-the-scenes peek at her process, Li \u2013 who did not respond to interview requests for this article \u2013 is very private. By all accounts, she struggled to find steady work in a city before returning to the countryside to care for her ailing grandmother (who appears in her videos).</p> <p>Recently, Li has been thrust into a wider spotlight by the Chinese government, who seem to have realized her soft power potential. In 2018, the Communist party of China named her a \u201cgood young netizen\u201d and role model for Chinese youth. In September 2019, the People\u2019s Daily, a CPC mouthpiece, gave Li their \u201cPeople\u2019s Choice\u201d award, while last month, state media praised Li for helping to promote traditional culture globally, and the Communist Youth League named her an ambassador of a program promoting the economic empowerment of rural youth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing\">Revealed: how TikTok censors videos that do not please Beijing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the government increasingly champions her, Chinese citizens have taken to Weibo to question whether Li\u2019s polished, rather one-dimensional portrayal of farm work conveys anything truly meaningful about contemporary China \u2013 especially to her growing international audience on YouTube.</p> <p>They have a point: Li\u2019s videos reveal as much about the day-to-day labor of most Chinese farmers as the Martha Stewart Show does the American working class. As Li Bochun, director of Beijing-based Chinese Culture Rejuvenation Research Institute told the media last month: \u201cThe traditional lifestyle Li Ziqi presents in her videos is \u2026 not widely followed.\u201d</p> <p>In reality, many of China\u2019s rural villages have shrunk or disappeared completely in past decades as the nation prioritized urbanization and workers migrated to cities, with research suggesting the country lost 245 rural villages a day from 2000 to 2010. The 40% of China\u2019s population still living in rural areas encompass a huge diversity of experience, yet life can be difficult, with per-capita rural income declining sharply since 2014 and environmental pollution often as rife as in industrial centers. That\u2019s not to say the beautiful forests and compelling traditions of Li\u2019s videos are not genuine \u2013 like many social media creators, she simply focuses on the most charming elements of a bigger picture.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1MLIw6mP2k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d1MLIw6mP2k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>So what do Li\u2019s videos reflect about modern China, if not average daily life in the countryside?</p> <p>For one, they say something about the mindset of her mainland audience \u2013 primarily urban millennials, for whom a traditional culture craze known as \u201c<em>fugu</em>\u201d or \u201c<em>hanfu</em>\u201d has been an aesthetic trend for a number of years.</p> <p>\u201cFugu\u201d, according to Yang Chunmei, professor of Chinese history and philosophy at Qufu Normal University, reflects the \u201cromanticized, pastoral\u201d desires of youth \u201cdisillusioned by today\u2019s ever-changing, industrial, consumerist society.\u201d In practice, it looks like young people integrating more traditional clothing into their daily looks, watching historical dramas and following rural lifestyle influencers like Li. (While Li is an extremely popular example of the trend, she\u2019s not the only young farmer vlogging in China right now, and outdoor cooking videos of people making meals with wild ingredients and scant equipment are a genre of their own on Douyin.)</p> <p>Among urban millennials in the west, giving up the nine-to-five grind and living humbly and closer to nature is a popular dream.

      "bodyText": "Since she began posting rustic-chic videos of her life in rural Sichuan province in 2016, Li Ziqi, 29, has become one of China\u2019s biggest social media stars. She has 22 million followers on the microblogging site Weibo, 34 million on Douyin (China\u2019s version of TikTok) and another 8.3 million on YouTube (Li has been active on YouTube for the last two years, despite it being officially blocked in China). Li\u2019s videos \u2013 which she initially produced by herself and now makes with a small team \u2013 emphasize beautiful countryside and ancient tradition. In videos soundtracked by tranquil flute music, Li crafts her own furniture out of bamboo and dyes her clothing with fruit skins. If she wants soy sauce, she grows the soybeans themselves; a video about making an egg yolk dish starts with her hatching ducklings. The meals she creates are often elaborate demonstrations of how many delicious things can be done with a particular seasonal ingredient, like ginger or green plums. There is even a Li Ziqi online shop, where fans can purchase versions of the steel \u201cchopper\u201d knife she uses to dice the vegetables she plucks from her plentiful garden, or replicas of the old-fashioned shirts she wears while foraging for wild mushrooms and magnolia blossoms in the misty mountainside. While she occasionally reveals a behind-the-scenes peek at her process, Li \u2013 who did not respond to interview requests for this article \u2013 is very private. By all accounts, she struggled to find steady work in a city before returning to the countryside to care for her ailing grandmother (who appears in her videos). Recently, Li has been thrust into a wider spotlight by the Chinese government, who seem to have realized her soft power potential. In 2018, the Communist party of China named her a \u201cgood young netizen\u201d and role model for Chinese youth. In September 2019, the People\u2019s Daily, a CPC mouthpiece, gave Li their \u201cPeople\u2019s Choice\u201d award, while last month, state media praised Li for helping to promote traditional culture globally, and the Communist Youth League named her an ambassador of a program promoting the economic empowerment of rural youth. As the government increasingly champions her, Chinese citizens have taken to Weibo to question whether Li\u2019s polished, rather one-dimensional portrayal of farm work conveys anything truly meaningful about contemporary China \u2013 especially to her growing international audience on YouTube. They have a point: Li\u2019s videos reveal as much about the day-to-day labor of most Chinese farmers as the Martha Stewart Show does the American working class. As Li Bochun, director of Beijing-based Chinese Culture Rejuvenation Research Institute told the media last month: \u201cThe traditional lifestyle Li Ziqi presents in her videos is \u2026 not widely followed.\u201d In reality, many of China\u2019s rural villages have shrunk or disappeared completely in past decades as the nation prioritized urbanization and workers migrated to cities, with research suggesting the country lost 245 rural villages a day from 2000 to 2010. The 40% of China\u2019s population still living in rural areas encompass a huge diversity of experience, yet life can be difficult, with per-capita rural income declining sharply since 2014 and environmental pollution often as rife as in industrial centers. That\u2019s not to say the beautiful forests and compelling traditions of Li\u2019s videos are not genuine \u2013 like many social media creators, she simply focuses on the most charming elements of a bigger picture. So what do Li\u2019s videos reflect about modern China, if not average daily life in the countryside? For one, they say something about the mindset of her mainland audience \u2013 primarily urban millennials, for whom a traditional culture craze known as \u201cfugu\u201d or \u201chanfu\u201d has been an aesthetic trend for a number of years. \u201cFugu\u201d, according to Yang Chunmei, professor of Chinese history and philosophy at Qufu Normal University, reflects the \u201cromanticized, pastoral\u201d desires of youth \u201cdisillusioned by today\u2019s ever-changing, industrial, consumerist society.\u201d In practice, it looks like young people integrating more traditional clothing into their daily looks, watching historical dramas and following rural lifestyle influencers like Li. (While Li is an extremely popular example of the trend, she\u2019s not the only young farmer vlogging in China right now, and outdoor cooking videos of people making meals with wild ingredients and scant equipment are a genre of their own on Douyin.) Among urban millennials in the west, giving up the nine-to-five grind and living humbly and closer to nature is a popular dream. In China, the contemporary experience of burnout is compounded by the intensity of \u201curban disease\u201d, an umbrella term for the difficulties of living in megacities like Shanghai or Guangzhou, which can be used to refer to everything from traffic jams and poor air quality to employment and housing scarcity. Also at play in Li\u2019s popularity is the particular tenor of Chinese wistfulness. \u201cIt\u2019s called xiangchou. Xiang means the countryside or rural life, and chou means to long for it, to miss it,\u201d says Linda Qian, an Oxford University PhD candidate studying nostalgia\u2019s role in the revitalization of China\u2019s villages. \u201cIt is quite prevalent for youth living the city life. They get really sick of [the city] so the countryside\u201d \u2013 or a fantasy of it \u2013 \u201clooks increasingly like the ideal image of what a good life should be.\u201d Qian also likens Li\u2019s appeal to that of \u201cMan vs Wild\u201d-style entertainment in the west. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a certain point of materialism and consumption where there\u2019s only so much you can buy, and we\u2019re like, \u2018What other experiences can I have?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cSo we go back to what humans can do.\u201d Yet as her fame grows internationally, some have questioned, in comments, blogposts and Reddit threads, whether Li\u2019s channel is communist propaganda. In addition to providing China a form of international PR, Li embodies a kind of rural success the government hopes to generate more of through recent initiatives. With the aim of alleviating rural poverty, the Communist Youth League has embarked on an effort to send more than 10 million urban youth to \u201crural zones\u201d by 2022, in order to \u201cincrease their skills, spread civilization, and promote science and technology\u201d. \u201cWe need young people to use science and technology to help the countryside innovate its traditional development models,\u201d Zhang Linbin, deputy head of a township in central Hunan province, told the Global Times last April. By using technology to create her own rural economic opportunities while simultaneously championing forms of traditional Chinese culture before a huge audience, Li may seem like a CPC dream come true. According to Professor Ka-Ming Wu, a cultural anthropologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong: \u201cLi represents a new wave of Chinese soft power in that she\u2019s so creative and aesthetically good, and knows how to appeal to a general audience whether they\u2019re Chinese or not.\u201d And yet, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is some kind of engineered effort by the Chinese state,\u201d she says. Li\u2019s narrative hinges on her failure to thrive in the city; that failure is antithetical to China\u2019s overarching narrative of progress and urban opportunity. Were she a manufactured agent of propaganda, Wu speculates, \u201c[Her failure] is something the Chinese state would never even mention. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what really fuels her popularity,\u201d says Wu. \u201cThat despair of not being able to find oneself in the \u2018Chinese dream\u2019.

      "bodyText": "The Scottish government failed to properly monitor and evaluate billions of pounds\u2019 worth of privately financed contracts to build roads, schools and hospitals, two public spending watchdogs have said. In a damning report issued on Tuesday, Audit Scotland and the Accounts Commission found that the Scottish government had signed off on \u00a39bn worth of privately built and financed construction projects without fully understanding how they worked. Scottish ministers failed to predict how much profit the builders and lenders would make over the 25- to 30-year lifespan of the contracts, their joint report concluded. It was also unclear why private financing was used in some projects but not others. Ministers did not realise that large profits could be made by selling off debts from these contracts to other investors without any consultation with the public body using that asset. That reduced transparency and accountability, and increased risks for the public sector, the report found. In some cases, parcels of debt for these contracts had interest rates as high as 14.5%, while the investors enjoyed returns on their money that were nearly 6% higher than if councils had borrowed money from the Treasury. Those projects included the Aberdeen western peripheral route, a 36-mile long bypass, new hospitals, colleges and schools, which were built using a revised version of the private finance initiative (PFI) known as the non-profit distribution (NPD) model. Overseen by the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT), a quango set up by the then first minister Alex Salmond in 2010, Audit Scotland and the Accounts Commission found the lifetime cost of those projects was nearly twice as much as building them with construction grants from the government. In some cases, they were 50% more expensive than the route open to local authorities: borrowing from the Treasury-funded public works loan board. The report said councils agreed to the new privately-financed schemes partly because they felt the Scottish government gave them little choice, and often without considering other options. The report confirmed the findings of investigations by the Guardian that the firms that built and financed these projects were making significant profits from the debt and maintenance costs over the lifetimes of the contracts, which last 25 or 30 years. While private firms and investors spent \u00a32.3bn on the construction costs, with the public sector contributing \u00a31bn, the total lifetime costs for the 56 contracts overseen by the SFT and Scottish government would be \u00a39bn, including maintenance. As a result, the total cost for all PFI-type projects in Scotland had grown to \u00a340bn under the Scottish National party, which first won power in Edinburgh\u2019s devolved parliament in 2007 partly due to Salmond\u2019s attacks on the hefty profits made from PFI projects agreed by previous Labour governments. Scottish Labour said the report added weight to their calls for the Scottish government to halt the private financing of public buildings. The Conservatives said the report showed Salmond was guilty of hypocrisy for attacking PFI in the past but then embracing the policy once in power. The Scottish parliament\u2019s public audit committee will question Scotland\u2019s auditor general, Caroline Gardner, on its findings next month. Jenny Marra, the committee\u2019s convenor, said MSPs \u201cwill certainly want to know how these funding decisions were made, and whether they represents value for taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d, she said. The report said there were some benefits from the NPD system. It prevented builders and lenders from making the huge profits seen during the first years of PFI, introduced in the early 1990s by the Tories. The Scottish government\u2019s borrowing powers and capital spending grants were also restricted by the Treasury ten years ago, and were only gradually extended. This decreased the Scottish government\u2019s options for funding new public projects. The SFT had also succeeded in attracting support for some projects from the European Investment Bank (EIB), a European Union-owned institution which charged lower interest rates than private lenders. That helped reduced debt and annual financing costs to the public sector. Even so, there were significant questions about how the NPD system worked, the two spending watchdogs said, as well a decision by the SFT to introduce a streamlined project commissioning system known as hub. The hub programme involved bundling together 54 similar projects, including 28 schools and 13 health centres, into single contracts. The contracts were modelled on the NPD system and shared out around the country by five regional hub companies called hubcos. Although the hub system was apparently simple to use, its decision-making was very opaque. Each hubco is controlled by two primary contractors, who appointed other contractors, which decreased competition and choice. Audit Scotland and the Accounts Commission, the quango that polices local government financing in Scotland, said there were doubts too about the SFT\u2019s claims that its approach saved money. Public bodies \u201coften had difficulty understanding how the SFT\u2019s savings figures relate to the projects they are delivering\u201d. Gardner, the auditor general, said Scottish ministers had to learn lessons from these experiences before they rolled out a new private financing system called the mutual investment model, which includes many features of the PFI and NPD systems. A Scottish government spokesman said it would consider the report in detail, but defended private financing.

It has the capacity to unlock economic potential, support jobs, and enable our businesses and communities to grow,\u201d the spokesman said.",

The National Audit Office said ministers chose to run a \u00a3100m campaign \u2013 the most expensive of four options \u2013 to tell all UK businesses and individuals how they should prepare for leaving the EU. The campaign was launched as the 31 October deadline for leaving the EU approached. But the evidence shows that the proportion of UK citizens who reported that they had looked or started to look for information, did not notably change, auditors said. Auditors said the numbers of people looking for information about Brexit did not notably change as a result \u2013 ranging from 32% and 37% during the campaign, to 34% when it stopped, having spent just under half of the allotted money. The campaign was halted three days before the UK was supposed to leave after the EU granted another extension. The report increases concerns over the government\u2019s spending leading up to the 31 October deadline set by the prime minister to leave the EU with or without a deal. It comes as the government prepares a new \u201cReady to Trade\u201d campaign on 1 February, the day after the UK is due to formally leave the EU. Auditors found the Cabinet Office\u2019s business case did not demonstrate increased impact for the proposed spending on the campaign compared with lower-cost alternatives. Auditors said it was \u201cnot clear\u201d it left people \u201csignificantly better prepared\u201d. The Cabinet Office, which is in charge of Brexit preparations, said it had to launch a campaign in the run-up to the October deadline or risk \u201csignificant and unnecessary disruption\u201d. The department estimated the campaign reached 99.8% of the population, with every member of the public having the opportunity to see the range of billboard, print, TV and online adverts 55 times. The campaign encouraged people and businesses to visit the government\u2019s main gov.uk website to answer questions and receive advice on preparing for the UK\u2019s exit from the bloc. Among those specifically targeted were British citizens who were intending to travel to Europe in the days and weeks after Brexit and businesses that exported to the EU. Gareth Davies, the NAO\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAt short notice, the Cabinet Office successfully corralled multiple government departments to work together effectively and launched this complex campaign at great speed. \u201cHowever, it is not clear that the campaign resulted in the public being significantly better prepared.\u201d In response, the government said the watchdog had acknowledged the campaign increased public awareness of the action it needed to take to be ready to leave the EU. \u201cNot undertaking the campaign would have risked significant and unnecessary disruption to businesses and to people\u2019s lives,\u201d a spokesperson for the cabinet office said. Responding to the report, the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said it was \u201ca colossal waste of taxpayers money\u201d which was effectively part of the Conservative election campaign. \u201cThis damning report shows what we knew all along: the Conservative government\u2019s \u2018Get Ready for Brexit\u2019 campaign was an expensive propaganda stunt designed ahead of the election to help no one but Boris Johnson stay in Number 10. \u201cOnce again the Tories are misusing their powers at the expense of our democracy.

He\u2019s 28, but this is only his 11th main draw at a slam. He\u2019s spent the bulk of his career grinding on the Challenger and Futures tours. He\u2019s matching his career best today after reaching the same stage of the Australian Open in 2018. Back then his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/23/tennys-sandgren-alt-right-conflicted\">overnight stardom caused a few issues</a>.</p> <p>Since that breakthrough event he\u2019s won his first (and so far only) ATP Tour title and spent most of his time ranked 50-100. During his run this month he\u2019s upset eighth seed Matteo Berrettini and 12th seed Fabio Fognini, as well as neutralising the in-form big-serving Sam Querrey. </p> <p>Federer, by contrast, is into his 57th slam QF, 11 more than the next most prolific, Novak Djokovic, and he\u2019s 14-0 in quarters at Melbourne Park. He lifted four titles last season and continues to rank near Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in rarefied air near the top of the rankings. </p> <p>The 38-year-old\u2019s run to the quarters has been far from a cakewalk. He looked supreme beating Steve Johnson and Filip Krajinovi\u0107 but got out of jail in a fifth set tiebreak against John Millman before dropping the opening set to M\u00e1rton Fucsovics. If he\u2019s to earn a record 21st slam he\u2019s probably going to have beat Djokovic then Nadal in consecutive matches. If he\u2019s to accomplish that unlikely feat he\u2019ll need all his strength.

As Kevin Mitchell reports: Martina Navratilova was cut off in mid-sentence when she climbed into an empty umpire\u2019s chair on an outside court here on Tuesday to push for Margaret Court Arena to be renamed in honour of Evonne Goolagong Cawley. \u201cI\u2019ve been speaking out about an issue for a while now,\u201d the former world No 1 said of her criticism of Court\u2019s homophobia, \u201cand John McEnroe is here to join me and push the conversation forward...\u201d At that point, the umpire\u2019s microphone goes dead. While there is no evidence Navratilova was deliberately censored, she and McEnroe both made strong statements criticising Court\u2019s controversial views on gender and race before the 77-year-old Australian was presented with a replica of the winner\u2019s trophy on Rod Laver Arena the previous night to mark the 50th anniversary of her calendar grand slam. Before we sign-off here and handover to the evening liveblog, here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s take on Ash Barty\u2019s surge to the semi-finals earlier on against Petra Kvitova. Some stats, that only to serve to highlight the unlikeliness of Federer\u2019s victory. Aces - Sandgren 27 / Federer 5 Winners - Sandgren 73 / Federer 44 Unforced errors - Sandgren 53 / Federer 56 Total points won - Sandgren 161 / Federer 160 In Roger Federer\u2019s long and storied career you might not expect a quarter-final victory over an opponent ranked 100 in the world to feature in his list of most memorable matches, but that was something else. At 0-3 down in the third set with the score at 1-1 he was off the court receiving treatment. His movement was impaired and during the fourth set he was a beaten man. Somehow - call it luck, call it grit, call it failure on the part of his opponent - he prevailed. He still looks as though he can\u2019t believe what\u2019s just happened. Embarrassed, a little dazed, standing with body language that suggests he\u2019s unsure how to respond to questions about his great escape. He credits Milos Raonic for his performance, ahead of a possible semi-final meeting - Novak Djokovic will have a massive say about that of course. \u201cI believe in miracles,\u201d he says, after describing his groin injury that went on to affect his lower leg. His pride prevented him from retiring, or from receiving treatment on-court, and that stubbornness eventually opened the door for victory after Sandgren failed to put him away. Federer\u2019s voice is breaking as he talks to Jim Courier. Physically and emotionally exhausted. Federer: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get lucky sometimes. I was just hoping that maybe he was not going to smash the winner, to keep the ball in play, who knows what he\u2019s thinking about? I got incredibly lucky today. As the match wore on I started feeling better and the pressure went away. I don\u2019t deserve this one but Im standing here and I\u2019m obviously very happy.\u201d Fifth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 7-6 6-3 Sandgren (* denotes server) Sandgren toughs out the opening point to demonstrate he\u2019s not going to be steamrollered on Federer\u2019s march to glory. He digs deep again to force 15-30 but Federer secures a couple of quick first serve points to engineer his first match point (Sandgren has failed with seven) - and he does it! The great escape complete. What a turnaround from Roger Federer. Fifth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 7-6 5-3 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Federer plays a little fast and loose with Sandgren on the ropes, slipping to 40-15 with some poor shot selection. He concedes the game with a now rare unforced error, slapping a forehand into the net. Federer to serve for the win. Fifth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 7-6 5-2 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer is serving as well as he has all day now, and he\u2019s moving smoothly too, this is absurd. 40-15 arrives in textbook fashion and despite requiring a second serve he holds convincingly. Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Fifth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 7-6 4-2 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Sandgren berates himself when he strikes long under no pressure to allow Federer 15-15, then he loses his racket (perhaps accidentally) at 30-30 after Federer pierces his backhand corner. Both times he comes back strongly to win the next point but both times he can\u2019t back it up and Federer forces deuce. A superb deep return from a stretching forehand from Federer ramps up the pressure on Sandgren, who misses his first serve at break point then Federer clubs a high bouncing forehand that his opponent cannot control. Unbelievable, Roger Federer, from two sets to one down, incapacitated, facing seven match points, is a break up in the fifth. Fifth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 7-6 3-2 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer proves his fitness by executing a forehand drive volley (from memory the first he\u2019s nailed all match, including a couple of notable misses). He is now serving at his highest average speed per set for the match and ripping backhand winners down the line. He holds to 30 but it feels more comprehensive than that. Fifth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 7-6 2-2 Sandgren* (* denotes server) It\u2019s a tired bedraggled game from both men but Sandgren won\u2019t mind. He holds to 15. Here\u2019s that ball-kid incident from earlier. Nick Kyrgios\u2019s tournament is over. Fifth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 7-6 2-1 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer holds to love, featuring just his fifth ace of the day. Did he switch bodies with a stunt double between sets? Is that the secret to his success all this time? Somewhere in the bowels of RLA there\u2019s a knackered Federer v1.0 icing up while 2.0 seals the deal. Maybe this is where Paul Rudd got the idea for that TV show \u2018Living With Yourself\u2019 and the in-joke about Tom Brady was all a red herring? Fifth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 7-6 1-1 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Pop! From the back right corner Federer pings a forehand crosscourt winner - the first of its kind in an age - to reinforce his Lazarus-like resurrection. What does he do next? Another! Vintage Federer. Sandgren stops the rot and both players trade points until deuce. Here Sandgren rattles the net with a backhand, trying to shorten a point ahead of schedule. Break point is on Federer\u2019s racket but he can\u2019t pierce his opponent\u2019s ungainly reflexes at the net. Federer gets a second look at deuce two, and Sandgren is increasingly disillusioned out there, chatting to the chair umpire again. There\u2019s a phone ringing somewhere, the umpire\u2019s mic\u2019s dropped out, the tension is at fever pitch. Sandgren saves, getting smartly in behind a first serve, then he scuds his 25th ace to move to game point, and he takes it. This is becoming quite a saga. And the longer it drags on the less into it the American seems to be. Fifth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 7-6 1-0 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer is twisting much freer now than at any point since the second set. There\u2019s pop to his forehands and bend in his spine on his serves, all of which means he holds to 15 in pretty routine fashion. By contrast, Sandgren looks heavy-legged and hangdog. Sandgren has left the court. The trainer is back on working on Federer\u2019s right groin while the legend is briefly bare-chested switching shirts in some fan-fiction made real cutaway. Sandgren is back but he\u2019s having a heated debate with the chair umpire, complaining that Federer has now gone for his bathroom break. We need Bill Lawry telling us it\u2019s all happening right now. Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 7-6 Sandgren (* denotes server) Sandgren puts serious heat on his serve to stay in the set to force 8-8 but then Federer digs in, really digs in, grunts, stretches - you can practically feel his ageing sinews screaming in pain - and he forces the mini-break. Can he convert? YES! WOW! This is unbelievable. Federer defends doggedly from the baseline then lobs up a testing overhead. Sandgren twitches - and we\u2019re going five. Holy moly. Tiebreak: 10-8 Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 6-6 Sandgren (* denotes server) Sandgren earns another match point immediately with a fierce serve that Federer can\u2019t return. Federer then misses with the first serve, inviting a long baseline exchange - 19 shots - and Sandgren slices into the net! The crowd erupts, then takes the roof off RLA after their hero follows up the save with a thumping smash winner to edge ahead. Tiebreak: 8-7 Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 6-6 Sandgren (* denotes server) Two awesome serves from Sandgren, and he is within touching distance of the biggest result of his life. Federer, serving to remain alive, survives a fourth match point after a tentative 19-shot rally. Match point five comes and goes with a solid first serve. Back to Sandgren, with ball in hand, can he do it? No! Federer just keeps the ball in play from the baseline then somehow prevails with Sandgren all over the net. Incredible. Tiebreak: 6-6 Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 6-6 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer continues the serving masterclass, but then there\u2019s controversy. What happened? Oh my! The ball-kid ran into Sandgren\u2019s outstretched left leg while he was leaning to put his towel on his bench. That\u2019s Sandgren\u2019s taped leg, by the way. Oh boy, that could have been a story. Sandgren grimaces but plays on - and he wins the next point, earning the mini-break when Federer finds the net. Tiebreak: 3-4 Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 6-6 Sandgren (* denotes server) Sandgren nails his pair of serves without being required to play any further shots. Tiebreak: 2-3 Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 6-6 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer dominates the opening point on Sandgren\u2019s serve but misses the volley at the net to secure the mini-break. He serves clinically twice to edge his nose in front. Tiebreak: 2-1 Fourth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 6-6 Sandgren (* denotes server) In the circumstances, that was a quick, solid service hold to 15 for Federer. Tiebreak time. Nick Kyrgios taking the scenic route, again... Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 5-6 Sandgren* (* denotes server) The crowd is well into this now, hollering its approval when a Sandgren error hands Federer an early advantage. They\u2019re respectful in their applause when Sandgren hammers a couple of first serves to regain the ascendancy. There\u2019s a nervous murmur when the American double faults and a weird anxious shriek when Federer finds a forehand winner that hits the line. He can\u2019t convert his break point though, Sandgren turning from hunted to hunter in the blink of an eye to force deuce. Sandgren looks to be struggling to know how to approach this dip for the finish line. He escapes with a poor put-away volley at deuce but fails to hold when he hits long soon after. Any nerves are settled with some pristine serving, returning all the pressure to Federer. Fourth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 5-5 Sandgren (* denotes server) Loose forehands are exchanged to open the game before a sharp serve and a Sandgren unforced error allow Federer the chance of a straightforward hold. He doesn\u2019t get it though because Sandgren rattles RLA to its foundations with a couple of beefy bashes to up the ante on the next point - and Federer duly slashes a backhand wide with plenty of court to aim for. That\u2019s not the worst of it. A limp forehand into the net at deuce offers Sandgren match point... but a nervy rally ends Federer\u2019s way when the American hammers a backhand into the net. Deuce two begins in identical fashion, with Federer off-balance dumping a forehand into the net. Again he stays in match point long enough to induce an error from his opponent. Deuce three follows the same pattern - Sandgren mishitting his third match point. Federer finally sneaks an advantage after deuce four and he holds! Much to the delight of a raucous Rod Laver Arena. Have we gone from Ali-Holmes to Ali-Foreman rope-a-dope? Federer lives to fight another game. Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 4-5 Sandgren* (* denotes server) For the first time in an age there\u2019s a smidgen of pressure on Sandgren\u2019s serve at 15-15 but Federer\u2019s reluctance to stretch for a makable forehand then inability to even contemplate a tough backhand allow Sandgren to move up 40-15. An error reduces the margin but any nerves are obliterated with a 20th ace. Federer serving to stay in the championships. Fourth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 4-4 Sandgren (* denotes server) The painkillers from that medical time out might be kicking in, or maybe it\u2019s adrenaline, but Federer reaches 30-0 in vintage fashion, serving strong and showing finesse at the net. He has two game points at 40-15 but Sandgren dismisses one of them with a blistering running two-handed backhand down the line that catches the spiderwebs in the corner. He backs that up with a punishing forehand return winner to an innocuous second serve. Deuce one comes and goes with Federer unable to accept a third game point, but deuce two is enough for the hold. Federer\u2019s serving motion is looking increasingly fluid and it\u2019s reflected on the speedgun. Meanwhile in the mixed doubles, Nick Kyrgios has put last night\u2019s disappointment behind him. Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 3-4 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Sandgren holds to love in the time it takes me to copy and paste the score over from the previous game. I repeat: it is hard to see Federer forcing a break unless Sandgren completely implodes. Fourth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 3-3 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer starts well, easing up 30-0 but an error then another demonstration of his impaired movement leads to 30-30. The crowd gets to its feet when Federer comes out on top in a thrilling exchange at the net, but they\u2019re back in their chairs when he concedes deuce shortly afterwards. The conservative serving approach disappears briefly for two quick points and nuggety hold. He\u2019s toughing this out as long as he can. \u201cHi Jonathan!\u201d hi Scott Campbell. \u201cSuch a strange match, though as Fed tries to push back the waves it is worth considering that were Sandgren to crumble, and Fed were able to stay upright and somehow win, is there any guarantee that Fed would make it onto the court for Thursday\u2019s semi? We\u2019d then be in a (unique?) situation whereby either Djokovic or Raonic get a walkover into the final, which wouldn\u2019t be good for anyone. By anyone, I mean those remaining in the top half of the draw. That being said, the above scenario does seem desperately unlikely.\u201d Indeed, a walkover semi is far from ideal for tournament organisers, but it\u2019s hard to see Federer winning the next two sets to bring that possibility into reality. Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 2-3 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Ace. Ace. Unreturnable second serve. Unreturnable second serve. It is hard to see Federer forcing a break unless Sandgren completely implodes. Fourth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 2-2 Sandgren (* denotes server) There hasn\u2019t been much memorable proactive tennis recently but Sandgren\u2019s running backhand pass at 30-0 deserves commendation. 30-15 quickly becomes 30-30 but Federer finds his serving range, however impeded, to remain in contention; just. Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 1-2 Sandgren* (* denotes server) During a nine-shot rally at 0-15 Federer is in business but a backhand long precedes a couple of points of Sandgren savagery that are too hot for the now maladroit maestro. An angled crosscourt winner to secure the hold rams home Federer\u2019s immobility. The stadium DJ plays Stayin\u2019 Alive during the change of ends. He might need to upgrade to Livin\u2019 on a Prayer pretty soon. Fourth set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 1-1 Sandgren (* denotes server) A stop-start game inches its way to 30-30 before Federer executes a perfect point - serving wide, stepping in and crunching the backhand crosscourt winner - to set up game point. Sandgren overhits to confirm the hold. Sam Groth, courtside, suggests it\u2019s a rotational issue for Federer, which is clearly a big deal. The No 3 seed is digging in for now though, banking on his unheralded opponent eventually feeling the weight of the circumstance. Something that has yet to happen. Fourth set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-6 0-1 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Are we in for an Ali-Holmes style drubbing that leaves a bitter taste? Or is Federer going to rage against the dying of the light? 15-30 suggests the latter but Sandgren muscles up to power his way to a hold. Third set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-6 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer\u2019s average first serve speed has dropped 10% since the medical time out (and that\u2019s in a tournament where his average serve speed was already down on previous years). He\u2019s plugging away nonetheless, and looks on course for a hold at 40-15 but consecutive errors introduce deuce into the equation. Here, Sandgren smells blood and asserts himself on his wounded foe, pouncing on a second serve and hunting Federer at the net to earn break point. Federer saves it after an 11-shot rally, but gifts it straight back with a half-volley into the net. A sharp serve down the T saves another day but deuce three again goes Sandgren\u2019s way when his opponent slaps an inside-out forehand into the net. Somehow Federer staves off set point yet again, only to offer a fourth with a double fault. This one is repelled with an unreturnable serve and Federer links points together to force his way ahead. With the hold begging Federer taps a backhand volley into the net for deuce six! Again Sandgren capitalises on a second serve to invite Federer into trading meaty forehands from the baseline, each one surely making the superstar wince. Set point five? Saved, of course, Sandgren unable to redirect a sliding backhand in court. Set point six arrives immediately after though, and this time Sandgren converts. Roger Federer is on the ropes. Tennys Sandgren is zen, steeling himself for the knockout. Third set: Federer 6-3 2-6 2-5 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Federer has never retired mid-match in his career, but that outcome is being discussed by Jim Courier and Todd Woodbridge on TV. He\u2019s battling on, for now, keeping the ball in play without trying to force the issue, and he works his way to 15-30 before Sandgren batters a series of serves with the subtlety of a competitive woodchopper. There is a blunt force to the American\u2019s style that is in contrast to his opponent\u2019s refinement, and for the time being, much more effective. It\u2019s been a tournament of relatively few news stories (once the air quality improved). Hardly any tantrums, not many startling upsets, but this looks like it\u2019s going to take top billing. Third set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 2-4 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer races to a love hold but it is now visible that he is in some discomfort. There\u2019s no bend in his serving motion, no pop in his forehands and he\u2019s barely pushing off to reach strokes more than a half-step away. Big news. Third set: Federer 6-3 2-6 1-4 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Sandgren has been ice cold since the opening set. He looks completely unfazed and holds to love in quicktime. Seven winners to just six unforced errors this set (to Federer\u2019s 2-8) with the match figures standing at 26-22 Sandgren, 17-30 Federer. Third set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 1-3 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer jogs back out with no visible strapping and immediately gets into his work, serving fluidly to hold to 15 with the minimum of fuss. Let\u2019s hope the half-time pep talk from the doctor perks up the Basel ballerina. Tennys Sandgren spends the opening couple of minutes of the time out working on his headband knot. In so doing it highlights his MASSIVE GUNS. I don\u2019t mean to dwell on this, but he has cannons for biceps and bazookas for triceps. Then he does this: The medical time out is taken. Here we go - the physio has been called and Federer departs RLA for an assessment. Tactical? The explanation for Roger\u2019s poor play? TV comms speculate it might be a hip or groin issue if it\u2019s something that can\u2019t be worked at on-court to begin with. Federer has recent history of back issues, which could be at the heart of any short-term problems. Third set: Federer 6-3 2-6 0-3 Sandgren* (* denotes server) A rare Sandgren unforced error then a double fault lifts Federer\u2019s spirits. The crowd then erupts for the first time all match when the Swiss secures three break points at the end of a 28-shot rally. Sandgren saves the first with a solid point then Federer upbraids himself after dumping a backhand into the net. That curse earns Federer a code violation, which he accepts grumpily, first discussing the incident with the line judge who picked up on the comment, then approaching the chair umpire for confirmation. Sandgren holds his nerve to save break point three, then serves imposingly twice to defend his turf. That felt like a pivotal game. Sandgren did superbly to tough it out in difficult circumstances. Federer is seriously rattled. It\u2019s already a long way back into this set, let alone a match drifting away from the veteran. Third set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 0-2 Sandgren (* denotes server) This is edging into worrying territory for Fed fans. 0-30 arrives quickly and Sandgren is in the next point before missing his target. A good serve wide to the Sandgren backhand claws him level but another huge missed forehand mid-rally - that was a poor poor shot - hands his opponent another break opportunity. And yet again he donates it meekly, dumping a mistimed forehand into the net. Something is going awfully wrong for the great man right now. There\u2019s no sign of illness or injury. Can he interrupt this pattern of the match? Third set: Federer 6-3 2-6 0-1 Sandgren* (* denotes server) This is not going to be the quick match Federer needed if he\u2019s any hope of outlasting Nadal or Djokovic in later rounds. He may not even reach that far, of course, and Sandgren is doing his darnedest to prevent him, serving smoothly to 40-0 then holding to 15. In open play the match has been even, perhaps even leaning towards Sandgren, since the outset. Now the American is competing on serve it\u2019s little surprise to see him poking his nose in front. Second set: Federer* 6-3 2-6 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer has looked a touch ragged on occasion today, none more so than conceding the opening point of this service game. Scrap that, when he punches a drive-volley forehand wide to drop to 15-30, that was his most ragged moment. That error begets another error and Sandgren has two set points. The first comes and goes in the blink of an eye but the second is a rasping 16-shot affair that only ends when Federer makes his 15th unforced error of the set (to Sandgren\u2019s six). The No 100 ranked Sandgren levels at one set all with 20-time grand slam champion Federer. Second set: Federer 6-3 2-5 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Sandgren is serving much better this set, up over 70%, and his second serve is much more potent. Consequently, Federer is getting much less to work with before we even get to his own inconsistencies. He scraps hard to 30-30 before Sandgren batters a pair of first serves to move within one game of the set. Second set: Federer* 6-3 2-4 Sandgren (* denotes server) Sam Groth is suggesting the extra bounce may be causing a few issues for Federer who is playing in the warm sunshine of RLA after a series of matches under lights. The bounce doesn\u2019t cause him any concern on his way to 40-0 but Sandgren plays a lovely point to pinch one back. A splendid first serve seals the hold. Second set: Federer 6-3 1-4 Sandgren* (* denotes server) This is really uncharacteristic tennis from Federer, he\u2019s conceding points with high-percentage shots like stand and deliver backhands in baseline exchanges, let alone the strokes with a high degree of risk. Sandgren cruises to 40-0 and looks destined for a simple hold but Federer claws back a couple of points. A backhand volley into the net erases any hope of that crucial break back. Second set: Federer* 6-3 1-3 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer sprints to a hold to 15 in more familiar fashion. Can he break back? Second set: Federer 6-3 0-3 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Federer\u2019s unforced error count for the second set is already in excess of his tally for the opening set. Sandgren holds easily for 3-0. Second set: Federer* 6-3 0-2 Sandgren (* denotes server) Some rare pressure on the Federer serve. He leaks to 0-30 after missing a forehand put-away at the net then he\u2019s forced to watch in awe as Sandgren muscles a backhand down the line. Points are then shared, leaving Sandgren with two break opportunities - but he only needs one! Excellent defence from the American forces Federer into hitting one more shot than he wanted, and he smashes a deep overhead long. This not what Federer ordered, but this has been an error-strewn start from both men. Second set: Federer 6-3 0-1 Sandgren* (* denotes server) The exchange of errors continues like a bad round of office secret santa. Sandgren reaches 40-15 in a game that can be politely described as average to that point, before Federer executes beast mode for a couple of shots, obliterating a forehand then a backhand that overpowered Sandgren like a tsunami. He backs that up with some smart court craft, dropping a shot into the breeze with his opponent miles behind the baseline. Sandgren holds despite slipping to deuce, serving powerfully then profiting from a poor Federer backhand. First set: Federer* 6-3 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer is serving around 70%, without overreaching (only two aces, no doubles) and that\u2019s enough for him to skip to the opening set. The crowd offers a polite ripple of applause. This is not the Nadal v Kyrgios blockbuster of last night, nor does it have the investment of Barty\u2019s match that preceded it. First set: Federer 5-3 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Sandgren is serving under 50% and he\u2019s winning just 20% of points on second serve - not a great combo. Again he crawls to 0-30 but battles back to 30-30 with some fierce forehands. Federer errs with a backhand slice to concede a game point then a forehand to relinquish any chance of a break. Once the ball is in play Sandgren is Federer\u2019s equal, but there is a major disparity on serve so far. First set: Federer* 5-2 Sandgren (* denotes server) Federer wraps that gift from Sandgren in a safe hold, despite his rival winning the point of the game, whipping a backhand crosscourt for a clean winner with the No 3 seed at the net. Federer, by the way, is in Wimbledon white today, offset by a maroon headband and shorts. It\u2019s been a pretty ordinary tournament for tennis fashion (imho). First set: Federer 4-2 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Sandgren is no slouch either, which gives little time to admire his outfit - which deserves admiration. Think M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce or Van Halen in their mid-80s snowstorm days. Sleevless shirt, teamed with loud shorts and a busy headband. He has massive guns too, perhaps as big as anyone on tour. They don\u2019t help him hold serve though, Federer comes back from 30-0 to secure the first break as the American\u2019s serve breaks down under limited pressure. First set: Federer* 3-2 Sandgren (* denotes server) A classic example of Federer racing through his obligations. He holds to 15. It\u2019s like watching Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan or Jimmy White race around a snooker table. First set: Federer 2-2 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Brad Gilbert has nicknamed Tennys \u2018Enter Sandgren\u2019, which is clearly excellent. But it\u2019s exit Sandgren this game as Federer continues his momentum from the previous game, skipping to 0-40 in a run highlighted by a whipped forehand pass that curved like a Xherdan Shaqiri free-kick. Sandgren is a fighter though and he finds his range off the tee to claw his way back to game point with the minimum of strokes, including a 207 kph ace. Federer then dominates the final point of the game before Sandgren whips a miraculous single-handed backhand from deep in the corner beyond his net-guarding opponent and through for a winner. First set: Federer* 2-1 Sandgren (* denotes server) Sandgren controls the net like a giant volleyball blocker to earn the opening point of Federer\u2019s second service game, but it\u2019s routine thereafter with the maestro easing into his work after an iffy start. Federer is playing rapid tennis this tournament, rattling through points, making them as short as possible, and wasting no time between serves. Sad to see the end of the teenage tearaways in the women\u2019s doubles. First set: Federer 1-1 Sandgren* (* denotes server) Indifferent start by both men on serve. Without reaching anywhere near his best Federer enjoys two break points at 15-40 but can\u2019t convert either, the second the latest in a series of forehands into the net. At deuce the Swiss chooses a poor time in the rally to come into the net, allowing Sandgren to pass him with a forehand down the line. An overhit return levels the mismatch on the scoreboard. Sam Groth makes the astute observation that Federer is coming off three night matches during this tournament so the daytime conditions may take some getting used to. On nominative determinism, Derek Kickett, an Australian rules footballer, is one of my favourites. First set: Federer* 1-0 Sandgren (* denotes server) Not the cleanest opening for Federer, dumping a couple of forehands into the net to slide to 30-40. A strong couple of serves sets up game point but a tame forehand volley into the net drags things back to deuce. That was the second poor drive-volley of the game for the veteran. The second deuce is over in a flash with a couple of aces. Sandgren has his left knee strapped, incidentally, but his movement looked unimpaired in the opening game. The players are out, the formalities have been observed, time for tennis. It\u2019s sunny in Melbourne Park, temperatures in the mid-20s C, but there\u2019s a cool southerly breeze that may become a factor as the match wears on. Sandgren is an unlikely quarter-finalist. He\u2019s 28, but this is only his 11th main draw at a slam. He\u2019s spent the bulk of his career grinding on the Challenger and Futures tours. He\u2019s matching his career best today after reaching the same stage of the Australian Open in 2018. Back then his overnight stardom caused a few issues. Since that breakthrough event he\u2019s won his first (and so far only) ATP Tour title and spent most of his time ranked 50-100. During his run this month he\u2019s upset eighth seed Matteo Berrettini and 12th seed Fabio Fognini, as well as neutralising the in-form big-serving Sam Querrey. Federer, by contrast, is into his 57th slam QF, 11 more than the next most prolific, Novak Djokovic, and he\u2019s 14-0 in quarters at Melbourne Park. He lifted four titles last season and continues to rank near Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in rarefied air near the top of the rankings. The 38-year-old\u2019s run to the quarters has been far from a cakewalk. He looked supreme beating Steve Johnson and Filip Krajinovi\u0107 but got out of jail in a fifth set tiebreak against John Millman before dropping the opening set to M\u00e1rton Fucsovics. If he\u2019s to earn a record 21st slam he\u2019s probably going to have beat Djokovic then Nadal in consecutive matches. If he\u2019s to accomplish that unlikely feat he\u2019ll need all his strength. Anything other than a breezy day out today will count against him. Before we get too far into Fed v Sandy, here\u2019s your match report on Ash Barty\u2019s historic victory. Thanks Mike. So my stint on the blog is all about 20-time grand slam champion and one of the icons of his generation, Roger Federer, against the king of nominative determinism, Tennys Sandgren (Anna Smashnova is the queen, obvs). This is the first time these two have met in competition, Federer coming into it ranked third in the world and the overwhelming favourite, Sandgren, the massive underdog, ranked 100. Remember to retune your dials so that emails go to jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com and tweets @JPHowcroft. Well, that was a novel exercise in post-match interviewing. But Jim Courier\u2019s gig won\u2019t under too much threat for the timebeing. Anyway, another excellent performance from Ash Barty, who becomes the first Australian woman into an Australian Open semi-final since Wendy Turnbull in 1984. An incredible achievement, but pretty much in keeping with this remarkable athlete, who remains on course for a second grand slam title. Fourteenth seed Sofia Kenin is next up, and it would take a brave person to bet against Barty continuing her run at Melbourne Park after that ruthless second-set display against Kvitov\u00e1. And with that, I\u2019ll leave you in the capable hands of Jonathan Howcroft, who will take you through Roger Federer\u2019s game with Tennys Sandgren, coming right up on Rod Laver Arena. Cheerio. Here\u2019s Barty on court, speaking to Casey Dellacqua, who is dragged onto court: \u201cI love putting you on the spot,\u201d says Barty. \u201cI knew I had to bring my best today against Petra.\u201d Barty pays tribute to her coach, Craig Tyzer. \u201cHe does everything to the nth degree.\u201d On Kvitov\u00e1: \u201cShe\u2019s the perfect competitor. She fights her best, regardless of when she always got a grin on her face. I love testing myself against her.\u201d On her next match, against Kenin. \u201cShe\u2019s having an incredible run. She has developed her game over the last 18 months. I\u2019ll have nothing but a massive smile on my face when I come out onto this beautiful court.\u201d Second set: Barty* 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 Kvitov\u00e1 (* denotes server) Doubts creep in when Barty gets a challenge wrong at 15-30 down but an ace bails her out and saves the first of two break points. Kvitov\u00e1 then gets a challenge of her own wrong and Barty gets it back to deuce. An ace follows and she is on the brink of the semis... Barty then hammers down another ace, her fifth of the day, to secure her place in the final four! Second set: Barty 7-6 (8-6), 5-2 Kvitov\u00e1* (* denotes server) Kvitov\u00e1 fights back from 0-30 down on her serve, levelling at 30-all, but that\u2019s all she\u2019s got. Barty brings up break point, at which point the Czech can only muster a double fault. The Australian world No 1 will now serve for the match and a place in the semis. Second set: Barty* 7-6 (8-6), 4-2 Kvitov\u00e1 (* denotes server) Kvitov\u00e1\u2019s not done yet though and things have just got slightly more interesting as the Czech breaks. She needs another one to get back into this match, but could this be the start of a remarkable comeback? Second set: Barty 7-6 (8-6), 4-1 Kvitov\u00e1* (* denotes server) Kvitov\u00e1 steadies the ship, some excellent shotmaking this time hitting the mark. She wins to love, although she still has a mountain to climb now if she is to derail Barty, who is just two games away from a spot in the semis, with the ball in her hands next. Second set: Barty* 7-6 (8-6), 4-0 Kvitov\u00e1 (* denotes server) New balls prompt Kvitov\u00e1 swings from the hip. Initially it works for the Czech, opening up a 30-0 lead, but her gung-ho shot-making does for eventually this game as a lack of precision allows Barty back into it, and eventually hold serve. Second set: Barty 7-6 (8-6), 3-0 Kvitov\u00e1* (* denotes server) Barty is flying here. She storms to 30-0 on Kvitov\u00e1\u2019s serve, and it looks pretty grim for the Czech. Barty stumbles momentarily as she finds the net before a Kvitov\u00e1 double fault hands her two more break points. On the second, a glorious lob \u2013 at the third time of asking \u2013 clears Kvitov\u00e1\u2019s frame at the net and lands just inside the basline. A set and two breaks up, Barty is looking good at this point. Second set: Barty* 7-6 (8-6), 2-0 Kvitov\u00e1 (* denotes server) You get the feeling Barty senses blood now. Kvitov\u00e1, for all her shotmaking, is beginning to look a bit tired. The Australian really couldn\u2019t find a better way to confirm that break than this \u2013 a quick hold to love. Second set: Barty 7-6 (8-6), 1-0 Kvitov\u00e1* (* denotes server) Barty\u2019s forehand is wheeled out to good effect to bring up deuce, but Kvitov\u00e1 once again finds a precision winner to save the break point that follows. When faced with a second break point though, a tired shot finds the net, and Barty has the early advantage this second set. A few first-set stats for you: winners (Barty 10-19 Kvitov\u00e1), unforced errors (21-28), return winers (0-4), win first serve (70%-75%), break points won (33%-11%). First set tie-break: Barty 8-6 Kvitov\u00e1 The Czech goes long and Barty has set point on Kvitov\u00e1\u2019s serve... can she mini-break and secure the first set? Yes she can! Kvitov\u00e1 goes long again at the baseline and Barty has the opener in her back pocket! As expected though, this is an incredibly evenly-matched contest. First set tie-break: Barty 6-6 Kvitov\u00e1 Barty gets the mini-break but she can\u2019t confirm it as Kvitov\u00e1 pulls level at 4-4. Barty then aces (her third of the day) before Kvitov\u00e1 pulls out one of those forehand winners of hers \u2013 5-5 now. An un-returnable serve later and the Czech has set point, but she can\u2019t get it this time. Six-each as we change ends... First set tie-break: Barty 3-3 Kvitov\u00e1 There has been so little between these two during the first set it comes as no surprise the tie-breaker is a tightly contested affair. Nothing exemplifies that more than a marathon 22-shot point with Kvitov\u00e1 leading 3-2 \u2013 Barty\u2019s powers of retrieval are astounding as she continually manages to get to Kvitov\u00e1\u2019s balls, return then, and then eventually win the point. First set: Barty 6-6 Kvitov\u00e1* (* denotes server) Off to a tie-break we go after Kvitov\u00e1 benefits from a net cord and wraps up another service game. 59 minutes on the match clock. First set: Barty* 6-5 Kvitov\u00e1 (* denotes server) Commentator\u2019s curse! Barty gives an inch, maybe even two, as she falls to 15-40 and gives Kvitov\u00e1 a glorious chance to break at a crucial point. But the Czech fails to capitalise \u2013 again. That\u2019s been nine break points she has had so far today, and she\u2019s managed to take just one \u2013 an 11% conversion rate, by my calculations. And she is made to rue that particular stat as Barty holds. First set: Barty 5-5 Kvitov\u00e1* (* denotes server) Kvitov\u00e1 opens with a double fault... not the best way to start such a crucial game, but she recovers soon enough and \u2013 via a brilliant, quick reaction to a net cord midway through the game \u2013 she holds. Neither player is giving an inch at the moment. First set: Barty* 5-4 Kvitov\u00e1 (* denotes server) Kvitov\u00e1 has few answers to Barty\u2019s opening salvos this game, although a weak shot from the Australian into the net gives the Czech a sniff at 30-40. A double fault follows and having seemingly been cruising, Barty finds herself at deuce. But she then displays all her craft with a couple of perfectly-executed slices on the next rally, to set up game point and she emerges with a hold. Now would be a pretty good time for her to find another break... First set: Barty 4-4 Kvitov\u00e1* (* denotes server) Kvitov\u00e1 discards her headband midway through this game as things heat up on court, but her radar is off with an over-cooked volley at the net that goes out at the baseline to bring up deuce and offer Barty a glimmer of a break. She gets that chance soon enough but Kvitov\u00e1 saves it and goes on to hold. Barty blows out her cheeks as the opportunity lost. Still nothing to separate these two, and we\u2019re all square in this first set. First set: Barty* 4-3 Kvitov\u00e1 (* denotes server) Oof, Kvitov\u00e1 shows her class at 15-0 up on Barty\u2019s serve, opening up her body to fire a beautiful forehand winner back past the Australian. A stunning backhand follows and the Czech has three break points... but Barty manages to save all three! Five deuces follow before another stunning hit from Kvitov\u00e1\u2019s forehand brings up another break opportunity... she\u2019s wide of the mark though and we go to a sixth deuce... and then a seventh after a fifth break point is saved! Finally, after the longest game of the match by far, Barty manages to hold as we tick over the half-hour mark. Kvitov\u00e1 may have lost that game, but some of ball-hitting was the stuff of champions. First set: Barty 3-3 Kvitov\u00e1* (* denotes server) Another double fault from Kvitov\u00e1 puts the Czech in a spot of bother at 15-30 but she emerges with a much better serve down the T which Barty can only return into the net. She\u2019s wild with a backhand on the next point though and Barty has a chance to break again... no dice this time though as Kvitov\u00e1 aces with impeccable timing. And another ace a point later eventually secures the hold. First set: Barty* 3-2 Kvitov\u00e1 (* denotes server) Blink and you\u2019ll miss it stuff now. And much better from Barty this time around with the ball in her hand as she races through a service game \u2013 the third game on the trot that ends to love. Back on serve on Rod Laver Arena. First set: Barty 2-2 Kvitov\u00e1* (* denotes server) But then, just like that, Kvitov\u00e1 wobbles with a poor service game, that includes her first two double faults of the day, allowing Barty to break back straight away with a love game of her own. First set: Barty* 1-2 Kvitov\u00e1 (* denotes server) Here we go then, Kvitov\u00e1 continues her ominous start to this match with the first break of the day! To love at that, and secured with a belting forehand crosscourt winner that Barty can\u2019t get anywhere near to. The Czech is looking good so far. First set: Barty 1-1 Kvitov\u00e1* (* denotes server) Kvitov\u00e1 sets out her stall early in an entirely more comfortable service game, which she wins to love. Probably a good time to remind yourselves of the Czech\u2019s incredible journey over recent years, courtesy of this interview with Simon Hattenstone: First set: Barty* 1-0 Kvitov\u00e1 (* denotes server) Here we go then, Barty to serve first. The Australian eases into the swing of things, opening up a 40-0 lead before Kvitov\u00e1 goes on the attack, moving aggressively into the net on several points and eventually bringing up a break point opportunity. Barty saves it though, and then her serve comes to the rescue as she manages to get herself out of a small hole and hold serve. The players are out on the court, and have just finished warming up. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, find your seats quickly please,\u201d says the umpire, and we\u2019re just about ready to go. Kenin, of the US, is through to her maiden grand slam semi-final, having just beaten Tunisia\u2019s Ons Jabeur 6-4, 6-4 after an hour and 32 minutes in the first match of the day on Rod Laver. Kenin, the first woman through to the semis, will play the winner of Barty v Kvitov\u00e1 next. But the American 14th seed says she doesn\u2019t care who she meets. \u201cI\u2019m in the semi-finals, at this point whoever I play they\u2019re playing really well.\u201d She\u2019ll be watching on though. \u201cI\u2019ll watch it\u2019ll be an exciting match.\u201d With the nation\u2019s recently-installed favourite athlete of all-time, Nick Kyrgios, now departed from the single\u2019s draw, home hopes firmly rest on the shoulders of Ash Barty, a woman who genuinely has a lock on a place in Australian hearts. Today on Rod Laver Arena, the world No 1 faces her toughest challenge yet at this year\u2019s tournament at Melbourne Park. Barty comes into this clash having won her last three matches against Petra Kvitov\u00e1, but also with the memory of last year\u2019s drubbing at the hands of the Czech at the same stage of the Australian Open lingering in the back of her mind. Of course, a lot of water has passed under the bridge since then \u2013 including wins for Barty in Miami, Beijing and at the WTA Finals in Shenzhen, not to mention a French Open triumph and her ascension to the summit of the rankings \u2013 and she should be quietly confident of going further than she has been before at this tournament by booking a spot in the semi-finals. Kvitov\u00e1 does hold a career 4-3 head-to-head record against Barty, though. And the Australian is expecting a tough outing against the two-time Wimbledon champion. \u201cI think I\u2019m looking forward to another battle against a quality opponent,\u201d she said earlier this week. It promises to be an intriguing afternoon of tennis in the sunshine on Rod Laver Arena. And later on, Roger Federer takes on the unseeded American, Tennys Sandgren in the men\u2019s quarter-finals before Novak Djokovic headlines the evening session on Rod Laver with a match against Canada\u2019s Milos Raonic. All that and more to come. Time now just quickly for some housekeeping before we get underway \u2013 do email your thoughts to mike.hytner@theguardian.com or if Twitter is your thing, it\u2019s @mike_hytner.",

      "bodyText": "A prison officer at Victoria\u2019s largest prison has been stood down pending allegations that he failed to provide food to an Aboriginal prisoner. The prisoner at the privately run Ravenhall Correctional Centre, a 1,300-bed medium-security men\u2019s prison on the outskirts of Melbourne and operated by GEO Australia, was allegedly not provided with dinner after he was moved from his usual cell to an isolation cell. Guardian Australia understands the man informed the prison officer before he was moved that he had not yet had dinner, and was told he would be brought food in the isolation cell. He did not receive food until the guard shift changed two hours later, and he told the incoming officers that he still had not been given dinner. The prison officer was stood down the following day. In a statement, GEO Australia said a staff member at the prison had been \u201csuspended from duty pending an outcome of an investigation into a possible breach of GEO\u2019s Code of Conduct\u201d. \u201cGEO has a strong code of conduct in relation to basic human rights and prisoner welfare and has a zero tolerance policy in relation to proven breaches of its code,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cGEO recognises the needs of all prisoner groups and treats all prisoners with dignity and respect. As the investigation is ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further.\u201d Neither GEO Australia nor Corrections Victoria, the state body that has responsibility for the welfare of inmates in Victoria, would comment on the record about what the officer was alleged to have done. \u201cWe expect all correctional staff to act to the highest standards at all times and that any allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated,\u201d a government spokeswoman said. GEO Australia operates four private prisons, including Ravenhall and Fulham in Victoria, and a post-release facility. The $670m Ravenhall prison opened in 2017 and is expected to cost the Victorian government $6.3bn to operate over the life of the 25-year contract. It was built in an attempt to manage Victoria\u2019s skyrocketing prison population and GEO Group can receive up to $2m in annual bonuses if it meets targets to reduce recidivism, including a target to reduce the recidivism of Aboriginal prisoners by 14%. The Andrews government announced last year that it would spend another $1.8bn on prison upgrades including a new maximum-security prison north of Geelong.",

And British hopes of maintaining a post-Brexit flow of data with the EU, seen as vital for security and the economy, risked being jeopardised after the Netherlands raised questions over the UK\u2019s poor record in protecting personal information. What next Brexit Day will be celebrated by leave voters on Parliament Square in London, and a clock counting down the last hour will be projected on to No 10 Downing Street, but 31 January will not be marked by any official pageantry. As soon as the clock strikes 11pm (midnight in Brussels), the UK will no longer be a member of the EU and British citizens will no longer be EU citizens. Its 73 MEPs will no longer sit in the European parliament, British ministers will no longer sit in European council meetings. Few others will notice much difference for the time being because the UK will remain part of the single market and customs union until the end of the transition period in December, so free movement of goods, people, services and capital will apply. What happens after December 2020 remains unclear; the future relationship between the EU and its first ex-member remains to be negotiated. Much will depend on how far the UK government wants to diverge from the EU rulebook \u2013 whether or not it will abide by a \u201clevel playing field\u201d. Formal talks are likely to start in early March. David Frost, the prime minister\u2019s chief Europe adviser, will lead trade negotiations with the EU on his behalf, at the head of a 40-person taskforce reporting into Downing Street. The Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) is due to shut down on 31 January. Here you will find a fairly exhaustive Guardian Brexit explainer on just how we got to this point, and what we can expect over the coming 11 months.

Top comment As we leave the EU, we should not forget what was gained while we were members, argues Andrew Rawnsley in the Observer: For Brexiters, this Friday may be a night to revel. For the many who will feel a profound sense of loss, it will be an occasion for anguish. Indifference will be the least appropriate emotion. Dusk falls on a long, hugely significant and in many ways fruitful period of our modern history. What comes next, no one is sure, least of all those who most willed this rupture. Top tweet Neat.

      "bodyText": "When Jared Kushner took on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict alongside his many other official duties \u2013 promoting American innovation, arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the US opioid crisis \u2013 he decided to begin with a blank slate. \u201cHe said flat out, don\u2019t talk to me about history,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a US peace negotiator for previous administrations who was consulted by Kushner. \u201cHe said, I told the Israelis and the Palestinians not to talk to me about history too.\u201d This was a daring approach to a conflict and region steeped in every bitter turn of history. During one of a handful of meetings, Miller reminded the president\u2019s son-in-law of William Faulkner\u2019s observation: \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past\u201d. Kushner decided to deal with the problem of history intruding on talks by engineering a proposed settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis without negotiations or even really talking to one of the parties. \u201cI think Jared has a real conviction that he\u2019s the Frank Sinatra of the peace process. He\u2019s going to do it his own way,\u201d said Miller. The result is the \u201culitmate deal\u201d, as Donald Trump described it, that the president is expected to formally present to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the White House on Tuesday. But enough details have leaked for the proposals to be widely scorned as favouring Israel by opening the door to its annexation of large parts of the occupied territories and giving it almost total control of Jerusalem. Trump appointed Kushner, a developer who is married to the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka, to oversee the US\u2019s policy on Israel and Palestine even though he has no experience of Middle East diplomacy. A lack of experience in Middle East negotiations is not necessarily a hindrance to trying to forge a peace agreement \u2013 and might be an asset compared to those who lost their way in the weeds of positioning of checkpoints and access to Gaza.

It didn\u2019t help that it wasn\u2019t even going to be his full time job but tacked on with a lot of other tasks. But perhaps the key was that Kushner has close family ties to Netanyahu who is facing an election in March. The make up of Kushner\u2019s team was an early clue to where it the process was headed. It included David Friedman, a lawyer with close ties to the Jewish settler movement in the occupied territories who Trump appointed as US ambassador to Israel. Friedman has questioned the need for a Palestinian state and likened members of a liberal US Jewish group to Nazi collaborators for their criticism of the Israeli government\u2019s actions. The Trump administration then alienated the Palestinians with a series of actions in Israel\u2019s favour including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and slashing funding for Palestinian refugees. Kushner toured Middle East capitals seeking to get the kings of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and Egypt\u2019s authoritarian president, to pressure the Palestinian Authority into going along with the White House plan. Among those wooed by Kushner was the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, which goes some way to explain \u2013 alongside arms deals \u2013 why the Trump administration has let him off the hook over the murder of the Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Miller noted that Kushner will be running Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and that a plan that helps get Netanyahu re-elected by giving Israel a green light to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank will in turn help the president not least with the Christian evangelical vote which is very supportive of the Jewish state. \u201cI told Jared you\u2019re going to put out a plan that meets the needs or requirements of only one side.

      "bodyText": "A fluorescent pink slug, found only on a single mountaintop in northern New South Wales, has survived the bushfires that burnt through much of its alpine habitat. Around 60 of the brightly coloured Mount Kaputar slugs, which can grow to a size longer than a human hand, were spotted by National Parks and Wildlife Service rangers after recent rainfall in Mount Kaputar national park. The Kaputar fire burnt through the area for more than six weeks from October to December 2019, affecting more than 18,000 hectares of land. The mountain was formed by a now-extinct volcano, and is home to at least 20 species of snails and slugs found nowhere else in the world. The area has been identified as an endangered ecological community, the first of its kind in Australia. Some of the fluorescent slugs would have managed to survive the fire because they had \u201cretreated into rock crevices\u201d in the heat, the Australian Museum malacologist Frank K\u00f6hler said. But around 90% of the slug population, which also hibernates in bark and trees, would have been killed in the fire, he said. Much of the slug\u2019s food sources \u2013 fungi, moss and mould \u2013 would also have been burnt by the fire, but K\u00f6hler said these species should recover relatively quickly. In coming months the slug might be at risk of being seen more easily in the burnt landscape by hungry birds and mammals, said K\u00f6hler, but the bright colour could also act as a warning to dissuade the predators. The unmistakable slug is a \u201cposter boy for snails and slugs\u201d because of its distinctive colour, K\u00f6hler said, \u201cbut it comes with a number of other species that are similarly threatened by the fires that don\u2019t get the same attention\u201d. The Mount Kaputar ecological community includes three species of carnivorous snails found nowhere else in the world. While the Mount Kaputar slug may take around five years to recover from the fires, the snails could take 20 years, K\u00f6hler said, because \u201ctheir lifespan is longer and they produce fewer offspring\u201d. Their food source, primarily earthworms and other snails, is also likely to have been heavily affected by the fires. Slugs and snails \u201care the foundation of all of our ecosystems\u201d, K\u00f6hler said. \u201cThey are the foundation food source for many mammals and birds.\u201d But while invertebrates represent 99% of all species in Australia, \u201cthey don\u2019t get even close to representative funding in research and conservation,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecies don\u2019t exist independent of other species, and we need to try to maintain the whole system and all the species within in it against environmental impacts such as the fires,\u201d K\u00f6hler said. Bushfires are not the only threat facing the unique species. \u201cThey are not likely to be able to adapt to a very fast-changing climate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely than not that they will go extinct.\u201d \u201cA warming of only 2C would be enough to wipe out the entire [ecological] community\u201d said K\u00f6hler. Because the species are found at the summit of the mountain, \u201cthey will not be able to move higher to escape increased temperatures\u201d. Mount Kaputar national park is still affected by the bushfires and is closed to visitors until 28 February.",

An unnamed 35-year-old woman checks into a hotel in Avignon; over the years, we\u2019ll meet her in several more \u2013 in Prague, Oslo, Auckland and Austin. She monitors her desire to drink, to have casual sex, and to not quite look at her own past. She is haunted by a lost love, and these encounters with others \u2013 or mostly, really, with herself \u2013 in these anonymous rooms bring painful flashes of that former relationship.</p> <p>One clear departure is in the voice, which is expressed in a kind of convoluted verbosity (\u201cit\u2019s merely her preference not to indulge mortality\u2019s by now routine assaults on her carefully habituated ennui\u201d), as her protagonist engages in an endless, spiralling conversation with herself \u2013 analysing her thought patterns, second-guessing her motivations, casting judgment on her evasions and justifications.</p> <p>The woman uses this discursive language to control her actions and cage her emotions, to (occasionally literally) talk herself down from the edge: \u201clining words up against words, then clause against clause until an agreeable distance has been reached from the initial, unmanageable impulse\u201d. In the final section \u2013 which notably moves from third to first person \u2013 she acknowledges that this \u201crelentlessly reshuffling the deck of pseudo-intellectual garble \u2026 serves the solitary purpose of keeping the world at the far end of a very long sentence\u201d.</p> <p>All this is so removed from the fragmented, hot-headed language of McBride\u2019s earlier novels, it feels pointed. The character herself addresses this: she recalls being raised to keep words \u201cas far as possible from the scent of blood and guts\u201d but that she couldn\u2019t help herself, and \u201call the words filled up with blood and moved around as though entitled to motion \u2026 The trick was knowing when to stop. The trick was knowing how much others could take. And then she got tired of the trick. And then she saw others using sub-standard versions of it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/20/on-my-radar-eimear-mcbride-cultural-highlights\">On my radar: Eimear McBride\u2019s cultural highlights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s tempting to interpret this as McBride on some level anticipating the reader\u2019s response to her distinctive change in style. But it\u2019s also possible to ascribe it to one of her previous fictional characters. When the woman describes the first time she stayed in a hotel, taken there by her older lover, the age gap between the two will remind previous readers of the characters of Eily and Stephen in <em>The Lesser Bohemians</em>, as will other details. Could this be Eily\u2019s evolution of literary style rather than (or as well as) McBride\u2019s?</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to say \u2013 this short book is evasively lacking in context. We never know why the woman is in these cities, or what she does in them. We never see her leave the hotel rooms.</p> <p>Hotel rooms are strange \u2013 and McBride captures brilliantly the uncanny feeling of replication across cities and continents they give, how they seem to exist out of time, and how an abstract, untethered version of the self stacks up whenever you check in. But <em>Strange Hotel\u2019s</em> view is also limited, always turning inwards rather than outwards. There\u2019s a stuffy, airless claustrophobia to the character\u2019s solipsism.</p> <p>\u201cIf the past comes in, it will wring her neck\u201d, the woman fears, which feels like a promise for us as much as it is a threat for her \u2013 but it\u2019s one McBride doesn\u2019t wholly fulfil. There are a couple of beautifully controlled drops into devastating emotion, but for much of the book, the character desperately tries to avoid that darkness. Without much action in the present or much revelation about the past, going inward isn\u2019t that revelatory.</p> <p>McBride has pinned down the inner workings of an individual arguing with themselves with as much coherent virtuosity as she captured the unrestrained rush of youthful impressions and geysering emotions in <em>Girl</em> and <em>The Lesser Bohemians</em>. It\u2019s just that \u2013 to put it bluntly \u2013 the result is rather less interesting.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Strange Hotel </em>by Eimear McBride is published by Faber (\u00a312.99).

The character herself addresses this: she recalls being raised to keep words \u201cas far as possible from the scent of blood and guts\u201d but that she couldn\u2019t help herself, and \u201call the words filled up with blood and moved around as though entitled to motion \u2026 The trick was knowing when to stop. The trick was knowing how much others could take. And then she got tired of the trick. And then she saw others using sub-standard versions of it.\u201d It\u2019s tempting to interpret this as McBride on some level anticipating the reader\u2019s response to her distinctive change in style. But it\u2019s also possible to ascribe it to one of her previous fictional characters. When the woman describes the first time she stayed in a hotel, taken there by her older lover, the age gap between the two will remind previous readers of the characters of Eily and Stephen in The Lesser Bohemians, as will other details. Could this be Eily\u2019s evolution of literary style rather than (or as well as) McBride\u2019s? It\u2019s hard to say \u2013 this short book is evasively lacking in context. We never know why the woman is in these cities, or what she does in them. We never see her leave the hotel rooms. Hotel rooms are strange \u2013 and McBride captures brilliantly the uncanny feeling of replication across cities and continents they give, how they seem to exist out of time, and how an abstract, untethered version of the self stacks up whenever you check in. But Strange Hotel\u2019s view is also limited, always turning inwards rather than outwards. There\u2019s a stuffy, airless claustrophobia to the character\u2019s solipsism. \u201cIf the past comes in, it will wring her neck\u201d, the woman fears, which feels like a promise for us as much as it is a threat for her \u2013 but it\u2019s one McBride doesn\u2019t wholly fulfil. There are a couple of beautifully controlled drops into devastating emotion, but for much of the book, the character desperately tries to avoid that darkness. Without much action in the present or much revelation about the past, going inward isn\u2019t that revelatory. McBride has pinned down the inner workings of an individual arguing with themselves with as much coherent virtuosity as she captured the unrestrained rush of youthful impressions and geysering emotions in Girl and The Lesser Bohemians. It\u2019s just that \u2013 to put it bluntly \u2013 the result is rather less interesting. \u2022 Strange Hotel by Eimear McBride is published by Faber (\u00a312.99).

The few branches emerging from the water mark the place where he proposed to his wife 35 years earlier. It used to be the town square of Doun Baba Dieye, a vibrant fishing community on the outskirts of Saint-Louis in northern Senegal. The village has been wiped off the map, with only the tree and crumbling walls of an abandoned school remaining as testament to its existence. Everything else is 1.5 metres under water. \u201cThis was home. I was born here. Everything which was important to me happened here,\u201d says Ameth, the former village chief.

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) and the Royal College of Physicians want local authorities to be able to compel schools and other public buildings with poor air quality to make urgent improvements. The move comes as a new report released by the two medical bodies highlights the impact indoor air pollution has on a range of childhood health problems from asthma to conjunctivitis, dermatitis and eczema. Prof Jonathan Grigg, a paediatric respiratory consultant from the RCPCH said the report painted a worrying picture. \u201cWe\u2019re finally paying attention to the quality of our outdoor air and this is long overdue [but] it\u2019s harder to get population level data on the quality of indoor air. \u201cChildren in the UK spend most of their time indoors, with just 68 minutes spent outside on an average day.

The authors of the report, a review of 221 previous studies, warn that indoor air quality tends to be poorer in low-quality housing and older buildings where ventilation may be inadequate or insufficient. Prof Stephen Holgate, special adviser for the Royal College of Physicians, said people living in poorer households often had fewer choices about where to live and where to go to school. \u201cMore than 3 million families live in poor quality housing in the UK. Most will not have enough money to make improvements and have no option but to make do with damp, under-ventilated environments. \u201cWe need to offer support at local authority level \u2013 likewise with schools. If we ask our children to spend their childhood days in unhealthy spaces, then we\u2019re storing up problems for future health.\u201d The report recommends that local authorities should have the power to require improvements where air quality fails to meet minimum standards in local authority schools and houses, including: Legally binding performance standards for indoor air quality from ventilation rates to maximum concentration levels for specific pollutants. Air quality tests when local authority construction is complete and before the building is signed off. Compliance tests after the construction stages and assessment of buildings once occupied. Free indoor air testing for residents and a national fund to support improvements for low income families. David Renard, the Local Government Association\u2019s transport spokesman, said councils would \u201ctake on board any good practice guidance that helps continue to protect vulnerable people and keep them safe\u201d. But he also called for \u201cdevelopers, manufacturers, households and businesses\u201d to do more to tackle indoor air quality. \u201cFor air quality plans to be successful, they need to be underpinned by local flexibility and sufficient funding, while issues around resourcing and capacity also need to be addressed, as well as educating the public around the need to reduce pollution.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Julia Quir\u00f3s Rodr\u00edguez, from Cadiz, in Spain, dreamed about doing a student exchange under the European Union\u2019s Erasmus+ programme she always imagined coming to the UK. But her university warned her off Brexit Britain, and she is studying at the University of Galway, in Ireland, instead.</p> <p>Last year Rodr\u00edguez had to choose eight European universities where she would like to do her Erasmus+ exchange. As she is studying English, her choices were all in Britain. However, her university asked her to change her options because, like many EU universities, it feared being left to pay high student fees if Britain were shut out of the scheme, post-Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cThey said it was too much of a risk planning to go to the UK not knowing what is going to happen with Brexit,\u201d she says. \u201cEconomically and academically it is a big risk for our universities. If the Erasmus agreement is broken, what happens then?\u201d</p> <p>Rodr\u00edguez says Erasmus \u201chas always been my dream\u201d \u2013 her uncle was one of the first Spanish students to benefit from the scheme when it launched more than 30 years ago. </p> <p>When she arrived in Ireland, she admits, she found it overwhelming, not least because she couldn\u2019t understand the Irish accent. But she has made good friends, improved her English, and describes it as a \u201cgreat experience\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think the UK should definitely fight for Erasmus,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/19/erasmus-scheme-chaos-uk-students-limbo-funding-accommodation\">Erasmus scheme in chaos as UK students left in limbo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But many fear there is no appetite for such a fight in the UK, with a Liberal Democrat-backed amendment to the withdrawal agreement bill requiring the government to seek continued participation in Erasmus+ being defeated by Conservative MPs earlier this month.</p> <p>Boris Johnson, pushed in prime minister\u2019s questions, said there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/09/uk-committed-to-maintaining-erasmus-exchange-scheme\" title=\"\">\u201cno threat\u201d</a> to the scheme. \u201cUK students will continue to be able to enjoy the benefits of exchanges with our European friends and partners,\u201d he told MPs. However, many remain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jan/16/boris-johnson-says-the-erasmus-scheme-isnt-under-threat-do-you-trust-him\" title=\"\">fearful about the future of Erasmus</a>, which is known to have few supporters in the Treasury and is expected to be a long way from the top of the negotiating list with the EU.</p> <p>Vivienne Stern, director of the international arm of Universities UK (UUK), the vice-chancellors\u2019 body, describes the prime minister\u2019s statement as \u201cvery encouraging\u201d but says: \u201cIt was not clear whether the PM was talking about us continuing to participate in this programme, or whether we would seek association to the next programme starting in January 2021. And then, of course, it is going to be a subject for negotiation.\u201d</p> <p>Students of any subject can do an Erasmus year, but it is language departments, many of which are already struggling to attract enough students, that have most to lose.</p> <p>Marion Schmidt, professor of French literature and film at Edinburgh University and president of the association of university professors and heads of French, says being barred from Erasmus would be \u201cabsolutely disastrous\u201d for her subject. \u201cWe are in limbo. The current second-year students know they can go abroad on Erasmus+ next year, but beyond that we don\u2019t know and it is causing a lot of anxiety on campus.\u201d</p> <p>Schmidt realised at a meeting with French universities last year that Brexit was already harming student exchange. \u201cSome partner institutions were saying that they were stopping sending new students to the UK because of the uncertainty. A lot of institutions are worried that they might be left footing the bill for fees at British universities.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with declining demand, seven universities have <a href=\"https://university-council-modern-languages.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/\" title=\"\">stopped offering modern language degrees</a> in the past year, and more than 50 have cut courses or closed departments since 2000, according to the University Council of Modern Languages (UCML).</p> <p>Spending a year abroad - teaching, studying or working as an intern \u2013 is a compulsory part of most modern language degrees in the UK, and a big reason why many students choose to study a language in the first place. Universities say Erasmus+ makes that year straightforward, providing generous living grants with top-ups for poorer students, a simple application process, and the guarantee that credits earned on their exchange would be recognised by their home university.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/09/erasmus-programme-year-studying-europe\">Thanks to the Erasmus programme, my small world grew big  | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>UCML says some UK universities have made financial guarantees to reassure worried students as well as European partners. For instance, Newcastle University has earmarked \u00a31.4m to underwrite Erasmus+ exchanges for the 400 students who will study abroad during the 2020-21 academic year, and says it will continue to receive European students in that year whatever happens politically. But many others have no safety net.</p> <p>Claire Gorrara, professor of French studies at Cardiff University and chair of the UCML, says: \u201cWe can\u2019t run a language degree and say to students, \u2018You will have to make up for all the support previously on offer through the Erasmus+ programme to pay for the costs of going abroad. That would be a massive blow for language degrees. And it would have a major impact on equity of access to these courses.\u201d</p> <p>She says language degrees are already in a \u201cbad place\u201d. Between 2010-2011 and 2016-2017, student numbers for Italian degrees declined by 63%, French by 45%, and German by 43%, according to new research by the <a href=\"https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2020/01/09/action-needed-to-avert-the-growing-crisis-in-language-learning/\" title=\"\">Higher Education Policy Institute</a> thinktank.</p> <p>Gorrara believes this stems from a negative attitude to languages in the UK that must be challenged \u201curgently\u201d. </p> <p>Erasmus+ sends around 16,000 UK students to more than 30 countries each year. Those who study abroad outperform their peers in both the classroom and the job market, according to <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Pages/gone-international-expanding-opportunities-.aspx\" title=\"\">research</a> by Universities UK. They are 19% more likely to get a first and 20% less likely to be unemployed.</p> <p>Paul Craig, a management consultant from Shropshire, whose daughter is studying Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Studies and is planning to study in Portugal under Erasmus, says: \u201cIt\u2019s the uncertainty that\u2019s the killer. It\u2019s an unnecessary stress on students and parents.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government is going to use Erasmus as an EU negotiating point that is pretty low. This is a fantastic scheme that has benefited thousands over decades.\u201d</p> <p>Stern, of UUK, says Britain does see a net return on its investment in Erasmus when you consider incoming students\u2019 spending, but she warns that if the Treasury is making \u201ca narrow judgment of Erasmus on the basis of money in and money out\u201d it is \u201cmissing the point\u201d. \u201cTaking part in Erasmus gives students new skills that are valuable to employers and that boosts our economy.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Julia Quir\u00f3s Rodr\u00edguez, from Cadiz, in Spain, dreamed about doing a student exchange under the European Union\u2019s Erasmus+ programme she always imagined coming to the UK. But her university warned her off Brexit Britain, and she is studying at the University of Galway, in Ireland, instead. Last year Rodr\u00edguez had to choose eight European universities where she would like to do her Erasmus+ exchange. As she is studying English, her choices were all in Britain. However, her university asked her to change her options because, like many EU universities, it feared being left to pay high student fees if Britain were shut out of the scheme, post-Brexit. \u201cThey said it was too much of a risk planning to go to the UK not knowing what is going to happen with Brexit,\u201d she says. \u201cEconomically and academically it is a big risk for our universities. If the Erasmus agreement is broken, what happens then?\u201d Rodr\u00edguez says Erasmus \u201chas always been my dream\u201d \u2013 her uncle was one of the first Spanish students to benefit from the scheme when it launched more than 30 years ago. When she arrived in Ireland, she admits, she found it overwhelming, not least because she couldn\u2019t understand the Irish accent. But she has made good friends, improved her English, and describes it as a \u201cgreat experience\u201d. \u201cI think the UK should definitely fight for Erasmus,\u201d she says. But many fear there is no appetite for such a fight in the UK, with a Liberal Democrat-backed amendment to the withdrawal agreement bill requiring the government to seek continued participation in Erasmus+ being defeated by Conservative MPs earlier this month. Boris Johnson, pushed in prime minister\u2019s questions, said there was \u201cno threat\u201d to the scheme. \u201cUK students will continue to be able to enjoy the benefits of exchanges with our European friends and partners,\u201d he told MPs. However, many remain fearful about the future of Erasmus, which is known to have few supporters in the Treasury and is expected to be a long way from the top of the negotiating list with the EU. Vivienne Stern, director of the international arm of Universities UK (UUK), the vice-chancellors\u2019 body, describes the prime minister\u2019s statement as \u201cvery encouraging\u201d but says: \u201cIt was not clear whether the PM was talking about us continuing to participate in this programme, or whether we would seek association to the next programme starting in January 2021. And then, of course, it is going to be a subject for negotiation.\u201d Students of any subject can do an Erasmus year, but it is language departments, many of which are already struggling to attract enough students, that have most to lose. Marion Schmidt, professor of French literature and film at Edinburgh University and president of the association of university professors and heads of French, says being barred from Erasmus would be \u201cabsolutely disastrous\u201d for her subject. \u201cWe are in limbo. The current second-year students know they can go abroad on Erasmus+ next year, but beyond that we don\u2019t know and it is causing a lot of anxiety on campus.\u201d Schmidt realised at a meeting with French universities last year that Brexit was already harming student exchange. \u201cSome partner institutions were saying that they were stopping sending new students to the UK because of the uncertainty. A lot of institutions are worried that they might be left footing the bill for fees at British universities.\u201d Faced with declining demand, seven universities have stopped offering modern language degrees in the past year, and more than 50 have cut courses or closed departments since 2000, according to the University Council of Modern Languages (UCML). Spending a year abroad - teaching, studying or working as an intern \u2013 is a compulsory part of most modern language degrees in the UK, and a big reason why many students choose to study a language in the first place. Universities say Erasmus+ makes that year straightforward, providing generous living grants with top-ups for poorer students, a simple application process, and the guarantee that credits earned on their exchange would be recognised by their home university. UCML says some UK universities have made financial guarantees to reassure worried students as well as European partners. For instance, Newcastle University has earmarked \u00a31.4m to underwrite Erasmus+ exchanges for the 400 students who will study abroad during the 2020-21 academic year, and says it will continue to receive European students in that year whatever happens politically. But many others have no safety net. Claire Gorrara, professor of French studies at Cardiff University and chair of the UCML, says: \u201cWe can\u2019t run a language degree and say to students, \u2018You will have to make up for all the support previously on offer through the Erasmus+ programme to pay for the costs of going abroad. That would be a massive blow for language degrees. And it would have a major impact on equity of access to these courses.\u201d She says language degrees are already in a \u201cbad place\u201d. Between 2010-2011 and 2016-2017, student numbers for Italian degrees declined by 63%, French by 45%, and German by 43%, according to new research by the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank. Gorrara believes this stems from a negative attitude to languages in the UK that must be challenged \u201curgently\u201d. Erasmus+ sends around 16,000 UK students to more than 30 countries each year. Those who study abroad outperform their peers in both the classroom and the job market, according to research by Universities UK. They are 19% more likely to get a first and 20% less likely to be unemployed. Paul Craig, a management consultant from Shropshire, whose daughter is studying Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Studies and is planning to study in Portugal under Erasmus, says: \u201cIt\u2019s the uncertainty that\u2019s the killer. It\u2019s an unnecessary stress on students and parents. \u201cIf the government is going to use Erasmus as an EU negotiating point that is pretty low. This is a fantastic scheme that has benefited thousands over decades.\u201d Stern, of UUK, says Britain does see a net return on its investment in Erasmus when you consider incoming students\u2019 spending, but she warns that if the Treasury is making \u201ca narrow judgment of Erasmus on the basis of money in and money out\u201d it is \u201cmissing the point\u201d. \u201cTaking part in Erasmus gives students new skills that are valuable to employers and that boosts our economy.\u201d",

The course is not about \u201cbeasting it\u201d, but a week of supportive tuition in the mountains. Richard and Jon created a welcoming atmosphere, helping us to hone a huge range of skills without judgment or criticism. Throughout our trips into the hills, the instructors paused to point out plants, birds and animals. I discovered that there are three main species of heather in Scotland (common, bell, and bross-leaved Heath) and, by the end of the week, I knew how to identify each one. I left exhausted but inspired, brimming with enthusiasm to put my new skills to use. Essential equipment for the course Rucksack (30-40 litres, and possibly a larger one for the expedition) Good walking boots Waterproof jacket and trousers Good thermal layers Thermos flask for hot drinks Packed lunches each day Compass (preferably a Silva type 4 or similar) Mapcase Headtorch Hat and two or three pairs of gloves Tent Stove, pots and pans Sleeping mat Sleeping bag \u2022 Book mountain leader training courses through Mountain Training; they are available from National Training Centres (like Plas y Brenin in Wales and Glenmore Lodge in Scotland) from \u00a3300-\u00a3450, accommodation not included. Or you can book a private instructor; Anna trained with Richard Bentley (\u00a3330) Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

Its report says that number is likely to reach 400,000 by 2050, when the government expects to have developed a clean energy system based on renewable electricity, green heating systems and electric vehicles. A quarter of the green jobs required will need to be based in the north of the country, according to National Grid.</p> \n<p>It is estimated that more than 21,000 new recruits will be required to complete energy projects that include an offshore windfarm off the coast of Blyth and a new subsea power cable to Norway from the north-east of England.

      "body": "<p>One day nearly 60 years ago, Rita Tushingham was walking through Soho with her friend, the late British actor Paul Danquah, when a passerby yelled: \u201cBlacks and whites don\u2019t mix!\u201d Tushingham looks troubled by the memory. \u201cIt happened to Paul a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember he shouted back, \u2018Don\u2019t worry! She\u2019s only been on holiday and got a tan.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>That was Britain in 1961, before London swung, before sex between men was decriminalised, before a black man and a white woman walking in Soho might pass unremarked. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw208436/Rita-Tushingham-Paul-Danquah?LinkID=mp68708&amp;role=sit&amp;rNo=1\">a photo in the National Portrait Gallery</a> of the pair that very year, her leaning in care-free, him eyeing the street as if on alert for the next racist. </p> <p>At the time, Tushingham and Danquah were filming the now-celebrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/10/a-taste-of-honey-review-trafalgar-studios-london-shelagh-delaney-jodie-prenger\">A Taste of Honey</a>, adapted from the play by Shelagh Delaney. \u201cIt had everything \u2013 race, class, gender, sexuality, poverty,\u201d says Tushingham of her first film role. She played something cinema had never seen before: a bored teenager from the rough end of Salford. Jo was alienated from school, revolted by her boozy single mam and eternally suckered by worthless suitors. After falling in love with a sailor, played by Danquah, Jo gets pregnant. He returns to sea, so she moves in with Geoffrey, a gay textiles student who becomes her surrogate co-parent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"20f0db7694aea59ac3d3ba01d7e57d7fa0758792\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20f0db7694aea59ac3d3ba01d7e57d7fa0758792/145_85_5304_3183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We did the first interracial kiss on screen\u2019 \u2026 Tushingham with Paul Danquah in A Taste of Honey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We did the first interracial kiss on screen\u2019 \u2026 Tushingham with Paul Danquah in A Taste of Honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe shocked audiences without intending to,\u201d says Tushingham. \u201cI only learned later that Paul and I did the first interracial kiss on screen.\u201d It\u2019s a big claim: certainly, it was seven years before Captain Kirk and Lieutenant Uhura kissed in Star Trek, and a year before the earliest known interracial kiss on British TV, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/20/tv-archive-discovers-couple-who-beat-kirk-and-uhara-to-first-interracial-kiss\">in the ITV</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/20/tv-archive-discovers-couple-who-beat-kirk-and-uhara-to-first-interracial-kiss\"> drama You in Your Small Corner</a>. For this and other supposed outrages, A Taste of Honey was banned in several countries including New Zealand. \u201cA lot of the reaction was, \u2018People like that don\u2019t exist\u2019 \u2013 by which they meant homosexuals, single mothers and people in mixed-race relationships. But they did.\u201d</p> <p>Not only did Tushingham win a Bafta and a Golden Globe, her haunting looks became iconic. Delaney wrote A Taste of Honey when she was 19. Tushingham was 17 when she played Jo, getting the part after replying to a newspaper ad. \u201cI quit as assistant stage manager at Liverpool Playhouse,\u201d says the actor, who had been earning \u00a31 a week and getting the occasional walk-on role. \u201cThen I was wide-eyed in London, not quite believing what had happened to me.\u201d</p> <p>When the city started to swing, the former convent girl joined in, albeit mutedly. \u201cI\u2019ve never smoked or drunk alcohol, so I observed.\u201d Danquah introduced Tushingham to a struggling artist called Francis Bacon.

      "bodyText": "One day nearly 60 years ago, Rita Tushingham was walking through Soho with her friend, the late British actor Paul Danquah, when a passerby yelled: \u201cBlacks and whites don\u2019t mix!\u201d Tushingham looks troubled by the memory. \u201cIt happened to Paul a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember he shouted back, \u2018Don\u2019t worry! She\u2019s only been on holiday and got a tan.\u2019\u201d That was Britain in 1961, before London swung, before sex between men was decriminalised, before a black man and a white woman walking in Soho might pass unremarked. There\u2019s a photo in the National Portrait Gallery of the pair that very year, her leaning in care-free, him eyeing the street as if on alert for the next racist. At the time, Tushingham and Danquah were filming the now-celebrated A Taste of Honey, adapted from the play by Shelagh Delaney. \u201cIt had everything \u2013 race, class, gender, sexuality, poverty,\u201d says Tushingham of her first film role. She played something cinema had never seen before: a bored teenager from the rough end of Salford. Jo was alienated from school, revolted by her boozy single mam and eternally suckered by worthless suitors. After falling in love with a sailor, played by Danquah, Jo gets pregnant. He returns to sea, so she moves in with Geoffrey, a gay textiles student who becomes her surrogate co-parent. \u201cWe shocked audiences without intending to,\u201d says Tushingham. \u201cI only learned later that Paul and I did the first interracial kiss on screen.\u201d It\u2019s a big claim: certainly, it was seven years before Captain Kirk and Lieutenant Uhura kissed in Star Trek, and a year before the earliest known interracial kiss on British TV, in the ITV drama You in Your Small Corner. For this and other supposed outrages, A Taste of Honey was banned in several countries including New Zealand. \u201cA lot of the reaction was, \u2018People like that don\u2019t exist\u2019 \u2013 by which they meant homosexuals, single mothers and people in mixed-race relationships. But they did.\u201d Not only did Tushingham win a Bafta and a Golden Globe, her haunting looks became iconic. Delaney wrote A Taste of Honey when she was 19. Tushingham was 17 when she played Jo, getting the part after replying to a newspaper ad. \u201cI quit as assistant stage manager at Liverpool Playhouse,\u201d says the actor, who had been earning \u00a31 a week and getting the occasional walk-on role. \u201cThen I was wide-eyed in London, not quite believing what had happened to me.\u201d When the city started to swing, the former convent girl joined in, albeit mutedly. \u201cI\u2019ve never smoked or drunk alcohol, so I observed.\u201d Danquah introduced Tushingham to a struggling artist called Francis Bacon. She met Elizabeth Taylor, too, and hung out with pop stars. On stage, she played Nancy in The Knack and Hermia in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. On screen, she starred in 1963\u2019s cult gay film The Leather Boys and was the eponymous Girl with Green Eyes in the adaptation of Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s novel. A New York Times reporter who met her described her as \u201ca slip of a girl, her uncosmeticised face framed in straight dark hair, wearing a sweater and jeans, with those enormous eyes incessantly expressive even when the rest of the small face disappeared behind a big yellow coffee cup\u201d. Across the decades, those eyes \u2013 now behind glasses as she sips a decaf latte in a demure dark suit \u2013 still captivate. Tushingham became the go-to girl for doe-eyed innocence, playing the daughter of Julie Christie and Omar Sharif in 1965\u2019s Doctor Zhivago. In The Trap the following year, she played a mute living with French-Canadian fur trapper Jean La B\u00eate. She was the orphan beauty, Oliver Reed the rough-hewn beast whose leg needs amputating. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any lines, but I did cut off Oliver Reed\u2019s leg with an axe!\u201d Tushingham also starred in Richard Lester\u2019s film version of The Knack.

      "body": "<p>A joined-up cycling and walking network in Greater Manchester could provide a national blueprint for reducing congestion and air pollution and improving health, a report says.</p> <p>Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, and Chris Boardman, the region\u2019s cycling and walking commissioner, are calling on the government to back plans for an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/27/manchester-makes-a-beeline-for-new-dutch-style-cycling-network\">1,800-mile network</a> of protected routes for pedestrians and cyclists.</p> <p>They claim the Bee Network initiative could increase journeys on foot or by bike by 2.5m a day, cut some journey times by 50% and save the NHS \u00a36.73bn by improving people\u2019s health.</p> <p>A report, Change a region to change a nation, contains projections of a 350% increase in daily cycling trips over the next 10 years, from 100,000 to 450,000, a one-third increase in daily walking trips, from 1.48m to 2.05m, and up to 130,000 fewer daily private car and taxi trips.</p> <p>Boardman said one in three car journeys in Greater Manchester were less than a kilometre, which could be covered in 15 minutes on foot, and change was clearly needed to encourage more people to travel actively.</p> <p>The report was commissioned by Transport for Greater Manchester, Greater Manchester Combined Authority and the mayor. It sets out plans for 17 \u201cfiltered neighbourhoods\u201d \u2013 areas that prioritise the movement of people over the movement of motor vehicles. Alongside infrastructure plans, it outlines the changes in legislation needed to ensure that the investment provides value for money.</p> <p>Burnham said the plans were a national blueprint for promoting real change in the way people travel, and government backing was paramount. </p> <p>\u201cOur city region\u2019s 10 districts have been working on these plans since 2017 and, crucially, residents have helped to develop them, based on what they want their neighbourhoods to look like,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNow we have a world-class plan and we know how to deliver it, but we cannot do it alone. We need the government to back us with sustained funding over the next 10 years to enable us to complete the Bee Network. If they do so, they will be helping create a model that can be replicated across the rest of the country.\u201d</p> <p>The report will be delivered to Westminster next month. Boardman said: \u201cAll 10 Greater Manchester councils have taken on this challenge and they\u2019ve already started transforming ambition into action. But without guaranteed government investment, we are hamstrung.</p> <p>\u201cTo revolutionise travel across a whole city region, we\u2019re asking for the same financial backing over a 10-year period as it\u2019s costing for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2019/jun/24/what-14bn-buys-1800-miles-of-cycle-lanes-or-one-big-roundabout\">single junction improvement scheme in Bedford</a>. I know which will return the best investment \u2013 not only for our city-region but the nation as a whole.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A joined-up cycling and walking network in Greater Manchester could provide a national blueprint for reducing congestion and air pollution and improving health, a report says. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, and Chris Boardman, the region\u2019s cycling and walking commissioner, are calling on the government to back plans for an 1,800-mile network of protected routes for pedestrians and cyclists. They claim the Bee Network initiative could increase journeys on foot or by bike by 2.5m a day, cut some journey times by 50% and save the NHS \u00a36.73bn by improving people\u2019s health. A report, Change a region to change a nation, contains projections of a 350% increase in daily cycling trips over the next 10 years, from 100,000 to 450,000, a one-third increase in daily walking trips, from 1.48m to 2.05m, and up to 130,000 fewer daily private car and taxi trips. Boardman said one in three car journeys in Greater Manchester were less than a kilometre, which could be covered in 15 minutes on foot, and change was clearly needed to encourage more people to travel actively. The report was commissioned by Transport for Greater Manchester, Greater Manchester Combined Authority and the mayor. It sets out plans for 17 \u201cfiltered neighbourhoods\u201d \u2013 areas that prioritise the movement of people over the movement of motor vehicles. Alongside infrastructure plans, it outlines the changes in legislation needed to ensure that the investment provides value for money. Burnham said the plans were a national blueprint for promoting real change in the way people travel, and government backing was paramount. \u201cOur city region\u2019s 10 districts have been working on these plans since 2017 and, crucially, residents have helped to develop them, based on what they want their neighbourhoods to look like,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have a world-class plan and we know how to deliver it, but we cannot do it alone. We need the government to back us with sustained funding over the next 10 years to enable us to complete the Bee Network. If they do so, they will be helping create a model that can be replicated across the rest of the country.\u201d The report will be delivered to Westminster next month. Boardman said: \u201cAll 10 Greater Manchester councils have taken on this challenge and they\u2019ve already started transforming ambition into action. But without guaranteed government investment, we are hamstrung. \u201cTo revolutionise travel across a whole city region, we\u2019re asking for the same financial backing over a 10-year period as it\u2019s costing for a single junction improvement scheme in Bedford. I know which will return the best investment \u2013 not only for our city-region but the nation as a whole.\u201d",

I\u2019m just going to do what I want to do.\u201d Although race is an issue at the centre of Get Out, which follows a series of disturbing events when an African American man meets his white girlfriend\u2019s family, Kaluuya said he had played a wide variety of roles that often went ignored and he did not want to become \u201cthe race guy\u201d. \u201cThe Fades ain\u2019t about race, Psychoville ain\u2019t about race, Skins ain\u2019t about race, Chatroom ain\u2019t about race, Johnny English Reborn ain\u2019t about race. But that almost gets erased. There\u2019s a narrative that is pushed,\u201d he added. In his latest venture, Queen &amp; Slim, he stars alongside Jodie Turner-Smith as a couple who go on the run after a Tinder date gone wrong. While driving home the pair are pulled over by an aggressive policeman, whom Kaluuya\u2019s character, Slim, ends up shooting in self-defence. Kaluuya said he might have had some reservations about taking on another role that would lead to him being asked about race, but it was the love story element of the film that attracted him. \u201cYes, it\u2019s got those moments [about race] but that\u2019s more of a catalyst.\u201d The British actor and writer, from north London, has previously said he started doing more American movies as he felt he was not getting roles in England because of his skin colour. Now he has clarified that it was mainly to do with a lack of challenging roles, and at the age of 25 he found he was too old to play children, and too young to play men. His Black Panther co-star Michael B Jordan introduced an \u201cinclusion rider\u201d to his production company to ensure more diverse cast and crew. His film, Just Mercy, was one of the first to be made with the the rider in place, but it just missed out on an Oscar nomination. While he is working on another American film, Kaluuya said he would be open to doing something in the UK, such as a play upstairs in the Royal Court or at the Young Vic, but right now he wanted to experiment. \u201cThe good thing is there\u2019s no expectation on me, so I could bomb, but I\u2019ve had a good innings!\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Last March, when I went to Las Vegas for the very first time, I made sure to pack pens and paper. I knew we would need the supplies. We converged from various points on the US map: six of us, a guys\u2019 weekend in Sin City. On Friday afternoon, we dawdled in the Hard Rock hotel, waiting with impatience for the action to begin. Dusk fell, the neon rose, and we gathered in the lobby. Together we walked through the maze of slot machines and blackjack tables, past the bar and the steakhouse, past the flyers for burlesque revues and up into the nightclub.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/16/quiz-obsessive-podcast\">Question time: my life as a quiz obsessive \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And there, having spurned the vices of Vegas, we indulged our own, clustered around our team\u2019s answer sheet as a quizmaster barked questions at us. The weekend, Geek Bowl XIII, had been put together as a blowout for quiz fiends who attended bar trivia nights across the US and still yearned for more. Friday was a warm-up quiz: calisthenics before the big game. On Saturday, 240 teams spent the evening packed into a Hard Rock auditorium, sweating their brains over 65 questions. You could buy beer and snacks while you quizzed, but no one seemed particularly keen on alcohol. You drink to forget; you quiz to remember. The only Elvis impersonators I saw that weekend were part of a special round in the quiz, in which Vegas street-theatre performers staged cryptic re-enactments of famous movie scenes. (We had to identify the movies.) Another round had questions to which the answers all included types of cheese: Alison Brie, Goat, Grand Coulee Dam. In a third, we had to construct portmanteau phrases from images of snacks and celebrities. NutElla Fitzgerald. OvalTina Turner. Desmond TuTuna Helper. No quiz I\u2019ve ever attended has provoked this much pained groaning at the answers.</p> <p>Which is saying something, because I\u2019m entering my fourth decade of addiction. In my quizzing, there is to be found a story of my life. It is the single constant to which I\u2019ve clung as I bounced between schools, universities, jobs and cities. In India, where I grew up, my obsession began with inter-school quizzes: teams of two or three, sitting behind desks, fielding questions in turn. When I was eight, I took part in my first, in Delhi. We missed out on winning on a tie-breaker, and for a week afterwards, I replayed that moment in my mind so vividly that I found it hard to fall asleep at night. In 1999, when I went to an American university to study journalism, I discovered Quiz Bowl tournaments, for which we practised once a week, dividing up into teams and holding mock-contests in empty classrooms late into the night. I returned to India and, while working as a reporter, sank into the circuit of \u201copen\u201d quizzes, so-called because anyone is free to form a team and take part. Three years ago, after my wife and I moved for a brief stint to Ireland, I joined the Dublin Quiz League, conducted in pubs but otherwise a serious affair with difficult questions.</p> <p>Everywhere I have lived, I have attempted the World Quizzing Championship \u2013 an exam-like solo affair held all over the world on a particular June day. Last year, nearly 3,000 people took part. Its 240 questions, to be answered in two hours, are set by a tight group of enthusiasts who run the International Quizzing Association. For much of the year, I begin my days with a dose of six questions emailed to me and thousands of other subscribers of Learned League \u2013 an online quiz that solicits new players only through referrals from existing ones, divides us all into small brackets, and pits us against each other. (This morning, bound as ever by honour to refrain from Googling, I answered questions on shibboleths, umami, Assassin\u2019s Creed and Indian princely states, but blundered on Dora the Explorer and surf guitar.) During holidays with friends who are fellow addicts, we\u2019ve sought out pub quizzes: light fixes when we were craving the hard stuff. I wish I could say that we thought of them as dips into the local pub culture of Colombo, or Madrid, or Seattle, or Edinburgh, but we really went just for the questions. Whatever I\u2019m doing at any point of the day, it is probably safe to assume that I would rather be quizzing.</p> <p>We ended up not doing very well in Vegas; 100 teams and 25 points separated us from the winner of the $13,000 top prize. It was a reminder of how my quizzing has not only defined my life but has, in turn, been defined by it. Even in our age, when practically all the information in the world is available on our phones, what you know best is often a product of where you have been. In my team were five men who had grown up in India. The sixth, the lone American, had to bear the burden of recalling Tuna Helper, Yoo-Hoo and other snacks from his childhood; he was also the one we turned to when we needed to know the number of Canadian teams in the National Hockey League or the name of the country singer Tammy Wynette\u2019s husband. We felt like a basketball team playing with our shoelaces tied together.</p> <p>That we got many answers right nonetheless was the result of a remarkable shift in quizzing culture over the past two decades \u2013 another way in which quizzing has closely tracked my life. I started quizzing when I had the sticky memory of a teenager; my mind held facts without effort and yielded them instantly. Back in the 90s, quizzing demanded this quality above all else. As I got older, my mind shed some of its retentive powers. But quizzing, too, has changed; its questions have come to privilege not just memory but also breadth, deduction and lateral thinking. This new shape was a response to the rise of the internet, and it called upon a truer, more natural form of our relationship with knowledge \u2013 of what it means to know the answer to a question.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>There isn\u2019t even a word for us, really. Quiz players? Trivia fanatics? I prefer quizzers. But when I use that to describe myself to a civilian \u2013 to a non-quizzer \u2013 the inevitable inquiry follows: \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d For that question, ironically, there is no easy answer.</p> <p>The problem is not that no one knows what a quiz is. Quite the contrary, in fact; the problem is that nearly everyone has quizzed, or has at least seen a quiz, at some point in their lives. They have caught clips of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Or they have played a multiple-choice Friends trivia game online. Or they have been set a general knowledge quiz in school. Or they have learned to avoid the local pub on Tuesdays, when it hosts Trivia Night; in 2013, The Publican, a trade magazine, found that 23,000 out of the UK\u2019s 60,000-odd pubs have at least one quiz a week.</p> <p>Everyone knows how a quiz works: a question asked, an answer ventured, a binary verdict of correct or incorrect handed down, next question please. They suspect that quizzing depends upon an ability to soak up facts: capitals of US states, currencies of countries, names of authors, Academy award winners. Where they flounder is in imagining how something this commonplace can turn into a passion, into a marker of identity. A quizzer? It\u2019s like describing yourself as a doodler or a shower-singer.</p> <p>The most visible quizzes, the ones on TV, are also those that least graze the lives of quizzers. I have been on the Indian edition of Mastermind, and I have friends who have appeared on Only Connect, Jeopardy! and Millionaire. But these were one-offs. The selection process is competitive, and there are too few shows to sustain the ardent quizzer. The most frequent, hardcore quizzing always happens under the radar, attended by the few dozen regulars in each city who never stop wondering why their tribe isn\u2019t larger. For the Dublin Quiz League, we borrowed corner tables in pubs on slow weeknights: a quizmaster and two teams at each table, questions murmured out of earshot of the patrons sipping Guinness at the bar. In universities, Quiz Bowl tournaments requisition classrooms. In Bangalore, quizzes take place in a seminar hall rented from the Institution of Agricultural Technologists during holidays, when there isn\u2019t an agricultural technologist for miles around. So many quizzes happen on Sundays that a passerby peeping into one of these rooms anywhere in the world might take in the hushed conferrals and the gnostic atmosphere and believe that a Christian cult\u2019s prayer meeting is in session.</p> <p>In such quizzes, the material rewards are scanty, often non-existent. You compete for pride, and even that can only be enjoyed within the small, cramped confines of this subculture. The more pathetic the prize, it would seem, the greater the sincere quizzer\u2019s dedication. In Amsterdam, where I once happened to be on holiday on the day of the World Quizzing Championship, I came an all-Netherlands third and won a Jabra Bluetooth earpiece. It is my most sophisticated piece of quiz loot ever. I still haven\u2019t figured out how to sync it with my phone.</p> <p>When I was a member of the Pennsylvania State University Quiz Bowl Club, we would pool our money to rent a car, drive across two or three states and stay in a cheap motel near another university that was hosting a tournament. We would lug along \u201cthe Judge\u201d \u2013 a buzzer set built into a briefcase, with protruding red and green lights, looking for all the world like a B-movie bomb. (If you brought along your own buzzer, you got $5 or $10 knocked off your registration fee.) All weekend, our squad of four played half-hour University Challenge-style games against other teams, buzzing individually on 10-point questions and conferring on 30-point bonuses. The scorelines often ran tight, but the real drama was private, internal: the mortification at buzzing wrongly on a question your teammate surely knew; the glee at encountering a question your team had come across in practice only the previous week. Nominally, the tournament produced a champion: the team that had won the most games, and that often received just a kitschy trophy for its labours. Come Sunday evening, we would pack up the Judge, hop back into the car, and reach our dorms close to midnight. Sometimes, we would read questions to each other on the way home.</p> <p>In India too, the most intense quizzing events occupy all of a weekend. Quiz festivals, we call them, as if we\u2019re recognising them as rituals in the calendar of some deviant paganism. If you pass through the written preliminary round into the eight-team final, you will encounter some of the most elaborate quizzes on the planet; one film quiz I attend every June plays almost 100 minutes of video, short snatches patiently clipped and reclipped to offer a clue or reveal an answer. Across seven or eight quizzes over three days, a quizzer might face as many as 600 questions. By Sunday evening, you feel as if someone has been punching you in the head; you also feel deeply sorry that the weekend is over.</p> <p>To attend these contests, quizzers rearrange the furniture of their lives, budgeting their time away from their families, or ensuring that they don\u2019t travel overseas for work during a quiz weekend. I know one quizzer who switched jobs because his city\u2019s quiz scene wasn\u2019t active enough; I know another who scheduled his wedding to avoid a clash with a quiz. Once, while we were waiting around for a popular annual quiz to begin, a friend remarked that his wife was heavily pregnant; he hoped she wouldn\u2019t go into labour over the next few hours. That would be unfortunate, we agreed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf my daughter\u2019s born today, that means she\u2019ll have a birthday party on this date every year. Which means I can never come to this quiz again.\u201d</p> <p>Admitting to such a fevered love isn\u2019t a good look, I realise. The very premise of quizzing can appear to be a fetishising of book learning:<strong> </strong>of facts memorised for their own sake, instead of being learned from any true engagement with life. At best, this can feel charmingly antique in the 21st century, when the internet and its infinite electronic lobes do our remembering for us. At worst, quizzers are thought to suck up facts only to win meaningless contests that cater to their intellectual vanities; they are typecast as people who have such a transactional relationship with knowledge that they really can be said to know very little at all.</p> <p>But at its finest, quizzing today is never about shallow recall; it\u2019s an exercise in nimble thinking, and possibly the only forum where the entirety of your life \u2013 everything you\u2019ve ever seen, read, tasted, heard, heard of, or lived through \u2013 can be marshalled as pure knowledge. A friend of mine, an English professor in a college in Bangalore, once called quizzing an act of bricolage \u2013 a term that the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss used to describe how even a small number of ideas may be mixed and combined to create something novel and unforeseen. The process thrives on freshness and play, and it holds a sense of limitless possibility \u2013 of producing many, many things we never knew out of the few things we do know.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The deconstruction of a question is one of quizzing\u2019s high pleasures. Here\u2019s one that I set for a quiz a few years ago. The root word is the proto-Indo-European <em>bhel</em>. Out of this springs a host of related words (in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese) and also an English word. Strangely, the English word is precisely the opposite of the others. The reason, it has been surmised, has to do with fire, <em>bhel</em>. The words of the Romance languages refer to the brightness of fire, but the English word refers to its final remains. What words are we talking about?</p> <p>The question is designed for teamwork and deductive leaps, not for quick familiarity with proto-Indo-European etymologies. The brightness of fire and its final remains evoke two images: the white heat of flame and the char left behind. They are opposites, most evidently, by virtue of their colours. If the English word describing the char is \u201cblack\u201d, then the Romance counterparts must be translations of \u201cwhite\u201d: <em>blanca</em>, <em>blanc</em>, <em>bianca</em>, <em>branca</em>, all words that might very conceivably have derived from <em>bhel</em>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a difficult question, but I love it for its feat of bricolage \u2013 for how it does so much with so little. The foreknowledge potentially required to answer it is minimal: really, just the word for \u201cwhite\u201d in any one of a number of European languages. You don\u2019t need to speak fluent French or Spanish to have come across terms like carte blanche\u201d or Casablanca, and the merest curiosity about their literal meanings will have yielded all that you require.</p> <p>But with this single key, such a rich universe is unlocked: the evolution of language, and its elemental roots; the beautiful, contradictory union of black and <em>blanc</em>: everyday words which, at the slightest inquisitive tug, divulge their history. The answer is satisfying even if you don\u2019t solve it. It has what University Challenge\u2019s question-setters call \u201cinherent interest\u201d, and what Indian quizzers call \u201cfunda\u201d, short for fundamental: an easy appeal for anyone, and a burst of joy at encountering an unsuspected elegance in the world.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When I was 15 or 16, in 1997, we got our first internet connection at home, and I discovered Quiznet, a mailing list<strong> </strong>full of junkies like me. You could set a quiz and send it out; people wrote to you with their attempts over the subsequent week, and then you released their scores and the correct answers. In my first Quiznet quiz, which included<strong> </strong>seven questions on cocktails, I asked: \u201cWhich cocktail, made of bourbon, sugar and mint, is associated with the Kentucky Derby?\u201d Answer: the mint julep. I had read about the Kentucky Derby in a book; I\u2019ve forgotten its title, but the mint julep has stuck.</p> <p>This standard model of quizzing \u2013 short, stiff questions, to which you either knew the answer or you didn\u2019t \u2013 had been around in India for decades. Its progenitor, in quizzing lore, was a Calcutta man named Neil O\u2019Brien who had spent time in England, grown fond of its pub quizzes and taken the concept back with him. Even when he conducted his first quiz, at a parish hall in 1967, quizzing was a relatively young pursuit, in comparison to the life spans of other pastimes. The Romans did not quiz. Neither did the Aztecs. We have no evidence of quizzing in Mughal India or Ming China. It didn\u2019t feature among the parlour games of the 19th century. The Victorians preferred charades or squeak piggy squeak, a variation of blind man\u2019s bluff \u2013 perhaps understandably, because at the time, to ask questions about distant countries or art or literature would have presumed an implausible breadth of access to texts and education.</p> <p>The first quizzes emerged, naturally, in schools, where students could be tested on a shared body of knowledge. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/king-william-s-college-quiz\" title=\"\">King William\u2019s College, on the Isle of Man, has wrung answers out of its pupils in an annual quiz that began in 1905</a>. In 1934, the year O\u2019Brien was born, the quiz\u2019s categories included bishops, coinage and literary queens, and its questions already wore the garb of the cryptic-crossword clue for which it later became famous. \u201cWho balked who of his fame \u2018with a worm\u2019?\u201d If you didn\u2019t recall that phrase from the 288-line Tennyson poem A Dream of Fair Women, you had only the slenderest hope of responding correctly with Cleopatra and Caesar. This was not a quiz for lackadaisical readers.</p> <p>In the US, the military tested basic knowledge as part of its Alpha examination of recruits. (A 1921 multiple-choice form asked: \u201cThe Penguin is a: Bird, Reptile, Insect.\u201d No intimacies with Tennyson were required.) But for a while, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alan-connor\" title=\"\">Alan Connor</a> recounts in his book The Joy of Quiz, the purpose of this pursuit remained foggy, if intriguing. The two authors of Ask Me Another!, a compendium of questions published in 1928, thought it a fine idea to quiz celebrities and record their performances, but they were often met with confusion. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite understand just what it was he wanted to do to me,\u201d the humourist Robert Benchley wrote after being approached by one of the authors. The book sold well, but it didn\u2019t seem to spread the love very far. Why would anyone wish to commit such arcane details to memory, reviewers wondered. \u201cA man who treasures up a piece of information like the height of the Brooklyn Bridge has a screw loose somewhere,\u201d the New York World decided.</p> <p>By the time the second world war ended, though, the culture shifted, and quizzing came to be appreciated as entertainment, not imposition. The knowledge \u201cbees\u201d on British radio inspired quizzes in pubs and youth clubs. On US television, shows such as Twenty-One and The $64,000 Question drew rapt audiences. In 1953, US universities also started to compete in a radio programme called College Quiz Bowl; it moved to TV as College Bowl and provided the template for University Challenge in Britain, which first aired on ITV in 1962.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e76d92d4b6af905c64902a75a6ab7e650823fd53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76d92d4b6af905c64902a75a6ab7e650823fd53/0_6_1654_992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"QUIZ WEB v2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The questions in Quiz Bowl, College Bowl\u2019s direct descendant, are thickly academic. When I first quizzed at university, I needed a few months to calibrate myself \u2013 to get used to dredging answers not out of my recreational reading but out of my textbooks and classroom lectures. But I came to relish the density of the toss-ups \u2013 the starter questions, as they are called on University Challenge \u2013 and how they unwrap themselves in orderly fashion. A question starts with the most opaque clues: \u201cA wreath of flowers sent to this politician\u2019s funeral is the origin for the name of the Primrose League.\u201d More facts follow; midway, perhaps at \u201cHe controversially took a loan from Lionel de Rothschild\u201d, there is just enough light and enough material to buzz in with a guess. Certainly at the transparent end \u2013 \u201cName this Conservative prime minister of Jewish descent, the rival of William Gladstone\u201d \u2013 we know the answer is Benjamin Disraeli.</p> <p>The delight lies in how certain facts may be obscure to some and immediately clear to others, or how even the same information may be held and organised in different ways by different minds. Once, at a tournament, I buzzed after three words \u2013 \u201cPresident Cheddi Jagan\u201d \u2013 and, in wild surmise that the question would ask for a country, ventured: \u201cGuyana\u201d.</p> <p>I was right, but there was no reason for me to have known that \u2013 except that, years ago, I\u2019d seen Jagan in a cheesy Unesco advertisement that played throughout the breaks of an India-West Indies cricket broadcast. He appeared above his name and title, offering such a cheesy thumbs-up that I\u2019ve never forgotten him.<strong> </strong>In the same game, I came up empty while trying to remember the name of the Deccan Plateau \u2013 the triangular chunk of southern India, where I lived for much of my childhood. There is nothing to be done about the caprices of memory \u2013 but somehow, that makes quizzing more exciting, not less. And it sweetens the sudden, climactic illumination: the microsecond when the brain, acting almost outside your will, pulls the clues together to recognise the answer, as cleanly as if you had known it all along. The quest for that moment is the source of the addiction.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>There are so many different formats of quizzing that no one can be described as the world\u2019s best quizzer. But Pat Gibson can certainly stake a claim. He\u2019s won the World Quizzing Championship four times. In 2004, he won a phlegmatic million on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?; in 2006, he won Brain of Britain, the BBC Radio 4 quiz. Today his diet involves three quiz leagues in which his team takes part. \u201cSerious quizzing,\u201d Gibson said approvingly, describing the leagues to me when we met in November. Additionally, five or six weeks a year, he takes the train from Wigan, where he lives, to Glasgow, to appear as an Egghead on the BBC show of that name. The format often requires a challenger to take Gibson on solo. You have to feel for the challenger.</p> <p>Gibson, 58, didn\u2019t properly start quizzing until he was in his early 30s. Growing up in Ireland, he devoured atlases and maps, but he only ever went to one major quiz: the Brain of Ireland, where, as a teenager, he got stage fright and didn\u2019t say a word. After moving to England, he worked as a software engineer, and in the 90s, a colleague roped him into a quiz league. He got so good that, a decade later, he decided to do it more seriously.</p> <p>Gibson has built himself software into which he keys facts that he comes across; on some days, he will add as many as 100 facts to his database, culled from books, TV or his perusal of The Times over breakfast. If he is driving and he hears something compelling on the radio, he will pull over and scribble it down in the notebook he always carries with him. He sets time aside for revision. He may decide, next week, that it\u2019s been too long since he brushed up on the Vietnam war, so he will call up the file and study it. He has built files on all sorts of subjects. Sometimes he wonders if he could acquire an appreciation of, say, Ibsen\u2019s plays purely via his Ibsen file, without watching or reading any of the plays themselves.</p> <p>Frequently, Gibson talks about questions as if he were Genghis Khan surveying central Asia: \u201cAll those individual little fortresses, each one begging to be conquered,\u201d he says, practically licking his lips in anticipation. People often assume that his only weapon is his tenacious memory. \u201cWell, yes, remembering is obviously important,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it isn\u2019t decisive.\u201d Even after mastering a database, there is no way to know every possible question-answer pair cold; nearly always, a quizzer is making a reasoned guess, even when they are certain that their answer is correct. What Gibson values far more than memory is his capacity to submerge himself in a topic. \u201cIf you answered a question about Alexander the Great, it\u2019s because you were interested in Alexander the Great, and you read about Alexander the Great,\u201d he said. \u201cCuriosity \u2013 there\u2019s a big payoff for curiosity.\u201d</p> <p>Within the philosophy of quizzing, it isn\u2019t easy to define what precisely makes a fact worth retaining. It has to have the ring of novelty, or the tilt of oddity, or the gloss of some human achievement; it has to sit at an angle to all the rest of the information that continually laps at our feet. \u201cThe number of eggs produced every year in Cambridgeshire \u2013 that isn\u2019t interesting to a quizzer,\u201d Gibson says. Unless the number is zero, it isn\u2019t distinctive; other counties produce eggs, too, and the statistic says nothing intriguing about Cambridgeshire. On the other hand, on the morning of the day we met, Gibson had prospected a nugget out of the newspaper: that the actor Eddie Marsan has situs inversus, a condition in which the positions of major internal organs are flipped into the opposite side of the body. That only seemed to beguile Gibson into further inquiry. How common is situs inversus? How does the human frame handle this inversion? Who else has situs inversus? The fact went straight into Gibson\u2019s database.</p> <p>Every quizzer practises some such form of information triage. (On my phone, a Notes file is dedicated to gobbets of fact that I\u2019ve come across and want to pursue. The latest entry: \u201cThe names of hydrogen and oxygen \u2013 Greek for \u2018water-former\u2019 and \u2018acid-former\u2019 respectively \u2013 should actually be reversed. It\u2019s hydrogen that forms acids and oxygen that forms water.\u201d) This habit can make quizzing out to be a kind of intellectual escapism \u2013 a constant flight from the big, boring everyday into the eccentric or the significant. But it is, in fact, the opposite. Quizzing invites us to pay extra attention, not only to what we read or watch but also to what is around us. </p> <p>For all its flaws, Slumdog Millionaire got that part about quizzing right. In the movie, Jamal Malik, a young man from Mumbai\u2019s slums, goes on a hot streak on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, prompting suspicion in everyone. How would a kid like this, with his narrow, limited existence, know the statesman whose portrait appears on a $100 bill or the city in which Cambridge Circus lies? But he had been tipped $100 by an American tourist while working as a phoney tour guide at the Taj Mahal, and he had served tea in a call centre where the clusters of cubicles and their aisles were named after British cities and their streets. That\u2019s how he knew.</p> <p>In less dramatic, Oscar-winning ways, that has happened to every quizzer: an answer pried out of some ancient circumstance, like Cheddi Jagan from a Unesco advertisement. In psychology, episodic memory is distinguished from semantic memory. The first recollects autobiographical events \u2013 past birthdays, a first kiss, a car accident \u2013 while the second stores facts, like names of cities or Ballon d\u2019Or winners or chemical element symbols. In our minds, during a quiz, these categories don\u2019t feel nearly as separate; every slice of episodic memory seems to be embedded with facts that we can pick out, like plums in a pie. During one of his Mastermind runs, Gibson got a question about the USS Pueblo, a spy ship once captured by North Korea. \u201cIt was like a Proustian moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a flash, I was back to being a boy, sitting on the floor of our house in Letterkenny, reading a Reader\u2019s Digest article on the Pueblo.\u201d Even our most secondhand knowledge is tied intimately to our first-hand experiences. If you stay alert and inquisitive, the best preparation for quizzing can be life itself.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>My time in quizzing has overlapped tidily with the web\u2019s renovation of the sport. Mainly, its effect has been to vastly expand the realm of subjects that might feature in quiz questions. In the US, the more academic style of Quiz Bowl was supplemented in the late 1990s by<strong> </strong>Trash tournaments, which quizzed students on video games, comic books, pop music and decidedly non-classic TV and cinema. The web held reservoirs of detail about these topics that made it possible to frame sound questions about them; in an earlier era, setting a Trash question pack by relying on the library would have been a punishing task.</p> <p>European quizzes grew more capacious as well. \u201cI\u2019ve looked in old quiz books, and the questions are dreadful, frankly,\u201d Jack Waley-Cohen, one of the question editors for the BBC show Only Connect, told me. \u201cThere was an assumption that everybody knew the same things.\u201d Now, quizmasters don\u2019t ever ask who the chancellor of the exchequer was in 1973, he said. \u201cFor one, someone who is an expert in television or music has an opportunity to demonstrate it, because there are questions on that. But also, the questions I like don\u2019t test absolute knowledge. They test lateral thinking, and your ability to access knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>The greatest internet-driven transformation has occurred in Indian quizzing, where questions have bloomed into intricate puzzles, strewing clues through wordplay, snippets of video, clips of audio, and photos. My morsel about the mint julep would never make the cut today: it\u2019s too dry, too plain. Questions are longer and denser now, and devised to be unlocked in multiple ways, as in the <em>blanc</em>-black case. Logic and teamwork are indispensable. In these quizzes, one may even lavish the compliment \u201cGood answer!\u201d \u2013 not for the right response, mind, but for a guess that makes inventive use of the facts provided. The creativity of this style of quizzing, I\u2019m convinced, is also a reaction to the stodginess that infects Indian education. Studying in India involves scant imagination and heavy doses of rote learning; examinations admit no such notion as a \u201cgood answer\u201d, merely correct and incorrect ones. Just as the internet offered its bottomless resources to those with wide, various interests, quizzing became a canvas to express these interests.</p> <p>In theory, the web ought to have democratised participation and success as well. \u201cAnyone can look anything up now, so the only investment is curiosity,\u201d Gibson told me. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason that someone from [the isolated Micronesian island] Nauru can\u2019t be the next World Quizzing Championship winner.\u201d Of this, I\u2019m not so sure. The hierarchies that order knowledge everywhere else are present in quizzing as well. A Nauruan quizzer will encounter fewer questions about centuries of Micronesian art than about the horse\u2019s head in Picasso\u2019s Guernica. New Western-centric canons bound into place alongside old ones \u2013 Game of Thrones cheek by jowl with the old Greek tragedies. But perhaps we are in the middle of a slow improvement, a gradual rearrangement of these hierarchies; certainly quizzes today represent the world much better than they did 20 or 30 years ago.</p> <p>The more perplexing issue is that of gender. The subculture tends to be overwhelmingly male \u2013 a problem that has been visible wherever I have quizzed, from Ireland to India. Local patterns of sexism might account for some of it. But the universality of this imbalance suggests that the old, male domination of systems of knowledge \u2013 even informal ones \u2013 is still solid and immovable, like a boulder across a road. As a result, quizzing lays itself open to the accusation that it doesn\u2019t try hard enough to be inclusive, and that it is content largely to be a space into which men can escape to hang out with other men \u2013 like poker nights, but for nerds who happen to know why a two-pair of black eights and aces is called a Dead Man\u2019s Hand. (When Wild Bill Hickok, the American frontiersman, was shot in the head during a poker game in a South Dakota saloon in 1876, these were supposedly the cards he held.) For all the quick intelligence that quizzing demands, it can also be slow and witless in avoiding the worst traits of the culture it inhabits.</p> <p>This is unfortunate, because quizzing really is, in principle, among the most equitable of sports. A well-set quiz will not cater exclusively to any inborn prowess. Instead, by being wide-ranging and original, it takes as its premise a powerful truth: no one knows everything, and everyone in the room knows something that the others don\u2019t. Each fresh question is played on a newly levelled field, offering the distinct possibility that the newcomer may beat the veteran to the answer. The guy on the couch never watches Ben Stokes get bowled in a Test match with the certainty that he could have done better. But he might well watch an Oxford team on University Challenge fumble an answer that he knows and be sure that, within that pocket of erudition, he has proven a winner.</p> <p>These individual triumphs can come about because no two lives experience the world in identical ways. There is something beautifully human about that, just as there is something beautifully human about the very act of remembering \u2013 especially now, when we are fast ceding our intelligence to our machines. We don\u2019t always need to remember facts any more, given that we can look them up or store them; more and more, we relieve our minds of this duty. But that\u2019s precisely why, in a quiz, it\u2019s gratifying to excavate answers from our memories, as if to prove to ourselves that we are still capable of it. And it feels pure and liberating that this is knowledge stripped of any practical purpose. It has lodged in our neurons not because it has been programmed in to serve a function, as with computers, but because the human brain is an insatiable, indiscriminating sponge.</p> <p>For the moment, too, it appears as if we have this caper of the intellect just to ourselves. The machines are already defeating us at chess and Go, solving mathematical problems, and identifying fake works of art. But as of now, they can only hoard deep reserves of facts, producing one of them when queried specifically for it. They only know what they can store; they don\u2019t yet have a way to go from not knowing to knowing, the way we do so unconsciously in quizzing. It is true that, in 2013, an IBM supercomputer named Watson trounced two former champions on US quiz show Jeopardy! But it turned out to be a perverse badge of pride for our species that IBM spent billions of dollars on the machine, deployed it in a quiz show where buzzer reflexes matter as much as answers, and had to discard its brute, fact-crunching approach for an algorithm that sifted hypotheses, appraised language, processed allusions, and made associations. Thinking like a human, it turned out, is still something that humans do better than machines.</p> <p>No other quizzing computers have come forth since. Which isn\u2019t to say that they won\u2019t ever; in fact, we may turn into such devices ourselves, if we elect to install the kind of brain-machine interfaces that Elon Musk and others want to develop. I suppose this will be like having a Google search bar in each of our heads, the cursor blinking, ready to ransack every viable bank of information. Maybe the power to know absolutely everything will result in some elevated, as yet unimaginable form of quizzing, but I have my doubts. Quizzing depends too much on not knowing. I don\u2019t mean this in the hard-nosed, free-market sense that only deficits of knowledge can determine winners and losers, or as airy solace that our limitations make us beautiful. I mean that the purpose of quizzing is to discover the answers, to work with meagreness, to build sufficiency out of insufficiency. It is to fashion your own lamp and guide yourself to the truth that black and <em>blanc</em> are shoots with the same root. In this manner, the world comes slowly into focus, question by question.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last March, when I went to Las Vegas for the very first time, I made sure to pack pens and paper. I knew we would need the supplies. We converged from various points on the US map: six of us, a guys\u2019 weekend in Sin City. On Friday afternoon, we dawdled in the Hard Rock hotel, waiting with impatience for the action to begin. Dusk fell, the neon rose, and we gathered in the lobby. Together we walked through the maze of slot machines and blackjack tables, past the bar and the steakhouse, past the flyers for burlesque revues and up into the nightclub. And there, having spurned the vices of Vegas, we indulged our own, clustered around our team\u2019s answer sheet as a quizmaster barked questions at us. The weekend, Geek Bowl XIII, had been put together as a blowout for quiz fiends who attended bar trivia nights across the US and still yearned for more. Friday was a warm-up quiz: calisthenics before the big game. On Saturday, 240 teams spent the evening packed into a Hard Rock auditorium, sweating their brains over 65 questions. You could buy beer and snacks while you quizzed, but no one seemed particularly keen on alcohol. You drink to forget; you quiz to remember. The only Elvis impersonators I saw that weekend were part of a special round in the quiz, in which Vegas street-theatre performers staged cryptic re-enactments of famous movie scenes. (We had to identify the movies.) Another round had questions to which the answers all included types of cheese: Alison Brie, Goat, Grand Coulee Dam. In a third, we had to construct portmanteau phrases from images of snacks and celebrities. NutElla Fitzgerald. OvalTina Turner. Desmond TuTuna Helper. No quiz I\u2019ve ever attended has provoked this much pained groaning at the answers. Which is saying something, because I\u2019m entering my fourth decade of addiction. In my quizzing, there is to be found a story of my life. It is the single constant to which I\u2019ve clung as I bounced between schools, universities, jobs and cities. In India, where I grew up, my obsession began with inter-school quizzes: teams of two or three, sitting behind desks, fielding questions in turn. When I was eight, I took part in my first, in Delhi. We missed out on winning on a tie-breaker, and for a week afterwards, I replayed that moment in my mind so vividly that I found it hard to fall asleep at night. In 1999, when I went to an American university to study journalism, I discovered Quiz Bowl tournaments, for which we practised once a week, dividing up into teams and holding mock-contests in empty classrooms late into the night. I returned to India and, while working as a reporter, sank into the circuit of \u201copen\u201d quizzes, so-called because anyone is free to form a team and take part. Three years ago, after my wife and I moved for a brief stint to Ireland, I joined the Dublin Quiz League, conducted in pubs but otherwise a serious affair with difficult questions. Everywhere I have lived, I have attempted the World Quizzing Championship \u2013 an exam-like solo affair held all over the world on a particular June day. Last year, nearly 3,000 people took part. Its 240 questions, to be answered in two hours, are set by a tight group of enthusiasts who run the International Quizzing Association. For much of the year, I begin my days with a dose of six questions emailed to me and thousands of other subscribers of Learned League \u2013 an online quiz that solicits new players only through referrals from existing ones, divides us all into small brackets, and pits us against each other. (This morning, bound as ever by honour to refrain from Googling, I answered questions on shibboleths, umami, Assassin\u2019s Creed and Indian princely states, but blundered on Dora the Explorer and surf guitar.) During holidays with friends who are fellow addicts, we\u2019ve sought out pub quizzes: light fixes when we were craving the hard stuff. I wish I could say that we thought of them as dips into the local pub culture of Colombo, or Madrid, or Seattle, or Edinburgh, but we really went just for the questions. Whatever I\u2019m doing at any point of the day, it is probably safe to assume that I would rather be quizzing. We ended up not doing very well in Vegas; 100 teams and 25 points separated us from the winner of the $13,000 top prize. It was a reminder of how my quizzing has not only defined my life but has, in turn, been defined by it. Even in our age, when practically all the information in the world is available on our phones, what you know best is often a product of where you have been. In my team were five men who had grown up in India. The sixth, the lone American, had to bear the burden of recalling Tuna Helper, Yoo-Hoo and other snacks from his childhood; he was also the one we turned to when we needed to know the number of Canadian teams in the National Hockey League or the name of the country singer Tammy Wynette\u2019s husband. We felt like a basketball team playing with our shoelaces tied together. That we got many answers right nonetheless was the result of a remarkable shift in quizzing culture over the past two decades \u2013 another way in which quizzing has closely tracked my life. I started quizzing when I had the sticky memory of a teenager; my mind held facts without effort and yielded them instantly. Back in the 90s, quizzing demanded this quality above all else. As I got older, my mind shed some of its retentive powers. But quizzing, too, has changed; its questions have come to privilege not just memory but also breadth, deduction and lateral thinking. This new shape was a response to the rise of the internet, and it called upon a truer, more natural form of our relationship with knowledge \u2013 of what it means to know the answer to a question. * * * There isn\u2019t even a word for us, really. Quiz players? Trivia fanatics? I prefer quizzers. But when I use that to describe myself to a civilian \u2013 to a non-quizzer \u2013 the inevitable inquiry follows: \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d For that question, ironically, there is no easy answer. The problem is not that no one knows what a quiz is. Quite the contrary, in fact; the problem is that nearly everyone has quizzed, or has at least seen a quiz, at some point in their lives. They have caught clips of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Or they have played a multiple-choice Friends trivia game online. Or they have been set a general knowledge quiz in school. Or they have learned to avoid the local pub on Tuesdays, when it hosts Trivia Night; in 2013, The Publican, a trade magazine, found that 23,000 out of the UK\u2019s 60,000-odd pubs have at least one quiz a week. Everyone knows how a quiz works: a question asked, an answer ventured, a binary verdict of correct or incorrect handed down, next question please. They suspect that quizzing depends upon an ability to soak up facts: capitals of US states, currencies of countries, names of authors, Academy award winners. Where they flounder is in imagining how something this commonplace can turn into a passion, into a marker of identity. A quizzer? It\u2019s like describing yourself as a doodler or a shower-singer. The most visible quizzes, the ones on TV, are also those that least graze the lives of quizzers. I have been on the Indian edition of Mastermind, and I have friends who have appeared on Only Connect, Jeopardy! and Millionaire. But these were one-offs. The selection process is competitive, and there are too few shows to sustain the ardent quizzer. The most frequent, hardcore quizzing always happens under the radar, attended by the few dozen regulars in each city who never stop wondering why their tribe isn\u2019t larger. For the Dublin Quiz League, we borrowed corner tables in pubs on slow weeknights: a quizmaster and two teams at each table, questions murmured out of earshot of the patrons sipping Guinness at the bar. In universities, Quiz Bowl tournaments requisition classrooms. In Bangalore, quizzes take place in a seminar hall rented from the Institution of Agricultural Technologists during holidays, when there isn\u2019t an agricultural technologist for miles around. So many quizzes happen on Sundays that a passerby peeping into one of these rooms anywhere in the world might take in the hushed conferrals and the gnostic atmosphere and believe that a Christian cult\u2019s prayer meeting is in session. In such quizzes, the material rewards are scanty, often non-existent. You compete for pride, and even that can only be enjoyed within the small, cramped confines of this subculture. The more pathetic the prize, it would seem, the greater the sincere quizzer\u2019s dedication. In Amsterdam, where I once happened to be on holiday on the day of the World Quizzing Championship, I came an all-Netherlands third and won a Jabra Bluetooth earpiece. It is my most sophisticated piece of quiz loot ever. I still haven\u2019t figured out how to sync it with my phone. When I was a member of the Pennsylvania State University Quiz Bowl Club, we would pool our money to rent a car, drive across two or three states and stay in a cheap motel near another university that was hosting a tournament. We would lug along \u201cthe Judge\u201d \u2013 a buzzer set built into a briefcase, with protruding red and green lights, looking for all the world like a B-movie bomb. (If you brought along your own buzzer, you got $5 or $10 knocked off your registration fee.) All weekend, our squad of four played half-hour University Challenge-style games against other teams, buzzing individually on 10-point questions and conferring on 30-point bonuses. The scorelines often ran tight, but the real drama was private, internal: the mortification at buzzing wrongly on a question your teammate surely knew; the glee at encountering a question your team had come across in practice only the previous week. Nominally, the tournament produced a champion: the team that had won the most games, and that often received just a kitschy trophy for its labours. Come Sunday evening, we would pack up the Judge, hop back into the car, and reach our dorms close to midnight. Sometimes, we would read questions to each other on the way home. In India too, the most intense quizzing events occupy all of a weekend. Quiz festivals, we call them, as if we\u2019re recognising them as rituals in the calendar of some deviant paganism. If you pass through the written preliminary round into the eight-team final, you will encounter some of the most elaborate quizzes on the planet; one film quiz I attend every June plays almost 100 minutes of video, short snatches patiently clipped and reclipped to offer a clue or reveal an answer. Across seven or eight quizzes over three days, a quizzer might face as many as 600 questions. By Sunday evening, you feel as if someone has been punching you in the head; you also feel deeply sorry that the weekend is over. To attend these contests, quizzers rearrange the furniture of their lives, budgeting their time away from their families, or ensuring that they don\u2019t travel overseas for work during a quiz weekend. I know one quizzer who switched jobs because his city\u2019s quiz scene wasn\u2019t active enough; I know another who scheduled his wedding to avoid a clash with a quiz. Once, while we were waiting around for a popular annual quiz to begin, a friend remarked that his wife was heavily pregnant; he hoped she wouldn\u2019t go into labour over the next few hours. That would be unfortunate, we agreed. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf my daughter\u2019s born today, that means she\u2019ll have a birthday party on this date every year. Which means I can never come to this quiz again.\u201d Admitting to such a fevered love isn\u2019t a good look, I realise. The very premise of quizzing can appear to be a fetishising of book learning: of facts memorised for their own sake, instead of being learned from any true engagement with life. At best, this can feel charmingly antique in the 21st century, when the internet and its infinite electronic lobes do our remembering for us. At worst, quizzers are thought to suck up facts only to win meaningless contests that cater to their intellectual vanities; they are typecast as people who have such a transactional relationship with knowledge that they really can be said to know very little at all. But at its finest, quizzing today is never about shallow recall; it\u2019s an exercise in nimble thinking, and possibly the only forum where the entirety of your life \u2013 everything you\u2019ve ever seen, read, tasted, heard, heard of, or lived through \u2013 can be marshalled as pure knowledge. A friend of mine, an English professor in a college in Bangalore, once called quizzing an act of bricolage \u2013 a term that the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss used to describe how even a small number of ideas may be mixed and combined to create something novel and unforeseen. The process thrives on freshness and play, and it holds a sense of limitless possibility \u2013 of producing many, many things we never knew out of the few things we do know. * * * The deconstruction of a question is one of quizzing\u2019s high pleasures. Here\u2019s one that I set for a quiz a few years ago. The root word is the proto-Indo-European bhel. Out of this springs a host of related words (in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese) and also an English word. Strangely, the English word is precisely the opposite of the others. The reason, it has been surmised, has to do with fire, bhel. The words of the Romance languages refer to the brightness of fire, but the English word refers to its final remains. What words are we talking about? The question is designed for teamwork and deductive leaps, not for quick familiarity with proto-Indo-European etymologies. The brightness of fire and its final remains evoke two images: the white heat of flame and the char left behind. They are opposites, most evidently, by virtue of their colours. If the English word describing the char is \u201cblack\u201d, then the Romance counterparts must be translations of \u201cwhite\u201d: blanca, blanc, bianca, branca, all words that might very conceivably have derived from bhel. It\u2019s a difficult question, but I love it for its feat of bricolage \u2013 for how it does so much with so little. The foreknowledge potentially required to answer it is minimal: really, just the word for \u201cwhite\u201d in any one of a number of European languages. You don\u2019t need to speak fluent French or Spanish to have come across terms like carte blanche\u201d or Casablanca, and the merest curiosity about their literal meanings will have yielded all that you require. But with this single key, such a rich universe is unlocked: the evolution of language, and its elemental roots; the beautiful, contradictory union of black and blanc: everyday words which, at the slightest inquisitive tug, divulge their history. The answer is satisfying even if you don\u2019t solve it. It has what University Challenge\u2019s question-setters call \u201cinherent interest\u201d, and what Indian quizzers call \u201cfunda\u201d, short for fundamental: an easy appeal for anyone, and a burst of joy at encountering an unsuspected elegance in the world. * * * When I was 15 or 16, in 1997, we got our first internet connection at home, and I discovered Quiznet, a mailing list full of junkies like me. You could set a quiz and send it out; people wrote to you with their attempts over the subsequent week, and then you released their scores and the correct answers. In my first Quiznet quiz, which included seven questions on cocktails, I asked: \u201cWhich cocktail, made of bourbon, sugar and mint, is associated with the Kentucky Derby?\u201d Answer: the mint julep. I had read about the Kentucky Derby in a book; I\u2019ve forgotten its title, but the mint julep has stuck. This standard model of quizzing \u2013 short, stiff questions, to which you either knew the answer or you didn\u2019t \u2013 had been around in India for decades. Its progenitor, in quizzing lore, was a Calcutta man named Neil O\u2019Brien who had spent time in England, grown fond of its pub quizzes and taken the concept back with him. Even when he conducted his first quiz, at a parish hall in 1967, quizzing was a relatively young pursuit, in comparison to the life spans of other pastimes. The Romans did not quiz. Neither did the Aztecs. We have no evidence of quizzing in Mughal India or Ming China. It didn\u2019t feature among the parlour games of the 19th century. The Victorians preferred charades or squeak piggy squeak, a variation of blind man\u2019s bluff \u2013 perhaps understandably, because at the time, to ask questions about distant countries or art or literature would have presumed an implausible breadth of access to texts and education. The first quizzes emerged, naturally, in schools, where students could be tested on a shared body of knowledge. King William\u2019s College, on the Isle of Man, has wrung answers out of its pupils in an annual quiz that began in 1905. In 1934, the year O\u2019Brien was born, the quiz\u2019s categories included bishops, coinage and literary queens, and its questions already wore the garb of the cryptic-crossword clue for which it later became famous. \u201cWho balked who of his fame \u2018with a worm\u2019?\u201d If you didn\u2019t recall that phrase from the 288-line Tennyson poem A Dream of Fair Women, you had only the slenderest hope of responding correctly with Cleopatra and Caesar. This was not a quiz for lackadaisical readers. In the US, the military tested basic knowledge as part of its Alpha examination of recruits. (A 1921 multiple-choice form asked: \u201cThe Penguin is a: Bird, Reptile, Insect.\u201d No intimacies with Tennyson were required.) But for a while, as Alan Connor recounts in his book The Joy of Quiz, the purpose of this pursuit remained foggy, if intriguing. The two authors of Ask Me Another!, a compendium of questions published in 1928, thought it a fine idea to quiz celebrities and record their performances, but they were often met with confusion. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite understand just what it was he wanted to do to me,\u201d the humourist Robert Benchley wrote after being approached by one of the authors. The book sold well, but it didn\u2019t seem to spread the love very far. Why would anyone wish to commit such arcane details to memory, reviewers wondered. \u201cA man who treasures up a piece of information like the height of the Brooklyn Bridge has a screw loose somewhere,\u201d the New York World decided. By the time the second world war ended, though, the culture shifted, and quizzing came to be appreciated as entertainment, not imposition. The knowledge \u201cbees\u201d on British radio inspired quizzes in pubs and youth clubs. On US television, shows such as Twenty-One and The $64,000 Question drew rapt audiences. In 1953, US universities also started to compete in a radio programme called College Quiz Bowl; it moved to TV as College Bowl and provided the template for University Challenge in Britain, which first aired on ITV in 1962. The questions in Quiz Bowl, College Bowl\u2019s direct descendant, are thickly academic. When I first quizzed at university, I needed a few months to calibrate myself \u2013 to get used to dredging answers not out of my recreational reading but out of my textbooks and classroom lectures. But I came to relish the density of the toss-ups \u2013 the starter questions, as they are called on University Challenge \u2013 and how they unwrap themselves in orderly fashion. A question starts with the most opaque clues: \u201cA wreath of flowers sent to this politician\u2019s funeral is the origin for the name of the Primrose League.\u201d More facts follow; midway, perhaps at \u201cHe controversially took a loan from Lionel de Rothschild\u201d, there is just enough light and enough material to buzz in with a guess. Certainly at the transparent end \u2013 \u201cName this Conservative prime minister of Jewish descent, the rival of William Gladstone\u201d \u2013 we know the answer is Benjamin Disraeli. The delight lies in how certain facts may be obscure to some and immediately clear to others, or how even the same information may be held and organised in different ways by different minds. Once, at a tournament, I buzzed after three words \u2013 \u201cPresident Cheddi Jagan\u201d \u2013 and, in wild surmise that the question would ask for a country, ventured: \u201cGuyana\u201d. I was right, but there was no reason for me to have known that \u2013 except that, years ago, I\u2019d seen Jagan in a cheesy Unesco advertisement that played throughout the breaks of an India-West Indies cricket broadcast. He appeared above his name and title, offering such a cheesy thumbs-up that I\u2019ve never forgotten him. In the same game, I came up empty while trying to remember the name of the Deccan Plateau \u2013 the triangular chunk of southern India, where I lived for much of my childhood. There is nothing to be done about the caprices of memory \u2013 but somehow, that makes quizzing more exciting, not less. And it sweetens the sudden, climactic illumination: the microsecond when the brain, acting almost outside your will, pulls the clues together to recognise the answer, as cleanly as if you had known it all along. The quest for that moment is the source of the addiction. * * * There are so many different formats of quizzing that no one can be described as the world\u2019s best quizzer. But Pat Gibson can certainly stake a claim. He\u2019s won the World Quizzing Championship four times. In 2004, he won a phlegmatic million on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?; in 2006, he won Brain of Britain, the BBC Radio 4 quiz. Today his diet involves three quiz leagues in which his team takes part. \u201cSerious quizzing,\u201d Gibson said approvingly, describing the leagues to me when we met in November. Additionally, five or six weeks a year, he takes the train from Wigan, where he lives, to Glasgow, to appear as an Egghead on the BBC show of that name. The format often requires a challenger to take Gibson on solo. You have to feel for the challenger. Gibson, 58, didn\u2019t properly start quizzing until he was in his early 30s. Growing up in Ireland, he devoured atlases and maps, but he only ever went to one major quiz: the Brain of Ireland, where, as a teenager, he got stage fright and didn\u2019t say a word. After moving to England, he worked as a software engineer, and in the 90s, a colleague roped him into a quiz league. He got so good that, a decade later, he decided to do it more seriously. Gibson has built himself software into which he keys facts that he comes across; on some days, he will add as many as 100 facts to his database, culled from books, TV or his perusal of The Times over breakfast. If he is driving and he hears something compelling on the radio, he will pull over and scribble it down in the notebook he always carries with him. He sets time aside for revision. He may decide, next week, that it\u2019s been too long since he brushed up on the Vietnam war, so he will call up the file and study it. He has built files on all sorts of subjects. Sometimes he wonders if he could acquire an appreciation of, say, Ibsen\u2019s plays purely via his Ibsen file, without watching or reading any of the plays themselves. Frequently, Gibson talks about questions as if he were Genghis Khan surveying central Asia: \u201cAll those individual little fortresses, each one begging to be conquered,\u201d he says, practically licking his lips in anticipation. People often assume that his only weapon is his tenacious memory. \u201cWell, yes, remembering is obviously important,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it isn\u2019t decisive.\u201d Even after mastering a database, there is no way to know every possible question-answer pair cold; nearly always, a quizzer is making a reasoned guess, even when they are certain that their answer is correct. What Gibson values far more than memory is his capacity to submerge himself in a topic. \u201cIf you answered a question about Alexander the Great, it\u2019s because you were interested in Alexander the Great, and you read about Alexander the Great,\u201d he said. \u201cCuriosity \u2013 there\u2019s a big payoff for curiosity.\u201d Within the philosophy of quizzing, it isn\u2019t easy to define what precisely makes a fact worth retaining. It has to have the ring of novelty, or the tilt of oddity, or the gloss of some human achievement; it has to sit at an angle to all the rest of the information that continually laps at our feet. \u201cThe number of eggs produced every year in Cambridgeshire \u2013 that isn\u2019t interesting to a quizzer,\u201d Gibson says. Unless the number is zero, it isn\u2019t distinctive; other counties produce eggs, too, and the statistic says nothing intriguing about Cambridgeshire. On the other hand, on the morning of the day we met, Gibson had prospected a nugget out of the newspaper: that the actor Eddie Marsan has situs inversus, a condition in which the positions of major internal organs are flipped into the opposite side of the body. That only seemed to beguile Gibson into further inquiry. How common is situs inversus? How does the human frame handle this inversion? Who else has situs inversus? The fact went straight into Gibson\u2019s database. Every quizzer practises some such form of information triage. (On my phone, a Notes file is dedicated to gobbets of fact that I\u2019ve come across and want to pursue. The latest entry: \u201cThe names of hydrogen and oxygen \u2013 Greek for \u2018water-former\u2019 and \u2018acid-former\u2019 respectively \u2013 should actually be reversed. It\u2019s hydrogen that forms acids and oxygen that forms water.\u201d) This habit can make quizzing out to be a kind of intellectual escapism \u2013 a constant flight from the big, boring everyday into the eccentric or the significant. But it is, in fact, the opposite. Quizzing invites us to pay extra attention, not only to what we read or watch but also to what is around us. For all its flaws, Slumdog Millionaire got that part about quizzing right. In the movie, Jamal Malik, a young man from Mumbai\u2019s slums, goes on a hot streak on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, prompting suspicion in everyone. How would a kid like this, with his narrow, limited existence, know the statesman whose portrait appears on a $100 bill or the city in which Cambridge Circus lies? But he had been tipped $100 by an American tourist while working as a phoney tour guide at the Taj Mahal, and he had served tea in a call centre where the clusters of cubicles and their aisles were named after British cities and their streets. That\u2019s how he knew. In less dramatic, Oscar-winning ways, that has happened to every quizzer: an answer pried out of some ancient circumstance, like Cheddi Jagan from a Unesco advertisement. In psychology, episodic memory is distinguished from semantic memory. The first recollects autobiographical events \u2013 past birthdays, a first kiss, a car accident \u2013 while the second stores facts, like names of cities or Ballon d\u2019Or winners or chemical element symbols. In our minds, during a quiz, these categories don\u2019t feel nearly as separate; every slice of episodic memory seems to be embedded with facts that we can pick out, like plums in a pie. During one of his Mastermind runs, Gibson got a question about the USS Pueblo, a spy ship once captured by North Korea. \u201cIt was like a Proustian moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a flash, I was back to being a boy, sitting on the floor of our house in Letterkenny, reading a Reader\u2019s Digest article on the Pueblo.\u201d Even our most secondhand knowledge is tied intimately to our first-hand experiences. If you stay alert and inquisitive, the best preparation for quizzing can be life itself. * * * My time in quizzing has overlapped tidily with the web\u2019s renovation of the sport. Mainly, its effect has been to vastly expand the realm of subjects that might feature in quiz questions. In the US, the more academic style of Quiz Bowl was supplemented in the late 1990s by Trash tournaments, which quizzed students on video games, comic books, pop music and decidedly non-classic TV and cinema. The web held reservoirs of detail about these topics that made it possible to frame sound questions about them; in an earlier era, setting a Trash question pack by relying on the library would have been a punishing task. European quizzes grew more capacious as well. \u201cI\u2019ve looked in old quiz books, and the questions are dreadful, frankly,\u201d Jack Waley-Cohen, one of the question editors for the BBC show Only Connect, told me. \u201cThere was an assumption that everybody knew the same things.\u201d Now, quizmasters don\u2019t ever ask who the chancellor of the exchequer was in 1973, he said. \u201cFor one, someone who is an expert in television or music has an opportunity to demonstrate it, because there are questions on that. But also, the questions I like don\u2019t test absolute knowledge. They test lateral thinking, and your ability to access knowledge.\u201d The greatest internet-driven transformation has occurred in Indian quizzing, where questions have bloomed into intricate puzzles, strewing clues through wordplay, snippets of video, clips of audio, and photos. My morsel about the mint julep would never make the cut today: it\u2019s too dry, too plain. Questions are longer and denser now, and devised to be unlocked in multiple ways, as in the blanc-black case. Logic and teamwork are indispensable. In these quizzes, one may even lavish the compliment \u201cGood answer!\u201d \u2013 not for the right response, mind, but for a guess that makes inventive use of the facts provided. The creativity of this style of quizzing, I\u2019m convinced, is also a reaction to the stodginess that infects Indian education. Studying in India involves scant imagination and heavy doses of rote learning; examinations admit no such notion as a \u201cgood answer\u201d, merely correct and incorrect ones. Just as the internet offered its bottomless resources to those with wide, various interests, quizzing became a canvas to express these interests. In theory, the web ought to have democratised participation and success as well. \u201cAnyone can look anything up now, so the only investment is curiosity,\u201d Gibson told me. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason that someone from [the isolated Micronesian island] Nauru can\u2019t be the next World Quizzing Championship winner.\u201d Of this, I\u2019m not so sure. The hierarchies that order knowledge everywhere else are present in quizzing as well. A Nauruan quizzer will encounter fewer questions about centuries of Micronesian art than about the horse\u2019s head in Picasso\u2019s Guernica. New Western-centric canons bound into place alongside old ones \u2013 Game of Thrones cheek by jowl with the old Greek tragedies. But perhaps we are in the middle of a slow improvement, a gradual rearrangement of these hierarchies; certainly quizzes today represent the world much better than they did 20 or 30 years ago. The more perplexing issue is that of gender. The subculture tends to be overwhelmingly male \u2013 a problem that has been visible wherever I have quizzed, from Ireland to India. Local patterns of sexism might account for some of it. But the universality of this imbalance suggests that the old, male domination of systems of knowledge \u2013 even informal ones \u2013 is still solid and immovable, like a boulder across a road. As a result, quizzing lays itself open to the accusation that it doesn\u2019t try hard enough to be inclusive, and that it is content largely to be a space into which men can escape to hang out with other men \u2013 like poker nights, but for nerds who happen to know why a two-pair of black eights and aces is called a Dead Man\u2019s Hand. (When Wild Bill Hickok, the American frontiersman, was shot in the head during a poker game in a South Dakota saloon in 1876, these were supposedly the cards he held.) For all the quick intelligence that quizzing demands, it can also be slow and witless in avoiding the worst traits of the culture it inhabits. This is unfortunate, because quizzing really is, in principle, among the most equitable of sports. A well-set quiz will not cater exclusively to any inborn prowess. Instead, by being wide-ranging and original, it takes as its premise a powerful truth: no one knows everything, and everyone in the room knows something that the others don\u2019t. Each fresh question is played on a newly levelled field, offering the distinct possibility that the newcomer may beat the veteran to the answer. The guy on the couch never watches Ben Stokes get bowled in a Test match with the certainty that he could have done better. But he might well watch an Oxford team on University Challenge fumble an answer that he knows and be sure that, within that pocket of erudition, he has proven a winner. These individual triumphs can come about because no two lives experience the world in identical ways. There is something beautifully human about that, just as there is something beautifully human about the very act of remembering \u2013 especially now, when we are fast ceding our intelligence to our machines. We don\u2019t always need to remember facts any more, given that we can look them up or store them; more and more, we relieve our minds of this duty. But that\u2019s precisely why, in a quiz, it\u2019s gratifying to excavate answers from our memories, as if to prove to ourselves that we are still capable of it. And it feels pure and liberating that this is knowledge stripped of any practical purpose. It has lodged in our neurons not because it has been programmed in to serve a function, as with computers, but because the human brain is an insatiable, indiscriminating sponge. For the moment, too, it appears as if we have this caper of the intellect just to ourselves. The machines are already defeating us at chess and Go, solving mathematical problems, and identifying fake works of art. But as of now, they can only hoard deep reserves of facts, producing one of them when queried specifically for it. They only know what they can store; they don\u2019t yet have a way to go from not knowing to knowing, the way we do so unconsciously in quizzing. It is true that, in 2013, an IBM supercomputer named Watson trounced two former champions on US quiz show Jeopardy! But it turned out to be a perverse badge of pride for our species that IBM spent billions of dollars on the machine, deployed it in a quiz show where buzzer reflexes matter as much as answers, and had to discard its brute, fact-crunching approach for an algorithm that sifted hypotheses, appraised language, processed allusions, and made associations. Thinking like a human, it turned out, is still something that humans do better than machines. No other quizzing computers have come forth since. Which isn\u2019t to say that they won\u2019t ever; in fact, we may turn into such devices ourselves, if we elect to install the kind of brain-machine interfaces that Elon Musk and others want to develop. I suppose this will be like having a Google search bar in each of our heads, the cursor blinking, ready to ransack every viable bank of information. Maybe the power to know absolutely everything will result in some elevated, as yet unimaginable form of quizzing, but I have my doubts. Quizzing depends too much on not knowing. I don\u2019t mean this in the hard-nosed, free-market sense that only deficits of knowledge can determine winners and losers, or as airy solace that our limitations make us beautiful. I mean that the purpose of quizzing is to discover the answers, to work with meagreness, to build sufficiency out of insufficiency. It is to fashion your own lamp and guide yourself to the truth that black and blanc are shoots with the same root. In this manner, the world comes slowly into focus, question by question. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s peak welfare body has cautiously welcomed news the government will simplify income reporting for Centrelink recipients \u2013 a factor behind the multibillion-dollar robodebt debacle. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, said on Tuesday the government would this week release draft legislation for the changes, which are slated to save $2.1bn over five years \u2013 the biggest single savings measure in last year\u2019s budget. But the overhaul comes as the government counts the cost of being forced to back down on the robodebt scheme, with thousands of welfare recipients waiting to find out how much they will be repaid after they were wrongly pursued for Centrelink debts. Under the legislation, 1.2 million welfare recipients who are required to report their income each fortnight will now be able to enter the details recorded on their payslips, rather than being forced to calculate their earnings manually based on the number of shifts they have worked and their hourly pay rate. The chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, Cassandra Goldie, said on Tuesday the changes were positive because Centrelink reporting periods often did not match workplace pay cycles, leaving people to estimate or predict their earnings. \u201cWe welcome measures to improve accuracy of reporting income to reduce instances of people having to pay back overpayments,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s important that the system is accurate, and that people can easily make corrections where pre-filled data is incorrect. Also, Centrelink must be properly staffed to help people correct their records.\u201d The legislation will also facilitate an $82.4m expansion of the single touch payroll system, which sends income data from employers direct to the tax office in real time. From July, Centrelink recipients who worked for employers using the payroll system would have their income pre-filled, as already occurred with tax returns, the government said. Ruston said the changes would improve the welfare system for recipients. \u201cWe want to make sure that Australians who need financial support are able to get the support that they are eligible for \u2013 no less and no more,\u201d she said. \u201cThe current system of calculating earnings can be confusing and lead to misreporting especially when accounting for overtime or penalty rates. \u201cThese changes will make accurate reporting much easier for people getting a social security payment.\u201d But Goldie warned that the robodebt experience showed the dangers of automation, particularly the averaging of welfare recipients\u2019 income using tax office data. In November, the government settled a federal court challenge to the scandal-plagued scheme, acknowledging that it was unlawful. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know how much the government owes people who have paid false robodebts over the past three years,\u201d Goldie said. Labor\u2019s Bill Shorten and Linda Burney said in a joint statement they were yet to see the legislation, but that the government\u2019s record on digital delivery \u201cwill not fill anyone with great confidence\u201d. Services Australia officials told a Senate estimates committee late last year that staff were in the process of contacting welfare recipients about a review of the debt. They would not reveal how many debts might result in a refund to the welfare recipient, although staff have been told the figure is about 220,000. A total of 734,000 debts had been issued by August last year. By the middle of last year, the debt recovery program had reaped $1.9bn in fiscal savings on paper since 2015, but with many of debts being paid back in instalments, only $642.7m has actually been recovered. The government had banked further savings of $2.1bn over four years, which department officials acknowledged was likely to be possible only by expanding the scheme to include disability and age pensioners.",

      "bodyText": "Sport Australia reportedly raised concerns about the controversial $100m sports grant program, warning the Morrison government\u2019s administration was compromising its independence. In an explosive report, published on Tuesday, the ABC said Sports Australia executives complained about the program in March 2019, and revealed that the three lowest scored projects that nevertheless received funding were all in Coalition-held seats. The report is based on a leaked spreadsheet containing the merit scores of projects in the community sport infrastructure grant program, colour-coded by which party held the seat in which they were located. The program was the subject of a scathing auditor general\u2019s report which found the office of the former sports minister, Bridget McKenzie, conducted a parallel process, departing from Sport Australia\u2019s assessment of projects to skew grants towards target marginal seats. The government has so far weathered a storm of criticism and calls for McKenzie\u2019s resignation from Labor and the crossbench, but McKenzie\u2019s fate now rests with an investigation into whether she breached ministerial standards through her handling of the program. The ABC report for the first time provides examples of applications judged meritorious by Sport Australia but rejected by the minister, including a roller derby upgrade in the safe Nationals seat of Gippsland, which did not receive a grant despite a rating of 98%. The report said the Pakenham Football Club in the Victorian Liberal-held marginal seat of La Trobe received a $500,000 grant despite having an assessment score of 50%. According to the auditor general\u2019s report, if Sport Australia\u2019s recommendations had been followed, projects would have required a score of 74% or more to receive funding. The Wangaratta Clay Target Club reportedly received a score of 69%, below the threshold. The club received a $36,000 grant after gifting McKenzie a membership, a fact she failed to disclose on her senator\u2019s register of interests. Two projects in Scott Morrison\u2019s electorate of Cook were also below the threshold: the St George and Sutherland Shire Giants baseball club, with a score of 67, and Sans Souci Football Club, with a score of 59. The Applecross tennis club, which Guardian Australia revealed had received a $500,000 grant, was reportedly given a score of 54; while the Hawthorn-Malvern hockey centre in Josh Frydenberg\u2019s seat of Kooyong was granted $500,000 with a score of 62. The ABC reported that Sport Australia\u2019s executive director of sport partnerships, Robin O\u2019Neill, emailed McKenzie\u2019s then chief of staff, Richard Hyett, on 6 March, asking that he note the concerns of Sport Australia detailed in an email the day before. \u201cOur actions have been driven by our responsibility to provide the best advice to the Minister,\u201d O\u2019Neill reportedly wrote.

Under Miche\u00e1l Martin, a nimble political veteran, it has clawed back support and may overtake Fine Gael as the biggest party and lead the next coalition government.

Peace in Northern Ireland helped Sinn F\u00e9in rebrand as a working-class advocate opposed to austerity.

Saudi airstrikes had fallen 80% by one measure.</p> <p>Griffiths told the Guardian: \u201cThe remarkable achievements of de-escalation are at grave risk and we are in danger of going back to a war that is unwinnable. Certain pieces of ground can be captured and recaptured, but none of these are knockout blows, or substantially change the equation.\u201d</p> <p>The upswing in violence \u201ctold us is that the war is not over\u201d, Griffiths said. \u201cEveryone wants de-escalation and yet it seems difficult to achieve. It is a question of who goes first.\u201d</p> <p>Griffiths did not directly attribute the Marib attack to the Houthis, saying it was \u201ctragic, egregious and inexplicable\u201d. His job was to convene, and not condemn, he said. \u201cMy job is to find areas of commonality rather than judging parties. But we need to understand why it happened.\u201d</p> <p>Yemen\u2019s civil war escalated in 2014 when Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates came to the defence of the government of Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi after he was ejected from the capital by the Houthis, an Islamic political and armed movement that emerged from Sa\u2019dah in northern Yemen in the 1990s.</p> <p>As many as 100,000 people have been killed subsequently, and millions afflicted by severe food shortages. The UAE has pulled out of the war, and the Saudis appear to favour a peace in which the Houthis form part of a unified government.</p> <p>Griffiths acknowledged that the previous strategy of localised agreements before national talks, such as an agreement over the strategic port city of Hodeidah, was no longer appropriate.</p> <p>He said the crucial trigger for national talks over a transitional national coalition government was the implementation of an agreement negotiated by the Saudis in November between the Hadi government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist movement. The STC had seized the port city of Aden from Hadi last August, exposing a further fissure in Yemen\u2019s anti-Houthi alliance. \u201cProgress on the agreement is vital if we are to launch political talks,\u201d Griffiths said.</p> <p>Yemen\u2019s civil war has been complicated by the degree to which the Iranians are advising or arming the Houthis as a way of weakening their arch-rival Saudi Arabia. There is a fear that Iran will see Yemen as a way of hitting back against Saudi and American interests in the wake of Suleimani\u2019s killing, but Griffiths said: \u201cWe have no evidence that Iran has been asking the Houthis to mount any campaign.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

Certain pieces of ground can be captured and recaptured, but none of these are knockout blows, or substantially change the equation.\u201d The upswing in violence \u201ctold us is that the war is not over\u201d, Griffiths said. \u201cEveryone wants de-escalation and yet it seems difficult to achieve. It is a question of who goes first.\u201d Griffiths did not directly attribute the Marib attack to the Houthis, saying it was \u201ctragic, egregious and inexplicable\u201d. His job was to convene, and not condemn, he said. \u201cMy job is to find areas of commonality rather than judging parties. But we need to understand why it happened.\u201d Yemen\u2019s civil war escalated in 2014 when Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates came to the defence of the government of Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi after he was ejected from the capital by the Houthis, an Islamic political and armed movement that emerged from Sa\u2019dah in northern Yemen in the 1990s. As many as 100,000 people have been killed subsequently, and millions afflicted by severe food shortages. The UAE has pulled out of the war, and the Saudis appear to favour a peace in which the Houthis form part of a unified government. Griffiths acknowledged that the previous strategy of localised agreements before national talks, such as an agreement over the strategic port city of Hodeidah, was no longer appropriate. He said the crucial trigger for national talks over a transitional national coalition government was the implementation of an agreement negotiated by the Saudis in November between the Hadi government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist movement. The STC had seized the port city of Aden from Hadi last August, exposing a further fissure in Yemen\u2019s anti-Houthi alliance. \u201cProgress on the agreement is vital if we are to launch political talks,\u201d Griffiths said. Yemen\u2019s civil war has been complicated by the degree to which the Iranians are advising or arming the Houthis as a way of weakening their arch-rival Saudi Arabia. There is a fear that Iran will see Yemen as a way of hitting back against Saudi and American interests in the wake of Suleimani\u2019s killing, but Griffiths said: \u201cWe have no evidence that Iran has been asking the Houthis to mount any campaign.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus outbreak will have a \u201csignificant\u201d impact on Chinese growth, economists have warned, with the \u201cwildcard\u201d of still unknown infections posing potentially serious risks for the global economy. Shares in Asia Pacific continued to fall on Tuesday in the wake of heavy losses at the start of the week which has seen the death toll from the outbreak in China almost double in two days to 105. The number of infections has risen to 4,500, \u2013 that\u2019s up 45% from Monday, with China\u2019s authorities confirming the virus can be transmitted by \u201crespiratory droplet transmission\u201d or by touch. Markets in mainland China are closed until 3 February at the earliest, providing a bulwark to losses, but the financial contagion has spread across Asia and the rest of the world. South Korea, where a fourth case was confirmed on Tuesday, saw its Kospi index fall more than 3% and Australia\u2019s ASX200 was off 1.35%. Shares in Europe and the US suffered similar heavy losses on Monday. The yuan, China\u2019s currency, dropped to its lowest level for a month. Economists agreed that the outbreak will have a negative impact in China but the lack of understanding about how the virus spreads and how bad it might be was adding to uncertainty to the mix and compounding investor concerns. Citigroup said on Tuesday: \u201cThe wildcard is not the fatality rate, but how infectious the Wuhan virus is. The economic impact will depend on how successfully this outbreak is contained.\u201d The consultancy Capital Economics said the impact could be similar to the Sars outbreak in 2003 which knocked three percentage points off growth \u201cThe outbreak is developing too rapidly to predict with any confidence the final extent of the economic damage,\u201d said Capital\u2019s chief Asia economist Mark Williams. \u201cBut it is now certain that the outbreak will have a significant impact on China\u2019s GDP this quarter.\u201d And although China recovered quickly from Sars, Williams said the local economy was much stronger back in 2003 and was not facing the cyclical and structural headwinds posed by slowing population growth and industrialisation. Gerard Burg, senior international economist at the Australian bank NAB, agreed that it was hard to predict the impact of the outbreak because there was so little information or data coming out of China. But he said there would be a \u201cbig flow-on effect outside China, especially in south-east Asia because of the growing importance of Chinese tourism\u201d. He said countries such as Thailand, which depends on China for around one quarter of its 10 million annual tourists, \u201creally jumps out\u201d because Thailand may be hesitant about people travelling there from China and the Chinese, with many cities in lockdown, would not be able to travel. \u201cSouth-east Asia already felt the big brunt of the US trade war so there is potential for a negative impact,\u201d he said. Chinese authorities stepped up their attempts to control the spread on Tuesday as the capital Beijing recorded its first fatality from the outbreak and the country\u2019s second city, Shanghai, said it now has 13 confirmed cases. Another large industrial city, the steel-making centre of Tangshan, said that it was suspending public transport, adding to dozens of similar moves across the country where millions of people are in lockdown. Viet Nguyen, a senior research fellow in macroeconomics at the University of Melbourne, said that the restrictions already placed on many areas would mean Chinese consumers were spending less and making fewer journeys which would harm the economy. It was difficult to say what the final impact would be, he said, noting that Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, was not a major industrial area. But he added: \u201cIt depends how well China can contain the outbreak.

      "bodyText": "The bus company Greyhound Australia has ruled out any extension of work on the controversial Adani coal project after a backlash from climate change campaigners. On Sunday the SchoolStrike4Climate group launched a campaign to boycott travel with the company until it publicly ruled out working on the mine. Guardian Australia revealed last week that Greyhound had written to staff warning they could be caught \u201cin the crossfire\u201d of anti-Adani campaigners after the company took a three-month contract at the coal project, with an option to extend. The Indian-owned Adani mine and railway project is the first to begin work to extract the vast coal reserves of Queensland\u2019s Galilee basin. Greyhound is providing transport to workers for the construction company BMD, which is building the railway to take the coal to Adani\u2019s Abbot Point port. In a statement, Greyhound Australia said it had \u201creceived numerous messages, emails and phone calls from people expressing their thoughts both for and against the Carmichael Rail Network and Adani Carmichael project\u201d. It said: \u201cFollowing considered deliberation, and in the best interests of our staff, customers, and partners, Greyhound Australia has decided to not enter into a contractual agreement with BMD to service construction of the Carmichael Rail Network beyond our preliminary 31 March 2020 commitment.\u201d The company declined to comment further. Within hours of Guardian Australia\u2019s report on the contract, the conservation group Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation announced it had terminated a partnership with Greyhound. Greyhound\u2019s chief executive, Alex de Waal, also resigned as chairman of the foundation. Varsha Yajman, a spokesperson for SchoolStrike4Climate, said the group had launched a campaign to boycott Greyhound buses on Sunday. \u201cWe thank Greyhound for not throwing young people under a bus by continuing to help Adani build their climate-wrecking coalmine,\u201d she said.

Most Australians don\u2019t want the Adani mine and every single company with a retail brand has listened to their customers and dumped Adani. \u201cWe\u2019re already experiencing climate chaos and corporations simply have to take heed of an angry public increasingly willing to risk legal sanction for a liveable climate.\u201d In January the German technology company Siemens said it would honour its Adani contract after it reviewed a reported $30m contract with the project. The engineering firm GHD ended a 10-year association with Adani in December after that company was also targeted by campaigners. Julien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces, a group that tracks the relationships between corporations and fossil fuel industries, told Guardian Australia: \u201cAs Greyhound have discovered, and Siemens are in the middle of discovering, Adani\u2019s climate-wrecking mine is a surefire way to destroy your reputation. \u201cNow we need the likes of Siemens to realise what an appalling and ill-informed decision they have made to work on Carmichael and also pull the pin on their relationship with Adani.\u201d A BMD spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cOur contracts with clients and subcontractors are commercial in confidence and, as such, we do not disclose them publicly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Live coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial continues on Tuesday\u2019s blog: Donald Trump\u2019s defense team pushed a debunked conspiracy implicating Joe Biden, implied that Barack Obama was more deserving of impeachment than Trump is and argued \u2014 despite precedent\u2014 that nothing short of a serious crime is grounds for impeachment of any president. Among the lawyers who presented arguments today were Alan Derschowitz \u2014 a Harvard professor who gained notoriety for defending Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein \u2014 and Ken Starr, who spearheaded the investigation that led to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. One topic Trump\u2019s lawyers largely avoided: John Bolton. Amidst mounting pressure from Democrats and a few Republicans to call the former national security adviser to testify, the president\u2019s defense ignored new reports that Bolton claimed in an unpublished manuscript of his forthcoming book that Trump directly hinged military assistance to Ukraine on investigations of Democrats. The state department has removed an NPR reporter from the pool of journalists traveling to Europe and Asia with Mike Pompeo, following the secretary of state\u2019s public feud with the news organization. Trump said he\u2019ll announce an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan tomorrow, as the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his election opponent Benny Gantz visit Washington. Representative Doug Collins \u2013 a staunch Trump ally \u2013 is expected to run for Senate Doug Collins, the Republican representative from Georgia you may remember as a leading defender of Donald Trump during the president\u2019s impeachment, is expected to announce a run for Senate, according to multiple reports. Collins would face off against the GOP senator Kelly Loeffler, complicating the Republican party\u2019s efforts to hold on to the seat in what has become a battleground state. Georgia\u2019s Republican governor Brian Kemp appointed Loeffler to the Senate after Senator Johnny Isakson stepped down due to health concerns. Though Trump advocated for Collins as Isakson\u2019s replacement, Kemp chose Loeffler, a finance executive, and major Republican donor who some strategists believed would be competitive in suburban areas where support for the GOP has waned. Loeffler recently came under fire by conservative groups for sitting on the board of a hospital that performed abortions. She was in the news earlier today after she called out Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, for his openness to call witnesses to testify in the Senate trial. Advocating that the \u201cgolden rule of impeachment\u201d should be that Democrats \u201cdo unto Republicans\u201d as they want done unto them, White House counsel Pat Cipollone concluded today\u2019s oral arguments. But even as Donald Trump\u2019s defense team wrapped up for the night, the New York Times revealed more excerpts from John Bolton\u2019s unpublished book. The former national security advisor reportedly told Attorney General William Barr last year that he was concerned the president was granting personal favors to Turkey and China. From the Times: Mr. Barr responded by pointing to a pair of Justice Department investigations of companies in those countries and said he was worried that Mr. Trump had created the appearance that he had undue influence over what would typically be independent inquiries, according to the manuscript. Backing up his point, Mr. Barr mentioned conversations Mr. Trump had with the leaders, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Xi Jinping of China. Mr. Bolton\u2019s account underscores the fact that the unease about Mr. Trump\u2019s seeming embrace of authoritarian leaders, long expressed by experts and his opponents, also existed among some of the senior cabinet officers entrusted by the president to carry out his foreign policy and national security agendas. Mr. Bolton recounted his discussion with Mr. Barr in a draft of an unpublished book manuscript that he submitted nearly a month ago to the White House for review. People familiar with the manuscript described its contents on the condition of anonymity. The Times\u2019 report will only add to mounting pressure for lawmakers to summon Bolton to testify before the Senate. Democrats and a handful of Republicans have indicated that they\u2019re in favor of hearing from Bolton, either independently or in addition to testimony from Hunter Biden Alan Dershowitz broached a topic that members of Trump\u2019s defense team have largely avoided: John Bolton. \u201cNothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense,\u201d Derschowitz said, referring to reports that Bolton, a former national security adviser, had written a book in which he recounts that Trump told him in an August 2019 meeting that he did not want to send aid to Ukraine until that country delivered material relating to Joe Biden and to supporters of Hillary Clinton. Until now, Trump\u2019s legal team didn\u2019t mention Bolton, though they attacked Democrats for failing to present a witness with a first-hand account of Trump\u2019s thinking on Ukraine, The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy reported. Arguing that abuse of power allegations are a \u201cpolitical weapon\u201d, Alan Dershowitz claimed that George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, James Polk, Abraham Lincoln, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Barack Obama could all have been impeached by the standard. \u201cLincoln had dueling motives\u201d, Dershowitz added, noting that Abraham Lincoln was not so different than Donald Trump in that he wanted to advance his political career. In his constitutional argument against impeachment, Alan Dershowitz is arguing that nothing short of a \u201cserious crime\u201d is ground for impeachment. The House\u2019s articles of impeachment against DonaldTrump \u2014 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,\u2014 are \u201coutside the scope of impeachment\u201d, he said. It\u2019s only, for example, \u201cif a President committed extortion\u201d, Dershowitz said, he could be impeached for it. It\u2019s with nothing here that Congress\u2019 abuse of power article lays out what could be described as an extortion scheme. Dershowitz\u2019s argument here contradicts the consensus of most legal scholars and lawmakers. Both the Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton impeachment arguments hinged on \u201cabuse of power\u201d charges. Alan Dershowitz has taken the floor Dershowitz began by noting he voted for Hilliary Clinton. \u201cI would be making the same argument if Hillary Clinton, for whom I voted, stood accused of these same violations,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here today because I love my country and our constitution.\u201d He said he was there to \u201cto present a constitutional argument against the impeachment and removal not only of this President but of all and any future presidents who may be charged with the unconstitutional grounds of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress\u201d. Biden campaign on Trump defense: \u2018We didn\u2019t realize that Breitbart was expanding into Ted Talk knockoffs\u2019 Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has responded to allegations by Trump\u2019s defense team that he pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor to benefit his son. The Biden campaign\u2019s rapid-response director Andrew Bates said in a statement to reporters that Trump\u2019s defense was pushing a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d that \u201chas been conclusively refuted\u201d: The New York Times calls it \u2018debunked,\u2019 The Wall Street Journal calls it \u2018discredited,\u2019 the AP calls it \u2018incorrect,\u2019 and The Washington Post Fact Checker calls it \u2018a fountain of falsehoods.\u2019 The diplomat that Trump himself appointed to lead his Ukraine policy has blasted it as \u2018self serving\u2019 and \u2018not credible.\u2019 Joe Biden was instrumental to a bipartisan and international anti-corruption victory. It\u2019s no surprise that such a thing is anathema to President Trump. Read up on the Trump defense team: Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, film director Roman Polanski, boxer Mike Tyson and former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, is expected to present his opening arguments shortly. The Senate trial has reconvened and Robert Ray is delivering his opening arguments right now. During the dinner break, Republican senators disparaged Joe Biden, suggesting the Trump defense will and should affect Democratic primary voters and caucus-goers. Iowa caucuses are this next Monday evening and I\u2019m really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters,\u201d said Joni Ernst of Iowa. \u201cThose Democratic caucus-goers \u2014 will they be supporting Vice President Biden at this point? Not as certain about that.\u201d \u201cThe four people whose eyes were fully wide open were Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Michael Bennett, and Amy Klobuchar \u2014 all leaning forward. I\u2019ve never seen them so attentive as when this discussion was on Joe Biden.\u201d echoed John Barrasso of Wyoming. The State Department has removed an NPR reporter from the pool of journalists traveling to Europe and Asia with Mike Pompeo, following the Secretary of State\u2019s public feud with the news organization. In a statement, the State Department Correspondents\u2019 Association president said it seemed as if the State Department was \u201cretaliating against National Public Radio\u201d after a contentious interview with NPR host Marie Louise Kelly. Last week, Kelly revealed that Pompeo angrily asked her to find Ukraine on an unmarked map and used expletives in his conversation with her, after she questioned him about Ukraine. Fact Check: What Trump\u2019s defense mischaracterized about Barack Obama\u2019s conversation with Moscow Trump\u2019s legal team tried to turn the tables, characterizing a conversation between Barack Obama and Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev as \u201cunquestionable quid pro quo\u201d. The conversation they were referring to was caught on a \u201chot\u201d microphone during what the two leaders believed was a private moment during a 2012 nuclear summit in South Korea. Obama asked Medvedev to tell incoming Russian president Vladimir Putin to give him time to negotiate contentious issues like missile defense: \u201cThis is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility,\u201d Obama said. The former president wasn\u2019t offering or withholding anything; at the time, Republicans criticized what they saw as a lack of resolve to keep Putin in check. But Obama never offered or withheld anything from the Russians in exchange for a personal favor, as Trump\u2019s legal team tried to claim. Speaking to reporters during the dinner break, Republican senators steered clear of the Obama allegations. \u201cThe point is: that we might have a Republican House and a Democratic president and in that situation, with this becoming a new normal in America, that Democratic president might be impeached,\u201d said Mike Lee, a Republican of Utah. Speaking to reporters outside the Senate chamber, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said it\u2019s unnecessary to call more witnesses. If any witnesses are to be called, he said, \u201cThe most important witness the Senate needs to hear from at this point is Hunter Biden\u201d Other Republican senators, including John Barrasso of Wyoming and Mike Braun of Indiana, indicated if the Senate does summon witnesses, they would back a \u201cone-for-one\u201d deal where each party got to call one person to testify. The Senate is now taking a 45-minute dinner break. It looks like some have Chick-fil-A on the way. The Trump defense team has debuted a new tactic. Lawyer Eric Herschmann has accused Barack Obama of soliciting interference in the 2012 election by asking Russia to give him \u201cspace\u201d on missile defense. Herschmann characterized a 2012 communication between Obama and former Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev as \u201cunquestionable quid pro quo\u201d. \u201cIt was President Obama, not President Trump, who was weak on Russia,\u201d Herschmann said, arguing that Article 1 of Trump\u2019s impeachment better applied to Obama. Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican of Pennsylvania, has reportedly pushed to have two witnesses testify: one called by the Democrats and one by Republicans. Amid new allegations that the president told John Bolton in to keep withholding nearly $400m of security aid to Ukraine, a few Republican senators have signaled openness to calling Bolton as a witness in the impeachment trial. According to multiple reports, we can count Toomey among that group \u2013 which includes Utah senator Mitt Romney and Susan Collins of Maine. Last week, Democratic senators and aides had also proposed making a witness deal, but lawmakers denied that they\u2019d be willing to make such a trade. Joe Biden has also said he won\u2019t testify. Selectively presenting media coverage of the Bidens and Burisma, Pam Bondi reiterated the disproved allegation that Joe Biden encouraged the removal of Ukrainian prosecutor Victor Shokin because Shokin was investigating Burisma, the national gas company where Biden\u2019s son Hunter worked. In fact, Shokin refused to cooperate with an investigation of money laundering at Burisma, led by British authorities. US and European governments lobbied for the removal of Shokin due to his repeated failure to fight corruption in Ukraine. Although Shokin himself has said that he has Burisma in his sights, the prosecutor\u2019s deputy told Bloomberg that they did nothing to pursue such an investigation into Burisma. Bondi also repeatedly claimed that Trump\u2019s legal team had no choice but to discuss the Bidens and Burisma because the news media and has been pressing the issue. This contradicts Republican senators who have criticized a lack of media scrutiny of the Bidens. Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff: VP never linked Ukraine aid to investigations into Bidens or Burisma Marc Short issued the following statement: As matter of policy we don\u2019t typically share or discuss conversations between the President and Vice President, but given the journalistic fury over alleged conversations, the President has given me permission to set the record straight. In every conversation with the President and the Vice President in preparation for our trip to Poland, the President consistently expressed his frustration that the United States was bearing the lion\u2019s share of responsibility for aide to Ukraine and that European nations weren\u2019t doing their part. The President also expressed concerns about corruption in Ukraine. At no time did I hear him tie aid to Ukraine to investigations into the Biden family or Burisma. As White House Counsel presented today, based upon testimony provided by Democrat witnesses in the House hearings, these were the only issues that the Vice President discussed with Ukrainian officials \u2013 because that\u2019s what the President asked him to raise. Pam Bondi, a lawyer, lobbyist and the former attorney general of Florida, is now going after the Bidens and Burisma. \u201cWe would prefer not to be discussing this. But the House managers have placed this squarely at issue, so we must address it\u201d she said. Bondi is pushing a debunked allegation Joe Biden, as the vice-president, advocated for a Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s dismissal because the prosecutor was investigating Burisma, a natural gas company where Biden\u2019s son Hunter was working. Bondi is a longtime supporter of Trump. In 2013, while Bondi was the attorney general of Florida, Trump donated $25,000 to a group supporting her; critics later questioned whether the donation was given in exchange for Bondi\u2019s office ending an investigation into Trump University, which had been accused of fraud. That\u2019s it from me today. I\u2019m handing the blog over to my west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump\u2019s lawyers continued their opening arguments in the impeachment trial as questions remained over whether the Senate would call John Bolton, the former national security adviser, to testify. A handful of Republican senators signaled they were opening to calling Bolton to testify after the former official reportedly claimed in a manuscript of his forthcoming book that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. Ken Starr, one of the president\u2019s lawyers who led the investigation that led to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, ironically warned of the political dangers of impeachment becoming \u201cnormalized\u201d. The supreme court ruled that the Trump administration could allow its \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule to go into effect as legal battles over the controversial immigration policy play out in the courts. Trump said he would announce the administration\u2019s Israeli-Palestinian peace plan tomorrow, as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Netanyahu\u2019s election opponent, Benny Gantz, visit Washington. Maanvi will have more updates as the impeachment trial continues, so stay tuned. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin pointed to historical clashes between the executive and legislative branches, dating back to George Washington\u2019s presidency, as evidence that there is precedent for pushing back against congressional oversight. \u201cThe idea that invoking privilege and claiming immunity are impeachable offenses is absurd,\u201d Philbin said. However, it\u2019s important to note that Trump has argued for a wholesale rejection of Congress\u2019 ability to conduct oversight of the White House, a power that is laid out in the Constitution. \u201cThen, I have an Article II, where I have to the right to do whatever I want as president,\u201d Trump falsely said back in July. Congressman Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party over his opposition to Trump, criticized the president\u2019s lawyers for ignoring news reports as they present their opening arguments. Trump\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly pointed to the lack of first-hand accounts in the impeachment inquiry as evidence of the president\u2019s innocence, even as many Republican senators push back against the proposal to call former national security adviser John Bolton as a witness in the trial. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that he was not given \u201cany advance notice\u201d about John Bolton\u2019s manuscript. The National Security Council confirmed that it received a copy of Bolton\u2019s manuscript late last month for pre-publication review, but an NSC spokesperson added, \u201cNo White House personnel outside NSC have reviewed the manuscript.\u201d After offering a robust defense of Rudy Giuliani, Jane Raskin ended her presentation by describing the president\u2019s personal lawyer as \u201ca minor player\u201d and \u201ca shiny object meant to distract you.\u201d The defense of the former New York mayor may come as a surprise to Republican lawmakers, many of whom have expressed unease about Giuliani\u2019s role in pushing Ukraine to investigate Democrats. The Senate trial has resumed, and Jane Raskin, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, has now taken the floor to continue her side\u2019s opening arguments. Senate Democrats were shocked by the opening arguments from Ken Starr, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers who also led the investigation against Bill Clinton that led to the former president\u2019s impeachment. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut desribed Starr\u2019s appearance as \u201can out-of-body experience.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers have paused their opening arguments, and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has called for a 15-minute break. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts said at the start of the day that the president\u2019s team had about 22 hours left, spread across two days, to finish making their opening arguments. After roughly two hours of presentations, Trump\u2019s lawyers should have about 20 hours left. Mike Purpura, the deputy White House counsel, has repeatedly criticized the House impeachment managers for not providing \u201cany first-hand evidence\u201d that Trump linked Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. This critique is more than a little ironic, considering the New York Times reported last night that John Bolton alleges exactly that in his forthcoming book. The former national security adviser could provide an invaluable first-hand account about the Ukraine controversy if he were called to testify in the impeachment trial, but some of Trump\u2019s Senate allies are already pushing back against that proposal, claiming Bolton has \u201cnothing new\u201d to offer. So, to sum up: the president\u2019s lawyers are complaining about the lack of first-hand evidence while the president\u2019s allies simultaneously try to prevent a first-hand account from being heard during the trial because it would allegedly only mirror the testimony that\u2019s already been heard. Mike Purpura, the deputy White House counsel, is now arguing Trump held up Ukraine\u2019s military assistance in part over concerns about the US providing a disproportionate amount of funding to the ally. But other countries have actually provided billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. PolitiFact reported in September: While the United States has taken the lead on military aid, the Europeans, Japan and Canada have borne the brunt of economic and government restructuring aid to bolster Ukraine. After 2014, the European Union and its financial assistance agencies put together $15 billion mainly in loans but also in direct grants to Ukraine. Spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told PolitiFact in statement that described it as \u2018the largest support package in the history of the European Union.\u2019 Ken Starr, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, has now stepped off the floor after delivering a highly controversial warning about impeachments becoming \u201cnormalized.\u201d Another one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, briefly took the podium to admonish House Democrats for their handling of the impeachment inquiry, in comparison to the \u201csolemn\u201d nature of the Senate trial. Mike Purpura, the deputy White House counsel, is now presenting more of his side\u2019s opening arguments and said the president\u2019s team will be ready for a break once he concludes. Angus King, an independent senator who caucuses with Democrats, predicted that up to 10 Republicans would eventually vote in favor of allowing new witness testimony during the impeachment trial. In a new statement, John Bolton and his publisher denied that they were involved in the New York Times report about the former national security adviser\u2019s forthcoming book. Some of Trump\u2019s congressional allies have tried to deflect questions about whether Bolton should be called to testify in the impeachment trial by dismissing the Times report as a counterproductive \u201cleak.\u201d In a 5-4 vote along ideological lines, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration may start eforcing its \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule as challenges to the immigration policy continue. According to the rule, immigrants applying for green cards and other visas could be penalized for their use of public benefits, a proposal that has been widely criticized as a \u201cwealth test.\u201d Soon after the rule was proposed in 2018, immigrants started removing themselves from government programs out of fear that it could impact their immigration status. Asked about whether she would stay in Washington for the impeachment trial on the day of the Iowa caucuses next Monday, Elizabeth Warren said she would -- but the presidential candidate added a caveat. \u201cSo long as we\u2019ve got a real trial going on ... I have a responsibility to be here,\u201d Warren said. Asked to reiterate her plans, the Massachusetts senator echoed her line about a \u201creal trial,\u201d which could give her some wiggle room to skip out of the Monday proceedings if the trial is still going on. Ken Starr, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, warned that impeachment has become \u201cnormalized\u201d and could soon be turned into a weapon against every administration. \u201cDemocrats will regret it when Republicans are handing out the pens,\u201d predicted Starr, who spearheaded the investigation of Bill Clinton that led to his impeachment. \u201cLike war, impeachment is hell,\u201d he added. Starr\u2019s warnings were met with incredulity from Democratic commentators and strategists, including this former Clinton adviser: Lamar Alexander, another Republican senator who is being closely watched for how he will vote on allowing new witness testimony in the impeachment trial, remained vague following the news about John Bolton. Senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins have indicated openness to calling Bolton to testify, but Democrats will need to convince four Republicans to cross party lines in order to get their request for new witness testimony approved. Ken Starr, one of the newer members of Trump\u2019s legal team, is making his debut in the Senate impeachment trial. Starr played a key role in Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, issuing the eponymous Starr Report on the former president\u2019s extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky. \u201cWe are living in what can aptly be described as the age of impeachment,\u201d Starr told senators. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts announced that the president\u2019s legal team has a little over 22 hours left to finish opening arguments. Kicking off today\u2019s opening arguments, Jay Sekulow, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, attributed the president\u2019s interest in Ukraine launching investigations to \u201cdeep policy concerns\u201d about potential corruption. Sekulow also appeared to get in a dig against John Bolton after the fomer national security adviser reportedly claimed in his forthcoming book that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. \u201cWe deal with transcript evidence; we deal with publicly available information,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cWe do not deal with speculation \u2014 allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all.\u201d Opening today\u2019s proceedings, Senate chapain Barry Black and majority leader Mitch McConnell both wished a happy birthday to chief justice John Roberts, who is spending his 65th birthday presiding over the impeachment trial today. \u201cLord, thank you for giving our chief justice another birthday,\u201d Black said at the end of his opening prayer. McConnell jokingly added, \u201cI\u2019m sure this is exactly how you planned to celebrate today.\u201d Roberts thanked them for their birthday wishes and for \u201cnot asking for the yeas and nays,\u201d elicting laughs from those gathered in the chamber. Senator Kelly Loeffler, the newest addition to the Senate who was recently appointed to fill the seat of former Georgia senator Johnny Isakson, has come out swinging against Mitt Romney after he expressed support for calling John Bolton to testify. Romney said earlier today that he believed it was \u201cimportant\u201d to hear from the former national security adviser and predicted other Republican senators would come around to supporting the request for Bolton\u2019s testimony. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts has assumed his post in the Senate chamber, and the impeachment trial has officially resumed. Trump\u2019s lawyers will soon continue their opening arguments, and they will likely seek to address Democrats\u2019 demands to have John Bolton, the former national security adviser, testify in the trial. Leaving a caucus lunch, Senate Republicans largely ignored reporters\u2019 shouted questions about John Bolton\u2019s potential testimony in the impeachment trial. Press restrictions have been enforced on Capitol Hill since the start of the impeachment trial, sparking complaints from the congressional reporters who are usually allowed to roam hallways to interview lawmakers. If three Republican senators were to support Democrats\u2019 proposal to have new witness testimony in the impeachment trial, it could create an awkward 50-50 vote in the Senate. Majority leader Mitch McConnell has said a tie vote will not be enough to force witness testimony, but that interpretation could be up for debate. Lisa Murkowski, one of the Republican senators being closely watched for how she will vote on allowing new witness testimony in the impeachment trial, said she is looking forward to the Senate making a decision on the matter. As Democrats intensified their demands for former national security adviser John Bolton to testify, Murkowski noted she has previously said she is \u201ccurious as to what John Bolton might have to say.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve also said there is an appropriate time for us to evaluate whether we need additional information \u2014 that time is almost here,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cI look forward to the White House wrapping up presentation of its case.\u201d Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has put out a statement, through his lawyer, contradicting the report about John Bolton\u2019s forthcoming book. Mulvaney\u2019s lawyer said that Bolton \u201cnever informed\u201d the acting chief of staff about concerns he had after speaking with Trump in August and that Mulvaney \u201chas no recollection\u201d of speaking to Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, about Ukraine potentially investigating Democrats. Trump\u2019s lawyers are set to continue presenting their opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial in about 30 minutes. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Republican senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins indicated that a report about John Bolton\u2019s forthcoming book made them more likely to support calling the former national security adviser to testify. However, some of Trump\u2019s Senate allies said they are still against calling Bolton to testify, dismissing the former official as a \u201cdisgruntled employee\u201d trying to sell books. Welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House, Trump told reporters he has not seen a manuscript of Bolton\u2019s book, which reportedly includes a claim that the president directly linked Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of the Democrats. The blog will have updates and analysis from the Senate trial once it resumes, so stay tuned. A number of Trump\u2019s Senate allies are trying to discredit John Bolton by claiming the former national security adviser is a \u201cdisgruntled employee\u201d who is only trying to sell books. When Bolton left the administration in September, he and the president publicly argued over whether he has been fired or resigned. One Republican senator, Josh Hawley of Missouri, is explaining his opposition to John Bolton testifying by questionably claiming that the former national security adviser is not actually a \u201cfirst-hand witness.\u201d But witnesses who testified in the House impeachment inquiry have said Bolton was present for a number of key moments in the Ukraine controversy. A handful of Senate Republicans are signaling they will likely support calling John Bolton to testify in the impeachment trial, but many of their colleagues remain staunnchly opposed to the idea, even casting doubt on the former national security adviser\u2019s claims. Sitting alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Trump said the administration would announce its Israeli-Palestinian peace plan tomorrow at 12 p.m. ET. The president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, has been working on the peace place, the details of which remain under wraps. But Palestinian leaders have already expressed skepticism about the deal, predicting it will be unfairly weighted in Israel\u2019s favor. Netanyahu and his election opponent, Benny Gantz, are visiting the White House this week as the administration finalizes its peace proposal. Trump told reporters at the White House he has not yet seen the manuscript of John Bolton\u2019s book, which reportedly includes a claim that the president directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. Asked about the allegations from his former national security adviser, Trump offered a one-word response to a Fox News reporter: \u201cFalse.\u201d Republican senator Lindsey Graham expressed openness to hearing testimony from John Bolton, but the top Trump ally also said he would then want to hear from Joe Biden and the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry. There were reports last week that Senate Democrats were considering a possible \u201cwitness swap\u201d to hear from administration officials and the Bidens, but Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer then said that proposal was \u201coff the table.\u201d As some Republican senators indicate they will support a subpoena of John Bolton, others are busy claiming the report about the former national security adviser\u2019s book does not change anything about the Senate impeachment trial. But as a Washington Post reporter noted, the argument that Bolton\u2019s claims about Trump tying Ukraine\u2019s military assitance to investigations are not new contradicts the defense strategy of the president\u2019s lawyers. Reacting to the New York Times\u2019 report on John Bolton\u2019s book, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called the revelation \u201cstunning\u201d and said the former national security adviser\u2019s allegations go \u201cright to the heart\u201d of the impeachment trial. Schumer noted that Republicans have previously criticized witnesses in the impeachment inquiry for not providing \u201cfirst-hand evidence\u201d about the Ukraine controversy, underscoring the need for Bolton to testify about his own experiences in the Trump White House. \u201cHow can Senate Republicans not vote to call that witness and request his documents?\u201d Schumer asked. Bolton\u2019s claim that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of the Democrats also demonstrates a number of White House officials \u201cwere \u2018in the loop\u2019 on this scheme,\u201d Schumer added. \u201cWe are all staring a White House cover-up in the face,\u201d Schumer said. Senator Susan Collins\u2019 statement about the John Bolton news emphasized that reports of the former national security adviser\u2019s book have made calling new witnesses in the impeachment trial all the more important. \u201cThe reports about John Bolton\u2019s book strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues,\u201d Collins\u2019 statement said. In addition to Collins and Mitt Romney, who expressed a desire to hear from Bolton this morning, Republican senators Lisa Murkowski and Lamar Alexander are being closely watched for how they might vote on calling new witnesses. Republican senator Susan Collins indicated a report about John Bolton\u2019s book underscored the need to call him to testify after one of her colleagues, Mitt Romney, predicted more Senate Republicans would soon join Democrats in requesting new witness testimony. In a statement, Collins indicated she was \u201clikely to vote to call witnesses,\u201d but she said she would wait to make a final judgment until after Trump\u2019s lawyers finished presenting their opening arguments. The president\u2019s legal team will continue making opening arguments at 1 p.m. ET, when the Senate impeachment trial resumes. The morning press conference with Senate Republicans now seems to be back on, but some of those originally expected to appear -- including close Trump ally Lindsey Graham -- are no longer listed on the schedule. Reacting to the New York Times\u2019 report about John Bolton\u2019s book, Republican senator Mitt Romney also confirmed he hopes to hear from Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. Romney had previously indicated he was open to calling new witnesses for the Senate trial, but it remains unclear whether Democratic senators can secure the four Republican votes they need to get their witness request approved. Mitt Romney, one of the Republican senators that has already expressed openness to calling new witnesses to testify in the impeachment trial, said it was \u201cincreasingly likely\u201d other Senate Republicans would support the request. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has proposed calling several White House officials, including Bolton, to testify, but he needs at least four Republican senators to cross party lines to get the request approved. Following the report about John Bolton\u2019s forthcoming book, five Republican senators have canceled their press conference scheduled for this morning. Some Republican senators are reportedly pushing for more information from the White House about which officials knew about Bolton\u2019s book. According to the New York Times, the former national security adviser\u2019s manuscript includes a claims that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of the Democrats. Arriving at the Capitol this morning, House speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated her support for calling new witnesses to testify in the Senate impeachment trial, including John Bolton. The House was on recess last week as the Senate trial got into full swing, but members are returning today for leadership meetings and votes. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo is attracting criticism for his claim that an NPR reporter lied to him about the parameters of an interview after emails appeared to contradict the allegation. The Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland reports: Newly released emails between the office of Mike Pompeo and NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly cast further doubt on the secretary of state\u2019s extraordinary claim that the journalist lied to him before a contentious interview. Pompeo, who reportedly subjected Kelly to an expletive-ridden rant in his private living room after an interview during which he was asked about his role in the Ukraine scandal, issued a statement in which he accused the reporter of violating \u2018the basic rules of journalism and decency\u2019. Kelly maintained that her meeting with Pompeo after the recorded interview was not agreed to be off the record. NPR has stood by its reporter and emails quoted by the Washington Post show Kelly clearly expressing that Ukraine would be discussed. Speaking to CNN this morning, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff said the news about John Bolton\u2019s book underscored the need for the former national security adviser to testify in the Senate trial. \u201cI think the American people should see his testimony live,\u201d Schiff said. The House intelligence committee chair added that Bolton\u2019s claims proved Trump\u2019s reasoning for trying to block officials\u2019 testimony -- that he was protecting the privileges of future presidents -- was \u201cshallow\u201d and \u201cfalse.\u201d Bolton wrote in a manuscript of his forthcoming book that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats, including Joe Biden. The White House has reportedly had a copy of Bolton\u2019s manuscript since Dec. 30, which Schiff said he found unsurprising given the administration\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s impeachment so far. Schiff confirmed he has not yet read the manuscript, but he said he was particularly interested in obtaining Bolton\u2019s notes from his time as national security adviser. The impeachment manager also highlighted one reported detail from the book: that Bolton raised concerns about Trump\u2019s July call with attorney general William Barr, who has claimed he first learned about the conversation with the Ukrainian president in mid-August. \u201cThis was Bill Barr trying to protect Bill Barr,\u201d Schiff said. According to one of the New York Times reporters who broke the news about John Bolton, some Republican senators are now pushing for more information on which White House officials knew about the former national security adviser\u2019s book. Bolton\u2019s lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, insisted last night that leaks about the book\u2019s contents clearly came from the White House, which was given a copy of the manuscript on Dec. 30. \u201cIt is clear, regrettably, from the New York Times article published today that the pre-publication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript,\u201d Cooper said. Bolton\u2019s claims that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats could make it more difficult for Republicans to oppose calling new witnesses to testify in the Senate impeachment trial. Good morning, live blog readers! It seems the president has read his New York Times this morning. Donald Trump began the day by tweeting out his complaints about John Bolton, his former national security adviser. According to the Times\u2019 report, Bolton wrote in an early draft of his forthcoming book that Trump said military aid to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations into the Democrats, including Joe Biden and his son. Trump denied that allegation, but the report intensified Democrats\u2019 demands to have Bolton testify in the Senate impeachment trial. The president also pushed back against that, pointing to House Democrats\u2019 decision not to subpoena Bolton during the impeachment inquiry. But the real question is how the Times\u2019 report will affect Republicans\u2019 thinking on witness testimony. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer will need four Republicans to cross party lines to get witness testimony approved. Otherwise, the Senate trial could wrap up this week, and it will almost certainly end in the president\u2019s acquittal. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: The impeachment trial will resume at 1 p.m. ET, when the president\u2019s lawyers will continue presenting their opening arguments. At the White House, Trump is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his election opponent, Benny Gantz, as part of discussions over a potential peace plan. The Iowa caucuses are one week away, and several Democratic presidential candidates -- Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Tom Steyer and John Delaney -- are campaigning in the Hawkeye State today. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned.",

While some reports estimate the damage to the Australian economy could be as much as $2.3bn, experts told Guardian Australia it was too early to be sure. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got enough information,\u201d the economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin said. McKibbin has previously estimated that a \u201cmild\u201d pandemic in Asia, such as the 1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak which killed about 1m people, would carve 0.8% from Australia\u2019s gross domestic product, with most of the damage felt in the services sector. And in a 2004 paper co-authored with the World Health Organisation, he estimated the 2003 Sars outbreak, which killed about 800 people, cut Australian GDP by 0.07%. Coronavirus is so far known to have killed 106 people since the outbreak of a new strain in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last month. McKibbin said the hit to the economy would largely depend on how governments responded to the crisis. \u201cThe virus itself has a pretty small impact in itself, but the way people respond has a larger impact,\u201d he said. He said the damage would initially be felt in China-dependent industries such as tourism and mining. \u201cYou turn off the flow of Chinese tourists for six months and that\u2019s a big economic shock. \u201cAustralia I think has responded very well so far. They\u2019ve been transparent and they\u2019ve been responsible, so that\u2019s diminishing the impact domestically.\u201d Investors sold down China-exposed stocks on Tuesday morning. Airline flight sales website Webjet tumbled 11%, flag carrier Qantas was down more than 5% and Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest\u2019s iron ore miner, Fortescue Metals Group, tumbled almost 8%. Australia\u2019s two listed casino groups, which are heavily dependent on high rollers from China, also fell, with James Packer\u2019s embattled Crown Resorts dropping 4.4% and Star Entertainment Group, which runs Sydney\u2019s casino, falling 5.6%. Treasury Wine Estates, which sells wine including the top-end Penfolds Grange into the Chinese market, plunged 6.2%. Australian airports are also likely to be hit by falling passenger numbers, ratings agency Moody\u2019s said. \u201cThe Australian airports\u2019 exposure to travellers from China is significantly higher now than it was during the Sars outbreak, accounting for over 15% of total short-term inbound travellers in 2019 compared to 4% in 2003,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a report issued on Thursday. \u201cAny decline in passenger volumes would add to the challenging operating conditions facing Australian airports, including moderating passenger volumes due to lower arrivals from China, tepid consumer confidence and the impact of the bushfires on the peak holiday season.\u201d The Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director, Simon Westaway, said the virus was \u201ca genuine concern\u201d to the sector. He said that of about $50bn spent by tourists each year, Chinese visitors made up $12bn. About a quarter of these arrive as part of tour groups, which Chinese authorities have banned for at least two months. \u201cWe\u2019re receiving about 1.5m short-term arrivals a year out of China, so it\u2019s our largest inbound market,\u201d he said. \u201cSo therefore there are clear challenges ahead on the basis of the sheer numbers alone, and the fact that we\u2019ve built a strong relationship between our countries.\u201d He said it was too early to quantify the damage. \u201cThe concern is obviously we\u2019re going to see a reduction in terms of the number of visitors because the groups are going to fall away for the next two months. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how it\u2019s going to recover.\u201d He said the relationship between the coronavirus outbreak and the hit the tourism industry has already taken from the summer\u2019s deadly bushfires was \u201cnot as significant as many people may believe\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t spread tourists down through to places like Mallacoota. \u201cThere inevitably will be a level of crossover effect but we are really talking about a fairly separate market.\u201d Ratings agency Moody\u2019s said tourism industries across the Asia-Pacific, including Australia, were likely to feel the most impact in the short term. In a report issued on Friday, Moody\u2019s said it was too early to tell if the outbreak would cut China\u2019s growth, but warned it could hurt domestic travel and the country\u2019s car industry, which is heavily reliant on Wuhan. \u201cWuhan hosts production facilities for seven major domestic and foreign manufacturers, and for hundreds of auto parts suppliers,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. \u201cComplicated supply chains and just-in-time production could mean that production outages in Wuhan factories have broader spillover effects.\u201d It said the effect on consumers could be magnified because the outbreak is occurring during lunar new year, \u201ca period when households tend to spend more on travel, entertainment, and gifts\u201d. \u201cEven if the virus is contained fairly quickly, the initial stages of high uncertainty are likely to affect spending,\u201d the agency said. \u2022 This story was corrected on 29 January 2020 to attribute comments to Moody\u2019s that had been attributed to S&amp;P in an earlier version.",

      "bodyText": "America remains in shock over the death of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna in a helicopter crash on Sunday. Investigators were working on Monday to determine the cause of the crash, which also killed seven others. Federal safety investigators are exploring factors including the pilot\u2019s history and the chopper\u2019s maintenance records. But much attention has focused on the foggy weather, which was considered dangerous enough that the Los Angeles police department and the county sheriff\u2019s department had grounded their choppers. It emerged on Monday that the helicopter received special clearance to fly in foggy conditions that had grounded police air operations. Officials said the pilot asked for air traffic controllers to provide \u201cflight following\u201d aid in his last radio message but was told the craft was too low. About four minutes later, the pilot said he was climbing to avoid a cloud layer. When air traffic control followed up, there was no reply. Bryant, 41, was one of the most famous athletes in America. When the retired basketball star\u2019s death was confirmed on Sunday, television broadcasts were interrupted for breaking news bulletins. Among the other victims of the crash were a well-known California college baseball coach, John Altobelli, and his wife and daughter, Keri and Alyssa. California authorities did not immediately confirm the identities of the victims but friends and family members said Gianna\u2019s basketball coach, Christina Mauser, and Ara Zobayan, the aircraft\u2019s pilot, also died. The other two victims were identified as Sarah Chester and her daughter Peyton, a team-mate of Gianna. The medical examiner said it could take days to recover the remains of the victims due to the rugged terrain at the crash site. Citing audio records between the pilot and air traffic control at Burbank airport, which are available online, the New York Times said the decision to give the helicopter special clearance would be at the centre of investigations. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at maintenance records of the helicopter,\u201d the NTSB official Jennifer Homendy told reporters earlier. \u201cWe will be looking at records of the owner and operator of the helicopter and a number of other things.\u201d Kurt Deetz, who worked as a pilot for Bryant, told the Los Angeles Times the S-76B helicopter was considered safe, comparing it to \u201ca Cadillac, a limousine \u2013 it\u2019s limo-esque\u201d. Bryant won five NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the most famous sports teams in America. The team announced on Monday that its Tuesday game against the LA Clippers would be postponed. Among those who paid tribute to Bryant following the crash were presidents past and present. On Twitter, Donald Trump wrote: \u201cKobe Bryant, despite being one of the truly great basketball players of all time, was just getting started in life. He loved his family so much, and had such strong passion for the future. The loss of his beautiful daughter, Gianna, makes this moment even more devastating.\u201d Barack Obama also paid his respects. \u201cKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cTo lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to [Bryant\u2019s wife] Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.\u201d Sunday\u2019s Grammy awards were hosted at the Staples Center, the home of the Lakers and the stage for many of Bryant\u2019s greatest achievements. Alicia Keys led a tribute at the start of the ceremony alongside Boyz II Men, who are from Bryant\u2019s hometown of Philadelphia. Keys said: \u201cHere we are together on music\u2019s biggest night celebrating the artists that do it best, but to be honest with you we are all feeling crazy sadness right now. \u201cRight now, Kobe and his daughter Gianna \u2026 are in our spirits, they\u2019re in our hearts, they\u2019re in prayers, they\u2019re in this building. Take a moment and hold them inside of you and share our strength and our support with their families.\u201d Outside Staples Center, hundreds of mourning Lakers fans gathered throughout the day to leave flowers and share moments of silence, at times chanting \u201cThank you, Kobe!\u201d and \u201cMVP!\u201d Makeshift memorials have popped up throughout the region, including outside a Shoe Palace mural of the star in LA, and near his family home in Newport Coast. Michael Jordan, one of the few players in NBA history who has surpassed Bryant\u2019s achievements, spoke of his own grief. He said in a statement: \u201cI loved Kobe \u2013 he was like a little brother to me. We used to talk often and I will miss those conversations very much. He was a fierce competitor, one of the greats of the game and a creative force.\u201d Tributes were also paid to Gianna, who was 13 and one of Bryant\u2019s four daughters. The pair were travelling to Bryant\u2019s basketball academy near Los Angeles, where Gianna was due to play in a tournament, when the helicopter crashed. She had spoken of following in her father\u2019s footsteps and playing professionally in the WNBA. The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, said Bryant \u201cwas generous with the wisdom he acquired and saw it as his mission to share it with future generations of players, taking special delight in passing down his love of the game to Gianna\u201d. Bryant was also mourned outside the US. He spent much of his childhood in Italy where his father, Joe, played basketball professionally. \u201cAll of the NBA players are important, because they\u2019re legends, but he\u2019s particularly important to us because he knew Italy so well, having lived in several cities here,\u201d said the Italian basketball federation president, Giovanni Petrucci. \u201cHe had a lot of Italian qualities. He spoke Italian very well. He even knew the local slang.\u201d Bryant was hugely popular in China, where he was arguably more famous than Jordan and another Lakers star, LeBron James. \u201cFrom primary school to university, he accompanied the youth of countless people, and evoked the love for basketball among many young Chinese people,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily wrote in a post on social media platform Weibo. Bryant\u2019s reputation was tarnished after he was arrested in 2003 over accusations he raped a woman at a Colorado hotel. Bryant denied the allegations, saying the encounter had been consensual. The case was dropped after the alleged victim refused to testify at trial. Bryant later apologised to the woman, saying: \u201cI recognise now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did.\u201d Bryant and the woman settled a separate civil suit out of court.",

We\u2019re mostly in one location but due to the ever-changing nature of Anthony\u2019s surroundings, Zeller\u2019s film is one of the more impressively realised stage-to-screen adaptations of late.

He\u2019s now comfortably an early front-runner for the 2021 race with a turn so crushingly effective that I can\u2019t see how any other actor could beat him. It\u2019s astounding, heartbreaking work, watching him try to rationally explain to himself and those around him what he\u2019s experiencing. In some of the film\u2019s most quietly upsetting moments, his world has shifted yet again but he remains silent, knowing that any attempt to question what he\u2019s woken up to will only fall on deaf ears.

It\u2019s an experience many people will understandably want to avoid, existing just too close to home for a lot of us, easily swapping out Hopkins and inserting a family member in his place.

But new and more casual Australian fans might have only been made aware of the local connection \u2013 albeit a small one \u2013 after Eilish became the first female winner of Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100 at the weekend. It turns out the sample was recorded on Eilish\u2019s iPhone. \u201cMy mum and I went for a walk in Sydney,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were like across the street from the hotel and the crosswalk is this little \u2013 you press it and it\u2019s like \u2018doop, doop\u2019. And I was like, \u2018That\u2019s hard!\u2019 That\u2019s the sound that it makes when you have to wait.\u201d Eilish then plays the interviewer the recording. \u201cAnd then I was not prepared for this part,\u201d she said. And then light turns green on the recording. \u201cThat scared me,\u201d Eilish is heard saying in the iPhone recording. Her brother, producer Finneas, told Rolling Stone that the recording of the crossing sound needed some work before it could be used in the song. \u201cUnaltered it\u2019s not the right speed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hilarious part about all this is we were just in Australia in May and my dad goes, \u2018Have you heard these crosswalks?\u2019 \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s the chorus in Bad Guy.\u2019 And he goes, \u2018What?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah \u2026 never mind man.\u2019\u201d Bad Guy, taken from her album, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go?, was one of five songs Eilish had in this year\u2019s Hottest 100. Sydney\u2019s traffic light buttons were designed to meet the needs of blind and visually impaired people and rolled out from 1984 onwards. They were later exported to other countries including the US, New Zealand, Ireland and Singapore.",

It begins at 55 in England, though the NHS has pledged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/10/bowel-cancer-screening-age-england-lowered-50\">reduce it to 50</a> at some point in the future.</p> <p>An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS has already introduced a new and more accurate way to test for bowel cancer that will catch 1,500 more cancers a year at an earlier stage and will save thousands of lives, alongside other important improvements through the NHS long-term plan, including lowering the bowel screening age to 50 and improving the sensitivity of the screening test.\u201d</p> <p>Prostate cancer has overtaken breast cancer as the UK\u2019s most commonly diagnosed form of the disease, according to the most recent annual cancer registration figures published on Monday.</p>",

But we\u2019re concerned that NHS staff shortages are having a direct impact on the ability to diagnose more patients at an early stage, something the government committed to doing last year. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be slipping through the net.\u201d Cancer Research UK is concerned that as many as 1,100 people a year in England with bowel cancer are not being picked up because the NHS there used a higher threshold than Scotland in screening for the disease using the faecal immunochemical test. In Scotland those whose testing shows they have 80 micrograms of haemoglobin per gram of faeces are referred to have a colonoscopy to determine if they have bowel cancer. In contrast, in England only those with 120 micrograms go on to have further investigation. That is despite research showing that the lower the threshold, the more cases are detected and thus lives are saved. The charity said: \u201cThis is where patients are missing out in potentially life-saving early diagnoses, largely due to a lack of specialist staff.\u201d It said that if the NHS in England used the same lower threshold for deciding on referrals then it would undertake 2,000 more endoscopies a month but would detect 1,100 more cases a year. Dr Lisa Wilde, the director of research and external affairs at Bowel Cancer UK, said: \u201cWe know that the biggest constraint to increasing the sensitivity of England\u2019s bowel cancer screening test is a lack of NHS workforce. Bowel cancer is the UK\u2019s second biggest cancer killer but it doesn\u2019t need to be: it is treatable and curable especially if diagnosed early.\u201d Bowel cancer screening starts at 50 in Scotland. It begins at 55 in England, though the NHS has pledged to reduce it to 50 at some point in the future. An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS has already introduced a new and more accurate way to test for bowel cancer that will catch 1,500 more cancers a year at an earlier stage and will save thousands of lives, alongside other important improvements through the NHS long-term plan, including lowering the bowel screening age to 50 and improving the sensitivity of the screening test.\u201d Prostate cancer has overtaken breast cancer as the UK\u2019s most commonly diagnosed form of the disease, according to the most recent annual cancer registration figures published on Monday.",
